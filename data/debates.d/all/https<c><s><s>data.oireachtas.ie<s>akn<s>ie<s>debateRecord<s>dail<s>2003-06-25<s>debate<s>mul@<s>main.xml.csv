#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I wish to ask the Taoiseach two questions on the planning tribunal. It is fair to say that Mr. Justice Flood has done a great deal of good work in his interim report but the public is appalled at the prospect of the tribunal continuing for a further 15 years and the massive costs involved with this inquiry. In his letter, Mr. Justice Flood has indicated he wishes to step down as chairman of the tribunal. My understanding is that it is the Government's preference, as it is mine, that he should deal with the issue of costs, and he can only deal with the issue of costs as chairman, under the legislation as currently constructed.Has the Taoiseach responded to the letter from Mr. Justice Flood and, if so, will he provide the Opposition leaders with copies of that correspondence? In the event that Mr. Justice Flood is prepared to deal with the issue of costs as an ordinary member of the tribunal, which is allowable under the legislation, will the Taoiseach introduce a simple amendment to that legislation to allow for Mr. Justice Flood to deal with the issue of costs as an ordinary member of the tribunal, because the legislation would have to be amended to enable him to do that?A matter which is causing some concern is the proposal by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to have certain sections or modules of the planning tribunal carried out by a new body in private. The Minister has indicated that legislation in this area will be introduced next week. The concern of many would be that potentially embarrassing modules of the tribunal would be heard under these proposals in private. This could be a reason for some people to diminish the credibility of the public element of the hearings of this very important tribunal. Before any decision is taken in that regard, I ask the Taoiseach to consult fully with the Opposition Leaders to ensure nothing is done to undermine public confidence. Were the Government to follow on the proposals of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it would be regrettable if it used its  majority to bring about that situation. Will the Taoiseach respond to those two elements of the planning tribunal?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I have answered these questions very simply and straightly. I assured the leaders yesterday that I would consult fully on aspects of this matter because it was the Oireachtas that set up these tribunals. No decision will be taken without full discussion. It is the Government's wish that Mr. Justice Flood, in whatever capacity, deals with the issue of costs, although it would be better if he did so as chairman, because that would avoid legal complications. Some people feel one can do this and that there would not be difficulties while some other person would have a challenge on it because they may take a counter view. Quite frankly, I have no doubt this will be argued by legal people. The way to avoid that is if Mr. Justice Flood deals with the issue of costs, in whatever capacity, and we will make the arrangements for that.I do not want to release the letter sent to Mr. Justice Flood yet because he received it only yesterday, but it states that it is the Government's wish that he consider that issue. It asks some questions and there is nothing strange in the letter. It asks about the duration of the modules, the likely duration to completion, the legal costs and the likely costs to be incurred in investigating all matters within the terms of reference. The points raised are general and I am sure we will get an answer. If it is in order with the judge at that stage I will release both letters.On the other issue, I take the point made by Deputy Kenny. We have lived with all the tribunals for six years and it is good for politics that all these issues are dealt with. We have a good deal of legislation and I do not want to change the position now. I have discussed this issue with the Attorney General. The legislation which the Minister, Deputy McDowell, is bringing forward was originally intended to deal with other tribunals outside this set of tribunals. Perhaps there are modules that could be moved to it but that would only be done if there was agreement here and with the legal team. Given that they have done a certain amount of work, we cannot deal with the matter in isolation. My advice is that this matter could continue for 15 years and I do not want that either.The tribunals legislation of 2002 specifically envisages the chairperson continuing to sit as an ordinary member. The proposed change will not preclude the Flood tribunal from hearing the module before it, which includes dealing with allegations made by the lobbyist Mr. Frank Dunlop. It is important to emphasise that where allegations have been made in public before a tribunal, those who are the subject of the allegations should be entitled to a public hearing – Deputy Rabbitte made this point yesterday at Question Time – and, if the evidence so justifies it, a report vindicating them. The House must consider the full implications of this development.  The issues raised by the lobbyist, Frank Dunlop, which are before the tribunal will have to be dealt with by it. If we talk of any modules moving over, they will be later modules and we must discuss whether this is possible.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	2	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply. Mr. Justice Flood indicated in his letter that he would like to see this matter resolved before the House rises for the summer recess, which is tomorrow week. That leaves time for a simple amendment to be introduced to the legislation to allow him continue as an ordinary member of the tribunal and deal with the costs issue, if he is willing. It is unprecedented for a High Court judge not to deal with costs involved in a High Court action.If Mr. Justice Flood decides that he does not want to deal with the issue of costs, it leaves us in uncharted, complex legal waters where the Government could be faced with legal challenge after legal challenge, perhaps eventually leading to it having to concede costs across the board on every issue. This leaves us with a serious legal problem. It could be sorted out if Mr. Justice Flood consents to deal with the issue of costs, either in his capacity as chairman or as an ordinary member of the tribunal, in which case amendment to the legislation would be necessary.Will the Taoiseach reconfirm that the Government has no intention other than to see that those who obstructed the tribunal will not evade their responsibilities in terms of costs? Will he also confirm that no obstacle will be placed in the way of the truth being found out in regard to the reasons for the setting up of the tribunal? No price can be put on truth.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I agree and confirm that is the position. The module before the tribunal must be dealt with by it. I am legally advised that there is no other way to proceed. Having talked to the Attorney General and the Ministers directly involved, we do not think this can be resolved before the end of next week. The issue of costs is important and has been so for several months – it will have to remain important for some more months. I am not being difficult but that is the advice I have been given. We will have to resolve the issue. The Government, the Oireachtas and the tribunal have to deal with this matter. We will have to keep each other informed, and I will do that.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I am sure the Taoiseach will agree that the entire country is overawed at the nature of the splendid success of the Special Olympics to date, the courage and dignity of the participants and the energy and commitment of the volunteers. I am sure it is the private wish of every Member that the same effort we have seen in the planning and preparation for the games, and in the unprecedented co-operation between the public institutions and the voluntary sector,  should be mobilised to address the ongoing needs of people with special needs.If we had any doubt about the scale of the demand, the publication last week of the national disability database demonstrates the scale of need in that area. There are 667 people with intellectual disabilities incarcerated in psychiatric hospitals. Of the total number of people with disabilities, 10%, or 2,500, get no special support and there are 515 people on waiting lists for day and residential services. The database shows that the list of needs continues.The Taoiseach is aware that concerned people in the disability sector have pinned a lot of hope on the much promised Disability Bill which we have not yet seen. He will have received correspondence from the disability legislation consultation group asking him to meet it. Will he agree to meet this group before the games are over? This would send out the powerful message that he does not intend to let the issue of disabilities slip back down the political agenda as soon as the games are over. Will he agree to meet the group this week?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I spent six years directly involved with the games committee – I was honoured to do so – and worked with people close to Deputy Rabbitte, for whom I have great admiration in this area and who brought the idea to me in the first place, and I will continue to do that. I am glad that through this period I took the political flak and invested money in Croke Park, Abbotstown and other centres so that we would have the Special Olympics.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There was no flak about the swimming pool.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	7	Like all good things in this country, when the occasion arrives everybody agrees it was a good idea. I met representatives of NAMHI last week in regard to a separate issue and I met representatives of the National Disability Authority the previous week. They asked me if I would meet representatives of the full group and I agreed I would – I give that assurance to the Deputy also. I will continue to keep an interest in this issue. While an enormous amount has been done in recent years, there is a huge amount still to be done in the residential care, respite and education areas, and that work must continue.The Education Disability Bill is fairly well agreed with the various bodies although there is one outstanding issue between the representative groups. There are outstanding issues in the Disability Bill. Progress can be made and I assure the Deputy that I will continue to work closely with the groups for whom I have great admiration. I try to understand the difficulties but it is not easy when one has not got a direct family member involved. I understand what is being said but one cannot experience it unless one is in that position. The individual stories are not easy to listen to,  never mind to have to live with. I understand that and the passion people feel about the issues, but we have been trying to resolve them.Yesterday I mentioned what we have done in the area of education disabilities. The State has increased the allocation from under €100 million to €350 million in this one area. There is a huge agenda to be deal with in regard to residential care, autism, sensory disabilities and sheltered workshops. We will continue to work on these matters. I will try, as soon as possible, to come to a conclusion with the disabilities bodies to find a resolution in regard to the Bill.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I compliment the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues for taking up the initiative of former Deputy Spring, Deputy Quinn and Deputy Kenny and the rainbow Government in terms of bringing the Special Olympics to Ireland. I also wish to acknowledge and have always supported what the Taoiseach describes as the energy he put into Croke Park. However, if he had, on occasion, minimised that energy, the facility would now have a more ecumenical use than it has. That is a result of the Taoiseach's meddling.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I am not sure I have seen much magnanimity from the Minister since he came into the House.Croke Park was about to be thrown open when interference from the Government caused it to reaffirm the existing situation. The Taoiseach knows that as well as everyone else in the House.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The Deputy has little understanding of the GAA.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Despite the Taoiseach's being one of the most accessible we have had in the office, the disability legislation consultation group advised me as recently as this morning that the Taoiseach has never met any national organisation on a policy matter representing the disability sector. That is the net point. Having complimented the Taoiseach for the manner in which his Government has facilitated bringing the Special Olympics World Summer Games to Ireland and for the splendid success of the event, I ask him to be magnanimous and agree to meet that group concerning the elements, content and provisions of the disability Bill.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I met the chairperson of the National Disability Authority in the last ten days about the Bill. I also met representatives of NAMHI last Monday week regarding a separate issue, during which meeting they raised various issues. If the Deputy is suggesting that I never met them, someone's memory has totally gone.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I am not talking about shaking hands with them.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	15	No, I met them and sat down with them. I met the chairperson of the National Disability Authority in my office in Government Buildings ten or 11 days ago and I met people who stated that they were representatives of NAMHI last week. They asked me if I would meet the full group and I agreed to do so. I cannot understand why representatives of an organisation, who asked me to my face if I would meet them, would tell the Deputy that I never met them. That sounds quite extraordinary. I was not shaking hands with them, I was sitting down with them.Last night, representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association spoke to me about having a meeting with them, following a meeting they had yesterday with the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Fahey, which I was involved in setting up. I am not sure what agenda is being pursued here but I will meet these people.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	16	I thank the Taoiseach.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	17	My point about Croke Park was not in regard to its overall development, but that at the time I was asked to give specific money to Croke Park so that the Special Olympics could take place. We did this. The Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, gave €15 million to the project. I was making that point, rather than addressing the issue of every GAA ground.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Through the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the Government is driving a Bill through the Dáil to give city and county managers exclusive rights to levy refuse charges on householders and the absolute right to decide their levels. The Government is also attempting to intimidate the substantial cohort of compliant PAYE taxpayers and contributory pensioners who oppose the current bin tax and boycotting it by allowing the local authority to leave their bins uncollected on the side of the street. If the Taoiseach's backbenchers, especially those from Dublin, had been doing their job right, they would have told him and the Minister how opposed a majority of PAYE workers are to their plans. This is particularly the case in the capital which comprises a third of the population and a huge cohort of the compliant tax-paying community. These people see that the Government is deluded if it thinks it can smash the anti-bin tax campaign in Dublin, to privatise the bin collection service, to allow charges to rise to €700 or €800 per annum, as set by the county and city managers, to bring back water charges and to have a parallel tier of local taxation in place, which will quickly reach €1,000 per household and carry on upwards. Furthermore, this is not subject to a single vote of the Dáil or of local councillors since all these rights are being removed.If the Taoiseach persists, getting these measures through the Dáil will be the easiest task he will face. Does he realise he will face sustained and active opposition in the communities and the exercise of democratic people power? Does he not understand that many PAYE taxpayers, and particularly pensioners, believe that if they had exercised their people power in the 1970s and 1980s, they would not have been taken for a ride. They were fleeced by the tax system while the Ansbacher men and off-shore account merchants were salting away their hidden gains. If they had fought more openly at that time, these crooks would have been outed long ago and many of the services which were savagely cut could have been saved. There is no going back to the 1970s or 1980s for the bulk of the tax-paying public. I ask the Taoiseach to reflect again and withdraw these measures.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	19	These issues were discussed and debated on Committee Stage last night, therefore, I do not want to go into them. Some 70% of people pay charges and there are good and fair waiver systems available. The burden of tax, including the old tax wedge for people on the margins, is now the lowest in Europe and the burden of tax on individuals is way down the league of other EU countries.In regard to service charges, I have a different view. I like to see the open spaces of the city and county looked after. I would not like to go back to the early 1980s when they were strewn with rubble and there were no landscaped parks. We now have the finest national and local authority parks, where facilities are provided. This has been developed over many years.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Obviously, Deputy Joe Higgins does not want to see such facilities. It appears he wants to be against everything. I am for things, which is where the Deputy and I differ. I like to see progress and clean communities, whereas the Deputy just wants to rant that it should all be paid for out of central taxation. That is an old argument which has long gone.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	23	The Taoiseach will find out to his cost that the bulk of PAYE taxpayers, for whom I stand and speak in the House, do not agree with him.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	24	More Deputies than the Deputy himself were elected. He is a self-appointed spokesman.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	25	He has privatised the majority of local authority bin collection services, which means there is no waiver for old  age pensioners and the poor. If pushed, this proposal will have a detrimental effect. Some 37% of households in the home area of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government admitted in a local authority survey that they burned their refuse. They also said that the level of charges was a factor in their doing so.

Why does the Taoiseach not go out and catch the millionaire stallions which are prancing tax free on the plains of Kildare under the protective gaze of the Minister for Finance?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Why does he not provide for giving back some of the €1 billion which the Minister for Finance is giving back to the corporate sector in tax breaks in this year alone?Does the Taoiseach understand that, even if he puts this measure through, he will face a political war of attrition right up to and during the European and local elections? Does he further realise that he will not break the campaigns which represent the views of the many compliant and decent taxpayers, who are the bedrock of the tax-paying system?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Some €4 billion has been given back to the taxpayers in recent years and the level of taxation across society is substantially lower than when these issues took place some 20 years ago. It is far better that local charges with good waiver systems, which some 70% of people pay, are used to enhance our areas. Deputy Higgins used to be worried about the Control of Horses Act in his constituency but now he is worried about stallions. The reason the horses issue has been resolved is that local authorities were able to put money into controlling them. If the Deputy is really interested in environmental policy, I suggest his party should stop at every hand's turn on every issue, plastering grotty posters all over the city and then not taking them down.

I understand that one unsuccessful candidate is to take a court action because of the assessment that a particular Minister did not include full departmental facilities as part of his election expenses. Will that become the norm now?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	47	The standards to be followed have already been set out. The Standards in Public Office Commission has already given advice on what must be done in future for all candidates in subsequent elections. The framework being set out in the code is really taken from the legislation already there. This includes the Ethics in Public Office Act, the Standards in Public Office Act, the Prevention of Corruption Act. as well as the other directives that the commission has issued in recent years. The code will cover the positions of the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste, Ministers, Ministers of State, the Attorney General – if he is a Member of the Oireachtas – the chairmen and deputy chairmen of the Dáil committees, Seanad Éireann, the chairmen of joint committees of both Houses of the Oireachtas. It will set out the commission's views under headings as to the codes that should be followed.The important thing is that the code will be admissible in any proceedings before a court, tribunal or committee of this House or the Standards in Public Office Commission. It will have the force of law and people will have to follow it, otherwise it will be used in evidence against them. I saw the earlier draft, but I hope this new draft will be one that people can follow easily and understand. It is important that people do so, as it will become the document against which people will be checked.

Is the Taoiseach aware that the  Committee on Finance and the Public Service is currently discussing the draft code of conduct for civil servants and that it would be appropriate that the code of conduct for office holders should at the very least follow soon after the conclusions on the code of conduct for civil servants? If not, then the two should be introduced simultaneously.Will the code of conduct come before the Houses of the Oireachtas for consideration? Will it be discussed in this House? How soon does the Taoiseach expect that we will address the detail contained therein?Given the significant downturn in public confidence in representative office in this land, does the Taoiseach not recognise that it is incumbent on such a draft code to ensure that we do not see a situation allowed whereby, following the exorbitant over expenditure by candidates in the last general election, it is proposed or is likely to be proposed that there will be significant increases in the level of spending permitted in pre-general election electoral endeavours in the future?

It is about a code of conduct that stands up and is not just aspirational but has some meaning. It is imperative that—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	51	The Deputy's question is when the code of conduct will be completed.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	54	In the first case, the Standards in Public Office Act is already there. That legislation has been there for two years and people are governed by that. Since 1995 we have had ethics legislation, so all the standards and rules are already in place. However, under the Act it is the responsibility of the Standards in Public Office Commission to publish the code. These discussions have gone on before several Oireachtas committees in recent years. Members have given their views on the issue. The code will be published next week and will be there for everyone to follow. Whatever about the past, politicians are now a well-regulated group of people. There is a rule for almost everything. We all have to go through our form filling exercise. The code sets that out and this is the way politicians will have to conduct their business from now on.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I am only calling Deputies who submitted questions. I now call on Deputy Sargent.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	57	No doubt, politicians have to fill in their forms and ensure they are correct and above board. However, can the Taoiseach inform the House, following the Kelly case, as to what changes he now sees being needed in the Standards in Public Office Commission to respond to the constitutional issues raised by that case? Perhaps the Taoiseach will look again at the last Government of which he was Taoiseach which set its face against the Standards in Public Office Commission trying to include all pre-election material.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	58	We are dealing with a new code of conduct for office holders in these five questions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	59	It is in relation to office holders that the Kelly case adjudicated, a Cheann Comhairle, and it is relevant in that regard. Will the Taoiseach look again at the recommendations from the commission that there should be a much longer lead in period to any election in terms of evaluating spending? For example, the cost of running ministerial cars, which was not taken into account by the Standards in Public Office Commission, should be included in evaluations to make the playing pitch level.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	60	I will not, as I do not believe many of the facilities at one's disposal as a Minister have anything to do with being elected. If we are to go into that area, we would have to look at what organisations receive State money that are politically motivated and consider whether that should be taken into account with regard to the candidates to which they align themselves. There are plenty of them around the country—
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	61	The commission did not recommend that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	62	Well no, but maybe it should have.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Does the Taoiseach want it to do that?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	64	Maybe it should be included if the Deputy wants to include some of his suggestions.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	65	What about the commission?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	66	Legislation has been enacted for a number of years and now we have a code of practice to follow.Deputy Sargent is incorrect in his final point. The Ethics in Public Office Act and similar legislation were strictly followed by the previous Government. The courts, as they have a right to do, made a judgment late in the general election  campaign that changed the position. It is not fair to expect people to abide by a judgment made so late in a campaign, especially given that they had abided by the rules for 21 days previously.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	67	I am referring to the next general election.

Will the Taoiseach explain again how that will be monitored?Has the Taoiseach any information about whether the Standards in Public Office Commission standardised what was attributable to election expenses or otherwise? Leaving aside the question of ministerial overruns and the fact that Ministers did not know before the general election, how can one Minister have an overrun of—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	70	We are going well outside the realm of the five questions submitted which deal with the new code of conduct for officeholders. We cannot discuss individual items that are not related to the five questions under discussion.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	71	I do not mean to do that but I would like to see the situation I posit dealt with in the new code. How is it that one Minister can overshoot by €28,000—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	72	Again, the question is outside the realm of the questions tabled. I suggest the Deputy submit a question relevant to the point he raises.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	73	The point is relevant to the code. There is no point in our launching a new code if we do not deal with the issues that have arisen. I do not refer to any specific—

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Can I put it this way? Why should one officeholder overshoot by €28,000 while another, equidistant from Dublin, does not overshoot at all?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The issue does not arise.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	77	Has the commission communicated to Government what standards it applies that might explain why this could happen in one case and not in another?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	78	The commission issued standards at the time, but some Ministers included everything just to be certain while others followed clearly the interpretation set down in the  Standards in Public Office Act. My approach in recent years as Taoiseach has been to include everything because I am unsure whether items should be included. I include everything in all returns. Someone can then work out whether I should have included certain items. If they are not included, there is criticism for not doing so and I have been on the receiving end of this on a few occasions.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	79	The Standards in Public Office Commission will in that case return the Taoiseach's declaration and state that certain items have not been included. Therefore, in the case of what is properly included, how can there be such a difference between two Ministers?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	80	The commission did not do that with anyone.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I will explain what has been published. The legislation is in place. It is was discussed in the House and has been enacted for two years. It is law. All that is being done is the issuing of a code of practice based on that legislation. There is no discussion. We will have to implement its conditions.

Why would that be a good idea given that the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, increased the spending limits by up to 45% and increased corporate funding limits prior to the previous general election?

Does the Taoiseach accept that the criteria imposed by the Standards in Public Office Commission on office-holders does not relate to what the commission is told but rather depends on what it is supposed to be told? It is not a question, as the Taoiseach says, that he tells it everything and therefore these discrepancies occur.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	132	It depends on what use a Minister makes of staff in the Department or constituency office during the general election campaign. Some Ministers did not use any of their people and had no contact with them. A number of Ministers were in that position. Others would have had contact and therefore the cost would have had to be included. The parameters were set down but some people put forward the total costs rather than getting into an argument while others followed the strict interpretation, and they were quite entitled to do that.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	133	Section 11(1) of the Public Service Management Act 1997 makes provision for the appointment of special advisers to my office. As provided for in section 11(3) of the Act, the terms and conditions of these appointments are subject to determination by the Minister for Finance. Such appointments are exempt from the general rules governing civil servants and politics, for example, they can be members of political parties. The appointments are also subject to the Civil Service Regulations Acts 1956 to 1996 and  any other Act for the time being in force relating to the Civil Service.Currently the advisers who assist me in dealing with Government business are Gerry Hickey, special adviser-programme manager; Joe Lennon, special adviser; Gerard Howlin, special adviser; Brian Murphy, special adviser; Úna Claffey, special adviser; and Carl Gibney, special adviser to the Government Chief Whip. Katherine Bulbulia, programme manager for the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, is also based in my Department.The role of these advisers is to keep me informed on a wide range of issues, including business, financial, economic, political, administrative and media matters. Under the direction of the programme manager, their primary function is to ensure effective co-ordination in the implementation of the Government's programme.Each of the advisers liaises with a number of Departments and acts as a point of contact in my office for Ministers and their advisers. They attend meetings of Cabinet committees and cross-departmental teams relevant to their responsibilities. They also liaise, on my behalf, with organisations and interest groups outside of Government.In addition, a number of my advisers have specific responsibilities in relation to speech drafting. My programme manager meets other ministerial advisers on a weekly basis and reviews the papers for the Government meeting of that week. He monitors and reports to me on the programme for Government.

They are included in and must comply with the Ethics in Public Office Act, and have to fill in separate forms. I assure the Deputies that, from my experience of dealing with Prime Minister Blair, I do not want his set up. I am not sure what his political advisers are called but there is an enormous number of them.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	143	The special advisers are not involved in spin, they are involved in the organisation of Government business. They do not have any dealing with the media.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 30, inclusive, together.A total of €437,799 has been spent by my Department in the period 1 January 2003 to 31 May 2003 in relation to the National Forum on Europe. As well as salary costs, this expenditure includes six plenary meetings, seven regional meetings, the publication and launch of the forum's third progress report and the production of a video on the convention on Europe, which has been circulated to transition year schools and the completion of a related national public speaking competition.In the 2003 Revised Estimates, an allocation of €922,000 has been made to the National Forum on Europe and spending to date this year has remained within profile.The House will be aware that the National Forum on Europe is an independent body with an independent chairperson and secretariat. It would be inappropriate for me to report on progress to date within the forum or to comment on its day-to-day operation other than to say that I am happy that the forum is fully meeting its remit.The role of the forum is kept under constant review and the Government has no plans to make significant changes in relation to the forum at this time.I attended the EU-Russia summit in St. Petersburg at the end of May. The summit formed part of a larger civic programme to celebrate the 300th anniversary of the founding of the city. President Putin invited the Heads of State or Government of all 15 EU member states and our partners in  the ten acceding countries to attend the summit. This was the first international summit where the EU member states and the ten acceding countries joined together as a single delegation.The principal agenda item was EU-Russia relations. We focused on renewed mechanisms of co-operation and dialogue to improve EU-Russia partnership in the 21st century. To this end the summit agreed to strengthen the existing Co-operation Council by creating a permanent partnership council. This council will meet more frequently and will deal with issues in a more comprehensive and streamlined manner.A joint statement was adopted at the summit. The key issues contained in the statement included strengthening of political dialogue, development of a common European economic space, ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, issues relating to justice and home affairs, including a common response to drugs and terrorism, the current situation in Chechnya and security and defence issues.As the programme prepared by the Russian authorities was very comprehensive, I did not have the opportunity to arrange any private bilateral meetings. However, I was delighted to have the opportunity to meet informally with the Heads of State or Government from a variety of countries during the course of the visit.On Thursday, 12 June, as part of a structured series of engagements with my European counterparts in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the Union and the ongoing business of the Union, I visited Helsinki for talks with Prime Minister Jaatteenmaki. Later that day I travelled on to Talinn for a meeting with Prime Minister Paarts. The focus of my discussions with both was on issues of concern regarding both European Union and international matters.I informed both leaders that the effective and efficient conduct of the Union's business will be the overriding priority and focus of our preparations for our Presidency in 2004. I stated that work on the development of our Presidency programme was ongoing and that I was anxious to hear their views and to have an understanding of their concerns as we identified and developed priorities.I informed both that the Lisbon agenda would be a priority for our Presidency and I had an exchange of views with each of them on how best to advance the agenda despite the challenges of economic slowdown and global uncertainty. Progress at the European Convention and the likely timetable for the subsequent Intergovernmental Conference to be set at the Thessaloniki summit was also a major focus for discussion with both Prime Ministers.The House will be aware that the Prime Minister of Finland has in recent days resigned from her post. I look forward to working with her successor in strengthening and deepening relations between our countries.I met Prime Minister Racan of Croatia on 13 June during his official visit to Ireland. I wel comed the opening of the new Croatian embassy in Dublin as a sign of the developing relations between our two countries. The Prime Minister and I discussed Croatia's application for membership of the European Union. I said that Ireland welcomed Croatia's application for membership and I assured Prime Minister Racan that we would offer Croatia our full support.I also assured the Prime Minister that during our Presidency relations with the western Balkans would remain an important foreign policy priority for the EU. I reminded him that Ireland was one of the first member states to ratify Croatia's stabilisation and association agreement with the EU.The Prime Minister in turn briefed me on economic and social reform in Croatia and Croatia's relations with neighbouring Balkan states, including the new state union of Serbia and Montenegro. The stability and future prosperity of the region also depends on continued improvement in regional co-operation. Croatia has been playing a very positive role in this area.I was pleased to have the opportunity to welcome the King of Malaysia to Ireland when I met him at Farmleigh on 16 June. I also hosted a Government luncheon for the King and Queen the following day. I assured the King that their visit here represented another example of the increased links at the highest level between our two countries, following on from the very successful state visit of President McAleese to Malaysia last year. I welcomed the fact that Malaysia is the first member of ASEAN to open a resident mission in Ireland.The King and I noted our excellent bilateral economic relations, including our high levels of trade and our common interest and expertise in information and communications technology and other high-tech related industries.We discussed the ASEM IV summit which took place in Copenhagen in September last year when I made a contribution on lifelong learning and the digital divide. We noted the long-standing relationship that Ireland and Malaysia enjoy in education and in particular the number of Malaysian medical students studying in Ireland.I welcomed the establishment of the Malaysian Irish Alumni Association in Kuala Lumpur last year. This will provide a platform for regular networking between many of these graduates of Irish colleges.I attended the European Council in Thessaloniki on Thursday and Friday last. I will be providing a comprehensive report on my attendance at the Council to the House in statements which will commence shortly.In relation to bilateral meetings, I met with Prime Minister Blair en marge of the Council on Friday when we discussed Northern Ireland affairs. No other formal bilateral meetings were held, however, the Council provided for the usual informal contact with my counterparts.As I indicated previously to the House, I will continue my structured series of engagements with member and accession states in the context of the forthcoming Irish Presidency of the EU and the ongoing business of the Union. Actually, I did have an informal meeting with the President of Cyprus.To date this year, I have visited the Czech Republic, Portugal, Germany, Belgium, Sweden, Finland and Estonia. Visits have been arranged to Turkey on 17 July, Spain on 22 July, Austria and Slovenia on 24 July and France on 12 September. Arrangements for a visit to Italy before the end of the year are being finalised. I also hope to visit a number of other countries and these visits are at an early stage of planning.As I indicated earlier, the effective and efficient conduct of the Union's business will be the overriding priority and focus of our preparations for our Presidency in 2004. Our aim in relation to the Lisbon strategy, while seeking to progress the objectives generally, will be to focus on a limited number of issues of relevance and meaning to the public where tangible outputs can be achieved.I am committed to completing work on the area of freedom, justice and security in accordance with the Tampere agenda by 1 May 2004. I will seek to use our close relationship with the United States to further improve EU-US relations during our Presidency. I also look forward to welcoming the ten new member states on 1 May 2004, and the challenge of being the first Presidency to deal with a 25-member Union.The Presidency will bring increased demands on my Department. It is not envisaged at this stage to increase the staff complement but to meet the demand by the re-allocation of existing personnel. This measure will be supported by temporary contracts necessary to meet other needs arising. During 2003, an amount of €400,000 has been reserved for my Department from the central allocation for Presidency expenses. This will meet costs arising in information services, protocol facilities, travel and subsistence together with a major conference on the information society to be hosted by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin. A provision for 2004 has not yet been decided and will be considered in the framework of the budget, together with applications from other Departments.

I hope the King of Malaysia enjoyed his round of golf at the Old Head of Kinsale following the fine meal the Taoiseach hosted in Dublin Castle.In respect of the European Convention, the Taoiseach will have had an opportunity to look at the draft constitution accepted by the leaders as being the basis for a fair and balanced Intergovernmental Conference. If it transpires that the draft constitution, as proposed, remains substantially unamended, which I hope will be the  case, does the Taoiseach believe this will require a referendum here in order to give effect to that? In other words, will a referendum be necessary here? What steps is the Government taking to ensure the public are fully informed about what is contained in the draft constitution so that we will not have a repeat of Nice one where the public were largely uninformed on a range of complex issues? Does the Taoiseach believe the Italian Presidency will be able to conclude with an Intergovernmental Conference or are we likely to have the treaty confirmed as the Treaty of Dublin, as distinct from Mr. Berlusconi's strong personal wish that it be termed the Treaty of Rome II?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	151	I will give a brief reply. I think it will go to the Irish Presidency. I am fairly certain about that but it could be otherwise. I proposed last week that the treaty should be named the European treaty. The whole concept is to make it closer to the people. We should sign, in a proper ceremony, in our own individual countries where we could explain to our people what we are doing, which is the point the Deputy made. All the other countries could do that but to be honest, for our own benefit I think we should have the signing here, but the accession countries are anxious to have an involvement. It is a popular measure. If Mr. Berlusconi wants to have a function in Rome to lodge the treaty, because all treaties are lodged in Rome, I have no problem with that but we have to show that it is close to the people.On the education programme and many other initiatives from the National Forum for Europe, we have already started that by way of a video to show what is arising from it. It may not be necessary to have a constitutional referendum in many countries but my own view is that it will be necessary here. I do not see how it will not be.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	154	A Cheann Comhairle, bearing in mind your strictures in terms of the forthcoming debate on the summit, may I raise a different point with the Taoiseach? Traditionally there have been meetings on the margins of these meetings with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, and usually they have been of some importance. Did such a meeting take place on this occasion and, if so, will he comment on the outcome?Has the Taoiseach taken any particular steps in terms of earlier questions about resources and staffing in his own office in terms of preparation for the Presidency? Are resources being allocated to promotion of the outcome of the convention and is there to be a referendum?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I intend to use the same staff in my own office but it will mean taking people in the Department off other duties so that they can deal with that. It might be necessary to get some contract staff but we hope not too many. We hope to move people around.The difficulty with the Presidency these days is that we have to run a seven day office. I think it was the same the last time. We have to operate on Saturday and Sunday but I have already discussed this with the staff and we hope to follow that system.I had a long and detailed meeting with Prime Minister Blair. The key points were how we should handle the marching season and the initiatives that are going on in that regard. I stressed my strong view about the elections in the autumn, as I did here last week. Prime Minister Blair is very concerned about what is happening in the Ulster Unionist Party and how that will play out. As stated by the Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, over the weekend in interviews, they see the sense in the election but they are concerned about what will happen to the stability of the institutions arising from that. I share that concern but a more serious difficulty will arise if we do not face up to dealing with the position. The key issue that arises is that a large part of the Ulster Unionist Party, a large part of the Democratic Unionist Party, the UK Unionist Party and some other splinter groups are saying they will fight the campaign on the renegotiation of the Agreement. Deputies Rabbitte and Kenny and I share the view that we cannot do this. We are, therefore, in a difficult position.I hope to meet David Trimble. I was to meet him on Monday, but he cancelled because of difficulties involving his Westminster parliamentary party. It is a little unclear what is happening. I hope to meet him as soon as he is in a position to move on. I think Prime Minister Blair would share my concern that we have a short period to resolve this through the marching season and then we have to try to make a political move by September. It will be difficult.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	170	During recent European Union summits or other discussions among EU leaders, did discussions take place on the reactionary plans to attack workers pension rights in many EU countries, for example, in France where a proposal to extend the working life of the average worker by several years has evoked significant opposition among working people? What view did the Government take on the matter?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	171	The summit noted the launch of practical co-operation in the framework for European security and defence policy, notably in crisis management, and expressed a wish to work  towards a joint approach in this field. That is our position. We have no problem with the extension of the Petersberg Tasks, but we have no desire to change in any other areas. I made this clear at the meetings. We still believe there should be UN mandate positions and did not commit people to the recent force. Increasingly, the UN is delegating missions to regional organisations, but we have not changed our position on the matter.On pension rights, a discussion of the issue did not take place. However, the Deputy is correct that this is a very live issue in a number of countries. I talked to a number of colleagues about what is happening. There is a general move in many European countries to extend the pension age from 65 years to 67 or 68 years. It is inevitable that the pension age in Austria, France and a number of other countries will be 67 or 68 years.

Given the requirement of industry on this island to use road hauliers, it is anti-business and counter-productive to place excessive charges for trucks on toll plazas as demonstrated by the recent opening of the Drogheda bypass where charges for trucks are €4.95 per trip. In this instance road hauliers are boycotting the bypass and continue to drive through the town of Drogheda, affecting the quality of life of people and businesses in the town.

The treaty contains an agreement on extradition and mutual assistance which has major implications for the civil liberties of Irish citizens and I ask that the House discuss it prior to its signing.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	194	No. 12a refers to the Schengen information system and I understand it has only been put on the Order Paper this morning. Why are we not in a position to implement this before the end of 2004-05? I am opposed to the taking of the public services Estimates in this way for a variety of reasons.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	195	The practice of lumping unrelated matters together and putting them to the House as one vote is being followed again this morning. There is no relationship whatever between Nos. 12a and 13, yet we are being asked to vote on them together. I ask that this practice cease. We can have eight votes this morning if the Government wants; if it is a device to prevent votes it is not working.On No. 12a, we received an assurance from the Taoiseach previously that the practice of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform – that seemingly holds this House in some degree of contempt – offering serious motions like this with constitutional implications for passage at the 12th hour would cease. The Department signed off on this on 16 May and there is no good reason why it did not bring this to the House before this date. I ask the Taoiseach to again give an assurance that he will reign in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and ensure it complies with the normal rules of the House.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	196	No. 13 deals with the Revised Estimates coming back from committee and con tains a number of issues that need to be more fully debated. These are areas in which there are cutbacks and the public needs to know what this House will do and how it will respond to issues of expenditure. I ask that it not just be voted through without debate.

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	198	The linking of items has been a long-standing practice in the House.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The linking of matters that are poles apart is unacceptable. The argument has been well put. Members may wish to support one item but not another and are forced into making a judgment call.Regarding No. 12a, the connection between the Sirene manual and the Schengen information system, part of the apparatus of fortress Europe, clearly has civil liberties implications yet we have insufficient information to make a judgment call as to whether this should proceed without debate. It clearly should not. We do not know what is actually proposed or what amendments to the manual are being proposed. Nor do we know of the implications in terms of the Schengen information system or what supplementary information on EU citizens and non-EU citizens will be required. I strongly oppose 12a and oppose in principle the linking of such diverse matters into a single proposition.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	200	While I have heard what Members have said about linking matters, the proposal was only that they would be taken without debate. The motion on the Sirene manual only asks that it be referred to committee for discussion. It will come back from the committee to the House and, if it is approved, it can be discussed and people will get more information about it.I note the points made by Deputy Stagg about more notice being given on these issues.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	201	Is the proposal for dealing with No. 20, statements on the European Council, agreed to?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	202	Last week I asked the Taoiseach for a full Dáil debate on the new EU constitution. Many Parliaments throughout the EU have already had such a debate. The proposal to hold an 80 minute debate on the recent European Council summit is insufficient, especially as the EU constitution was discussed there. We will have a total of five minutes to contribute to the debate, which is inadequate. I suggest, therefore, that the time allocation to the debate be extended so that the House can properly debate the EU constitution.It is important to hold such a debate before the Intergovernmental Conference because the Taoiseach needs to get the message that if the constitution is accepted, Article 40.3 will result in higher military spending, which is totally unacceptable. The Taoiseach cannot pretend to be opposed to Sellafield and accept the EURATOM Treaty as part of the constitution. That is why we need more time for debate.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The Deputy can raise that matter during the debate if he wishes.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	204	I am in favour of a debate on this issue. Those who served on the presidium and on the European Convention should have the opportunity to participate. I indicated last week that we would hold a longer debate before the Intergovernmental Conference, and we will do that. The Intergovernmental Conference will not start until the end of October.

#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	206	The Order of Business proposes five guillotines, of which we object to four as the Bills have not taken their normal course. Rather than call four separate votes, I will, with your indulgence, Sir, deal with the four together. We asked for additional time with regard to No. 22, resumption of Report Stage of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002, to which the Government agreed, so that there would be a high degree of consensus on the Bill, yet only 30 minutes additional time has been granted. We object to the principle of having Bills guillotined without full debate and we will, therefore, oppose this proposal.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	207	The proposal to deal with No. 2 requires far more time than that allocated and we therefore oppose it. There is also uncertainty  about the conclusion of the debate. For example, if the holding of votes encroaches on the time allocated to following debates, will the time allocated to the various affected debates, such as, for example, on Private Members' Business, be extended?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	208	Under Standing Orders, a vote called at 7 p.m. takes from Private Members' time.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	209	If that is the case, Private Members' Business will need to be extended.

It is being rushed to committee tomorrow and the deadline for the receipt of amendments is midnight tonight. The committee that will deal with the Bill is currently in session dealing with other legislation and will continue its deliberations at 7 p.m. Yet, it is expected that the same committee members will be central to the preparation of amendments to the Bill before midnight, and they will be required to discuss it tomorrow. This is absurd and it is being done to feed the agenda of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in terms of his PR exercise on this legislation. It is an outrage and we will oppose it. It is not the way to treat Members, nor legislation.

Is the proposal for dealing with No. 22, conclusion of Report and Final Stages of the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill 2002, agreed to? Agreed.

I understand the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, outlined progress and developments being made by his Department and the Department of Social and Family Affairs. A question should be put down. I am answering on legislation which has been listed. This is not listed. I understand—

#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	243	The Taoiseach has answered the question. If the Deputy is not satisfied with the answer, there are other ways to raise the matter.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	244	I ask the Ceann Comhairle to allow me to make my point of order. Standing Orders require the Taoiseach to answer questions on promised legislation, whether the promise is made inside or outside the House. Questions do not have to be confined to the circulated list, which is now months old. Therefore, the promise of legislation yesterday by the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Callely, is relevant.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	245	The Taoiseach told me a few weeks ago that the Government had no plans to amend before the end of the session the Air Navigation and Transport (Amendment) Act 1998 and the Aviation Regulation Act 2001. However, in today's Irish Independent, the Minister for Transport—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Does the Deputy have a question on promised legislation? Perhaps, if he hears the Taoiseach on the promised legislation. I call the Taoiseach.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	247	Honestly, Ceann Comhairle. It takes only a minute. I am dealing with the same—

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	249	I am dealing with the Minister's statement that he intends to proceed with a private terminal at Dublin Airport and that the builders would be on site by the end of the year.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	250	Is this a question on promised legislation?
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	251	Yes, it is.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	252	Allow the Taoiseach to answer it.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	253	Allow me to clarify my point. The Minister says he is to reconvene the Mullarkey commission, which is precisely the com mission that said the two Acts I mentioned would have to be amended to permit the construction of a private terminal.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The Deputy should allow the Taoiseach to answer his question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	255	Is the Minister for Transport to assume executive powers over the summer? Is he to adopt plenipotentiary powers while the Dáil is in recess?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	257	There are three prospective air navigation Bills. The heads of the air navigation (Eurocontrol) Bill are expected in the middle of this year. Legislation should be available in the autumn. The air navigation and transport (Capetown Convention) Bill is in its preliminary stages and its heads are expected later in the summer. The legislation is due in the autumn. The heads of the air navigation and transport Bill are also expected and should be in the House in the autumn. As I stated previously, no Bills will be passed here before the end of the summer.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	258	Is it now to be common practice for Ministers to make announcements which will not be backed up by legislation?

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I raise the same subject as Deputy Rabbitte. It is incredible.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	261	On a point of order, I protest at something which has been happening on a regular basis. Deputy Joe Higgins is correct in the point he raises. The matter was raised previously by the Fine Gael leader and by Deputy Rabbitte. We receive information from outside the House constantly by way of ministerial announcements, which clearly indicate legislative intent. When we come into the House and ask about the legislation, we are told there is no legislation. Either the Ministers are out of control outside the House or Members of the House have a right to get answers to their questions. Which is it?
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	262	The Deputy has made his point.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	264	The Bill is in the Seanad. When it completes all Stages in that House, it can be dealt with here.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	265	Last year legislation was promised to establish the Dublin Institute of Technology on the Grangegorman campus. The Taoi seach is intimately involved with that. When will the legislation be introduced? It has been delayed for more than 12 months and the institute of technology has gone through a number of sets of plans at this stage. It is time to get the show on the road.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	266	The Bill will be brought before the Government shortly, probably at its next meeting.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	267	My question relates to another case of a Minister promising outside the House that legislation will be introduced. The Minister for Defence indicated that the need for a UN mandate for future missions would be examined. Will such legislation be introduced?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	268	Is the Deputy referring to the Defence Acts?

#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I have previously raised with the Taoiseach my concern about our preparedness for a major environmental accident at sea. Four Bills are promised in this area. Two Bills were due to be dealt with before the summer but the Dumping at Sea (Amendment) Bill is on Second Stage and the Sea Pollution (Hazardous and Noxious Substances) Bill is awaiting Committee Stage. Two further Bills, the Oil Pollution of the Sea (Civil Liability and Compensation) (Amendment) Bill and the Sea Pollution (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, were due to be published before the summer break. All four Bills appear to be stalled and there has been no progress on any of them over the last two or three months. Can the Taoiseach update the House on when it will receive the latter two Bills and when will the former Bills come before the House again? Obviously, at this stage it will be in the autumn.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	275	The first two Bills have been published and are before the House. With regard to the other two Bills, one was cleared by the Government yesterday and the other is due to be approved next week. They will be published and the full set can be taken in the autumn.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	276	The fishery harbour centres Bill is due to be published next year. However, the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, has raised harbour charges and dues from 1 July by up to 2,300% at the five ports of Howth, Rossaveal,  Castletown, Killybegs and Dunmore. This will seriously endanger the viability of the seafarers.
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The Deputy has made his point. We cannot discuss what might be in legislation.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The heads of the Bill are expected in September and the Bill should be published next year.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	279	When the Local Government Bill was passed recently by the Dáil, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government promised that regulations governing the relationship between Oireachtas Members and local authorities would be introduced. I had hoped those regulations would be published before the Dáil rises. Will they be published? On a second matter, during a debate on a Fine Gael Private Members' motion some months ago on the disabled persons grants, the Government promised a review of the three schemes – the essential repairs grant, housing aid for the elderly—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	280	That does not arise at this stage. The Deputy will have to put a question to the Minister.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	281	When will we see the regulations that will result from the review? Those schemes are in crisis at present—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The Deputy does not have to discuss what he might say during the debate on the secondary legislation. I call the Taoiseach on the first question regarding promised regulations.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The schemes are in crisis and we are still awaiting the regulations following the review.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	284	With regard to the first question, the regulations are to be published but I do not know whether that will happen before the House rises. They will be published shortly. I will try to get a definite date for the Deputy.
#BernardAllen	unknown-#BernardAllen-party	unknown-#BernardAllen-dob	unknown-#BernardAllen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	285	What about the second question?

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I answered the last question earlier. The heads of the courts and civil liabilities Bill are expected next month and the Bill should be ready for the autumn.

There is no mention of that legislation in our list. Is that legislation on the Taoiseach's list and, if so, what is its title and when might it be published? Second, what is the timescale for the promised transport Bill to provide for the break up of CIE? Have the heads been agreed and when will we see the Bill?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	296	It is in the public transport Bill which is being prepared and will be before the House shortly.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	298	That is correct. There is a transport reform Bill to provide for the reform of public transport. Work on the draft heads of that Bill is ongoing and the Bill is expected to be ready next year. The transport companies Bill will establish Bus Éireann, Bus Átha Cliath and Iarnród Éireann as separate autonomous companies. Preliminary work has started on the draft heads and the heads are expected in 2004.

I was accompanied by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Brian Cowen. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, also attended. The Conclusions of the European Council have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The meeting was a major success for the European Union. It marked a further milestone in the enlargement of the European Union with the Heads of State or Government of the ten accession states attending as observers; it warmly welcomed the outcome of the European Convention and it accepted the work of the Convention as a good basis for the  start of the Intergovernmental Conference. It set out a detailed work programme in the area of justice and home affairs; and it approved the appointment of a new Governor of the European Central Bank.The main item on the agenda of the meeting was the European Convention. The President of the Convention, Valery Giscard d'Estaing, presented the Convention's report and, in the presence of the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, the members of the European Council had an initial debate. All the members of the European Council welcomed the successful outcome of the Convention and expressed their gratitude to President Giscard and all the members of the Convention for the work they accomplished. At the Laeken European Council in December 2001, we set the Convention a daunting task. We asked it to pave the way for the upcoming Intergovernmental Conference by considering the key issues arising for the Union's future development and to try to identify possible responses. At the same time, we asked the convention, in the face of new challenges confronting the Union, to work towards making the European Union more democratic, more transparent and more efficient. We asked it to consider ways to bring citizens closer to the European Union; to consider how an enlarged Union should be organised and how it should develop as a stable model in a new, multi-polar world.The European Convention started its work in February 2002 and will conclude in mid-July following some additional technical work. It is fair to say the outcome of the European Convention has exceeded the expectations of most. The draft constitutional treaty that has been produced would help to make the Union more democratic, transparent and accessible. It represents the balance between the member states and the Union. It sets out in a clear way the competences of the European Union and distinguishes these competences from those of the member states. It simplifies the Union's instruments and reduces their number. It would increase the democratic legitimacy and transparency of the Union in a wide variety of ways, including by strengthening the institutions of the Union and enhancing their effectiveness. The Charter of Fundamental Rights would be incorporated in a way that ensures legal clarity and certainty. Furthermore, the convention has produced a draft constitutional treaty that is written in a simple, clear and legible style and this is very welcome. The report of the European Convention is a real achievement for the European Union. It proves, once again, that when people of good will in the European Union put their minds together they can achieve real progress that can be of tangible benefit to all.I take this opportunity to thank all the Irish representatives for their positive and constructive input to the European Convention. Deputies Dick Roche, John Bruton, Proinsias de Rossa, Pat Carey and John Gormley, and Bobby  McDonagh from the Civil Service, and their teams, conducted the work of the convention in a constructive and positive manner. I have said many times when Deputy Bruton was at meetings in Europe I would particularly like to thank him. Not alone was he in the convention but he was in the presidium which was a group that drove the entire work for the past 16 months. I appreciate not only the work he undertook in that but the courtesy he showed at all times to the Government and to the officials. He was extremely helpful and I am grateful for that. It is fair to say the work of the presidium and the compromises that were reached led us to this successful outcome. From an Irish perspective it would be unreasonable of me not to say Deputy John Bruton did an outstanding job in that and we are very grateful to him.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	321	In Thessaloniki, we decided that the Intergovernmental Conference would convene this October and complete its work as soon as possible and in any event before the European Parliament elections next June. The likelihood at this stage is that the Intergovernmental Conference will continue into our Presidency of the EU. We will be prepared for that. We agreed that the report of the Convention is a good basis to start the Intergovernmental Conference. At the meeting, I indicated that Ireland had some concerns that would be pursued in the Intergovernmental Conference. These concerns include unanimity in taxation, some issues in criminal law and in the security and defence areas. I was not alone in this and other members of the European Council also indicated the issues that they will pursue.In Thessaloniki, I proposed that at the end of the Intergovernmental Conference the constitutional treaty could be signed in turn by each member state in a ceremony in its own country, starting with the member state holding the Presidency when negotiations are concluded and culminating in Rome. In summing up the debate, the President of the European Council indicated that this proposal was adopted by all. I am pleased that this proposal was welcomed so warmly because the constitutional treaty is designed to serve our citizens for a generation or more. It is appropriate that, after the Intergovernmental Conference, each member state brings the treaty home to its citizens for signature. Signature in each member state will allow everyone to claim ownership of the constitutional treaty. It is also appropriate that given the Italian Government's role as the depository of the treaties, the final ceremony will be held in Rome.During the course of the European Council, we discussed a paper on security strategy prepared by Javier Solana, the European Union's High Representative. This is a very interesting report and it reflects our view that the Union pursue a  holistic approach to security and that security has economic, political and development dimensions. The report sets out in an easily accessible way some of the global realities with which we in the European Union are faced. The European Union will soon have 25 states, 450 million people and a quarter of the world's GNP. We are, therefore, global players. As global players, we have the responsibility to address the global challenges that face us. These challenges come from a variety of sources and each must be addressed in a variety of ways.For example, the European Union in Thessaloniki called for a substantial contribution to the financing of the global fund to fight HIV-Aids, TB and malaria. These scourges killed more than six million people last year, largely in low-income countries, mostly in Africa. This call for support for the global fund is in line with Irish policy and practice in this area. Low-income countries face particular economic, political and security challenges. The European Union and the member states are the biggest providers of official development assistance. We are playing, and will continue to play, a critical role through our development assistance, our trade and our missions in, for example, Congo.As the report points out, the rule of law has to be expanded. The multilateral system, and the United Nations in particular, has to be strengthened. The fundamental framework for international relations is the United Nations Charter. Proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, international terrorism and organised cross-border crime require global frameworks and a mix of responses. The conclusions of the European Council underline that the European Union will support conflict prevention, promote justice and sustainable development, help secure peace and defend stability in our region and globally. This is an area to which the European Council will return in December. In the meantime, High Representative Solana has been asked to bring the work forward taking into account member states' interests and citizens' priorities. The aim is to foster debate.The European Council also welcomed progress in the area of European Security and Defence Policy, including on capabilities and operations. An EU police mission has been in place in Bosnia-Herzegovina since January of this year, while military missions are under way in the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and the Democratic Republic of Congo. On this basis, and although somewhat limited and constrained by certain shortfalls, the European Council has determined that the Union has operational capability across the full range of Petersberg Tasks. In addition, we endorsed an annual report on the implementation of the EU programme for the prevention of violent conflicts, as well as a report on the contribution of EU Common Foreign and Security Policy to the fight against terrorism.We also issued a declaration on non-proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. The basic  principles have now been established and work continues on the development and implementation of an action plan. Ireland attaches great importance to disarmament and non-proliferation and I welcome this work. Key aspects on the strategy are a focus on the multilateral system and fostering the role of the Security Council and the mainstreaming of non-proliferation issues in EU contacts with third countries.The European Council also had a session devoted to immigration and asylum issues. There were a number of ideas discussed. This is a complex area and there are no simple solutions. The European Union is growing and its borders are expanding. We need more co-operation and resources to ensure that the policies that we agree together work well.Significant progress has been made in the area. Under the Greek Presidency, for example, we have agreed to develop a visa information system. However, we must reinforce our efforts and bring greater harmony to all our systems. We agreed that we had to reinforce our co-operation to ensure that immigrants are integrated into our societies. We also agreed that we should ensure that our asylum systems were not exploited and undermined for those who genuinely required asylum. We need greater co-operation with third countries, for example, to combat illegal immigration and trafficking in human beings.Other issues we discussed and which are covered in our conclusions include enlargement, the follow-up to the spring European Council and a range of external relations issues. In particular, we discussed the situation in the Middle East. We underlined the historic opportunity provided by the acceptance of the quartet's road map by the Palestinian Authority and Israel and the outcome of the Aqaba summit, including the personal engagement of President Bush. We underlined the readiness of the EU to contribute to a lasting, just and peaceful settlement, including through setting up a credible and effective monitoring mechanism.On Iraq, we had a constructive discussion. We welcomed the adoption of United Nations Security Council Resolution 1483 and the engagement of the United Nations through the appointment of the special representative. We looked forward to the formation, as soon as possible, of a representative Iraqi Government. We noted that the United Nations has unique experience in post-conflict nation-building.We also discussed developments in Iran and expressed concern about some elements in Iran's nuclear programme. We called on Iran to be fully co-operative with the International Atomic Energy Agency in all its nuclear activities. We urged it to sign, ratify and implement an additional protocol to its safeguards agreement as a confidence-building measure.While in Thessaloniki, I had a meeting with President Papadopoulos of Cyprus. The President briefed me in detail on the current state of play in Cyprus. I indicated that my colleagues in the  European Union and myself are united in our support for the continuation of the United Nations Secretary General's mission of good office and for negotiations on the basis of his proposals. In that context, I said to the President that Ireland looked forward to Cyprus becoming a member state during our Presidency on 1 May next year. I indicated that we continued to hope that a united island of Cyprus would accede to the European Union next May and that we would be ready to assist in whatever way we could.The Minister for Foreign Affairs represented Ireland at the EU-western Balkans summit on 21 June. The summit brought together the political leaders of the European Union, the accession countries, the candidate countries and the five states of the western Balkans. It adopted a joint declaration confirming the central role of the EU in working with the countries of the region towards the ultimate objective of their integration into European structures. The countries of the western Balkans are potential candidates for membership of the European Union. The summit adopted an agenda for co-operation focused on the implementation of the political and economic reforms essential to consolidating and increasing the political stability of the past three years. That agenda will provide a framework for Ireland's Presidency, during which relations with the western Balkans will remain high on the agenda.On the margins of the European Council meeting, I met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair. The meeting with the Prime Minister followed the meeting between the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Mr. Murphy, in Dublin on Wednesday, 18 June. I will meet Gerry Adams later this week and also hope to have an early opportunity to meet David Trimble and Mark Durkan. We also need to revisit and resolve the two key outstanding issues that were not dealt with satisfactorily in March, namely, ending paramilitarism and ensuring the stability of the institutions. Obviously we want to intensify the contacts with a view to ensuring that there is the best possible environment in which elections can take place in the autumn. I think that everyone recognises the need for the maximum amount of calm and restraint during the marching season. A good number of people are trying to assure that, and I commend them for their efforts. A calm and restrained marching season will also help us go into the autumn on a positive note.In my meeting with the Prime Minister, I emphasised, as I have been doing from the outset and as I did again in the Dáil last week, the absolute necessity for elections to take place in the autumn. Both Governments remain determined to move ahead with the implementation, in so far as we can, of our Joint Declaration. That declaration is our common agenda. Some aspects of the declaration remain dependent on acts of completion by others. However, we can, and must, push forward in areas such as policing, criminal justice, equality and rights issues.The Minister, Deputy Cowen, and Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, will meet again at the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference on 2 July. That meeting will be dedicated to reviewing progress on the implementation of the Joint Declaration. I plan to meet Prime Minister Blair again in London on 2 July. I believe that we can regain momentum in our efforts. That will require the full engagement and commitment, not just of the two Governments, but of all the parties committed to the Agreement.The Thessaloniki European Council was a very successful meeting. I thank the Greek Presidency for the organisation of the event. We are now little over six months away from Ireland's Presidency of the European Union. The issues with which we dealt in Thessaloniki are very likely to remain on the agenda of the European Union during our Presidency.For the first six months of next year, we will work to ensure that enlargement will be a success, as the accession countries move from observers to full members of the Union. We will work to advance the agenda in the justice and home affairs area. If the Intergovernmental Conference continues into our Presidency, as seems likely, we will work to ensure a successful outcome. We will also carry forward the agenda in external relations, where the Presidency represents the Union on the world stage.There will be many more tasks to be done and we will seek to carry them out efficiently and effectively.

I am glad to know that he met the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, on the margins of the European summit. It is critical at this juncture in the evolution of the peace process in Northern Ireland that we do not allow a hiatus to develop. I am glad the Taoiseach is meeting Mr. Adams, Mr. Trimble and Mr. Durkan. It is very important that Sinn Féin faces up to its responsibilities regarding the policing arrangements in Northern Ireland. I believe that the PSNI has the capacity to be an acceptable form of policing for all its communities, but it cannot work if young Nationalists are not encouraged and seen to join. I hope that when the Taoiseach meets Gerry Adams, he makes that point to him. Everyone knows that the Unionist parties have their own internal difficulties, but I hope that when the Taoiseach meets David Trimble he will impress upon him the importance of their understanding that the institutions in Northern Ireland must be allowed to work permanently.There are many reasons to call last week's summit a success for the European Union. It proved  an excellent opportunity to repair and restore important relationships damaged and fractured by the war in Iraq. Fifteen member states managed to consign their differences to the past, looking instead to a better and brighter future facilitated by what I trust will be a coherent and effective common security policy.The last Gulf War taught the EU a bitter but valuable lesson. No common security policy meant no common voice and therefore no European role in promoting a more enlightened, yet complex, view of the global interest. A common European defence is now inevitable, and Fine Gael is convinced that Ireland should become part of that defence structure, with the proviso that it can opt in and out of missions as Dáil Éireann sees fit. I very much hope that the new cohesion achieved at the summit in Greece will help make such development a reality. As I told a party forum in Dublin last night, like it or not, this country is no longer neutral. We are merely unaligned. We have been very forthright with the electorate on this matter. We believe passionately that with rights come responsibilities and that the security of all the members of the European Union lies in recognising our interdependence and exercising our mutual obligations.Our neutrality served us well in the State's infancy, but now that we have reached a new level of maturity we can do things differently. I would like to see our relationships in Europe characterised as much by new behaviour as by old history. In that context, I would like clarity from the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on this matter. We have had comments from Mr. Andrews, the Member of the European Parliament, and other soundings from members of the Government parties on the issue of a common defence alliance in Europe. It is time the Government made a clear statement in that regard.On the eve of the European Council meeting, I attended a meeting of the leaders of the European People's Party in Thessaloniki, where several Prime Ministers from member states and applicant countries were gathered. I pointed out to them how pleased Fine Gael is with the outcome of the work of the Convention on the Future of Europe. The draft treaty presented by the Convention represents a balanced and fair compromise which will result in the European Union becoming more accessible to the public and more efficient in its operations. It also provides a balanced approach to the rights of larger and smaller countries regarding representation in the institutions, and I am particularly happy that the draft constitutional treaty provides for equal representation for all member states in the European Commission.It is appropriate, as the Taoiseach has already done, to thank the Oireachtas Members who represented us on the Convention, the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, and Deputies Carey and Gormley, together with the  civil servants for their hard work and dedication during the past 16 months. In particular, I pay special tribute to my colleague, Deputy John Bruton, a former Taoiseach, who is not just a member of the convention but also a member of the praesidium. He has made a magnificent contribution to the work of the convention. His reputation within the European Peoples' Party in which there are ten Prime Ministers is second to none. It is also important to say to the Taoiseach that this was an open public forum for discussion. It allowed this party, in Opposition, to have a real say at the centre of all the drafting unlike the Intergovernmental Conference which is conducted behind closed doors and in secret. The Labour Party had Proinsias De Rossa at the discussions. This is important in bringing this matter before the people in a European sense. In that context, this convention exercise has been historic in bringing together member states and their national parliaments. Its public deliberations meant that the peoples of Europe could follow the negotiations under various draft documents. It also provided for the involvement of parties, including Opposition parties.I believe strongly that the Heads of Government should not attempt to unravel or fundamentally change the provisions of the draft constitution treaty during the Intergovernmental Conference which is due to start in October. To do so would undermine public confidence and support. Each of the member states' Governments was represented on the convention in order that each had a direct input into its outcome.I am pleased the Heads of Government who belong to the European Peoples' Party gave a positive reaction to the draft constitutional treaty. I am equally pleased it received a similar positive reaction at the subsequent European Council summit.I urge the Taoiseach and the Government to begin planning the widespread public debate which is necessary in order that the Irish people are fully informed about the significance of the draft treaty. If we learned one lesson last year as politicians, it was on the occasion of the second referendum on Nice that if one wants to bring the people with one on a complex issue, one must empathise with them, listen to them, engage and consult with them and give them their say in order that they feel part of the political process. That resulted in up to 500,000 more people voting on Nice II as against Nice I, which the people rejected on the basis of lack of information.If the draft is approved with major changes by the Intergovernmental Conference and is followed by proper public debate and proper public information, it will be possible to secure the support of the Irish public in its ratification by constitutional referendum.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	325	I thank my party leader for allowing me contribute to this debate and the Taoiseach for his especially kind and warm  remarks in regard to my work in the convention. I thank Deputy Kenny's predecessor, Deputy Noonan, for placing his confidence in me and appointing me to represent the party on the convention. I commend the Taoiseach, in particular, on being the only leader of any European country to have appointed two Opposition politicians to the two principal positions representing the national Parliament. I know of no other country where that was done. It established a very good working relationship from which the Government will gain. I should say how much of a difference the presence of the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, made to the work of the convention, both from Ireland's point of view and from the point of view of representing the interests of smaller countries. It has been an entirely positive contribution on his part.The summit received the report of the Convention on the Future of Europe but it did so against a background of deep strategic unease about Europe's relationship with the United States and the parallel concern about Prime Minister Blair's inability to take a clear political direction on British entry into the euro. No country has more to lose from these two developments than Ireland. We depend more than anyone else on the United States investment here for job creation and on maintaining a stable currency relationship with Britain. Both will be put at risk if the gap between continental Europeans and the so-called Anglo-Saxon powers widens.The new military doctrine of the current US Administration, that of accepting unilaterally decided pre-emptive or preventive wars, is radically different from the multilateral, no-first strike philosophy of European countries, including Britain. The US believes in unbridled freedom of action. Europeans believe in international rules. No one dares admit it but there can be no continuing basis for an EU-US alliance as long as the philosophical gap remains as wide as it is currently.The United States is no longer a status quo power; it wants to remake the world. Furthermore as Philip Stephens in his article in the Financial Times of 23 May 2003 states: “Amongst the most important geopolitical shifts in the past two years has been the US administration's judgment that its interest now lies in dividing rather than uniting Europe.”  A close study of the voluminous avalanche of economic data given to present an economic case for New Labour's continuing indecision on Britain's euro membership can be boiled down to one thing – the fear that euro zone interest rates will be too low to keep inflation in check in Britain because of a certain structural proclivity to inflation in Britain arising from the way it finances housing at variable rate mortgages rather than fixed rate mortgages.There is no substance to this economic case. The difference between sterling and euro interest rates is too little to make the difference that Chancellor Gordon Brown fears. The real problem about British euro membership is a political  one. After 30 years of EU membership, Britain is still not ready to commit itself to the project of a politically and economically united Europe. It still wants to keep its options open. Perhaps, if France and Germany once and for all successfully implement vitally necessary and overdue economic liberalisation and pension reform measures, Britain's view will change but then it may find some other problem, such as the entry rate being too high or too low.Against this difficult background on these two vital issues from an Irish point of view, how should we judge the outcome of the convention and of the summit in Thessalonika? I commend the Foreign Ministers for at last agreeing a common EU policy on weapons of mass destruction. It is a pity we did not have such a common policy a year ago. I commend the commitment to solving the deep problems of the western Balkans, Bosnia, Serbia, Kosovo and Albania. If the EU cannot establish a viable democratic settlement in its own backyard, there is no point in talking about a common foreign and security policy further afield. I commend the progress on asylum and immigration, a matter that will be aided by the majority voting recommended by the convention. In regard to the convention's draft constitutional treaty, the summit was positive. I find that very encouraging. I hope Governments will not think they can easily upset the political balance struck in the convention's draft, as distinct from the detail.Irish Ministers and Departments should also recognise that unanimous voting is non-viable in a Union of 25 or 30 countries. Vetoes mean paralysis. Ireland needs a Europe that works and Departments should wake up to that. On most issues, the European Union's interests and the Irish national interest are identical, not divergent.The proposed single Foreign Minister recommended by the convention will be very important. The European Council chair will be better than rotating Presidencies. The protocol on consulting national parliaments will radically open up the EU legislative process, politicising decisions more and taking matters out of official channels. That is good. Ministers who are accustomed to getting a brief, on which they must make decisions, to read for the first time as they get on to the aeroplane on the way to a key Council meeting will now have to make political choices much earlier in the EU legislative process thanks to national parliaments being involved. This will give elected politicians more power and that is more democratic and a wholly good thing.I admit to being disappointed about two aspects of the Convention outcome. We have not come up with a sufficiently radical proposal to engage European public opinion in the EU process. There will be no EU presidential election, either by popular suffrage or an electoral college. There will be no steps to create a truly European demos and thus no democratic glue to keep Europe together in the event of a real crisis.The decision to retain unanimity on how the EU is financed will lead to big problems when the next six year budget has to be settled in 2006. Unanimity will mean a continuance of the policy of special rebates to keep some happy, like a British rebate, or of pork barrel politics to keep others happy, like what the Spanish want to get, all in order to buy off the undeserving. This is bad business and gives the European Union a bad name.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Given that this was such a historically and politically important European Council, it is somewhat surprising that it did not receive more media attention. It was politically important for the reason that it raised the starter's flag on the Intergovernmental Conference process that it is proposed, according to the official communiqué, to have convened by October next and to have completed its work before June 2004 at the latest.It seems clear it is intended to have the Intergovernmental Conference's work done and dusted well before June. The language of the communiqué states that "the conference should complete its work as soon as possible and in time for it to become known to European citizens before the June 2004 elections for the European Parliament."  The communiqué also talks of member states signing the constitutional treaty as soon as possible after 1 May of next year.The latest Commission eurobarometer opinion poll, published earlier in the month, confirms again that the convention did not catch the public attention, but that is not to take away in any respect from the convention process itself. The convention worked well. Its members approached their task with real vigour and the process was conducted in the most open and transparent way. I join in the congratulations of the Taoiseach and Deputy Kenny to our representatives on the convention, to Deputy John Bruton as an outstanding member of the presidium and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, whose involvement, once the Government changed its attitude to the convention, certainly made a difference.Despite this, most people have not read the draft that has come from the convention and at best only in the most vague of terms are aware of its content. The draft that has emerged from the convention is not the draft that we will have to vote on and we know nothing about the draft that we shall be asked by way of amendment to our Constitution to ratify because it does not yet exist. Further, we do not yet have from the Government a coherent, comprehensive, reasoned opinion on the convention draft with which we will all have to become more familiar in the coming months.The new eurobarometer poll conducted for the Commission shows that during the past six months support for a constitutional treaty for the EU has fallen marginally throughout the Union. However, it has fallen sharply in Ireland since  December last. Just 54% of those polled in Ireland supported a constitutional treaty for the EU, down seven points on six months ago. There have also been sharp reductions in support levels in Denmark, Finland and France. Nonetheless, there is broad support, although what citizens favour is a construction that is cautious, even conservative, on institutional matters generally.For example, citizens do not want the national principle in respect of the appointment of Commissioners changed, even though that is what has been decided. They are also in favour of retaining a significant national right of veto, even though that is to be reduced in the convention draft. On the other hand they favour popular election of the president of the Commission, something that is not proposed. They are also somewhat less positive than they were on enlargement and favour development of a common foreign policy and common defence. On foreign policy, Ireland is a strong supporter of a common position and an EU foreign Minister. On defence, the Irish position is somewhat more confused. I hope the EU has learned from the mistakes of the past and that the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference will be far removed from the closed shop conclaves of history.What is the view of the Government on the need for an open and transparent Intergovernmental Conference? I hope that the Taoiseach, his Foreign Minister and the "experts" from Iveagh House do not plan to secretly horse-trade through the winter and in the spring return home on the new jet to tell us it is all done and now we must all vote "Yes" and do so in a hurry. Given that the closing stages of the Intergovernmental Conference will occur during an Irish Presidency, I am sure the Taoiseach will strive not to use it as an exercise in self-promotion and the cult of the leader in the context of local government and European elections. That could lead us into being confronted with a constitutional proposal that will be presented as requiring to be accepted without question and quickly.The Government must now think with some care and act democratically. Brief mention of some undefined role for the European Parliament does not amount to much. Domestically, the Taoiseach must tell us how he intends to communicate to the people in respect of the Intergovernmental Conference negotiations. One method would be for the Presidency, Irish and Italian, to report to the plenary sessions of the European Parliament each month in public on the progress of the Intergovernmental Conference. This would facilitate dialogue and scrutiny at both EU and national level. We need ready access to the convention draft. We need a Green Paper immediately and a White Paper in the autumn. The Labour Party believes that the Forum on Europe should be retained and sufficiently resourced to allow it to continue with its communications exercise. Both the forum and the Oireachtas require to be brought fully into the picture and the Houses of the Oireachtas require  to be properly resourced to scrutinise the Intergovernmental Conference work over the next nine months or so.The Intergovernmental Conference is not simply an exercise in international relations and, as such, under the Constitution, a matter that is the preserve of the Government. This context, to my mind, calls for a high degree of openness and transparency in the work of the Intergovernmental Conference, not to mention communication to our citizens by the Government and the provision of reasoned opinions for proposals being supported.There is another argument in favour of transparency and openness. It is that the European Council and the Council of Ministers are peculiar entities. They are gatherings of elected representatives who wield executive power at home and yet, in the context of the Community and the Union, have something of the character of a representative body, even assembly. This is so in that the Commission, in the character of an unelected executive power, makes legislative proposals but it is the Council, something in the character of an elected chamber, that decides to accept, reject or modify the legislative proposals that come before it. The Council has something of the character of an upper house in a bicameral parliament, but an upper house that is the decisive house, arguably reflecting a balance of power between the Union and member states, based on the weight given historically to national sovereignty. This is not the usual way of looking at the Council but it is not inaccurate and suggests that the Council, or a sub-committee of the Council, which is what the Intergovernmental Conference is in effect, should be open and transparent in the conduct of its business. Up to now it has not been thus, in so far as the Council currently conducts itself, in respect of the work of the various Councils of Ministers, or historically, as regards the work of Intergovernmental Conferences.It is interesting to note that the Council of Ministers does not have a high level of trust among European voters, according to the June eurobarometer opinion poll, and that throughout the EU national Governments are largely distrusted – indeed they are more distrusted than are national Parliaments – a sign of the times perhaps.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	330	I agree the Taoiseach will earn his money next year – there is no doubt about that. The Government has given no indication  that it intends to embark on this process other than by the normal rules of Intergovernmental Conferences to date, i.e. the rules of secret international diplomacy. If that is its intention and the intention of the Council, it is not appropriate. This Intergovernmental Conference is not like previous Intergovernmental Conferences. We have had the innovation of the convention, with all its openness of procedure, precisely because the secret diplomacy formulation had come to be seen as lacking democratic legitimacy. To dispose of the work of the convention in seven short paragraphs, communicates to me an unacceptable desire to revert to type. Conclaves, COREPER and cronyism may strike Heads of Government and Brussels bureaucrats as businesslike. However, they are actually a recipe for a re-run of Nice and this time it will not be all down to Ireland.To judge from the Presidency conclusions in the official communiqué, the Council had a full and very important agenda. It included consideration of the convention draft but significant consideration seems also to have been given to issues that come under the two broad headings, namely, justice and home affairs and foreign, security and defence policy. The principal items discussed under justice and home affairs were immigration, asylum and issues arising thereof. Much of the discussion of foreign, security and defence policy seems to have centred on international terrorism, religious extremism and alleged weapons of mass destruction.In regard to the JHA issue of asylum seekers, refugees and an EU interior ministry, on one reading, since 11 September, there appears to have been an unfortunate tendency to link asylum seekers and refugees with the issue of terrorism and to use this as a justification for the establishment of a good old-fashioned EU interior ministry, imbued with a strong internal security culture and a philosophy in respect of the individual and the state that cuts against the grain of what this party stands for in the area of human rights. This might be said to be a somewhat pessimistic view. However, we have to be vigilant in ensuring that the European Union does not develop an authoritarian tendency in the field of justice and home affairs. This was controversial territory at the convention in respect of the provisions that might be included in the constitutional treaty.The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has posed questions and promised vigilance, although he would also appear to have acted against the spirit of his own position on Committee Stage of the Criminal Justice (Temporary Release of Prisoners) Bill and the Immigration Bill. The Labour Party also has certain concerns as regards the proposed constitution from a distinctly civil liberties standpoint.The communiqué suggests that the new world view in Washington DC has found some support within the institutions of the EU. Annex 1 of the  communiqué tells us that the Council of Foreign Ministers has set up a group of advisors to examine, "extreme fundamentalism and terrorism". The group has reported and that report will now be discussed by the Council. What are the findings, views, conclusions and recommendations of this group of advisors?Given the appalling events in the Middle East in recent weeks, I am surprised that the situation there did not receive more focus of attention in Thessaloniki. I wish some of those europhiles like Deputy John Bruton would tell me how to pronounce "Thessaloniki".

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	332	I believe that there should be a strong role for the EU in trying to halt the terrible cycle of violence that has taken so many Palestinian and Israeli lives over the recent depressing months. The international community cannot stand aside and allow the terrible loss of life to continue. Neither suicide bombings nor assassinations from the sky should be acceptable to any democrat. The legacy of these tactics is not just the dead and broken bodies, but also the embitterment of yet another generation of people in the region.The road map proposals which had offered some hope of a breakthrough were drawn up by a quartet made up of the United Nations, the US, Russia and the EU. The joint ownership by the four parties of this proposal must now be reasserted. All of the participants must become actively involved in the search for a peaceful way forward. There is a planned meeting of the quartet at the weekend and the EU must move to reassert its role in the process. Clearly, the United States on its own does not have the required standing or authority to broker a solution and we may now be paying a price for the US-inspired marginalisation of Yasser Arafat. If we are to make any progress, there must be continuous and deep involvement by the United Nations, the EU and Russia.Too many lives have been lost so far and the peoples of Israel and Palestine deserve the opportunity to live their lives in peace and security. Ireland can and must play a role in ensuring that this happens. I know Ireland is about the join the troika on 1 July, six months in advance of assuming the EU Presidency. I also note that the Minister for Foreign Affairs is due to visit the region this weekend and I wish him well in his discussions with the various interests. In this regard, it is unacceptable that Israeli Government Ministers are apparently refusing to meet the Minister because he will also be meeting President Arafat.In regard to the link between defence and foreign policy, there is reference in the communiqué to something called ECAP and ECAP project groups. I have tried to find out something about ECAP. There was a meeting of Defence Mini sters in Brussels on 19 May, although the information on the meeting on the EU website suggests that it may have been a meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council. The meeting resulted in a declaration on EU military capabilities. Progress on the development of a European military capability action plan, ECAP, was welcomed. The group seems to have embarked on exploring a remarkable series of military, development and research options prepared by 19 project groups established under the plan. The project groups have produced papers on options including special operations forces, the development of unmanned aerial vehicles and space-based assets. Future research includes attack helicopters, cruise missiles and strategic sea-lift.What was the status of this meeting? Was the Government represented and by whom? What is the Government's attitude to ECAP and the ECAP project groups?

That task is the drawing up of an EU constitution. Successive treaties have created a mass of over-lapping legal texts and there was a real sense that a single text was needed, which would encompass previous treaties and give some clear definition of what the European Union really is.However, for many Irish people, the very mention of the term "European constitution" rings alarm bells and many are genuinely concerned about the possibility of an ever-more powerful Europe that is encroaching on national sovereignty. Therefore, an important question for many Irish people is whether this is a treaty between states or a constitution for a single state. Due to time constraints, I cannot deal with the document in any detail. However, the two central features of a state – the ability to raise taxes and to go to war – remain with national governments and outside the control of the EU. Therefore, I do not see the outcome as a plan for a superstate, although some may have wished it so. Rather, I see it as a treaty between states because all constitutional changes will still have to be made by unanimous agreement of all countries in the EU. There is, and will continue to be, a tension between cohesion and subsidiarity, but a reasonable balance has been struck. In this context, I commend the work of the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach, Deputy Roche, who was very much involved in an alliance  between the smaller states to help to promote our interests and the best interests of a wider Europe. I also congratulate our representative at the praesidium, Deputy John Bruton, as well as all other members of the convention. As a member of the European affairs committee, I have seen the extent of their work. It is not always visible to the public, but it is of enormous benefit and deserves to be commended.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	336	As the Deputy is aware, my Department has overall responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of the national drugs strategy and for the work of 14 local drugs task forces which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse.The Government has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in the action plans. In addition, services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over recent years. For example, in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, treatment services have expanded from 12 locations in early 1997 to 57 currently. Most of these services offer a range of treatments, including methadone maintenance, methadone reduction, outpatient detoxification, counselling and alternative remedies or therapies.In relation to methadone maintenance, there were 1,350 places available on the treatment list about seven years ago, whereas currently there are approximately 6,600. Outside the ERHA, treatment clinics have been established in the South Eastern Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, Western Health Board and Midland Health Board. General practitioners and pharmacists also provide treatment services and their involvement has increased over recent years. Services are also provided by a broad range of voluntary and community agencies which are funded through grants from health boards.It is not accurate to say that those not on the central methadone treatment list do not receive treatment. While they may not be on a substi tution treatment programme, such opiate users would receive a range of detox or drug-free treatments in both residential and non-residential settings. Other users would be clients of needle exchange programmes, outreach services and other interventions for chaotic users. As the Deputy will appreciate, entry into treatment is a personal choice and, indeed, positive motivation is essential for treatment to have any chance of success.The Deputy should note that funding of drugs services provided by my Department increased by 16% this year, even though the overall level of funding available to the Department generally has decreased. The increase in expenditure for this year clearly reflects the Government's ongoing commitment to addressing the drug problem, particularly in areas where heroin misuse is most prevalent.Additional InformationWhile there may be additional demands on the subhead in 2003, I believe that through this increased allocation and close monitoring of spending, we can address such requests for funding over the course of the year.

I ask the Minister to acknowledge that more money is needed for our drugs prevention programme, particularly for such young people. If they are using heroin they are certainly not on methadone treatment. More money needs to be put into support services such as those offered by Merchants Quay, Citywide Drugs Crisis and other projects.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	338	I am aware of the matters to which the Deputy referred. Internationally, the problem is to entice and encourage people into treatment. The percentage of drug users we attract into active treatment is as high if not slightly higher than the norm in most countries. One has to build on services. Drug users may not come looking for methadone or substitution treatments on the first day, but outreach workers are working with those people. We are funding projects such as the one in Merchants Quay, projects which deal with addicts, offering them counselling and needle exchange. One has to try to build up a level of trust and support and hope these people can make their lives less chaotic, go the whole way and look for substitution treatments. We could certainly use more money in the area, but there is a broad range of services available. Every effort is being made. There are extra outreach workers involved, trying to attract addicts into treatment.

In their view, that will affect 45% of the drugs task force organisations in Dublin. I ask the Minister if it is true that the numbers of people who die from opiate overdoses in Dublin city are very high. I believe there were 83 such deaths in the past year. This is equivalent to one fifth of all deaths from RTAs, road traffic accidents, all over the country. There is no comparison between the amount of money we spend, rightly and properly, on preventing road traffic accidents and the money spent on preventing deaths from drug overdoses. The Merchants Quay project representatives in particular have been very critical of the lack of new programmes to get more addicts into treatment.The Minister referred to people in residential units. There are very few such places in Dublin for anyone to go into. That is another area of need. The Minister's policy has utterly failed. It is completely underfinanced. It is a shame and a disgrace that on the city streets, drug abuse incidents such as the one I referred to can be seen daily.

Regarding funding, the Deputy got the relevant document under the freedom of information procedures. My Department's original pitch to the Department of Finance was for an extra €7 million. The regional drugs task forces have been initiated later than expected and some of the programmes promoted by the local drugs task forces have not yet been put in place. Had they been in place last January, we would have been short of funds. We are getting by through various means. We could do with more money, but I do not want the Minister for Finance to hear that we sought more than we needed. The pitch we made would have been necessary had all the programmes been put in place on the due dates, but fortunately they were not.

This  amounts to a decrease of 6% in the amount provided in the Estimates in 2002.Area Development Management Limited, ADM, manages the programme on behalf of my Department. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were agreed by the board of ADM earlier this year and were subsequently notified to each partnership and community group. ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote.The reductions in available funding for 2003 were managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the area partnership company or community group. Northside Partnership was allocated a total of €3,618,753 for the period 2001 to 2003, which equates to an annualised budget of €1,206,251 in each of the three years. As a result of the reduced budget in 2003, the Revised Estimate for 2003 is €1,121,814, a reduction of 7%.I am aware that some partnerships and community groups had the expectation of carrying over previous years' underspends into 2003. It is important to point out that my Department, as with all Departments, operates on an annual cash basis, not on an accrual basis. Consequently, it is not in a position to facilitate a cumulative carryover of underspends. ADM is working closely with all the bodies concerned to minimise as far as possible the impact of the reductions in funding this year.I acknowledge once again the work done by partnerships in disadvantaged areas. I have visited the Northside Partnership and seen at first hand the valuable work being undertaken.

All the 38 companies, such as Action South Kildare, Bantry Integrated Development Group, Co-operation Fingal, Tralee Partnership, Northside Partnership, Clondalkin Partnership and Ballyfermot Partnership, are in a similar position.Groups face closure because the Minister, not ADM, allowed the budget to be slashed last year by €3 million. The Minister said there is no facility for carryover. He knew three-year plans were in place, that agreement had been reached through ADM with his predecessors in different Departments before his was created and that a programme of action had been outlined to continue until the end of next year. Despite the fact that the Minister was aware of this, he allowed the budget in this area to be cut by €3 million. As a result, groups such as the Target group in Donaghmede face closure for the simple reason that key staff will not be paid from major partnership funding. Is it not time for the Minister to ask the Minister for Finance to provide the additional funding necessary to enable critical community groups to survive?

That comprises the sum of €44.6 million provided for this year and an extra €6 million provided in December 2002. That compares with an allocation of €45.5 million for 2001 and €47.6 million for 2002. Taking the 13 month period since 1 December 2002 to the end of this year, the amount that will be paid to ADM is €50.6 million. I do not understand the great difference from ADM's point of view between paying the money in December 2002 and paying it in January 2003 because this was money over and above the initial Estimate last year.As I have repeatedly pointed out, there were underspends in previous years and, as every Deputy knows, money not spent returns to the Exchequer. Deputy Broughan is incorrect in what he said. ADM informed me that it understood that there would be no carryovers. It appears to be under no illusion but seems to have some crossed wires with the partnerships. ADM and the Department are ad idem in that they both understand that money cannot be carried forward from one year to another.

He lives in a strange world – perhaps he has lost his true vocation and should be writing Harry Potter-type thrillers – where 13 months is suddenly 12 months. How can that be? He knew from his experience before he came to the Department, which was similar to mine and that of other Deputies, that three-year plans were in place and he chose to ignore that. He should obtain the money from the Minister for Finance and prevent communities being destroyed.

There are three-year plans with annualised budgets. Therefore, money cannot be carried forward because the financing system does not allow for it. Neither the Deputy's colleague, when he was Minister for Finance, nor any other Minister changed that fundamental position. The Deputy should not try to twist the issue because it will not run.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	350	The young people's facilities and services fund was established in 1998 to assist in the development of facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. The objective of the fund is to attract at risk young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.Most of the money is spent in the 14 local drugs task force areas but, recognising that the drug problem is not confined to these areas, funding was also allocated to a number of urban areas, including Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow. To date, more than €68 million has been allocated under the fund. This includes a sum of €9.1 million in respect of the Springboard initiative, which is administered by the Department of Health and Children. Funding of €15.877 million is available for the fund this year, of which €10.133 million is for capital projects and €5.744 million for services.With regard to the current position, the national assessment committee for the fund, which is chaired by my Department, is examining the services projects funded under round one. The intention is that, where they are found to be effective, they will be mainstreamed, thereby enabling their ongoing provision by statutory agencies.Qualification for continued funding is dependent on the successful evaluation of each project by the services steering group, which has been established to examine the projects, and subject to sufficient funding being in place. The work of the steering group has recently been completed and recommendations will be submitted to the Cabinet committee on social inclusion at its July meeting. The development groups will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible thereafter.The Cabinet committee also considered recently a number of issues relating to the operation of the fund, including its future funding. The matter will be kept under review and the Cabinet committee will return to the issue at its next meeting.The fund is regarded as a very important element of the drugs strategy, particularly the prevention pillar, and it has been positively received in drugs task force areas over the past five years. In supporting communities in their efforts to prevent young people from drifting into drug misuse, the fund aims to provide positive alternatives and divert them from the dangers of drug dependency.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I thank the Minister of State for his reply but there is considerable concern within youth services and those voluntary organisations that work directly with young people that the fund has been moved from the Department of Education and Science to the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. There may be an argument for having the Department deal directly with youth services but the handling of this fund has left many in the sector feeling confused. They are back to the situation against which they campaigned for years of having to deal with several Departments to access funds to work with young people. I ask the Government to re-examine the situation to ensure all the funding comes from one Department.More seriously, the movement of the fund from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has been accompanied by political sleight of hand in that the fund has not only been moved, it has been reduced. Many of those who work with young people have been angered by these two movements – they are trying to access badly needed money to work with young people and less money is available. I also note with concern the Minister of State's remarks about the Cabinet reviewing the fund itself, a dangerous preliminary signal that this fund may not exist in years to come.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I am surprised at what the Deputy is saying because the feedback from people in the business was that they wanted the fund administered by the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and they wondered why it was ever within the remit of the Department of Education and Science. It is one fund, but not the only fund, that supports youth workers. It is part of the national drugs strategy and most people wanted it to be under the control of the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs because it was strange that we were administering it but it was included in the education Vote. It is for people at risk, it is an extra fund allowing youth services to employ extra workers to deal with people in specific areas who were at risk from drugs. I have not heard that concern previously because everyone wanted it in the one Department for co-ordination purposes.The fund has delivered capital and services. We could do with more funding and it is true there are ongoing pressures on the present fund. The amount allocated this year puts us under pressure as we try to meet all commitments. The fund, however, is a necessary part of the strategy and it is doing a good job in the drugs task force areas.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	353	The concern in the youth services is that funding has moved from a single Department into separate Departments. There is no argument about the fact that youth services might be better looked after within the Department if it was prepared to take on that responsibility – that is an  argument for the Cabinet – but compartmentalising youth services will not help in the distribution of these funds.The wider question for the Minister of State is the degree to which consultation took place with youth organisations about the distribution of this fund. I note the Minister of State did not address my central point that the movement of the fund has been accompanied by a significant decrease in funding, sending out the wrong signals to those working with young people.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	354	We got the fund from the Department of Education and Science and the figure we are using is the one from that Department so I do not see how there could be any reduction in the services. The services we have provided under the fund are being evaluated and that will be discussed at the July meeting. I fail to see how there could be any reduction in the services currently being provided.The Deputy has surprised me. I have not heard this criticism anywhere else because we are not just funding youth workers, there are all sorts of other workers who are working with at risk youths in disadvantaged areas where drugs are a reality.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I refer the Deputy to replies to earlier questions on this matter, in particular my reply to questions on 26 March and Question No. 429 on 15 April 2003.As I indicated in these replies, a comprehensive consultation process is at the heart of the review of structures that my colleagues the Ministers for Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I have initiated. This will allow us to draw on the commitment and the expertise of those engaged at a community and local level.The consultation process was advanced by way of a national seminar attended by nearly 300 participants, which was held last week, during which I had an opportunity to listen to and discuss the views of many of the agencies active in this field.It is my task now to assimilate the views expressed during the seminar and in the submissions received by my Department. In the meantime, my Department will maintain and develop its existing contacts with the various groups and agencies so that the process of dialogue and information exchange continues as we  deepen our understanding on the issues appropriate for reform.Taking these matters into consideration, I am satisfied that an adequate opportunity for consultation is being provided to all the interested agencies and bodies.The IPA provided invaluable assistance and expertise in organising and running the seminar but it has no active role in the overall review. Accordingly it will not produce a report.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The Minister's mission is to protect and develop rural communities and ensure they are involved in the process. I received a full briefing on the conference the Minister attended and it was appreciated that he stayed for most of it. That conference, however, was held in Dublin at 8.30 a.m. It was not possible for those involved in rural affairs and who have other jobs or commitments to be there. Those that could attend appreciated the conference but, in all sincerity, coming from a rural area himself, was it realistic of the Minister to bring people into the centre of Dublin when this could have been done on a regional basis or, at least, in a rural setting? Perhaps it should not have been held on a Wednesday because of the Dáil sitting, but on a Monday or Friday instead.Will the Minister give a commitment that no matter how these groups are rationalised – the Leader programme partnerships and community groups – there will be no cutback in funding from Europe? They support the European ethos of a bottom-up approach. It is not the direct responsibility of the Department but we must ensure money is not lost. A great deal of effort was put into securing funding for the Border regions and disadvantaged areas and whatever structures are put in place in the long-term, that money should be retained.

This meeting was held on a Wednesday because we wanted a number of Ministers to attend. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform attended, as did Deputy Noel Ahern, as the Minister of State in my Department and at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. For that reason it was decided to hold the meeting in Dublin. It started at 9.30 a.m. and I stayed until 2 p.m., when I had an appointment with Glór na nGael. The attendance certainly indicated that most people managed to make the conference. I attended a city partnership last night and I hope to visit the Deputy's county some time during the summer. As I travel around the country I try to meet as many groups as possible because the formal setting is important but I often find I get more frank views in the informal discussions.The Deputy can be assured that the Leader groups will remain intact to the end of the period  to 2006. What happens after that is part of a bigger scene involving the reform in Europe and, please God, there will be even more emphasis on rural development. It is our intention to draw down all the funding available. In that context, however, I have had some interesting discussions with Leader and partnership groups working in the same areas on the possibility of either amalgamating or rationalising and being able to give a better regional service within the areas in which they function. That is the type of change I would like to see happen. When we have one-to-one discussions with the people on the ground, I am sure they will see the sense in moving that way but I want it to be voluntary, agreed and tailor-made to the requirements of a particular area, not some blueprint set down for the whole country. Change, properly managed, is a good thing. This is not about trying to save money but about delivering more services for the same money. The higher the quality of the service, the more chance we have of getting more money.

As regards formal consultations, we will move on now but throughout the summer I will be visiting various counties. Various groups come to see me. I have an open door policy on groups coming to meet me and I find the dialogue more intense and more focused towards local needs when I meet them on that basis. The basic templates will be worked out fairly fast, but how that will impinge on each group is something to be worked out in more detail as we go forward. I assure the Deputy that the full money available for Leader will continue to be available.

Lasmuigh den Ghaeltacht chomh maith, tá gá leis an nGaeilge a chothú agus a chur chun cinn agus tá iarrachtaí á dhéanamh ag mo Roinn agus ag Foras na Gaeilge i gcónaí chun na críche sin.

Mar sin, tá scagadh  déanta i roinnt figiúirí agus déarfainn go gcuirfeadh an Teachta spéis faoi leith iontu. Má ghlacaimid le daoine fásta, is é sin daoine os cionn 20 bliain d'aois, san nGaeltacht i 1996, bhí 20,813 duine a dúirt gur labhair siad an Ghaeilge go laethúil san nGaeltacht. Sa bhliain 2002, bhí 20,723. Sin laghdú de 90 duine, rud a chiallaíonn go bhfuil sé mórán seasmhach. Maidir leis an tír ar fad, i 1996 dúirt 70,950 duine fásta gur labhair siad an Ghaeilge go laethúil. Sa bhliain 2002 tá sé sin méadaithe go 72,834, breis agus 1,884 ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil.Tá rud eile a éiríonn as na figiúirí sin atá suntasach. Má thógann tú na cainteoirí laéthúla Gaeilge ar fad sa tír le hais na gcainteoirí laethúla Gaeilge san nGaeltacht ar bhonn an phobail iomlán agus gasraí san áireamh, tá níos mó ná 10% de na cainteoirí laethúla san nGaeltacht. Má chuireann tú gasraí scoile as, ardaíonn sé sin go 28%, mar tá i bhfad níos mó gasraí taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht ná mar atá taobh istigh.Maidir le gasraí trí  nó ceithre bliana d'aois, is é sin sula dtéann siad ar scoil, san nGaeltacht tháinig méadú de 42 orthu sin ó 861 go 903. Sa tír ar fad, an Ghaeltacht san áireamh, tháinig méadú 1,179 ar líon na ngasúr idir tr agus ceathar, is é sin roimh aois scoile, a deir a dtuismitheoirí go labhraíonn siad Gaeilge go laethúil, ó 4,812 go 5,991. Tá dhá rud i gceist ansin. Tá tionchar naí-scolaíochta nó go bhfuil níos mó tuismitheoirí ag labhairt na Gaeilge san mbaile le gasúir. Más é an dara cheann é is túar íontach dóchais don todhchaí. Arís, feicimid athrú sna figiúirí sa mhéad is go bhfuil an claonadh go bhfuil níos mó Gaeilge taobh amuigh den nGaeltacht ná mar a bhíodh.

The overall strategy decided by Government provides for balanced regional development to ensure the distribution of the benefits of economic progress throughout rural areas; investment in services and infrastructure; sustainable economic development; human resources development; and a determined focus on poverty and social exclusion.The national development plan is the vehicle for delivering the commitments in the White Paper. There is a specific chapter on rural development with a commitment to public investment of €8.5 billion over the period 2000-06 in actions which directly impact on rural areas. These range from payments to farmers on, for example, headage and REPS, to rural infrastructure, capital investment in the food sector and rural enterprises. Many of the other investments in the plan will also have indirect benefits for rural communities such as employment development, better roads and transport services, new housing and improved health services.In addition to the national development plan investments, I also introduced, in October 2001, the CLÁR programme for disadvantaged rural areas. An Agreed Programme for Government includes a commitment to continue the CLÁR programme and to consider additional areas for inclusion in light of the 2002 population census results. Earlier this year, I announced the revision of the CLÁR areas.It is not practical here to outline every topic covered in the White Paper. However, I am sending separately to the Deputy a detailed progress report, presented to the National Rural Development Forum at its meeting on 17 January last in Portumna, which outlines the position up to the end of 2002.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	370	I await the report with interest. The Minister told the House what the White Paper on Rural Development is and what funding headings are available for rural development, but did not indicate what it has achieved. What indicators does the Department use? The census returns, which show an overall increase in the population nationally, indicate that there has been a continuing decline in the rural population as measured in terms of small villages and smaller population units. Will the Minister issue a clear statement on how rural Ireland is defined and the way in which  it will be protected. In particular, he should clarify his position on the continuing decrease in facilities in rural areas. For instance, commercial companies such as An Post are closing or changing the facilities they offer in small villages and rural communities, while the ESB is closing commercial outlets and direct payment facilities for household bills.The Opposition, rural communities and the public at large are seeking concrete examples of how rural development is being enhanced, protected and progressed by the Government. Short of the report the Minister intends to supply me—

#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	372	I will conclude. Short of the report the Minister intends to supply me, I have not heard any such examples in his reply. I hope he will now inform the House of the direction of Government policy in this area.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	373	As the Deputy is probably aware, my Department was deeply involved in the spatial strategy published last autumn. For example, it made a clear statement on the issue of rural planning as well as on the need to allow the traditional settlement pattern of the country to continue and those with a connection to the countryside the right to build in their own areas. This is a fundamental issue in relation to rural population because prior to the spatial strategy's publication certain people had been trying to push a policy that only those involved in agriculture would be allowed to build outside of towns and cities. As everybody knows, the number of people employed in agriculture is declining dramatically and such a policy would have spelt a death knell for rural Ireland.The Deputy will also be aware that a major investment in rural infrastructure is under way through various Departments. Certain regions are not receiving a fair share of this development. My Department uses three instruments to redress this imbalance, one of which is the CLÁR programme which front loads development towards the least populated parts of the country, while the others are the Gaeltacht programmes and the islands programmes. If the Deputy wishes, I will get him a list of all the water, sewerage, road schemes and so on which have been developed. As he is aware, they are myriad.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	374	I remind the Minister that replies are subject to a one minute limit.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I ask the Minister to be specific on an issue in which he has a personal interest and for which a more defined structure is required, namely, rural housing. Different per sonnel in different councils currently read the situation differently. An Taisce and other bodies object to rural housing and there are various kinds of special areas in which families are not allowed to build houses. The situation is desperate. Will the Minister give a commitment to introduce or force his colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to introduce specific rules on the issue? Otherwise, the CLÁR programme and other efforts to try to repopulate rural communities being devastated through changes in farming will fail. Communities will collapse and schools, churches and other facilities will no longer be used if we do not introduce a proper structure for rural housing.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I could not concur more with the Deputy. Those who have not lived in a small rural townland – what outsiders consider a group of scattered houses – find it hard to understand the bonds which tie people together in good times and bad and the social cohesion such areas provide. Recently, I did an analysis of the educational achievements in my parish, the results of which were a major triumph and a challenge. It found that an extraordinarily high proportion of the population of the area receives third level education, which shows that the quality of life and opportunities for young people created in such areas are second to none. With young people in these areas doing so well in education, the challenge is to create third level type jobs to enable them to continue to live where they grew up.I continue to view the planning issue as a building block exercise. Following the issuing of the sustainable development guidelines in April 1997, there were arguments about the definition of urban generated housing. Some people argued that all housing, except farm families' housing, was urban generated. The spatial strategy restated, in unequivocal terms, the Government's policy that those with a connection with the countryside should be allowed to build in it. I accept that this message does not appear to have filtered down to ground level in a uniform manner. I am in consultation with my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, to try to achieve a consensus on implementation as opposed to policy which has already been laid down by the Government in the spatial strategy. We are working on a procedure to ensure there is uniform acceptance of the established policy and to define how it will be implemented within the current framework.During my time in the Department of the Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands alongside Deputy de Valera, no one-off rural house was refused solely on SAC grounds and we always managed to accommodate families with a housing need.

Given the devastation brought about in the past six months by the downgrading of rural post offices throughout the country through the failure to provide up-to-date ICT facilities for rural communities, is it not the Minister's responsibility to lay down guidelines on universal provision under the rural development programme and insist that they be followed by other Departments?

In addition, in relation to the facilities referred to by Deputy Boyle, most young and not so young people in rural areas now use ATM cards. I met the bankers' federation regarding the provision of ATM facilities.

Two CAIT programmes were launched under the initiative. These programmes sought to explore ways to provide those excluded from the benefits of information and communications technologies with opportunities to engage with them in a meaningful way. The initiative aimed to harness the experiences and knowledge of the community and voluntary sector to encourage citizens to participate fully in the information society. Funding of €7,444,516 has been committed to 121 projects since the launch of the first CAIT programme in December 2000. The projects funded under the second CAIT programme are coming to an end  and the overall programme will be completed at the end of this month.Because of the pilot nature of CAIT, an evaluation of the impact of the initiative was carried out by WRC, social and economic consultants, to identify learning for policy and practice. The evaluation of the initiative, which occurred alongside its implementation, looked at the experience of organisations in implementing their projects and highlights examples of good practice in relation to outreach, incentivising and supporting participation. It makes extensive use of case study data to highlight examples of good practice. Finally, it assesses the contribution that CAIT has made to understanding the potential role of the community sector in promoting inclusion in the information society, and more generally the initiative's contribution to the development of public policy for such inclusion.Over recent years, information and communication technologies have become more and more a part of everyday life. CAIT brought such technology to those on the margins. I hope that with some refocusing by local groups, the work previously carried out by CAIT can be done within existing structures and resources. The evaluation carried out of the CAIT initiative will be an extremely valuable tool to these groups, and to bodies such as the Information Society Commission, in carrying out this important work in the future.Technology "late adopters" need much more than physical access and financial support to make information technologies an integral part of their lives. The CAIT programme has fostered a change in attitude among members of the most marginalised communities in our society. A strong understanding of their potential to enhance our daily lives and a sense of empowerment and achievement as new skills are acquired have replaced a lack of confidence surrounding the new technologies. This profound change in attitude in some of our most socially isolated communities will be one of the strongest legacies of the CAIT initiative.On a tangible level, the CAIT programme has enabled organisations to purchase IT hardware and software according to the specific needs of their communities. Although the CAIT programme has come to an end, the specialist hardware and software for use by people with a wide range of physical and learning disabilities, including adaptive equipment for the elderly, and an extensive range of literacy and numeracy software, will remain a fully accessible resource within their communities. CAIT has helped to address the burden of equipment and infrastructure costs, one of the key barriers preventing access to information technology. CAIT has provided the tools to empower communities to use information technologies in a way that brings about the maximum practical benefits, for example, as a communication and socialisation tool or an educational and information resource  tool. CAIT has been concerned with usability for all, and not just accessibility.The CAIT initiative has directly led to the development of a pool of highly skilled volunteer tutors, who have an in-depth understanding of the psychological and tangible barriers "late adopters" face in engaging with information technologies. A multiplier effect has been generated as computer literacy skills continue to transfer throughout communities.

While €4.1 million was spent on the scheme last year, only €700,000 will be spent on it this year. This scheme was established to help the elderly, unemployed and disabled to meaningfully use information technology. The Minister has destroyed that opportunity. The Minister's Department funded 121 programmes last year.

That is shameful and disgraceful, especially as it will affect the disadvantaged and those who are excluded from learning about modern technology and communications.

Members will be aware that a number of new CDSPs have been commenced this year. I think the use of such groups is a better way of ensuring a continual turnover of people in these schemes. I accept that there will be a continuing need to upgrade equipment. One of the problems of a limited bid type system is that some win and some lose. We must have a more comprehensive approach to this and I assure the Deputy that I will develop such an approach.

If there is any argument in sustaining rural communities whose physical infrastructure has been undermined, it is advances in the use of information technology. The Minister is being totally inconsistent in overlooking the decline of many rural communities while at the same time pulling the rug from under projects that give people an opportunity of at least maintaining informal contacts with communications systems.The whole point of IT is that people are not given hardware without being helped with further software or ongoing training in the maintenance and use. The approach is like that of using a thimble of petrol to start a car where the car has been left in the middle of nowhere. I urge the Minister to rethink his policy. If he wants to sustain and improve rural communities, he will have to invest in this programme in the years to come.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Given that access to third level education is much lower in deprived urban communities than in rural communities, one would have to put a particular emphasis on the benefit of this programme in urban areas. Because so many young rural people get to third level, computer literacy within families in rural areas is quite high. I sometimes suspect that a son or daughter or grandson or granddaughter typed the letter, but it is obvious that these skills exist within families. That does not happen quite so widely in the more deprived urban communities.I attended a meeting last night of a city partnership which had ongoing computer classes, not connected with CAIT funding. Up to now communities have had to make a pitch for funding. I worry about that because it means the best organised communities benefit most. I would like a more systematic approach to ensure that the most vulnerable communities get equipment, software and continuing training, even if they are not so good at putting a bid together. I am in discussions with my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, on making education funds available for courses in the most disadvantaged areas to ensure a continual roll-out  rather than the fixed-period pilot schemes we had under the CAIT programme. That is critically important. We are examining methods of funding, but I would rather do it through existing developed structures and a large number of partnerships and community development support programmes in the most marginalised communities.There is one other group, the intellectually and physically disabled, about which I am very concerned. We should put a specific focus on and create a special niche for people in this category to ensure they can avail of this type of technology which allows them to communicate in a way that they cannot otherwise do.

However, although we are not told because we are Opposition Deputies, I understood that the Department usually advertises for interest in community type grants at this time of the year.

I accept the Deputy's point. I have often asked the same question and wondered whether putting advertisements in the newspapers is the best way to proceed. It is a pity that Iris Oifigiúil is not as widely available as Buy and Sell in order that all the State advertisements would be in one place. It is very difficult to keep up with all the advertisements and perhaps we should try to find better ways of communication. I have noted that even when provided with information by e-mail, people do receive it because they are so overloaded with e-mails they do not have time to check all of them. We face challenges of communication. From an administrative point of view, there are two ways of creating obfuscation. One is by providing too little information, but an equally lethal way of creating total obfuscation is  by providing too much information, which makes it difficult to find the information one wants.

With an overall objective of maximising the use of resources, the Department is also keen to foster closer liaison with parallel local development bodies and for city and county development boards to endorse plans from these various bodies.As a first step towards achieving this objective, a review of the programmes and activities that fall within the remit of my Department is currently under way. This review seeks to achieve greater coherence across the various initiatives and, through improved delivery structures, to administer programmes that benefit our communities. The views of the relevant parties, including area partnerships, have been sought and will, of course, be considered in the course of this review.As a further step, in the context of drawing up plans for 2003, area partnerships and community groups funded under the local development social inclusion programme have been asked to submit their 2003 work programmes – as approved by ADM – to the relevant city and county development board, CDB, for endorsement. This will allow the CDBs to examine and benchmark the work programmes against their own strategies and thus help to avoid duplication, bring about better co-ordination in service delivery and make the best use of resources.As regards the question of funding arrangements in 2003 for partnerships and community groups, the position remains as I outlined to the House on 27 May last and on a number of other occasions recently.Additional InformationAn amount of €44.6 million has been provided in the Vote of my Department for the local development social inclusion programme this year. This amount represents a decrease of 6% in the amount provided in the Estimates in 2002.Area Development Management Limited manages the programme on behalf of my Department. Allocations from within the budget available for the programme in 2003 were agreed by the board of ADM earlier this year and were subsequently notified to each partnership and community group. As the Deputy will appreciate, ADM must manage the programme from within the budget available in my Department's Vote.The reductions in available funding for 2003 were managed on a sliding scale, ranging from 4% to 7%, depending on the annual budget of the area partnership company or community group. I am aware that some partnership and community groups had the expectation of carryover of previous years' under-spending into 2003. However, my Department operates on an annual cash basis and not on an accrual basis, as do all Departments. Consequently, my Department is not in a position to facilitate a cumulative carryover of under-spending. However, the Deputies should note that ADM is working closely with the partnerships to minimise, as far as possible, the impact of the reductions in funding this year.Finally, I want to acknowledge once again the valuable work being done by partnerships in disadvantaged areas.

The Minister is involved in Iar Connacht in some of these initiatives. A number of partnership and local development bodies were pretty shocked to find this year that the county and city development boards were suddenly introducing protocol and effectively laying down the law and saying that this is how it will be from now on. There does not seem to have been much negotiation between people on the ground and city and county directors who are senior officials in the city and county councils. Has the Minister any plans to try to smooth that out and achieve better integration, bearing in mind that the best community bodies in the partnership and community development areas all have individual local membership and a real feel for what is happening on the ground? If they were to become more bureaucratic, they could end up being less effective.On budgets, will the Minister accept that from now on there will be a rolling three-year budget and that if there are four-year programmes, budgets must be provided to ensure that those programmes are successful?

However, what I cannot  accept, because there is no provision in this House for it, is that I can carry forward money from one year to another. Until we change the way this House finances its own affairs, we cannot do that. I stress that it is much better discipline that those given money in a given year should set about spending that money within the year. Some of the partnerships did that and they have no problem. It is only the partnerships which did not go about their business, and were carrying all the money forward because they were not getting on with things, which thought they would have a bonanza year in year three, not having spent the money.

The Deputy should think logically for a moment. Let us suppose a group is given €50,000 in each of three consecutive years and in year four and subsequent years receives €53,000. It would make a total nonsense of the operation if we allowed a situation to develop whereby if the group spent only €40,000 the first year and €40,000 in the second year, it could spend €70,000 the third year and fall back to €53,000 in the fourth year. An even spend is required, otherwise spending would go up and suddenly come back down. There is no other way of dealing with that. An even spend of money within reason is required one way or another. As I have said time and again, we front-loaded an extra €6 million into the system before Christmas last year to cover matured liability where some of the partnerships had gone ahead with projects. I do not accept what the Deputy says.On the county development board, we should be clear what this is about. The county development board cannot and should not become the creature of the executives who work for it – if it does it defies its own logic. The idea seems to be growing in local authorities and county development boards that the executives are in charge of the board and not the other way around. That is a total inversion of the structures. Any board that allows that to happen is in dereliction of its duty.The county development board is meant to be a partnership of all the interests, of which many also sit on the partnerships. If I was a member of a partnership which had been given the funding allocated this year I would see it as a massive opportunity because I have no doubt that while every county development board plan is full of platitudes and targets for disadvantaged areas in the county some of these are not acted on.Partnerships can examine county development board plans and formulate and justify its own plans based on the county development board's vision, which I am sure encompasses all aspects of dealing with disadvantage. They can challenge and force county development boards to do something about disadvantage rather than providing for it in glowing terms in their plans. I have seen a number of county development plans and came across one which indicated that the Gaeltacht will get everything on the basis of a love for the Irish language and that everything would be done to address disadvantage. However, in some cases rhetoric is much better than action.I see this as a good opportunity for the partnerships to tell county development boards that despite the partnerships acting in line with their plans, the boards complain about it. They must ask the boards what is wrong with the plans or is it the case that the board never meant them to be implemented. It is not a one way process where one party answers to the other, rather it is an opportunity for the partnership, as one of the main agents of dealing with disadvantage in the county, to put it to the county development boards that their plans must be acted on and implemented and that there can be no pious platitudes without action and good works to go with them.

I accept he would like to see some of the partnerships linked, but will he confirm if the funding is guaranteed over the next two to three years?In response to a question by Deputy Ring, the Minister assured him that the partnerships would deal with the fall-out from the destruction of the student jobs scheme, especially in disadvantaged areas. Given their curtailed budgets, how does the Minister expect the partnerships to deliver on that? I draw his attention to a case involving the two sons of a widowed woman who are desperately trying to find jobs but cannot because there is no summer jobs scheme. While there may be plentiful jobs in some areas, there is none in others. What will I tell this widow who has two sons of 20 and 21 years of age at home today because they cannot get work?

I wanted, and asked, the partnerships to act as brokers in locating employment. It is my experience that in most parts of the country there is a huge requirement for seasonal employment, especially in the catering and tourism industries.

That does not take account of all those from other European Union countries who do not need work permits.We are concerned here with third level students. Those who have not had second or third level education are at much greater risk in terms of being unemployed. There should be a greater focus on addressing their needs rather than those of third level students, who, having the advantage of being at third level, are much better placed to secure employment at the minimum wage during the holiday period. The minimum wage offers much better pay than what is available under the summer jobs scheme.

This gives the smallest nation the power to require action at the centre of policy determination, or it could give sectors of society the opportunity to force on to the EU stage measures needed at national level when they have been ignored by their Governments.However, whatever is agreed at the forthcoming Intergovernmental Conference, it will encourage and force Ireland to hold a more realistic debate on its future in Europe, which I welcome. Hitherto, we could have conducted a debate in a vacuum. We could, and did, say "No" to the first draft of the Nice treaty, but for the most part we did not have to live with the consequences. Now, we can say "No" to Europe. The convention provides an opt-out clause. Now we can have a real debate because we have a real choice, to remain as part of the European Union and influence its decisions or say "No" to Europe, mean it and, therefore, choose it.This places great responsibility on all politicians as well as the electorate. As politicians we have a duty to inform ourselves and act as a conduit for that information to the electorate and to do so in an even-handed manner by providing a fair assessment of the pros and cons of what is contained in the constitutional treaty. Part of the problem with Nice was one group telling us it was close to perfect while another issued dire warnings about the outcome. Few had the courage to say there were pluses and minuses which, when considered in the round, would hopefully lead to some balance.The broad agreement on the convention documents and the continued expansion of the Union to the east will require Ireland to rethink its relationship with Europe. Romano Prodi said in Thessaloniki that the EU looked forward to the western Balkans taking up membership of the Union in time while 25 EU leaders promised aid worth €210 million to the region. They see this as promoting peace rather than war and are prepared to use the economic resources of the Union to realise its vision of promoting peace and stability in Europe.The centre of gravity in the EU is moving to the east and towards central Europe. Within a number of years Ireland will become a net contributor. Our commitment to the European vision and our contribution to making it a reality will be tested in forthcoming years. There are interesting times ahead.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	419	The main subject for discussion at Thessaloniki was the new European constitution, as submitted by Mr. Giscard d'Estaing. I welcome the Taoiseach's agreement to hold a debate on the new constitution in the House before the Intergovernmental Conference commences. I wish him, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and the Minister of State, Deputy Roche,  the very best because there is a difficult task ahead. I record also my thanks to my fellow representatives on the Convention, which was a worthwhile and, at times, enjoyable experience. As the previous speaker has said, there are pluses and minuses in all treaties. I was not one of those on the last occasion who issued dire warnings. The Green Party took a measured approach to the Nice treaty and it will continue to act in that fashion. The constitution is more readable and comprehensible than previous treaties and the convention method has established itself as transparent. It is a proven way to operate. The charter of fundamental rights is also a step in the right direction.The Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, has indicated in newspaper reports that the constitution as submitted will be the basis for negotiations at the Intergovernmental Conference. If that is the case, the Minister should bring his negotiating skills to bear in certain areas. I am concerned about Articles 40.3, 40.6 and 40.7. Article 40.3 obliges us to increase our military spending and capabilities, to which I object fundamentally. My party objects in principle. Given the hospital bed shortages and the problems in education, it is indefensible to spend more money on armaments. Articles 40.6 and 40.7 provide us with the opportunity to develop closer and structured military co-operation without a referendum. It should be remembered that closer co-operation can involve mutual defence and the fact that it can happen without a referendum is extremely problematic. It is interesting to note that the new EU security doctrine devised by Javier Solana was unveiled at Thessalonika. It recognises that the EU may have to use force to prevent the construction of weapons of mass destruction and indicates support for pre-emptive strikes.All of this is very familiar and the debacle we are witnessing in Iraq should make it unacceptable. I would have thought people would have had qualms about using this sort of language. It is already there in the solidarity clause. I support the Government amendment on the solidarity clause which refers to prevention of terrorist threats, but does not state that no military adventures may take place outside the territory of the European Union. If we compete militarily with the United States of America, we run the risk of making the same mistakes the US has made. It is a very dangerous road to go down.I would like to see a tightening up of provisions on sustainability. The green eight group in Europe has said that Article 3.3 is not strong enough and I support Margot Wallstrom who has said that we require the attachment to the constitution of a protocol on sustainability. I hope the Minister accepts that. There needs to be more democratic control and accountability in trade negotiations. The World Trade Organisation must become the fair trade organisation.I have not had time to refer to institutional changes. There are a great many issues which will  cause difficulties there. We cannot pretend to be opposed to Sellafield while accepting the EURATOM treaty as a protocol attached to this constitution. It is not acceptable.

No weapons of mass destruction have been found and there is no evidence of their existence. The United Nations inspectors have not been allowed to return despite the fact that it was the alleged non-co-operation of Iraq with them that was used to justify the war. The head of the weapons inspection team, Dr. Hans Blix, has been sharply critical of the way the process was abused by the US and British governments. The illegal military occupation of Iraq is descending into repression, civil strife and guerrilla warfare.The main focus of the summit was foreign policy and much was made of the agreement reached in the wake of divisions in the EU during the invasion of Iraq. The Council concluded that the development of trans-Atlantic relations on an equal footing remains of fundamental importance in every domain, not only for the two sides, but for the international community. However, the trans-Atlantic relationship is on anything but an equal footing. The British joined the US invasion regardless of differences with their EU partners and the Bush and Blair governments rode roughshod over the United Nations and disregarded opposition in Europe.Instead of carrying out the necessary reformation and strengthening of the United Nations, the European Union leaders took another major step in Greece towards the militarisation of the EU. They are attempting to create a political and military power bloc in a futile effort to balance the power of the United States of America. The Government should have no part in this process as has been stated here time and time again. However, the Taoiseach and his fellow EU leaders agreed to establish in 2004 an intergovernmental agency in the field of defence capabilities, development research, acquisition and armaments. It is planned to develop defence capabilities in the field of crisis management, to promote and enhance European armaments co-operation, to strengthen the European defence industrial and technological base and to create a competitive European defence equipment market. It is a disgrace that the Irish Government was party to this agreement.The draft European Union Constitution which emerged from the convention and which was presented to EU leaders in Greece proposes to establish a European armaments agency, the basis of a European military-industrial complex. This is contrary to our belief that multilateral disarmament, particularly multilateral nuclear disarmament, should be a central goal of Ireland and the European Union. In Greece, the Council  agreed to a process of negotiation of the draft constitution at an intergovernmental conference, while at the same meeting it pre-empted this process by establishing an intergovernmental defence agency. There is no question that this is the case but this is not a people's process. The demand for an EU constitution and the transformation of the EU from a partnership of states to a single state does not come from the people. It is driven by a political and bureaucratic elite. It is widely accepted that there needs to be simplification and consolidation of existing EU treaties, but that should not be used to advance the superstate project.The Government has already taken the people for granted in much of this just as they did in the context of the Nice treaty. I assure the Minister of State, Deputy Roche, that we will not allow the Government to do so in the issue of this proposed constitution.

The creation of the post of president of the Council, which I acknowledge the smaller countries oppose, including Ireland, represents a shift of power from the Commission to the Council. Does the Minister accept that this is part of a process and that, like the process initiated at the time of the Amsterdam treaty with the creation of a high representative which has now led to double hatting and the creation of a Minister for Foreign Affairs, at some point in the future there could be a single president, which is the wish of many of the bigger states? Does this cause the Minister concern and will he raise it in the Intergovernmental Conference?Will the Minister outline in detail the Government's position on the EURATOM Treaty? This is of importance to the Green Party. Will the Minister make it clear in the Intergovernmental Conference that attaching the EURATOM Treaty as a protocol is unacceptable to the Irish Government? With regard to defence issues, what is the bottom line of the Irish Government? The Finnish Government has outlined its bottom line. It is prepared to accept enhanced co-operation in the area of defence—

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I will take all the questions asked, both by the leaders of the parties and the recent specific questions. I will be as quick as possible so there will be time for further questions.I am grateful to Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte, Harkin, John Bruton and Gormley for their kind remarks. I also pay tribute to Proinsias De Rossa and Deputies John Bruton, Gormley, Carey and my alternate, Mr. Bobby McDonagh. We worked extremely well as a team. It was a novelty for a government to leave the two lead positions in the parliamentary tier to opposition members. It was a good idea and it worked extremely well.Deputy Kenny and other speakers were correct to point out that the convention has reached a positive point. It is a positive development. We have worked through a novel process and I agree with Deputy Gormley about the openness of the new way of doing business. It is a far better way. This point was also made by Deputies Kenny, John Bruton and Harkin. It is a more public process than the classical form of holding treaty negotiations in secret. It is a better process and the way of the future.Deputy Kenny asked about the evolution of a common foreign and security policy. He also mentioned the European security and defence policy, as did other speakers. I will deal with specific questions in that area later. With regard to the common foreign and security policy, I agree with the point he implicitly made that there should be more clarity on this than there has been heretofore. I do not take the view, which was implicit in Deputy Gormley's comments, that the concept of an EU Foreign Minister is inherently bad. I would have a quibble with the title; Deputy Gormley is aware that I thought there should be a more appropriate title. However, the idea is welcome.The new post will create more coherence and more visibility for the Union's external relationships. That cannot but be positive. That is not to suggest, to take up Deputy Ó Caoláin's point, that Europe should be a counterpoint, in terms of being a world power, to the United States. Europe should never aspire to being a world power. However, Europe is a significant economic giant in the world and it is perverse and odd that it does not have clear external representation. That would be the positive outcome of this. We would be anxious that the Union Minister for Foreign Affairs should not chair the External Affairs Council meeting. The reason we have given is that the Union Foreign Minister must be answerable to the Council. That issue will be discussed in the Intergovernmental Conference. It is not the biggest issue for us but it is a big issue for others.Deputy Kenny also referred to neutrality and the evolution of the European security and defence policy. Deputy Kenny is aware of my view that the EU has a long way to go before it has a coherent security and defence policy. There is nothing in the convention that trespasses on or challenges the right of a member state to pursue a policy of neutrality or non-alignment. Deputy Kenny pointed out that a debate is needed on the issue of neutrality and I acknowledge the Fine Gael initiative in opening such a debate. I am firmly wed to the traditional Irish approach but I accept that others take a different view. It is time to have that debate and I hope it will be open, transparent, non-hysterical and will focus on facts.I have complimented the role of Deputy John Bruton and his extraordinary energy. He raised a general point about global security and the role the EU must play. He also commented on the different visions that inform the European approach and that of the United States. Deputy Ó Caoláin was not present when Deputy Bruton made that point but it is a vital point. If Deputy Ó Caoláin examines what he said he will see that his interpretation, particularly of the Solana view, is wrong. What Deputy Bruton is saying and what is suggested in the Solana paper is that there should be a concept of positive pre-emptive engagement. It is close in terminology but a world away in fact from the US approach. Deputy Bruton illustrated this well in his contribution. There is a polarity between the American approach of a pre-emptive right to strike and the approach suggested by Solana, an approach which Deputies Gormley and Ó Caoláin would actually support.The pre-emptive engagement suggested by Solana is engagement in helping to build democracy, to create good governance and societies which are based on justice and democratic principles. Every Member of this House would espouse such aims and would hope that Europe would develop in that direction. The language lends itself to misinterpretation but Members should read the Solana paper. A number of Deputies had difficulty getting it but it is available on the web or I can make it available to them. It requires a degree of quiet reflection.Deputy Rabbitte asked about ECAP. ECAP means the European capabilities action plan and is an aspect of the development of a common foreign and defence policy through which the Union focuses on a range of humanitarian, peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. ECAP is intended as a process to try and remedy shortfalls in capabilities. One can take a negative or positive view of this. I prefer to take the positive view. If Europe is to be engaged in any form of peacekeeping, peace making or humanitarian activities, it makes sense to have an efficient and effective way of doing so. ECAP is not in any way threatening.Deputy Rabbitte also asked if there will be a Green Paper or White Paper on this issue. We should be looking at ways of engaging the public  in a wider debate. Two Deputies asked if the forum will continue. It will. There was some criticism of the fact that the forum does not get enough attention in the media. In fact, I am not sure we can engage in such a debate without the Fourth Estate being actively supportive of that role. Deputies and Senators in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs have given a great deal of time to this, yet they do not get an inch of space. That is regrettable because there is a responsibility on all political sides to communicate but if the fourth estate, the print or electronic media, refuses to carry the communication, it is very difficult. In the initial phase we should continue the ongoing public and parliamentary process. I have already said to the party leaders that I would be willing to meet with them and discuss the issues further because the parties need briefing and I am available for that, and although people's time is pressurised we should look at that. The idea of a Green Paper or White Paper should come a little later in the process, particularly when we are approaching completion of the Intergovernmental Conference.Deputy Rabbitte also asked about the reference to fundamentalism and terrorism. The report has yet to be considered in detail by the council but it was commissioned to examine the impact of the developments in those areas and how Europe can take a more studied view rather than give a hysterical knee-jerk reaction. Deputy Gormley touched on the issue of the Intergovernmental Conference and the future of the convention, as did Deputy Rabbitte. The convention's great success was that it was open, transparent and was a completely different way of doing business. I would like to see, in so far as it is possible, that type of openness and transparency carried over to the Intergovernmental Conference. I also agree with Deputy John Bruton's comment that the Intergovernmental Conference will not be able to unpick much of the good work that has been done in the Convention.Deputy Harkin made an insightful contribution and I am grateful to her. She spoke about the benefits of a single treaty and a single clear text, and she is absolutely right. I agree especially that the use of the word "constitution" in the title may well confuse people. She also made a very realistic observation that this is a treaty which will be ratified by states—

Perhaps the Minister of State would like to answer them after we hear two more questions but we are rapidly running out of time. If he answers your three questions now, it will be time to move on to the next business so I propose to give Deputies Bruton and Ó Caoláin an opportunity to submit brief questions.
#JohnBruton	unknown-#JohnBruton-party	unknown-#JohnBruton-dob	unknown-#JohnBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	432	First, in regard to the proposed annual report on migration and integration of immigrants, which I heartily welcome, will the Minister of State elaborate on exactly what this is likely to contain? Second, in regard to the EU west Balkans initiative, which is an extremely important part of building democracy in the remaining unstable area of the Union, is the Minister of State satisfied that there will be adequate funds available for that? I have read some suggestions to the effect that it is under-funded or is liable to be so. Third, in regard to the issue of services of general economic interest, would the Minister of State agree that this term is extremely vague but that it represents a genuine issue of certain basic services which should be available, regardless of geographic considerations or the means of recipients. Would the Minister of State agree that further work might be done in the Intergovernmental Conference on refining this concept in order that it could be recognised even though it was not recognised by the convention?On the extradition treaty with the US, which I understand is under negotiation – the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may be helpful in his presence here – how is it to be assured that people, once extradited to the US, will not find themselves liable to the death penalty? Although assurances will be given before extradition, if further charges, for example, are preferred against them, which carry the death penalty, will the extradition warrant exclude the death penalty even in the case of such charges? Finally, would the Minister of State agree that there is a lacuna in our work in the convention in the matter of how sectoral councils are to be co-ordinated, given that the president of the European Council will not co-ordinate the line councils for good reason? Is the Minister of State satisfied from his experience that the General Affairs Council would be able to do this job given that it has a poor record and a poor level of attendance by Ministers? Will it be able to co-ordinate line councils adequately?

This agency would address and develop defence capabilities in the field of crisis management, promoting and enhancing European armaments co-operation, strengthening the European defence industrial and technological base and creating a competitive European defence equipment market. Did the Irish Government oppose that during the course of the summit and, if not, why not?Does the Minister of State agree that the decision taken at Thessalonika pre-empts the proposal in the draft EU constitution to establish the European armaments agency and what is the Government's view of that proposal? Does he agree with me that the EU should have nothing to do with the establishment of a military industrial complex?
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Perhaps the only point on which I agree with Deputy Ó Caoláin is that we should not be developing an industrial military complex. Nothing is further from the intentions of the proposal. Deputy Gormley asked several questions which I did not answer. The specific institutional question was whether we are witnessing a shift in power in the creation of an EU Council president and the answer is that we are not. Deputy Gormley and I discussed this at length during the course of the convention. He knows my views on the matter; what has been created is much closer to the chairmanship role which is currently played within the rotating presidency and does not in any way violate the balance.

That is certainly protected. I disagree with Deputy Gormley that there is no obligation whatsoever to increase defence spending. The EU needs capabilities in the area of the Petersberg Tasks. Armaments co-operation or co-operation in securing interoperability is far from a sinister development. If we are going to put our troops into the field to assist in UN-mandated operations, as we will from time to time, it is clearly sensible that there should be interoperability between them and other people in the field. It would be a threat to the lives and welfare of those young men and women if we did not do that. That is quite a nonsensical view of the issue.

I answered the question already on the European capabilities action plan and Deputy Ó Caoláin asked me a separate question on it. This is an aspect of the development of security and defence policy through which the Union is focused on a range of humanitarian peacekeeping and crisis management tasks. It is not a sinister development, as the Deputy suggests, nor is it new. It did not arise out of Thessalonika because the idea was launched as far back as the Council meeting in 2001. It might be worthwhile revisiting the question. I am wide open for discussion on any issue with any of the party leaders.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	447	I am at least as interested in peace, security and harmony in Europe as Deputy Ó Caoláin, and my interest in that goes back a long way. Deputy John Bruton asked about the western Balkans. There were Commission proposals before the meeting of the European Council in Thessalonika regarding funding. The feeling is that the funding put in place is adequate. Extradition to the United States is an issue which I would like to pass over to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I believe that the agreement is on the basis that the death penalty cannot apply. I may be wrong, but I will check.

#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I apologise. In that regard, my understanding is that it certainly cannot be reversed after the event. There were several other questions. I dealt with openness and transparency.Deputy Ó Caoláin dealt with another point, the question being whether the creation of an EU agency might only encourage an arms race against the US. I have mentioned the logic of  some sort of common procedures. There is certainly no reason why that should create an arms race against the United States. There are economies of scale. The developments on arms, far from being sinister, are pragmatic. The general question was also asked about the background for arms co-operation in the EU. Co-operation in that area has a fairly long history, but it is outside the EU treaty, and it makes sense to move in the same direction as the Community.Deputy Gormley raised a final question, also about the solidarity clause. Our response to the proposed treaty articles in the area has confirmed that we are open in principle to the possibility of a solidarity clause, and we discussed that at length. The issue was the subject of submissions from me during the course of the convention. We do not believe that the solidarity clause should extend to pre-emptive military activity, which I think was the Deputy's specific point. We certainly do not see it in those terms. As has been underlined, the idea is that, in the event of an emergency, the Union would be in a position to mobilise all its assets and call on those of its member states, both civilian and military. It is very much in keeping with our own tradition. In principle, Austria, Finland and Sweden, for example, have already indicated—

I hope that he does not carry on as he did yesterday, laughing and sniggering at everyone on this side of the House. When I was in school, there was only one place for the sniggering people, and that was the backbenches. Deputy Ring said that was where the Minister should be, since he has failed in his job over the past 12 months. There are still people of 14 and 15 years of age out on the streets falling round drunk, and the Minister has done nothing on the issue, except talk endlessly. As Deputy Ring said yesterday, the Minister has been on every radio station in Dublin and around the country saying  what he will do, without acting on one bit of it. I think everyone on this side of the House would agree with me.The Minister talks about the ID card system.

I make regular night-time visits to pubs and clubs, and the number of young people getting into them is unbelievable. They are being allowed to drink alcohol between the ages of 14 and 16. Perhaps parents allow their youngsters to go out now at that age, but it is terrible that the Minister has not done one thing to introduce a proper ID card system. I know that it is a very difficult task, but currently young people can trace or copy any sort of ID in existence. If the Minister wishes to come up with some serious proposals, he has the job, the resources and the people to do so. However, he has failed.Deputy Ring spoke about having young people out of pubs by 9 p.m. I disagree with the rule that when people holiday in the west of Ireland or in my own county of Wexford and have a meal with an under-age child, they must be out of the pub by 9 p.m. I ask the Minister to explain how he came up with such a proposal. He will have to look into it, for it will seriously damage our tourism trade. I know that Deputy Deenihan will speak on that too.There are many matters on which I would like to speak, and CCTV cameras are important in Wexford. On the main street of Wexford, there has been a great deal of vandalism, crime and young people brawling. Not enough money has been put into CCTV cameras. One must invest to stop the crime on our streets, and CCTV cameras are the only thing that will do that. I do not want to see gardaí going around like tourists with video cameras trying to do the job of a CCTV camera. There are not enough gardaí on our streets. The Minister promised an extra 2,000, and I would like to see where they are. We cannot have gardaí going round with video cameras trying to film what is going on. They have enough of a job guarding our streets and ensuring that they are safer for everyone.Some of the Deputies on the other side of the House, including Deputy Andrews, spoke about young people drinking. There is only one reason that they have such drinking habits: there are not enough amenities for them. This Government is not investing enough money in youth organisations to bring amenities to rural and urban Ireland to stop young people from drinking on the streets by ensuring that they have plenty to do. We suffer from a lack of resources for younger people. When they do not have anything to do between the ages of 14 and 16, they go out and binge drink.The Minister has failed over the last 12 months in the job which he was supposed to do. I ask him to get out on the streets at night and see exactly what is happening. If he did, he would know the true story and be able to react to it.

#JimmyDeenihan	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-party	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-dob	unknown-#JimmyDeenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	464	At the launch of the Fine Gael action plan on alcohol abuse on 15 April, Deputy Kenny stated:We need action on alcohol abuse that is not simply concerned with issues like competition, price and choice. Instead, we need action that safeguards public health, ensures the law is upheld, protects families and strengthens communities. We must ensure that children know the dangers of addiction, that young people take responsibility for their behaviour and all of us are aware of the consequences of our actions.That just about sums up our approach to the whole issue. It is about more than law or law enforcement. The whole package must be cross-departmental, and there must be an overall approach to the problem. The Department of Education and Science has a critical role to play. The health education programme in schools is ad hoc and there is no continuity. Usually what happens is that an expert on alcohol or drug abuse is brought in and the programme ceases thereafter. The message about the dangers or the over-use of alcohol is not reinforced each day or each week. It is a major health issue, yet the Department of Health and Children and the health boards are not doing enough to emphasise the damage drink is causing to all the population and especially to young people.One of the reasons the Minister is here today is because of the statistics for drunkenness and associated crime and the reaction to what is happening on our streets at night. Last year, I conducted a survey on public order in Tralee. It was clear from the parents who responded that they were concerned about the safety of their young people on the streets at night. In his response to the survey, the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, said it was balderdash but the people in Tralee knew better and it has become  a major issue there. According to preliminary Garda figures for 2002, there are 25 assaults on our streets every night, representing a total number of more than 9,000 per year. The Garda had to deal with 33,792 cases of public drunkenness and 22,404 cases of threatening or abusive behaviour. Alcohol-associated crime is up 50% in one year. Some 42,755 offences of public disorder were committed in 2001, compared with 16,384 in 1996, an increase of 161%. I am sure the number of offences has increased during the past two years. Statistics show that drink-related crime and public disorder are on the increase. The Bill is a response but it must go further.The Minister will be aware of the media reaction to his proposals and newspaper headlines to the effect that the liquor laws are not being enforced so the Minister decides to introduce further legislation; that the liquor licensing Bill is a wash-out; and alcohol abuse is bringing Ireland to its knees. Enforcement is crucial, as numerous speakers have mentioned. As it stands, the law could be effective but it is not being enforced.The Minister will be familiar with Dr. Anne Hope's commentary on the legislation. Dr. Anne Hope who is the national policy adviser at the Department of Health and Children said alcohol consumption has been increasing steadily since 1990, to such an extent that Ireland had a really wet culture when it came to drink. Irish people consume 11.4 litres of pure alcohol per head each year. The amount consumed per head in 1990 was eight litres. This increase has occurred here while consumption levels have decreased in other EU states. Dr. Hope agreed with all the legislative measures being proposed but said they would be pointless if not rigorously enforced. She also said they should be implemented as simultaneously as possible and that existing laws were not enforced with sufficient rigour. For example, a law which provides that a person should not be served alcohol if they are already drunk is not being enforced. Asked which was the top measure which would reduce alcohol related problems, she said enforcement of that law would cut down on the level of drunkenness on our streets, particularly at weekends. Enforcement is a major issue.I realise more expansive legislation is coming before the House next year when the Minister will codify the entire liquor licensing law. Perhaps the Minister would define what constitutes a drunken person. On what criteria can a bar proprietor or bar worker decide a person is drunk? It is a subjective matter. Depending on a person's drinking experience, he or she may be able to consume varying amounts of liquor. A bar person cannot say he will not serve a customer because he thinks the customer is drunk. When is it definitive that a person is drunk?While local authorities are seeking that powers be devolved to them, I do not see this provision working in local authorities. I will continue to be a member of a local authority for the next few months and I foresee problems with issues such as planning. Adjudication on exemptions could  prove complex. Will the Minister explain how this provision will be put in place?As spokesperson on tourism, I wish to raise two issues, the concerns from the Irish Hotels Federation and other groups. In the past, these people have responded to changes in the law and to the tourist industry. The first issue of concern to them is the ban on children accompanied by parents or guardians from the bar area of a hotel after 9 p.m. and the obligation on everyone under 21, unless accompanied by parents or guardians, to carry valid evidence of age while in the bar area of an hotel or licensed premises after 9 p.m.. The Minister has received an amendment to this proposal. While I agree with the legislation being put in place, a tight regime is required if we are to win the battle against alcohol abuse. I would listen carefully to what those people have to say as they have genuine concerns. If there is some way of making provision on a premises where young people can be close to the bar and where the parents might be able to get drink from the bar, but in a different part of the premises, this should be done.Those under 21 travelling from the UK and other countries to matches and other sporting events here who may not have identification with them will face major problems. This will be especially the case with people from the UK because there is no passport arrangement and they may have no identification. I foresee that issue leading to a bureaucratic nightmare. Perhaps the Minister will respond to these issues.

#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	467	We need to face the facts regarding the abuse of alcohol and other substances. We have a massive problem arising from the abuse of alcohol. The problem manifests itself in many ways: social, medical, financial and so on. We cannot continue to bury our heads in the sand and deny the problem exists. Those involved in education say young people come to school with a hangover while those in the health care area are well aware of the problems which arise, particularly at accident and emergency units. That used to be a Saturday night difficulty but now it is happening on Thursdays, Fridays, Saturdays and Sundays. The problem also affects the health care area.A story in my local newspaper last week concerned a consultant giving evidence about 14 to 16 year olds in hospital after drinking binges who were either self-damaged or battered. The first case concerned a 14 year old boy who was waiting for his mother outside the disco. He was abused by an older teenager who had consumed three bottles of wine and a bottle of vodka. We must try to deal with this crazy situation.The Oireachtas should compliment RTE on the programmes it has shown recently to highlight  this problem. Many members of the public were disturbed to see young people lying comatose on the streets or hospital floors as a result of consuming liquor. The cameras did not lie. Without the evidence of the camera, many people would argue that the problem is being exaggerated. We have heard that in the past. It was the knee-jerk reaction of many over the years. Until we accept that we have a serious problem, nothing will be done about it. When we accept the truth, we will be able to try to rectify the problem.I am also concerned about the reaction of contributors to this debate. Some people have tried to ridicule many of the Bill's proposals. Deputy Deenihan adopted the fairest approach of all of the Opposition contributors I have heard so far when he stated that he would support the legislation. Others have tried to ridicule it. Whether it concerned the involvement of local authorities or the identification of off-licence suppliers, they gave examples of how it would not work. Some of last night's contributions were off the wall.All the proposals in the legislation emanated from the Commission on Liquor Licensing. It is the commission's proposals that are being ridiculed, not the Minister's.

#JohnDennehy	unknown-#JohnDennehy-party	unknown-#JohnDennehy-dob	unknown-#JohnDennehy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Using the commission to have a go at the Minister, as happened last night, will not help to deal with the problem.I am also concerned by the reaction of some interest groups, be they off-licence operators, club owners or hoteliers, to any suggestion of action being taken. Over the years, they have seemed content to blame each other. The bottom line is that all of them will be affected if we do nothing. Having said that, I understand the concerns of hoteliers on the legislation. The Minister outlined yesterday the definition of a bar and the exclusion of other parts of a hotel. This area needs further examination on Committee Stage. The Minister should examine the information that has been presented in this regard.Some people have expressed concern that the proposed legislation will have a negative effect on tourism. I am concerned that if we do not do something quickly about the problem, tourists will be afraid to visit the country. This is not a figment of my imagination. Any good, efficient foreign travel agent will look at what is happening here and advise potential tourists of difficulties. It is up to us to clean up our act and get it right, at least on the liquor abuse situation. I do not suggest that all of our social problems are drink related but drink has a huge impact in many instances.Some previous speakers were critical of the Minister for some provisions and also for some things that were omitted. They must be aware that the major changes needed will be included in the 2004 codification Bill. Many issues need to be addressed. The codification Bill will have the opportunity to rectify any imperfections that may  arise from this one. I accept that we made a serious mistake when we extended drinking hours in the recent past. I include myself in those who accepted those changes but, in our defence, we believed one of its results would be to do away with the scoffing down of three, four or five drinks in the last quarter of an hour of drinking-up time. We got that wrong, as has been proved since. We need to redress that situation.It has also emerged, whether people are side-tracking the issue or using it for another agenda, that there is conflict between parts of the Equality Act and the liquor law requirements. The requirement to run a bar in a particular way and the difficulty arising from not having the right to refuse admission can make a publican's life impossible. A publican has a huge responsibility and must be helped in every way possible. It is becoming more difficult to run a drinks supply business, whether an off-licence or any other. We must support any changes required.Many changes are proposed in this legislation. Although the Minister has been accused of doing nothing in the past 12 months there seems to be little appetite among the Opposition, with the exception of Deputy Deenihan, for the changes proposed here. I know there are interest groups out there which try to pressurise everybody. However, we must be responsible and accept that we have a problem.Recently I was told, when I accepted part of the responsibility for the extension of hours and the new difficulties it created, by a spokesperson for one of the drinks federations that I was too old to become involved in this area and did not know what was happening down town. I was told I was living in cloud cuckoo land. I invited him to attend the accident and emergency ward of Cork University Hospital on any given night. He informed me that the group had a great arrangement with the local Garda Superintendent and that everything was slap-happy. By coincidence, the city council had a meeting the following Monday with the same Garda Superintendent. He could not believe what I repeated to him.Cork City Council is trying to work with gardaí and Cork has given a lead on this issue. One of my colleagues, Deputy O'Flynn, was responsible for the introduction of by-laws to control drinking on the streets. This was successful and is now being copied by other towns and cities. A number of colleagues have also asked for the details. We cannot cure all the ills but we have a responsibility to do whatever we can.There are signs that some good is being done. I received information in the post this morning from MEAS, a group which promotes responsible drinking. They sent me eight questions and I am sure many people would have difficulty in answering more than half honestly as they would give stereotypical answers. MEAS and the No Name Clubs encourage the kind of action that is required. We must encourage people not to start drinking until they are older. Anybody over the  age of 18 is entitled to make up his or her mind but anybody under that age needs encouragement to abstain until they are older.People often quote the Italian or French regimes where people are taught to drink moderately and responsibly at home from a young age. That is a different culture. We could probably point out many areas in which we are better than the French, Italians or anybody else. Our culture is different. Unfortunately, the abuse of alcohol is deeply embedded in our culture. The only change is that the number involved in the past was lower. We have had difficulties regarding liquor laws since the time when a person could drive three or four miles from town and drink to his or her heart's content. This Bill repeals laws which are 170 years old, which just proves how we have failed to come to grips with the issue over the years.This Minister is making a genuine attempt to address the problems. My one concern is in regard to hotels. Some of my own constituents have said that if one was dealing with a wedding party, all the children would have to be thrown out at 9 p.m. I told them I thought few wedding parties would be held in the bar of a hotel. However, I appreciate that hotels set up bars, according to their definition of a bar. If they set up a bar of any type and drink is served across the counter, children have to be removed. It would be a pity if this Bill was badly received simply because of issues concerning the running of hotels. People were wrong to label the Minister as being anti-family simply because they had a problem with this. A much more positive approach could have been taken and they could have come forward in a more constructive fashion and put proposals. They are doing so now, but they got it wrong at the outset.We could examine a plethora of areas which need change. However, we must implement the laws. Other Deputies have argued that more education is needed. That goes without saying and we are putting money into that area. We are the legislators and this Bill is about the abuse of alcohol, particularly and specifically by young people and we would be failing in our duty if we did not support it. The Bill is correct, with the one exception I have outlined. There is a difficulty with club owners with regard to alcohol being consumed within 100 metres of a premises. Much of the difficulty can be traced back to off-licence involvement. All sections of the drinks trade have a responsibility. Some Deputies referred to the fact that older people bought drink for young people. That is now in the past because the Minister has provided for such people to be made responsible and prosecuted. That is the reason for putting the label on drink in order that it can be traced back to a particular off-licence.

#JoeCallananFF	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-party	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-dob	unknown-#JoeCallananFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	472	I welcome this Bill and congratulate the Minister for bringing it to the House and for the fine work he has done since becoming Minister. I especially welcome identity cards for young people under 21 years of age. This measure is badly needed because under-age drinking must not be allowed to continue. Improvements will come from the new penalties on publicans and parents. I welcome the new penalties for publicans who continue to serve drink to people who are already drunk. It is about time this legislation was introduced. The problem of our drink culture is a serious one. Everything revolves around the pub and excessive drinking is causing significant problems in society. The accident and emergency units of our hospitals are busy every weekend with drink-related problems. Many parents and spouses stay awake at night worrying if their sons, daughters or spouses will come home safely from the pub, if at all.The Bill has not gone far enough as regards off-licences. Many off-licences have signs advertising that they are open until 11 p.m. or 11.30 p.m. This gives every opportunity for young people to buy cans and drink them later. These off-licences should be closed whenever the shop itself closes at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. I fully support and praise the people who have organised the No Name Clubs and the gardaí who have worked hard to ensure that they work as they should. I welcome the earlier closing hours on Thursday nights and feel that closing times for the rest of the weekend should be strictly implemented since they are probably too late at the moment. The onus for closure must be on the publicans since it is not possible for the gardaí to check every pub every night.I have concerns about serving people cocktails of drink which served together can contain very high levels of alcohol. Some of these drinks can be dangerous. The section of the Bill which does not allow children into hotels after 8 p.m. needs clarification. Children, properly supervised by parents, should have access to hotels where food is served after 8 p.m.If the whole drink culture is to change, we need to come up with entertainment that is better and more attractive than drink. We need to conduct urgent research to this end. We should support all the sporting bodies which are trying to keep people out of pubs. I commend the Bill to the House.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	473	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2003. I have a slightly different view on the debate. It is one from which all sides of the House can learn, rather than use as an opportunity to ridicule or attack personalities. Rather, the  debate is about this Bill and that is what we should focus on.While I welcome the debate on the issue of alcohol and abuse, this Bill is not well thought out and lacks real substance in dealing with the issue. The Bill is anti-youth, anti-children, anti-family and anti-common sense. The Bill claims to be concerned with combating drunkenness and disorderly conduct as well as addressing the problems of under-age and binge drinking. We all agree that we have a major problem and that urgent reforms are needed before we pass more laws that the vast majority of people know will not be enforced. We need to look at causes and come up with creative ideas about binge drinking and under-age drinking.It is wrong to blame all our young people and other adults who drink in a moderate manner and obey the laws of the land. We are too quick to label people and, at the same time, allow the anti-social elements set the agenda on this issue. We should always remind ourselves that they are a minority which needs to be tackled. However, to blame all sections of society in such a manner is a recipe for disaster.I strongly disagree with section 10 and the amendment of prohibited hours on Thursdays. It is time to grow up. I do not want to live in a nanny state. I have listened to all the views on this issue and I am more determined to oppose the sections of the Bill which are not rooted in common sense. Anti-social behaviour is a community and policing issue and must be dealt with in such a manner. Throwing people onto the streets at the same time is a recipe for disaster. We need to stagger our closing times.Section 12 on drinking-up time is off the wall. For me, it is a matter of personal choice. We all know that the vast majority of people behave in a responsible manner coming out of pubs and clubs at different times. We need full co-operation between the publicans, the night-clubs and the Garda. If clubs are allowed to stay open later, until the streets are cleared from the pubs, they will have a significant input into the problem of public disorder. We need supervision and control. I have met with publicans and night-club owners over the last few days and, having had a cynical view, I found them to be reasonable people, as opposed to the cowboys many people think they are. They too want a proper legislative base. They want top-quality public safety and responsible leisure activities, something with which I am sure the Minister agrees. People who get involved in binge drinking have a deeper problem. The way to deal with this is through educational and personal development and support at an early age. We have to look at the person, the issues of self esteem and male aggression in society. If we do not tackle these issues, we are going nowhere in this debate. The message from an early age has got to be of respect and awareness of the dangers of alcohol with the continued emphasis on moderation. This is done in other countries, so there is no reason  it cannot be done here. Bringing it in in any state is not part of the solution.I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to look again at aspects of this Bill. He must show a common sense approach and then we all win. I do not blame the Minister for all the ills in society and neither do I blame all bar staff. The blame lies with the individual and his responsibilities. People make choices and let us zone in on the reason they have made bad choices, whether through binge drinking or kicking someone to death on the ground. It is a problem for the community, for the family and policing and justice. That is the way we must tackle this issue.On the question of justice, we have seen today the tragic case of a disgraceful verdict with regard to a man being kicked to death. I understand the hurt and the anger of the family in that particular case and I give them my support. They feel they did not get justice.I worked in inner city Dublin for 20 years, where most of the kids came from some of the poorest backgrounds. Despite the massive poverty and disadvantage, 85% of them did not get involved in drugs, binge drinking or anti-social behaviour. It does not take a social scientist to see why. The reason is, despite the poverty, the social disadvantage and the negative surroundings, the family unit was solid and the extended family was supportive. The 15% that got involved in binge drinking and drugs came from dysfunctional family backgrounds. We can all learn from good parenting and quality family units. By family unit, I mean all sorts as there were many forms of it in the school where I worked. The key point was that if the parents were solid, in single or double family units, the children came to school, did their work and got on with their lives. These solid parents taught me a lesson which is one wider society should learn.It is not all bad news. We have problems and we need a response. However, I urge the Minister to consider some of the ideas I have put forward. Deputy Dennehy referred to the excellent project in Cork city where two or three nights a week, 1,200 under-age people are brought together in an alcohol-free disco. It is supervised and policed properly between the club and the Garda. This project has proved a major success and delivered necessary services to young people.I disagree with Deputy Dennehy when he refers to our pub culture as the basis of the problem. We can have an impact on our culture and alcohol consumption. If one is brought up among a family or neighbours who are moderate drinkers – I am one – and made aware of the danger of alcohol, one will learn positively from that. The French have given us an example of this. From the day children enter pre-school, they are given this sense of civic responsibility. They are taught this in pre-school to junior infants, right up to society. When I was sitting on a beach on Bastille Day with thousands of teenagers, there were no  bottles, cans or anti-social behaviour, just people enjoying themselves. This is the ethos we should foster and learn from. When we talk about republicanism, that kind of civic republicanism is the way forward. I urge the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to consider my views.

Suffice to say there are many aspects to the Bill that are agreeable. I have no problems with sections 20 and 21. Section 17 is not particularly enforceable, but I have no problem with it. I acknowledge that in his speech the Minister alluded to the forthcoming codification Bill. He also acknowledged that the Ministers for Transport and Health and Children will both bring in legislation that will tie in with drink-driving and alcohol advertising and sponsorship. However, it is a long time coming and I hope it comes soon.This Bill is a holding exercise and it has several flaws. I am saying this to be constructive and not get back at the Minister for accusing me of having constituency envy in a previous speech. I will do that another time as this is a more important issue we are discussing. Section 14 on the 9 p.m. ruling raises a number of issues. Although the definition of a "bar" is taken from the Intoxicating Liquor Act 1988, the issue of what constitutes a "bar" is crucial. If one has a function room with a bar, then one cannot have people of a certain age after 9 p.m. even though it is primarily a function room. I point this out in my capacity as spokesperson on tourism but also in the context of families who attend weddings in hotels. Many hotels make their profits out of these types of functions where the function room doubles up as a bar. It is not unreasonable to have under-age people in a function room with a bar given the large number of responsible parents there. This section needs to be looked at again.I refer to section 9 and the one chance rule where the Minister does not believe even one chance should be given. If the rule is broken that should be it. Obviously, the introduction of new rules will have teething problems. This is an issue of enforcement. If someone makes a mistake once, it is pointed out. If there is stringent enforcement then he or she will not get away with it the second time. It is not a matter of pubs feeling they will get away with it the first time because, as in many cases relating to the law in this State, then they feel they will get away with it numerous times. However, if there is proper stringent enforcement, then the one chance rule should remain.With regard to section 10 on Thursday night closing time, I do not agree with the Commission on Liquor Licensing on this or the Minister's use of it in the Bill. As Deputy Finian McGrath said, it is a social issue where people should have personal responsibility. Why people get drunk and engage in violence is not impacted on by Thursday night closing time or agreeing with Deputy  Deasy and extending this to Friday and Saturday nights.Section 12 relates to entertainment during drinking-up time. This is a ludicrous proposal. Staggering is not what a Deputy does coming out of the Dáil bar after an Adjournment debate. It refers to varying the closing times of night-clubs where one night-club can close at one time and the next can close at another. By giving them a variance of a half hour between times, people will not be coming out of them at the same time. There are a large number of people who do not drink. I am not a teetotaller but I do not necessarily drink to excess. I have often gone into a night-club because I enjoy dancing and have not drank because I was the designated driver. This proposal in the Bill is discriminating against non-drinkers in stopping the entertainment. It also encourages people to drink quicker and leave the premises whereas if the dancing is still on some will stay while others go. People go to night-clubs primarily to dance while others do so to drink.I did not study Latin in second level so I hope I am correct in interpreting the old saying in vino veritas as meaning when drunk, the truth. In many cases when people have a few gargles, it exacerbates fundamental personality traits. As Deputy Finian McGrath has said in areas where people have the backup of family and the community – a stable background – they are less likely to engage in anti-social and violent behaviour, exacerbated by alcohol. In a large number of situations people have been beaten badly or even killed arising from corner boys who have been drinking. However, the corner boys are not the ones drinking in the pubs, but the ones lying in wait whose hobby is beating the hell out of those who drink in pubs. It is to satisfy their sick minds, exacerbated by the effects of alcohol. The illness that makes them want to do that in the first place relates to other social issues.Other actions can be taken, such as an investigation of the continental approach, because we might be able to deal with being given responsibility if more gardaí are on the streets and there is proper enforcement. In terms of alcohol consumption leading to violence, the demolition of community employment schemes, bad planning and an education system that does not invest in primary level cause the conditions that lead people to exacerbate their anti-social tendencies through alcohol. If these were dealt with rather than an attempt being made to be the policeman for responsible drinkers, we might solve the problem.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	475	Unlike Deputy Gogarty, I am not prepared to let bygones be bygones quite so quickly. The Bill has three characteristics of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, with which we are becoming all too familiar, namely, the lawyer's craft in finding ways to use legislation to undermine civil liberties, the eye to  the public relations stroke, and disregard for the proper scrutiny of legislation by the Oireachtas.This hugely controversial legislation, which was only published on 19 June, is being forced and railroaded through the Oireachtas this week. Normal procedures are being set aside and it is intended to press it through Committee Stage within hours of the conclusion of Second Stage. I already voiced my objection to this on the Order of Business.This is the type of legislation that brings the Oireachtas into disrepute. The Minister needs to be seen to be doing something about drink-related assaults, so this Bill has been cobbled together. With the provisions regarding alcohol, we have dangerous and regressive sections which undermine the rights of the citizens and the role of the Equality Authority in vindicating those rights. This is a Bill on which I have no doubt most people will have an opinion. For good or ill, alcohol forms a huge part of the social life in Ireland. There will be many different views on the measures proposed, yet even the range of views in the Oireachtas will not be properly aired nor the Bill properly scrutinised. That is why I say the legislation and the method of its passage through the Oireachtas brings the process of passing legislation into disrepute.There is an assumption underlining the Bill that needs to be challenged, namely, that alcohol abuse and alcohol related crime are predominantly issues for young people. I dispute that; it is a myth. It is hypocrisy for this predominantly middle-aged assembly to lecture young people on drink when the abuse of alcohol is a problem for every generation and when young people follow what I can only regard as the well trodden path of their elders. The truth is that young people have been let down by the failure of the older generation to develop a more mature approach to alcohol in society and to address other deficiencies in terms of social choice and options.Section 2 is unworkable and will not be popular with the Garda Síochána. It is a recipe for conflict between gardaí, patrons of licensed premises and publicans. I can envisage a few token efforts to enforce it and when its folly becomes clear, it will be quietly dropped. It is folly for legislation to attempt to define drunkenness as the Bill does. There will be cases where courts will be asked to decide, on the opinion of a garda, whether a person was drunk. Under the definition in the Bill, the decision will be based on the perception of a garda that a person "might endanger himself or herself or any other person". This is ridiculously vague and is clearly open to abuse by gardaí.We are all familiar with the phenomenon, especially in rural areas, where a system of favouritism often exists regarding the enforcement of licensing laws. Certain publicans are favoured by gardaí and a blind eye is turned to infringements of the licensing laws. Others who are out of favour can be subject to what I regard as an over the top approach, and section 2 pro vides, regrettably, yet another outlet for that abuse.I welcomed and supported the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000 and am not present to provide opposition for oppositions sake, rather to scrutinise seriously what the Minister proposes. That Act extended opening hours in a sane and sensible way. I made the point that it was simplistic to make a direct link between opening hours and alcohol related problems. The Bill brings about yet another change with closing time on Thursday reverting to 11.30 p.m. from the 12.30 p.m. provided. Does anyone on the Government side really believe this will achieve anything except further confusion and annoyance for the many people who know how to behave and handle their drink? It is very frustrating and will have a deleterious effect in terms of visitors to the country.The Irish Hotels Federation has raised serious objections to the sections that deal with the presence of people under 18 years on licensed premises. It believes the legislation has the potential to damage the tourism industry, and there is some validity in its arguments. The rushing through of the Bill does not allow proper consideration of the federation's concerns or the expressed concerns of other representative groups.By far the most serious aspect of the Bill is the undermining of the Equal Status Act and the Equality Authority. My party opposes the removal in section 19 of the jurisdiction of the Equality Tribunal to hear complaints of discrimination by licensed establishments and the exemption of licensees from the Equal Status Act. The objections of civil liberties and human rights groups to this section have been dismissed and that is a mistake. I deplore the attitude of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to these groups who are broadly accepted as watchdogs of our democracy. He referred in a recent contribution on another Bill to such people and others who keep an important eye on human rights as the "modern human rights babble". That outlook underlines the Bill and is something of which the Minister should be ashamed. I call for rejection of the Bill.

This is due to a variety of factors, most if not all of which have been alluded to by previous speakers. This alarming increase in alcohol intake is a cause of grave concern to us all. Of particular concern is the obvious increase in alcohol consumption among the young. There is no doubt that children as young as 11 or 12 drink alcohol, and there is compelling evidence that a certain number of them drink to excess.Frequent reference is made to the growing drug problem in society, especially among the young. Let us not forget that alcohol is a drug, albeit one licensed by the State. While it can be enjoyed in moderation by the vast majority of people, for some reason, Irish people appear to have a predilection in engaging in excessive alcohol consumption. Whether this is genetic or multifactorial in origin is open to debate, but it is the case.This is a factor that wreaks havoc on an increasing section of the population. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health and Children is investigating the problem and we have heard evidence from the drinks industry, manufacturers, publicans and accident and emergency consultants whose hospital departments see the consequences of excessive alcohol consumption every day and especially every night. The investigations we have undertaken are not yet complete but the evidence so far indicates that there is a serious problem. This Bill is the start of a process that will deal with some of the aspects of this problem, particularly the legal aspects concerning the availability of alcohol.The Bill is radical and timely and the Minister is to be congratulated for responding to this growing social menace by introducing it so promptly after receiving the report of the Commission on Liquor Licensing two months ago. Many of the recommendations contained in the commission's final report find expression in the provisions contained in the Bill.Sections 4 to 10, inclusive, deal with the requirements of the holders of the licence of a public house to maintain an orderly house. Most publicans will welcome the ability to refrain from serving persons who are drunk. They now have the right, backed by the law, to refuse to serve alcohol to persons who are intoxicated, although most publicans already do this. Alcohol is a drug and the publican, as the holder of a State licence, has a duty and responsibility to the person serving alcohol in his premises and to other customers in the public house to maintain an orderly house. If excessive alcohol is consumed, drunkenness will ensue and that person will be a danger to themselves and to society at large. The right to hold a licence for a public house carries responsibilities with it and this Bill clearly illustrates those responsibilities.Section 11 is a new departure for the licensing laws in this State. There is now a role for local authorities in the determination of the duration of special exemption orders in their administrative areas. There has been a lot of talk about increasing the role and powers of local councillors and some of that talk is hot air, but this is a positive development. Local authorities must now consult the gardaí and others, including publicans and health professionals, before adopting resolutions regarding special exemption orders. The District Court still has the final say in the granting of the orders but now local people have an input  into decisions in their own areas. This is a positive step forward for local democracy.There is considerable debate on the changes proposed in section 12 to the 30 minute drinking up period. The commission recommended that no entertainment be provided during this time so the original purpose of an orderly clearing of the premises is allowed to occur. Some groups, including night club owners and hoteliers, argued that prohibiting people from dancing during this period will result in a mass exodus on to the streets at the same time, thus increasing the risk of disturbance, but the purpose of this section is to allow patrons of bars and dance halls a period of time to finish their drinks leisurely to avoid a mass exodus. Some people will leave immediately the entertainment stops and others will do so during the remaining half hour. This will allow a controlled exit of patrons and should help to reduce the risk of civil and public disorder.Sections 13 to 16 deal with under-age drinking, a very important issue. It is not fair for publicans to have to estimate a person's age solely by their appearance – a method of identification is essential. There is a worry that falsification of the age card could occur. Perhaps co-operation between the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs is needed so that a card clearly identifying the holder by date of birth, photograph and PPS number, backed up by the authority of the State, could be produced.Plain clothes gardaí will now have the same powers to enter a public house as uniformed gardaí. This is a major change in our law and must be carefully considered by the Minister. I support the concept of plain clothes gardaí enforcing the law but their authority to do so must come from a superintendent or higher ranking officer. Distinction must be maintained between a garda on duty, in uniform or plain clothes, and an off duty garda, otherwise confusion will reign and civil rights could become hopelessly compromised. The sections of the Bill referring to the procedure of special promotions are also to be welcomed.Concerns have been expressed by hoteliers who worry about the sections of the Bill that prohibit the presence of people under 18 years of age in public bar areas. This should be examined in greater depth and a previous speaker alluded to the need for legislation to distinguish between a bar area and a lounge area. I welcome the Bill.

In Cork a young man died as a result of an unwarranted attack. After that attack, I asked a senior garda about rostering and he told me that 60 gardaí were tied up in the District Court the following Monday morning dealing with minor offences. We must consider allowing a senior officer to take those cases to  court so the 60 gardaí could be released for duty on the streets.It is ironic that publicans employ security who throw on to the street people who have taken too much drink and the publican is no longer responsible.The Minister has shown great courage in introducing measures that are absolutely necessary to deal with a situation that has led to a major increase in public order offences. Anyone who witnessed the presentation of the accident and emergency consultants before the Joint Committee on Health and Children would have been alarmed at the details of young people being brought in comatose, developing liver problems at an early age and being abandoned by their friends when they fall down in the streets.Everyone is aware of the code of advertising of the drinks industry and how it was observed in the breach. We are all aware of the unacceptable promotional practices of the drinks industry and they cannot be allowed to continue. The Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Health and Children are absolutely correct in outlawing happy hours and ensuring that the breweries do not have people working for them on campuses to encourage young people to drink in the early afternoon.When people are disorderly in pubs, there should be an onus on the publican to ensure that the gardaí are informed before these people are thrown out. This Bill goes a long way to ensure that this will happen.It is about time publicans were brought to book about selling drink to drunk people. They serve too much drink and then protest, asking how they are supposed to know that a person is drunk. It is clear to most publicans. There is much that is positive in this Bill for them and the Minister should place an onus on them to refuse service to those who are obviously drunk.

A mechanism can be found by which we can accommodate both situations.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	486	I chose to speak on this Bill because, first, I believe it is important legislation and, second, it is based on the commission established to examine the abuse of intoxicating liquor by youths to which I made a personal submission. I did that because I am conscious of the fact that alcohol is having a serious effect on the lives of young people.I welcome the Bill because it is not about trying to curtail young people enjoying themselves. It is about ensuring that one person's good time will not lead to another person ending up in hospital. It is about ensuring that young people do not drink themselves into oblivion and that we tackle the negative social and health effects of the Irish love affair with alcohol. This Bill goes some way towards addressing that, although I accept it will take much more than just one legislative measure.We have all seen evidence of random assaults. We have also seen the accident and emergency statistics where one in four cases now relates to alcohol. We have seen young people who cannot be responsible in any way for what they do but who become involved not only in violent behaviour but in risky sexual behaviour. They are then incapable of facing up to the consequences in terms of public order and health.I am aware the Minister for Health and Children is examining issues regarding advertising, which is to be welcomed, but this particular legislation aims to ensure that young people cannot get access to alcohol. It will penalise the licensee and the customer if they aim to contravene the new regulations, all of which I welcome.There would appear to be no effective barrier currently to young people having access to alcohol. If a 16 year old can be in a bar legally up to closing time, how is any garda meant to know whether they are drinking coke or vodka and coke? It is impossible for anybody to be able to identify that. The Commission on Liquor Licensing pointed out that the proofs necessary were unreasonably onerous but the new proofs will make the job of enforcement easier. The fact that young people cannot now be in the bar after 9 p.m. is to be welcomed. Like everybody else, I have had correspondence from the hotels and I believe the Minister addressed some of their concerns here last night. What we are talking about is not just keeping young people out of pubs. We are trying to change a culture where everybody believes that the only entertainment is in the pub. The very same people who would talk to us about the need for early intervention in health, education and family support should say to us now that what we need in this area is early intervention to ensure that from a very young age children can be excluded from pubs. In that way, they  will not accept that the pub is the only culture or form of entertainment.It is obvious that many licensed premises throughout the country do not feel under any threat from a potential closure. When one compares the number of convictions and prosecutions in Dublin to those in Mayo, for example, it is obvious that cases are not being brought forward. If the law is to be enforced properly and is to be successful, it must be done uniformly throughout the country.I am aware the Minister is examining the whole idea of a labelling scheme for off-licence products. Even in my own constituency, I am aware of the difficulties in that area. If young people are drinking on the beach in Killiney or on Killiney Hill, who is to know from where they got the drink? It might not be evidence in itself but at least it will ensure that those people who are irresponsible will be caught.This legislation is crucial in so far as it tackles the issues of young people and the fact that they are able to get drink easily and are availing of that opportunity. I welcome the legislation as a contribution towards curbing the problems of excessive drinking.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I thank the Minister. I appreciate the opportunity to say a few words on the Bill, with which I am very disappointed. The Minister spoke a great deal about what needed to be done and we believed his commitment was sincere. The Minister said the Bill was an interim measure and it certainly needs to be beefed up in a major way in the not too distant future. I am aware that other Ministers deal with issues such as driving licences and the implications of drink for young drivers, and the advertising issue is possibly a job for the Minister for Health and Children, but it is unfortunate that these issues were not linked to deal with this serious problem. I listened to one of the Independents talk about the creation of a  nanny state. That is a joke. We have to realise that alcohol abuse is a very serious problem which must be dealt with in a serious way.We extended the opening hours, although I was one of the few people who spoke against that at the time, but it is a joke that we are addressing the Thursday night hours and not those of Friday or Saturday night. Those are the nights I get the telephone calls from the elderly and others who suffer abuse. They are the nights that cause the problems in the accident and emergency departments. They are the nights when the deaths from road accidents occur. That is an area to which the Minister must give serious consideration.On the whole issue of the family structure and objecting to somebody being on the premises, I know the Minister has changed the time from 8 p.m. to 9 p.m. but there is a whole grey area in terms of the definition of a function room, pub or club. Those are the issues that need to be clarified in order that there will not be an abuse of the system. I was in a public house in Canada not long ago which had a rule about smoking, yet it provided an open area outside the premises. I thank the Minister for the opportunity to say a few words about the Bill.
#SeanRyan	unknown-#SeanRyan-party	unknown-#SeanRyan-dob	unknown-#SeanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to speak on the Bill. There is no doubt that the drinking pattern of parents influences the attitudes of children towards drink. It is very difficult to get teenagers to accept the slogan, "Don't do as I do, do as I say", especially if parents or guardians are excessive drinkers. The old attitude of tolerance of excessive drinking and drink-related offences must be replaced by a new attitude of responsibility. That responsibility must be shared by everyone – the Government, by means of taxation legislation, those who produce and sell alcohol and those who consume it. Society must create the environment and introduce the measures which will help to change the existing pattern of behaviour. Alcohol advertisements deliberately set out to reinforce the link between drinking, socialising and the belief that the use of alcohol contributes to social and sexual success. That issue must be addressed.The problem of young people binge drinking at weekends must be addressed. As somebody who represents Dublin North, I had representations from members of Neighbourhood Watch, which represents a population of up to 30,000, in regard to late night drinking at weekends. They said that there is a wider dimension to this issue. Everyone, whether a drinker or licensee, has to take responsibility for bringing the problem under control. We must also reduce its effects on residents of adjoining communities. Unlike Swords, many towns do not have bar extensions.I welcome the provision to reinstate 11.30 p.m. and 12 midnight closing times on Thursday nights and favour considering the possibility of extending them to Saturday and Sunday nights. This is not provided for in the Bill. In continental countries and Britain people do not drink late  into the night. In the past five years consumption of alcohol here has rapidly risen to the top of the European league due to affluence. We must all accept responsibility for this.Many people argue there is sufficient legislation to address the issue. I want this legislation enforced to allow people in communities to address the issue and ensure their social lives are not destroyed. If we do not work together to change attitudes, there will be a sorry tale of woe further down the line.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate. There is general, though not universal, agreement that a change in the law was needed in certain respects. With a number of Deputies taking polar opposite views of what should be done, we have the full gamut of opinion in the House. Deputies Crawford, Deasy and others in the Fine Gael Party stated the Bill does not go far enough and much more serious measures must be taken, especially on licensing hours. Others, with equal vehemence, have argued that it would be a strategic mistake to attempt to tinker with licensing hours and we should not become hung up on the question, but instead allow people to drink until whatever time they like in the evenings and owners of premises to run them on that basis. I am fairly sure about one issue – I do not say this glibly – namely, that when one is under attack from both ends of the spectrum, there is some consolation in thinking one cannot be entirely wrong on an issue.Deputies Deasy and Crawford and other members of the Fine Gael Party have taken the view, echoed to an extent by Deputy Sean Ryan, that we should consider making a change to closing times on Friday and Saturday. The real problems in terms of disorder, youngsters being involved in terrible car crashes and so forth arise between 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., whether on the streets of Dublin, Cavan or elsewhere, as people leave clubs and congregate. This is the time when public disorder, fatalities, sexual assaults and all the other activities occur. The 11.30 p.m. or 12.30 p.m. closing time is not relevant in this context, which is my worry. Under the law, as it stands, special exemption orders operate with effect from whatever is the closing time of the premises in question until 2.30 a.m. As far as the behaviour of people coming out of clubs is concerned, therefore, the normal closing time for pubs does not matter. The real problem is what happens at 3 a.m. and 4 a.m., which is decided by reference to the time the late night places close.Deputy Deenihan and others raised the issue of forgeries. I accept there will probably be attempts to forge identity cards. The Bill introduces an obligation on people in the 18 to 21 years age band to produce identity cards. As these will be police cards, persons in this age group will not be able to enter a premises by waving student identification cards at security staff or barmen. Only one document will be accepted and  it will be a serious criminal offence to make dishonest use of it or create one dishonestly. This is as much as I can do on this issue.I accept the points made by Deputies opposite that the scheme will not be fool-proof and the ingenuity of young people will be used on occasion to attempt to find ways to circumvent this law – this should not happen. Given that publicans back the measure and are in favour of it being mandatory, I have no choice but to make it mandatory to use the official card.Some Deputies raised the fact that the Bill does not include measures on advertising or the Road Traffic Act. Although these areas are not my ministerial responsibility, they are under consideration. The Government is not thinking in separate channels. Discussions are ongoing between the relevant Ministers on to health, education, advertising, motor law and the provisions of the Bill. The legislation is only one part of a broader response.Since I published the Bill a few weeks ago, I have met various interested parties and lobbies. Each group started by telling me it recognised the extent of the problem and fully supported the general thrust of the Bill, but then followed this up by stating it had a problem with section X or subsection Y, which it would like amended or removed and, furthermore, an important matter had been overlooked and a new section Z was needed to address it. This is the kind of response I have had. I have stated repeatedly that I accept the good faith of all those I have met, some of whom have made valuable comments on the Bill. However, this legislation is a measured, balanced response to current circumstances and has not been introduced to satisfy one interest rather than another.Next year's codification Bill will offer us an opportunity to reconsider the questions of opening hours, boutique pubs versus super-pubs and the size of pubs. These issues could not be adequately discussed and one could not arrive at a view on them in the few short weeks which have elapsed between the fourth report of the commission and the publication and passage through the House of the Bill.A number of Deputies described the role envisaged for local authorities as unworkable,  unreasonable, unacceptable or in even tougher terms. On 20 January 2003 the secretary of the Association of Municipal Authorities in Ireland wrote to me congratulating me on the proposal to give local authorities a role. We cannot have it every way. Perhaps the association in question misjudged some of its members views, but not everything we have done is wrong.

If we do not have a rule that at some point in the evening under age persons must clear a premises, there is no point in requiring people of an older age to carry any card at all. If they are mixing in licensed premises and the bars of licensed premises with large numbers of 16 or 17 year olds, the law would fall into complete disrepute.I have been listening carefully to the debate on the question of what is or is not a bar. If there is any way in which I can make the law clearer, I will do so. Hoteliers should be aware that I will not open up a loophole which would allow them to place a "Function Room" sign in front of a bar and bring in 16 and 17 year olds without evidence of age cards to drink in it as if it were a bar. Whereas I am open to tightening and refining the definition of "bar" in the course of the debate on the Bill, I will not accede to the general proposition, which I regard as wrong, that this Bill is in principle anti-family or that it is somehow pro-family to allow youngsters to hang around bars between 9 p.m. and 11.30 p.m. I will not accede to the general proposition, which I regard as wrong, that this Bill is, in principle, anti-family—

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	505	I move:That Dáil Éireann resolves that sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 (No. 39 of 1998), shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months beginning on 30 June 2003.The resolution before the House today seeks approval for the continuance in force of those sections of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which would otherwise cease to be in operation on 30 June 2003.The recent Garda operation in County Louth and the PSNI discovery of a large van-bomb in Derry are clear indications of the continuing need for perseverance in the fight against terrorism on this island. Members of this House will need no reminder of the circumstances in which these provisions were enacted in 1998, namely, the Omagh bomb in August of that year. There was a determination that those responsible for that mass murder would not succeed in subverting the democratically expressed will of the people on this island and that the conflict should be resolved only by peaceful means and on the basis of consent. To date, one person has been convicted in this jurisdiction on a charge related to the Omagh bomb, and the investigation is continuing with excellent co-operation between the Garda Síochána and the Police Service of Northern Ireland. As has been stated before, a point worth reiterating, the Garda Síochána will never give up the search for those responsible for that mass murder.Deputies will recall that in recognition of the particular circumstances surrounding the enactment of the provisions of the 1998 Act, there was general agreement that the Act should be regularly revisited by the Oireachtas to see if the circumstances then prevailing justified the continuance in force of its provisions, or whether there had been a change in circumstances sufficient to convince the Oireachtas that the provisions were no longer needed. Under section 18 of the Act, therefore, as amended by section 37 of the Criminal Justice Act 1999, and by virtue of resolutions passed by each House of the Oireachtas on 20 June 2000, 26 June 2001 and, more recently, on 18 April 2002, sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 will cease to operate on and from 30 June 2003 unless a further resolution is passed by each House authorising the sections to continue to operate for such period not exceeding 12 months as may be specified in the resolution.Also included in the Act was a requirement on me to lay a report on the operation of the Act before each House of the Oireachtas prior to any consideration by the Houses of the renewal of the provisions. Such a report was laid before this House on 18 June. The conclusion of that report is that the renewal of the provisions for a further year is necessary. The sad reality is that, as already mentioned, those responsible for the Omagh bomb continue to pursue and plan a campaign of murder and violence and that there is no change of substance to the circumstances which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act.Before turning to the individual sections of the Act, I should mention the current position regarding the report of the committee to review the Offences against the State Acts 1939 to 1998, which was published last August. The report is extensive and deals with complex issues of law and policy and involves important considerations concerning the balance to be struck between national and international security on the one hand and civil liberties and individual rights on the other. The report's recommendations of direct relevance to the purpose and scope of the Criminal Justice (Terrorist Offences) Bill 2002 were considered in the context of the preparation of that legislation, and the Bill, accordingly, will give effect to a limited number of recommendations to that end. A fuller consideration of the recommendations of the committee will be finalised once the Bill has been enacted and I will then bring further proposals to the Government.I now turn to the individual sections which this House is asked to continue in force for a further 12 months, outline their purpose and indicate where they have been utilised in the past 12 months. First, the following sections have not been utilised since 23 March 2002: section 3, which provides that, in proceedings for an offence of membership of an unlawful organisation, the accused must give notification of an intention to call a person to give evidence on his or her behalf, unless the court permits otherwise.Section 4, which amends section 3 of the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1972. The effect of the 1972 provision is that any statement or conduct by a person accused of membership of an unlawful organisation implying or leading to a reasonable inference that he was at a material time a member of such an organisation shall be evidence that he or she was then such a member. It originally defined the expression "conduct" as including an omission by an accused person to deny published reports that he was a member of an unlawful organisation. The change made by section 4 of the 1998 Act was to expand the definition of "conduct" to include movements, actions, activities or associations. This simply aligns the definition of conduct in the 1972 Act with the reference to movements, actions, activities or associations used in section 2 of the 1998 Act.Section 6 established the offence of directing, at any level of the organisation's structure, the  activities of an organisation in respect of which a suppression order has been made under the Offences against the State Act 1939. While this section was not utilised during the period under report, one person remains before the courts having been charged with such an offence prior to that period. Section 8 made it an offence to collect, record or possess information which is of such a nature that it is likely to be useful to members of an unlawful organisation in the commission of serious offences. Section 12 made it an offence for a person to instruct or train another person in the making or use of firearms or explosives or to receive such training without lawful authority or reasonable excuse.Section 17 builds on the provision in the Criminal Justice Act 1994 for the forfeiture of property. Essentially, the 1994 provision empowers a court, in its discretion, whenever any person is convicted of an offence, to order the forfeiture of any property in the possession of that person which was used, or intended to be used, to facilitate the commission of the offence. The effect of section 17 is, in the case of a person convicted of specified offences relating to the possession of firearms or explosives, and where there is property liable to forfeiture under the 1994 Act, to require the court to order the forfeiture of such property unless it is satisfied that there would be a serious risk of injustice if it made such an order.Turning to those sections of the Act which have been used in the reporting period, section 2 provides that where, in any proceedings against a person for membership of an unlawful organisation, evidence is given that the accused, when questioned, failed to answer or gave false or misleading answers to any question material to the investigation of the offence, the court may draw such inferences from that failure or from the furnishing of a false or misleading reply as appear proper. This provision has been utilised on many occasions in questioning persons arrested on suspicion of being members of an unlawful organisation. Charges do not, of course, result in every case in which the provision is used, but since 23 March 2002, the section was utilised on 43 occasions. In addition, six persons were convicted during the period under report, having been charged prior to that period in cases where this section was utilised.Section 5 provides for the drawing of adverse inferences in the prosecution of a person for any offence under the Offences against the State Acts, any offence scheduled under the Acts and any offence arising out of the same set of facts as such an offence, provided that the offence carries a penalty of five years imprisonment or more. The effect of this section is to allow a court to draw inferences where the accused relies on a fact in his or her defence that he or she could reasonably have been expected to mention during questioning or on being charged but did not do so. This section was utilised on one occasion in the reporting period.Section 7 made it an offence to possess articles in circumstances giving rise to a reasonable suspicion that the article is in possession for a purpose connected with the commission, preparation or instigation of specified firearms or explosives offences. This section was utilised on 18 occasions. Section 9 made it an offence to withhold information which a person knows or believes would be of material assistance in preventing the commission by any other person of a serious offence or securing the apprehension, prosecution or conviction of any other person for such an offence and who fails without reasonable excuse to disclose such information to a member of the Garda Síochána. This section was utilised on 17 occasions.Section 10 extends the maximum period of detention permitted under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act, which otherwise is 48 hours, to 72 hours on the authorisation of a District Court judge. The judge must be satisfied, on the application of an officer of the Garda Síochána not below the rank of superintendent, that the further detention is necessary for the proper investigation of the offence concerned and that the investigation is being conducted diligently and expeditiously. The person being detained is entitled to be present in court during the application and to make, or to have made, submissions on his or her behalf. In the reporting period, 32 persons have had their periods of detention extended under this provision and nine were subsequently charged with offences.Section 11 allows a District Court judge to permit the rearrest and detention of a person in respect of an offence for which he or she was previously detained under section 30 of the Offences against the State Act but released without charge. This further period must not exceed 24 hours and can only be authorised in circumstances where the District Court judge is satisfied, on information supplied on oath by a member of the Garda Síochána, that further information has come to the knowledge of the Garda about that person's suspected participation in the offence and about which it wishes to question the suspect. This section was utilised on two occasions.The effect of section 14 is to make these new offences scheduled offences for the purposes of Part V of the 1939 Act. This means that persons suspected of committing such offences are liable to arrest under section 30 of the 1939 Act. This section was utilised on 83 occasions.The foregoing information on the use made of the provisions of the 1998 Act in the reporting period is based on information received from the Garda authorities and is contained in the report on the Act laid before the House. This report, together with the previous reports, shows that the key provisions of the Act are taking effect. We have seen the results of this legislation since its inception. Of course, the most significant result in the Garda's fight against subversive activity was the conviction of a person on a charge of conspiracy to cause an explosion in relation to the  Omagh atrocity. The provisions of the 1998 Act were used appropriately by the Garda in this case and will continue to be used in its efforts to bring to justice all those responsible for that horrific act of mass murder.At the same time it should be noted that the number of persons held under extended detention under section 10 in the reporting period was 32, as against 39 in the previous nine month period. This is a relatively modest number and one which, taken together with all the other information I have outlined, supports my view that the provisions of the Act are reasoned and proportionate and are being implemented by the Garda Síochána in a measured and restrained manner.There are, of course, some provisions which did not take effect in the context of court proceedings during the period under report, but even here the Garda authorities have informed me that the provisions in question have been utilised, where appropriate, by the gardaí during the investigation of offences. Members of the House will appreciate, of course, that many of the investigations at issue are, of their nature, ongoing.The Garda Síochána has had considerable success in the reporting period in combating those who would subvert, through the use of violence, the democratic wishes of the people on this island and I am sure that the House will join with me in congratulating the force on its achievements. However, the threat to life and our democratic values, which led to the enactment of the 1998 Act, remains. So too, I am sure, does the determination of this House to never give in to such a threat, but to provide the Garda and the criminal justice system with all legitimate means of combating it. The 1998 Act is an important part of those means and it is proving its worth.Much has been achieved in the implementation of the peace process and much remains to be done, but there are still those who threaten to subvert it through violence. The 1998 Act is part of the democratic response to that threat and I ask this House to continue to enforce its relevant provisions for a further 12 months. It is my earnest hope that as soon as it is possible not to move a motion of this kind, such a motion will be moved. A massive bomb was discovered ready for use in Derry the other day in circumstances in which if it did not kill many, it would have been a minor miracle. Anybody who saw that must realise a threat of mass murder and subversion still exists. Only a clear message from this House as to where it stands on this issue will suffice on this occasion.
#JohnDeasyFG	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-party	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-dob	unknown-#JohnDeasyFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	506	Fine Gael supports this motion as it always has. I agree with the Minister that if the last couple of months are anything to judge by, we are looking at an increased level of dissident republicanism. The threat of violence is certainly increasing. A bomb was planted on Merrion Square last month which the Garda says would have caused very serious injury to somebody had  it exploded. The Garda seized a 1,000 lb bomb in Louth two weeks ago which was ready to be transported to the North and the Minister has already explained that a massive primed bomb was found in Derry. These incidents are indications of the increased level of dissident republicanism with which we are faced. Last January the PSNI headquarters was attacked as were other stations in the Belfast area. The Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, has warned that members of the district police boards could be in danger and stated that the threat against them is very real.Some Deputies will surely have been reading the reports from the Central Criminal Court yesterday and today. If one reads the details of Mr. Rupert's evidence, one will quickly conclude that the evil which has existed on this island for 30 years is alive and well. All members of society must be vigilant against the growing threat of dissident republicanism. There was clear evidence that the recent serious gangland activity in Limerick was facilitated by weaponry supplied by the Continuity IRA to gangs in the Limerick area. There is also strong evidence to suggest that some universities are recruiting grounds for dissident republican movements whose aim is to put together a major bombing campaign in the UK and the British mainland.The Minister mentioned the Omagh bombing a number of times as it was the reason this resolution was originally formulated. I could not help but remember during his speech comments made by Sinn Féin's Alex Maskey a few months ago when he called on dissident republicans to disband after numerous bomb attacks in the Belfast area. To this day, Sinn Féin has never advocated that individuals co-operate with the Garda or the PSNI to bring the perpetrators of the Omagh atrocity to justice. That appals most people. I could not help but remember something the Sinn Féin president, Gerry Adams, said recently. He said the Omagh bombing was a grievous blow to the families who lost loved ones and whose loved ones were injured and that it represented a set back for the broad republican struggle. This comment comes from the party which would not support the Garda Síochána (Police Co-Operation) Bill or the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigations Teams) Bill both of which were recently before this House. These Bills provide for better co-operation between the PSNI and the Garda to prevent atrocities such as the one which occurred at Omagh from happening again. Sinn Féin feels the pain of the victims, but when it comes to supporting the institutions of the State to ensure that an Omagh never happens again, the party is nowhere to be found.Today we were informed of the success of the Criminal Assets Bureau which has taken €90 million from gangland bosses and drug traffickers. It is good news that the remit and jurisdiction of the CAB will be expanded to give it a wider role to combat terrorism and terrorist groups. The bureau recently served a tax bill on the Real IRA's second in command to the tune of €750,000, which is the first such move against the finances of dissident republicans. As mentioned yesterday by Senator Brian Hayes in the Upper House, there is good reason to believe the IRA now fronts legitimate businesses. If the remit of the Criminal Assets Bureau is being expanded to tackle terrorist groups, it should look immediately into the business activities of the IRA and confiscate its profits. As was said yesterday, we cannot allow groups, even those which are on ceasefire, to diversify their illegal activities.Last year, my predecessor, Alan Shatter, concluded his contribution on this motion by expressing the hope that by 2003 we would be in a new environment and would not need to continue with this resolution. He was being optimistic, however. We will probably bring this motion before the House for a couple of more years, but we will not need it eventually. The vast majority of people on this island understand that there can be no return to the state of affairs which existed previously. The will of the people will ultimately prevail. I support this motion completely, as does my party.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	507	Emergency amending legislation was introduced in September 1998 in the aftermath of the horrific Omagh bombing, the worst single incident in more than 30 years of violence. It came as a particular shock coming within months of the signing of the Good Friday Agreement and its subsequent endorsement in referenda by an overwhelming majority of people, North and South. Against this background, the Houses of the Oireachtas voted overwhelmingly to approve the Bill the Government brought forward in spite of the strong reservations many Members held about the severe nature of many of its provisions. The Labour Party agreed to enact the Bill as we were led to believe the law then operating would not be adequate to bring those responsible to justice. Further powers were needed. Newspaper reports at the time quoted a senior Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform spokesman as saying that while intelligence and evidence against the people involved existed, there was no way to secure convictions under existing legislation. The spokesman said there was enough evidence against those responsible for the heinous crime to make strong cases against them under the new legislation.The Oireachtas delivered the new powers sought by the Minister and the Garda, who have failed subsequently to deliver prosecutions and convictions to the extent we were given to believe they would. As the Minister said, one person has been convicted in the five years the special emergency legislation has been in operation. It is not a wonderful tally. The failure to make successful use of the powers provided by the Oireachtas raises legitimate questions of whether these powers were needed and whether, given their non-use, they should  remain on the Statute Book. Wider issues arise regarding the offences against the State code in its entirety. We have a poor record of introducing emergency legislation to deal with specific circumstances which we subsequently leave on the Statute Book for decades. The declaration of emergency made during the Second World War was allowed to remain in effect, if not in use, until the rainbow Government moved a motion to lift it in 1995.The Special Criminal Court had been reintroduced in 1972 and is still in use. It is surely time to consider whether it is appropriate that legislation with such extreme powers as the Offences against the State Act, as amended, should be a permanent fixture on the Statute Book. The original Act was a creation of its time. There are sections that could not conceivably be used now. It is, for instance, an offence to refer in writing to the illegal organisation known as the IRA. The newspapers commit an offence every time they refer in their columns to the IRA yet nobody would suggest that the newspapers should be prosecuted. There are many other provisions that have been used only rarely, if at all.It is time for a fundamental review of the Offences against the State Act by the Oireachtas. The Hederman report should have provided the vehicle to enable us to do so. The Constitution states: no person shall be tried on any criminal charge save in due course of law; that minor offences may be tried by courts of summary jurisdiction; that special courts may be established in cases where it may be determined that the ordinary courts are inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice and the preservation of public peace and order; and that, save in regard to minor offences or offences tried by special courts or military tribunals, no person shall be tried on any criminal charge without a jury.The Government made a proclamation on 26 May 1972, bringing Part V of the 1939 Act into operation and, four days later, an order was made establishing the Special Criminal Court. The court sits with three judges without a jury but the rules of law and evidence that apply in proceedings before the court are the same as those in other criminal courts. There is no concept in Irish law of special courts trying special cases according to special rules. That being so, the only basis for its establishment and maintenance is the fear that jury participation would render the administration of justice ineffective.On 15 June 1972, replying to questions in this House, the Minister for Justice responsible for the re-introduction of special courts, former Deputy Des O'Malley, was asked to cite the cases on which the Government had based its opinion that the ordinary courts were inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice, leading to the decision to introduce special courts, and whether this would be a temporary  measure. He replied, much as Ministers for Justice have done ever since, that he was precluded from referring to individual cases in which persons have been acquitted. However, he stated that when a jury verdict has to be unanimous, each member of the jury that brings in a guilty verdict is known to have supported the verdict and is thus a potential target for attack by associates of the convicted person.He confirmed that the Act envisages Part V as a temporary measure and that the Government is obliged under the Act to revoke its proclamation as soon as it is satisfied that conditions are such as allow that to be done. No such conditions have occurred, it appears, in the last 30 years. Again, when asked had there been any evidence of intimidation of jurors over the last few months, he replied that he was not prepared to go into detail in regard to any individual case. The House and the general public have been hearing much the same ever since. When the paramilitary threat seemed to have abated, organised crime was given as the reason for maintaining these emergency provisions. We can only hope that the disastrous series of events surrounding the prosecutions arising from the murder of Veronica Guerin has led to a re-think of this approach.In summary, Part V, which establishes the Special Criminal Court regime, is not part of the ordinary law of the land. However, the Government proclamation of 1972 bringing Part V into operation has never been rescinded and what was intended as an exceptional device in times of emergency has, in fact, become a permanent feature of the Irish legal landscape. Rights enshrined in the Constitution have been temporarily put to one side, on the grounds that the courts of this State were inadequate to administer justice and that special measures were needed, placing the apparatus of the State on a permanent emergency footing. In such an environment, allegations of miscarriage of justice, both real and opportunistic, were inevitable.Under the Good Friday Agreement, this Government committed itself to a wide-ranging review of the 1939 Act, with a view to reform and to dispensing with those elements of the Act which were no longer required. It was not surprising, given its composition, that the Hederman committee failed to reach a unanimous position on whether the Special Criminal Court should be abolished. In August 2002, the committee issued an interim report dealing with the role of the Director of Public Prosecutions in certifying cases for trial by the Special Criminal Court. The interim report was prepared to assist the Government in making a response to the United Nations Human Rights Committee on the case of Joseph Kavanagh.Mr. Kavanagh was tried by the Special Criminal Court in 1997 on foot of a certificate issued by the DPP to the effect that the ordinary courts were inadequate to secure the effective administration of justice. He unsuccessfully sought to  challenge that certificate by way of judicial review. The Supreme Court effectively found that it was all but impossible to challenge the decisions of the DPP unless mala fides could be shown which, in turn, was impossible as there was no obligation on the DPP to give reasons for so certifying cases. Mr. Kavanagh made an application under the optional protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.The UN Human Rights Committee found that Ireland was in breach of the covenant in that it failed to demonstrate that the decision to try Mr. Kavanagh before the Special Criminal Court was based upon reasonable and objective grounds. It said the State was obliged to provide Mr. Kavanagh with an effective remedy and to give wide publicity to the decision. A 90-day limitation period was imposed on the Government to inform the committee as to how it proposed to give effect to its views. The Government responded to the Kavanagh decision at the end of the 90-day limitation period. In its response, it referred to parts of the majority opinion contained in the interim report of the Hederman review committee. It made no reference to the views of a dissenting minority or to the existence of such a dissent. Those dissenting opinions called for an end to the Special Criminal Court and argued for a strengthening of measures to protect jury trial. Mr. Kavanagh was offered compensation of IR£1,000, which he rejected.The remainder of the Hederman report was, among other things, to consider the issue of the right to silence, which has already led to adverse findings against Ireland before the European Court of Human Rights. The UN Human Rights Committee had previously, in 1993 and 2000, called for an end to the jurisdiction of the Special Criminal Court in its concluding observations on Ireland's two periodic reports under the ICCPR. There is concern in the international arena, therefore, about the special nature of this legislation. While it is commonplace to lament the shelving by Government of commissioned reports, no tears should be shed if the majority report of the Hederman committee ends up being ignored. I believe this Minister will shed no tears in that regard. As was pointed out by a leading academic commentator, the best way to read that report is to start with the final chapter. It deals with police powers and procedures to combat terrorism and organised crime, apart from those contained in the Offences against the State Acts. Reading this chapter first it becomes clear, to even the most security-driven observer, that the catalogue of such normal powers is so extensive as to defy any justification for the maintenance of the emergency type laws which are the core subject of the report. Mr. Justice Hederman's dissenting view was supported by Professors William Binchy and Dermot Walsh.The majority of the committee, while favouring the retention of the court, recommended various changes in the way it operates. They considered that the threat from paramilitaries and organised  crime was sufficient to justify its retention. However, even among those who supported retention, this was subject to two qualifications: that the necessity for the court be kept under constant review; and that steps be taken to ensure that judges sitting on the court enjoy the same traditional guarantees of independence relating to their tenure and salary, as other judges.They also recommended the Government should no longer appoint particular High Court, Circuit Court or District Court judges to the court, but that all serving members of these courts be eligible to sit on it, with the President of the High Court acting as its president. The majority recommended further that any resolution establishing the Special Criminal Court should automatically lapse unless positively affirmed by resolutions passed by both Houses of the Oireachtas at three-yearly intervals. The interim report also dealt with the issue of the DPP referring specific cases to the Special Criminal Court on the basis of a certificate and recommended that the decision of the DPP to refer certain cases to the Special Criminal Court be reviewable.On the other side, in their dissenting view, the minority of the court felt that the proposed safeguards were not sufficient. They said a fundamental principle was at stake, where one side of the adversarial process was able to decide that an accused forfeited his or her right to trial by jury. They proposed dispensing with the Special Criminal Court, stressing that the right to trial by jury was a cornerstone of the criminal law system and that the case for its suspension had not been made. Other countries with an organised crime problem had not resorted to the abolition of the right to jury trial, they said, and the problem of jury intimidation could be dealt with by anonymous juries or by keeping them in a secure, secret location as is done in some of the other countries. Referring to the threat from paramilitaries, they pointed out that in Northern Ireland, where there were non-jury courts, the British Government had undertaken to move as quickly as possible to jury trials.Even regarding internment, which, unlike the position in the UK, is still legally permitted in Ireland, the committee was divided. The minority adopted a position of absolute opposition. The majority accepted that internment, "could, under appropriate conditions, constitute a legitimate, exceptional response to exceptional circumstances."  That is a bit of a mouthful. The committee seemed to wish to preserve in a stable democracy measures that the Irish Government would strongly oppose in Northern Ireland which is part of the anomaly that exists there. Effectively we have retained a non-jury court whereas the British Government has moved away from it in Northern Ireland.

It is not intended by the tenor of the Constitution, it is against the spirit and the letter of the Constitution and there will always be a reason or excuse for us to have special measures to deal with what are going to be regarded as special circumstances. Unless at some stage we decide to grasp the nettle and deal with it, we will have special legislation on our books forever. One of the things we had agreed under the Good Friday Agreement was to seek to phase out the Special Criminal Court, and to phase out non-jury trials.The Labour Party will be supporting this Bill because we buy into the argument that there is a need for it but we are seriously concerned that this substantial special powers legislation should be going on indefinitely. We hope that before we come to discuss it this time next year that we could have a full discussion of the Hederman report.

When speaking against this law five years ago, my colleague Deputy Ó Caoláin observed that, "Repressive legislation has always helped to fuel the cycle of repression and resistance. . . and the political blunders and legal injustices of the past are now being repeated."  This statement is just as true today.Since 1939 the Offences against the State Acts have operated almost exclusively outside emergency situations, and have also been widely abused. The powers that the Acts give the Garda special branch have turned it into a political police force which has systematically harassed citizens engaged in open, legal and democratic political activity, and citizens with no political involvement of any kind. Section 18 of the Act requires the Minister to report on the operation, and this report is supposed to provide the House with the information on which to base a decision to renew this law.I would be interested to know how many Deputies actually read that report. Anybody who had read it would have seen that it is totally deficient, it provides no evidence that the emergency provisions are necessary, or that the ordinary law was not sufficient for sound convictions. It also provides no evidence that the emergency measures in question have been effective. There is nothing in the Minister's report that assures the House that these provisions have not been abused to trawl for information or intelligence to intimidate political activists engaged in lawful activity. Quite the opposite. For example, it indicates that of 32 occasions in the last year where  extended detention was ordered, only nine people were charged with an offence. There is no indication in the report of the rate of conviction. Furthermore, and without any reason, the Minister wants to reactivate sections 3, 4, 6, 8, 12 and 17, even though these provisions were never used in the period since the last renewal. Thus the Minister has manifestly failed to prove the necessity for reactivating these measures.I call on Members of this House to at the very least reject the Minister's report as inadequate for the purpose of deciding to continue to suspend ordinary rights and freedoms. I call on Members, and in particular the Labour Party considering the statements of the previous speaker, to vote against the Government motion. This is not just a request to back Sinn Féin's call for repeal of the Offences against the State Acts in total but is based on support for the Good Friday Agreement which was endorsed by 94% of people in this State.

Most importantly, I urge Deputies to oppose the continuation of the emergency laws because by so doing they can send a message to those who oppose the Good Friday Agreement in this State and who insist that the Agreement has changed nothing. If the Deputies fail to accept my position and that of my party and vote to reinstate emergency powers and the draconian laws five years on, it will send a message to the opponents of the Good Friday Agreement reinforcing their belief that politics will not work to change things. In their view the Good Friday Agreement will not deliver the restoration of full human and civil rights and that is not the message that this House should be sending. I urge the Minister to let these sections lapse and repeal the legislation as soon as possible.

However, neither I nor my party takes that view, and we therefore oppose the resolution before the House this evening.It reminded me of a decision that had to be made some eight or ten years ago when there was  a very public and strong debate about whether Sinn Féin should be allowed the use of the public rooms of the Mansion House in Dublin for its Ard-Fheis. Several of the issues that we are discussing are analogous to the kind of debate and discussion that went on then. The view against allowing that party to use the round room of the Mansion House was that it was a very public space in this city and that it would send out the wrong signal, particularly to Unionists, to allow Sinn Féin to use those public rooms. The decision was made at that time not to allow Sinn Féin to use them. Looking back, my view is that the decision was wrong. It was easy for those of us living a relatively comfortable existence to deny that group access to the public rooms of the city.Similarly, today it would be very easy to use the example of Omagh and other atrocities to argue strongly for this legislation to continue. However, times have moved on, and, as the ICCL points out, the state of emergency is over. This review obviously has to happen at least annually, but for the Good Friday Agreement to prosper and to bring in the extreme elements on both sides of the violence that has torn apart this island over the last 30 years, we should drop the use of the Offences against the State Act in this instance. It will send out a strong message to everyone who has an interest in the resolution of the conflict.I certainly believe that there are – and, possibly, will continue to be – extreme situations where one can provide strong arguments for the continuation of this law. However, on balance, the perpetuation or continued use of the Special Criminal Court is not the correct message to send out to the various groups and parties and everyone on this island. I understand the harsh circumstances and examples that have been quoted this evening. However, in this instance, it is important to move on publicly and meaningfully, sending out the right message to those watching. I therefore oppose the resolution before the House and the Green Party wishes to state publicly that it does not want to see the use of the Special Criminal Court continue. We believe that there is a human rights violation in non-jury trials, and we will therefore be opposing the resolution before the House.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	516	I am thankful for the opportunity to speak on this motion regarding the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998, which states that sections 2 to 12 and 14 and 17 of the Act shall continue in operation for the period of 12 months, beginning on 30 June 2003. I disagree, and I am disappointed that, in the middle of a peace process and a scenario of conflict resolution, we are not promoting the civil liberties agenda or, more importantly, the sentiments of the Good Friday Agreement. We must move forward, and repressive legislation is looking backwards and undermines our democratic rights. It is also an attack on the whole peace process, which promised radical change and equality. We need reforms, and expanding emergency  legislation and powers under the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998 is against the ethos and vision of the Good Friday Agreement. I would even go further and call on the Government to repeal all the Offences against the State Acts of 1939 to 1998 as soon as possible.Human rights and civil liberties must always be part of our civic society, and any time that we erode them we travel a dangerous and undemocratic path. It is time for cool and calm heads, and past examples of rushing through legislation have shown that major mistakes were made. We should avoid such situations. Let us look at those countries which have turned their backs on human rights or turned a blind eye to civil liberties. They prove that it leads to worse situations, with more violence and more conflict.If Deputies do not believe me, they can ask such people as Nelson Mandela or the people of Colombia – or even of north Belfast. I talked to trade Unionists and lawyers while on a recent visit to Colombia, and the sheer scale of fear, human rights violations and breaches of international law was frightening. That is the type of society in which I would not like to live. If the Minister lived in Colombia, he would be perceived as being left of centre and a target. That is how bad the situation is, for I know that he is definitely not that.Those points are all relevant when we are talking about this motion on the Offences against the State (Amendment) Act 1998. We must listen to lawyers, and particularly human rights groups, which always make themselves available to this House and have appeared many times before the Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights. I commend their great work, but we also have a duty and responsibility as legislators to listen to them. We can all learn and then move forward when discussing legislation. Let me also pay tribute to such great people as Rosemary Nelson and Pat Finucane. They paid the ultimate price for human rights and civil liberties. We should never forget their integrity or bravery.When discussing this motion, we should also examine and include in the debate the question of policing, and particularly of who is policing the police. We urgently need new mechanisms for police accountability. We must tackle police corruption and root out collusion. Simply playing football matches will not solve the serious issue of open, fair and honest policing, for repressive legislation never worked and never will. It always fails, and we should face up to that reality. We should always learn from our history. That of course does not mean that we do nothing, and I accept that. I reject that charge, which is, incidentally, regularly levelled at human rights groups. We all support the rule of law, but as citizens we demand fair policing, and above all fair legislation. That is not happening in tonight's debate, and I will not be supporting the motion.We have a duty to listen to the victims of miscarriages of justice. I will quote one of them, Johnny Walker of the Birmingham Six. He  recently stated regarding his case, "They believed the police and believed we were liars, and it took sixteen and a half years to prove them wrong."  We should always listen to the victims of miscarriages of justice, for we can all learn as legislators. I therefore urge, if one wants to end the threat, that we develop the peace process, tackle injustice and make politics work. That is what the vast majority of people want.

I have listened carefully to what has been said. I thank Deputy Deasy for his support on this matter and Fine Gael for its responsible view. I also thank the Labour Party spokesman, Deputy Costello, for the views that he expressed, many of which I agree with.However, it is simply not good enough to expose the throat of the Irish State and our democratic institutions to those who would quite willingly slit it. I regret that, in the course of this debate, there has been not even one word of condemnation of what happened in Derry the other day from all those opposed to this motion. Their priorities are different. People who put together two bombs in one weekend and prepare to let loose on the innocent people of Northern Ireland a vicious and calculated effort at mass murder must be opposed.

I have made a point of contributing almost every week on Private Members' business when I get the opportunity because it is good use of Dáil time. I have stated frequently that the motions are good opportunities for all Members to contribute. I am not trying to score political points because there are occasions when Private Members' business is  tabled for PR reasons. It is important to use this time well.In respect of the Bill before the House, I support the Government. I became a member of Dublin County Council in 1991 which was succeeded by South Dublin County Council in 1994. I have no doubt that in the past mistakes have been made in the area of development and rezoning, not only in my council authority but in other Dublin councils and in many parts of the country.

I am happy to do that. Through these mistakes, lessons have been learned by both councillors and local authorities. To say that the problems of the past are being repeated is not constructive. This debate shows to some extent that colleagues want to remain in the past. Throughout our communities, constituents are seeking an imaginative policy that secures their future and that of their children. There have been many successes in rezoning.I spent a considerable amount of time last weekend in Citywest Business Park, south of my constituency, where I attended a briefing on future developments. This is a development of which the whole country can be proud. When it was the subject of a rezoning debate in 1991, it was opposed by planners. I am glad that in an area which borders on a disadvantaged part of my constituency great strides have been made in respect of the provision of jobs in a sound environment. If colleagues have not been there already, I would be happy to accompany them.

We have learned a lesson from past mistakes. While some of my colleagues opposite are opposed to the Adamstown project, one of the lessons learned, irrespective of what one believes about the project's merits, is that the concept of providing infrastructure and basic facilities at the same time as providing housing communities has been accepted and Adamstown will be a great success in that regard. The development plans being presented to local authorities are extensively communicated and it is important to continue to strive in that regard. It has often been said to us – whether we are members of South Dublin County Council, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, Fingal County Council or Dublin City Council – that people do not hear about  plans. We should strive to improve communication systems in order that people are aware of development plans. With an input from council officials and members of local authorities, together with community groups, we have reached a stage where development plans will incorporate all the area needs and hopefully continue to be transparent. I intend to vote with the Government at 8.30 p.m. I thank the Green Party for tabling this Bill and giving the House the opportunity to debate the issue.
#MJNolan	unknown-#MJNolan-party	unknown-#MJNolan-dob	unknown-#MJNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	527	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I compliment the Green Party on introducing this Bill because all Members in their daily work as local and national politicians come across planning issues. This is an area where there has been huge growth in the past four years. Generally, our planning laws provide adequate protection for everyone. While some would say too much protection is given to third parties, I do not agree. The Planning and Development Act 2000 tightened up loopholes where abuses occurred during the past ten to 15 years. Given the improvement in the economy in the past 15 years when individual developers made approaches about developments in the area of industry and the construction of business parks, local authorities and local councillors felt obliged to accede to such requests in order that as much investment as possible would be made in their areas. Times have changed somewhat. As a result of the Planning and Development Act 2000 a greater number of individuals, corporations and businesses are interested in developing in and around towns. That is good because we can be selective about what we want in large urban areas. Carlow County Council recently amended its development plan. Most counties have comprehensive and well thought out plans for the development of their areas.One area that has not been addressed concerns An Bord Pleanála, which appears to be untouchable. Some of the decisions emanating from the board are remarkable, apart altogether from the inordinate delays experienced. That so many applications and appeals are made to An Bord Pleanála is a sign of the times and the board is probably under-staffed and overworked but it could certainly improve its PR. To leave it to the last minute to notify individuals and groups, which have made applications, that they will not receive a decision for a further month or six weeks is not good enough.Another group which has taken a major interest of late in planning applications is An Taisce. I would be concerned about some of the individuals in that organisation. Unlike professional planners in local authorities who, in the main, do a professional and competent job, some of these self-appointed amateur planners have much to answer for. I am aware of a number of individuals who had submitted planning applications for section 23 developments, which must be completed by the end of December 2004, who have  been approached by individuals who said they were lodging third party objections to the developments. If the planning authority grants permission they will then submit an application of appeal to An Bord Pleanála. They quite openly say that they know the developer will not have his decision by the end of 2004 and therefore his proposed development will fall. The implication is that if a person plays ball with them and changes his plans to what they want, they will not appeal the particular decision to An Bord Pleanála. That is not good enough.I have sympathy with one or two aspects of the Bill as proposed by the Green Party. However, I understand that the Minister has difficulty with these. A measure in the proposed Bill concerns land which has been zoned or rezoned which is not being used by the landowner. The Green Party proposal is that this should be rezoned. We will have to find a way to deal with this issue. There are difficulties with the proposal in so far as it leaves local authorities open to large compensation cases which is not acceptable. I urge the Minister to examine this aspect. We have seen large tracts of land zoned for residential development not being used. Developers sit on them waiting for the price to increase in order that they may line their pockets with even more profit.The Bill, as proposed, was set down for the right reasons. Perhaps, if we had some more investigation into what the Green Party is trying to change we could do something. For these reasons I will support the Government.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	528	I am glad of the opportunity to speak on this legislation tabled by the Green Party. While I do not agree with the contents of the Bill as put forward, it gives us an opportunity to discuss this important and topical issue. I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Nolan, particularly in regard to the development of county development plans in recent years.As a result of the growth in our population and the decline in emigration there is a new demand for housing and infrastructure throughout the country. Thankfully, this demand is not just confined to urban areas. Deputy Nolan touched on some of the points I wish to raise, one of which concerned objections, particularly the blanket objections that are put forward by An Taisce for no good reason. Valid objections can be put forward to some planning applications but to adopt a policy of objecting in principle to all one-off housing is deplorable.My county, which has suffered significant depopulation over the years, has had a growth of 7% in population in the 1996 to 2001 period. This is the first time County Cavan has experienced such growth since the Famine. We have seen this development and welcome it. Townlands where nobody lived for decades have been repopulated. An Taisce, and others of like mind, object to one-off housing but at the same time they also object to small housing schemes within towns and villages. Where is the logic if a body is opposed to  one-off housing but is also opposed to housing schemes in towns and villages with the necessary water and sewerage infrastructure and also the schools, shops and commercial centres to cater for an increase in population?I have a serious concern regarding An Bord Pleanála which, by its constitution or formation, is not directly answerable to either House. There is a good case to be made for insisting that An Bord Pleanála should come before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government and the Houses to answer to the publicly-elected Members of the Oireachtas. Many public representatives on all sides have been concerned about delays in An Bord Pleanála in reaching decisions on planning appeals.I spoke in the House previously in regard to a case where County Cavan was to get a factory which would create 700 to 800 jobs. The particular enterprise, Teradyne Incorporated from the United States, lodged a planning application with Cavan County Council to develop a major campus which entailed an expenditure of €65 million. The application was processed within the set time by the council and the planning application was approved with some conditions attached. Those conditions were acceptable to the project promoters. Unfortunately for the county, which needs jobs and industry, one individual decided to object to the planning permission. The planning permission was granted in April and then appealed. An Bord Pleanála did not make the decision on that appeal until the end of October or early November.Six months were lost. In the meantime a downturn occurred in the technology industry world-wide and confidence was lowered in the industry. Subsequently, Teradyne Incorporated decided not to go ahead with its proposed investment. A €65 million investment in an industrial campus, with the potential to create a minimum 740 jobs, was lost because of the delay in the planning process. How can one explain that to any second or third level student or any young person who had hoped to return to County Cavan to work? It is hard to explain that our system of public administration will tolerate such delays.A person is entitled to object to a proposed development but surely there is an onus on the administrative system to ensure that major projects are fast tracked and decisions are made without delay. It is not every day of the week that An Bord Pleanála has to make a decision or receive an objection regarding a proposed €65 million investment in an area starved of investment for too many decades.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I commend the Green Party on using its Private Members' time to put forward this Bill. While I agree with some of the sentiments expressed, my major criticism is that what is set out to be achieved in the Bill will not be achieved by what is proposed. I also disagree with some elements of the Bill. As a general principle, I am in favour of parties and groups bringing for ward legislation for consideration in the House as opposed to using Private Members' time in the manner in which it is more frequently used.Much of what is proposed in this Bill has to do with the experience of people who deal, in the main, with the situation in cities and large towns. One of the biggest differences in the contributions on various sides in terms of what is emphasised is that Deputies who represent rural communities tend to place considerable emphasis on the difficulties that arise around the provision of single rural dwellings whereas people from cities and built-up areas tend to be more exercised by the idea of zoning and the profits generated by some people through being able to use and abuse the system as it stands at the moment.While the sentiment of addressing that problem is laudable, I do not believe that what is contained in this Bill will achieve what the proposers intend. To do that we must enter a long and difficult process, such as that currently being undertaken by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution chaired by Deputy O'Donovan. It is that route we need to pursue in order to achieve what is being proposed here. Hopefully that will be possible.In regard to the single rural dwelling controversy, the view of many rural representatives is that people who come from or work in a particular area should be accommodated, within reasonable parameters, in the area. A Deputy said last night that financial pressure on farmers is one of the driving forces behind the sale of sites. However, in my experience, it is more frequently the case that farmers agree to sell sites to neighbours' children because they cannot find a site on which to build a house in the areas towards which the planning authorities might be well disposed. Frequently, such sites are offered at knock-down prices.I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith's point that, regardless of local authority planning policy, this practice militates strongly against the sensible development of villages. In the majority of cases that I have seen and dealt with, the means for processing applications for five, ten or 20 house schemes in existing villages is so cumbersome and attracts such conditions that, in effect, it precludes development in such areas. In addition, the issue of services must also be addressed. More than anything else, the cost or lack of suitable sites in villages is the most important driving force behind the applications for single rural dwellings.One of the difficulties with the planning process is that, in almost any area, fairly arbitrary judgments are made. Even though these are made on professional grounds, aggrieved applicants or appellants are likely to conclude that something underhand is happening on the other side. It is impossible to adequately deal with such attitudes. Therefore, it must be accepted that any system of planning will attract a considerable level of criticism.A number of Deputies referred to the Irish Rural Dwellers Association. Whatever else one might say, one must concede that its members have struck a chord with people in rural areas that many of us in the political parties have singularly failed to. This is a serious issue and one which must be addressed in the county development plans. During this debate, there has been criticism of An Taisce and An Bord Pleanála, both of which I am sometimes critical of, particularly the former. However, I had occasion to deal with an application last year to which there was an objection from An Taisce, which I considered at least sensible, if not entirely sustainable. Ultimately, the local authority, the applicant and An Taisce were in agreement about remedying the problem. However, in what I thought a most peculiar decision, An Bord Pleanála insisted that it would take the appeal through to the end of the process and not agree to allow a second permission, which was about to come into force to deal with the difficulties. The upshot was that the project was built at a most unsuitable size on what was effectively an unsuitable site. It could have been moved 20 yards to An Taisce's preferred location where it would have been more suitable. The developer had no difficulty with it and the local authority was in agreement. On that occasion, the fault for the bad outcome lay squarely with An Bord Pleanála.I do not think what is proposed in this Bill will deal with these difficulties and I concur strongly with the points made by the Minister of State.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Like other speakers on this side of the House, I compliment the Green Party for providing this opportunity to comment on issues regarding planning and development. In my experience, planning and development issues have become tainted as political footballs in Dublin and throughout the country. While I admire the sentiments in the Bill before us, it is poorly thought through although I accept that the resources of a smaller political party are inadequate to develop such a Bill sufficiently. While it contains the genesis of some good ideas, I am extremely reluctant to start intervening in what I regard as the sacrosanct process of planning and the drafting of development plans.In my time on Dublin City Council, I have been involved in the drafting of two development plans; Deputy Cuffe was also involved in one, if not both of these. The city is in the process of working on a draft of a new development plan. Deputy Cuffe and his colleagues on the city council made a positive contribution to the drafting of the last development plan. Much of what was proposed by the Green Party was acceptable. Some of us had difficulties in regard to some, although not many, of the party's proposals.Strategic planning guidelines have been published by the Government, the spatial strategy has been developed and retail planning guidelines and the whole issue of sustainable development  is in the public domain for the first time in order to foster debate and better understanding.I am not sure that the Green Party's proposals will serve the public good at all and some of the Bill's proposals are contradictory. Deputy Cuffe spoke in his usual eloquent and well-informed fashion last night. He referred to the Kenny report, with which I am no longer as au fait as I was. Time has moved on and even though the principles are the same, it is time for us to engage in a new and informed debate on the provision of housing.There is no point in quoting statistics as the Minister did so in his speech last night. The Deputy knows the numbers of housing starts. The track record of the Government and the previous Administration will stand the examination of even the most severe critics on the provision of housing, although the Deputy might disagree with the modalities of the provision. Deputy Shortall is a member of the regional council of which I am a member and supports our work in developing a strong model for the provision of affordable housing.I am not sure whether the Green Party supported the motion, but were it not for the fact that Dublin City Council was able to rezone attractive land at Scribblestown Lane, 120 young couples would not be able to aspire to buying houses in the €150,000 bracket. All the developments we are proposing in Dublin North-West are in the affordable housing category.The Bill provides for a differentiation between the development of State owned and privately owned land. I do not know whether that would work in practice. There is a dearth of State owned or local authority owned land in the city. Must we wait until all that land is developed before the private land around it is developed? I do not know if that would be sustainable. We should not go back to the bad practices of previous development plans. The Planning and Development Act 2000 provided that if land is zoned, it is expected to be developed within a particular period of time. There are people working in Dublin Castle who are millionaires as a result of this type of provision. Developers are sitting on zoned land which they have not developed because they have exploited the deficiencies of previous planning Acts. With the greatest respect to the Green Party, what it proposes in its second amendment to the Act would mean a return to that practice.I do not hold a strong view on whether majorities should be of the order of two thirds. However, a simple majority should be adequate if there is a level of trust among the people and the officials advising the members of the city council. Therefore, this is an unnecessary provision. When we talk about housing, we should look at models such as are used in voluntary housing and the impact they can make. In the housing co-operatives area, sterling work is being done by a group called Tógáil. We are all being parochial here, but this group started with a great scheme in Ballymun. Deputy Cuffe knows all  about it. This group is developing other schemes in my area. Other groups include Respond and Focus Housing. That model of housing has encouraged local authorities to be more aggressive, innovative and proactive in developing housing in their areas. The quality of this model housing is far superior to what I have seen developed by local authorities. There are models of best practice to be seen there. While I admire the sentiments of the Green Party's Bill, the provisions of which merit further development, I cannot support it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	531	I wish to share my time with Deputy Burton.The Labour Party welcomes the publication of this Bill and congratulates the Green Party on its production. It gives us an opportunity of debating in the House issues relating to the planning and development of this country. The Labour Party supports the general thrust of the Bill and will therefore vote for it tonight. There are, however, some points in the Bill with which the Labour Party would have some disagreement. These points could be ironed out if the Government were to allow the Bill to proceed to Committee Stage.This Bill raises two fundamental issues. The first relates to the ownership of development land and its relationship to the zoning and planning process. The second relates to the zoning process itself. This country has seen massive development over the past 30 years. Towns and cities have greatly expanded, and even rural Ireland has been subject to development which in some cases is more appropriate to an urban context. The biggest beneficiaries from this development have been those fortunate enough to own land close to towns and cities whose land was rezoned for development. The zoning process, which is provided for in our planning and development Acts – an essential process that is basically a democratic provision in our planning legislation – has made overnight millionaires of a relatively small number of landowners. This has happened because the decision of the public authorities to rezone the land has, depending on the land's location, increased its value, in many cases by a factor of between 20 and 50.In the view of the Labour Party, the potential for such windfall gains from the rezoning of land had a most negative effect on many areas of our society. Rezoning has contributed enormously to the high prices of houses which have prevented many young people on modest incomes from buying their own homes. It has contributed enormously to the added cost to the taxpayer of the provision of essential infrastructure such as roads, public transport, schools and other public facilities. It has motivated pressure on local authorities to inappropriately rezone land in many parts of the country. It is the single biggest factor behind the corruption of the planning process which is now under investigation by the Flood tribunal  and which has in turn led to an undermining of confidence in local democracy.This issue of the price, cost and value of rezoned land was the subject of an official Government report, the Kenny report, in the early 1970s. The issue was never dealt with. The only attempt to implement the Kenny report since its publication was a Private Member's Bill which was submitted to Dáil Éireann by my colleague, Deputy Quinn, in 1980.The biggest effect of the windfall gains from the rezoning of land is to be seen in the price of houses. It is generally accepted that the cost of a site now amounts to almost 50% of the price of a house. This means that the purchaser of the average new house is now paying between €100,000 and €150,000 to whoever originally owned the site, which was probably worth little more than €1,000 in its original agricultural use.The Housing Statistics Bulletin issued by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government graphically illustrates the changes. Using a 1991 base of 100, the bulletin compares the indices for private new house prices, the average earnings of adult workers, house building costs and consumer prices. Throughout the early 1990s, these indices were consistent, although house prices had begun to open a slight gap by 1996. Comparing 1995 with 2002 the following are the indices: In 1995, the CPI stood at 111 and by the end of 2002, it was 139. Average earnings in 1995 stood at 116, while for the latest date for which figures are available, the figure is 155. The house building cost in 1995 was 114. At the end of 2002, it stood at 170. The house price index stood at 116 in 1995, but by the end of last year had risen to a whopping 296. These figures tell us that house prices, which in the mid-1990s were consistent with inflation, earnings and the cost of building, have increased disproportionately against all three indices. The average price of a new house has increased in that period of time by more than five times the rate of inflation, more than four times the increase in average earnings and by more than three times the cost of building houses.The most significant comparison here is with the cost of building. There is an urban myth that high house prices are due to the high earnings of bricklayers and others in the building trade, the increased cost of building materials, or even to the profits made by builders. This is true only to the extent that the increase in the cost of building exceeds the increase in average earnings. The real story is the outrageous gap which has opened up between the price of new houses and the cost of building them – a whopping 126 points according to the indices of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. This gap is accounted for primarily by the price of building land. These official figures tell us that those who have profited from the high house prices over the past six or seven years have been  the owners of building land, and those who have been speculating in building land.At the very least, one would expect a Government which cared at all for the housing needs of its people to use taxation as its instrument to restore at least some of these windfall gains to the public, in the process calming the profiteering from housing. Instead, the present Fianna Fail-Progressive Democrats Government went in the opposite direction and reduced from 40% to 20% the capital gains tax on these super-profits from development land. The owners of development land have ended up paying a lower percentage in tax than many of the builders' labourers working on their sites.The conclusion that profiteering in building land results in high house prices is not new. It was highlighted in the report of the Labour Party commission on housing in 1999. Some 30 years ago, the same conclusion was reached by the committee on the price of building land, which was chaired by Mr. Justice Kenny.The Taoiseach recently indicated that he wants the issue of building land to be addressed by the All-Party Committee on the Constitution. What is required is not an examination of the issue by the committee chaired by Deputy O'Donovan, but a decision by Government as to whether it intends to do anything about the price of building land. If the Government is not prepared to accept the proposal made by the Green Party this evening, or the argument made by the Labour Party that the Kenny Report or some variation thereof should be implemented, it should introduce specific legislative proposals to deal with the issue.I wish to refer to two points in the Bill presented by the Green Party about which I have some doubt. One relates to section 2 where it is proposed to remove the provision that there would be no presumption that land which is already zoned could not be changed in a subsequent development plan. As I recall, that provision was introduced to allow local authorities to downgrade the zoning of land without the fear of having to pay compensation. Prior to the introduction of this provision, if land was already zoned in a previous development plan which the owner had not developed and a local authority wanted to revisit the zoning, it could not do so without the fear of compensation. This is an issue that might need to be re-examined.The other issue about which I have reservations is the provision for the variation of a development plan. There is already a provision whereby the agreement of three quarters of the members of a local authority is needed to make a material contravention. If we are moving to something higher than a simple majority, it should be at least consistent with what already applies to material contraventions. As regards a variation, is it a good idea to straitjacket a local authority in this way for a five year period? For example, in implementing a housing strategy a local authority might want to vary a development  plan to meet the requirements of that strategy where there is considerable resistance to the provision of social or affordable housing in a certain area. It might be very difficult for a local authority to reach the type of threshold provided for in the Bill. Is it a good idea to remove that flexibility from a local authority?

Like Deputy Gilmore, I have reservations about the technical details of some of the proposals but the Labour Party will support the Bill because it represents an attempt to deal with the excessive greed, which is a feature of land rezoning, and the maintenance of a proper balance between developers and builders making reasonable and sustainable profits and the grossly excessive profits which Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Progressive Democrats have always ensured through the planning process – certainly in the County Dublin area – accrued in excess to certain groups of developers and builders.In recent years, huge changes have been made in planning law, many of which are not appreciated by the public. I want to use my time to outline a case study of one of the Government's strategic development zones at Hansfield in Clonsilla, Dublin 15. Like the development in Adamstown, this is a proposal fast-tracked by new Government planning proposals to provide for an additional 2,000 housing units in an area where, over the past six years, more than 4,000 houses have already been developed and another 2,500 housing units are to be developed under the ordinary planning process.We know more houses are necessary and, as leader of the Labour group in Fingal County Council, I promoted the most successful development by any council of social and affordable housing.

The Fianna Fáil proposal in the special development zone is faulty in that the infrastructure is discretionary but the houses will come. This is after 4,000 houses have been built in Hansfield. We can look at an area called Little Pace, which I invite Deputy Batt O'Keeffe to visit some time, where 4,000 houses have been built and occupied and one temporary primary school structure has been provided.Regarding the 2,000 houses which have been specially fast-tracked by Fianna Fáil for its friends in the building industry, I will quote some of the special pleading which forms part of the one and  only shot people have to make observations on the development plan.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	538	Fenton Simons Limited, a firm of planning and development consultants that operates widely in the Dublin 15 area, stated in its public representations, which are matters of public record, that "the provision of public open space [on the site] is considered excessive particularly when the reservation for the ESB pylons is taken into account."  These pylons run through and dominate this 2,000 housing unit site. For safety reasons, space has been reserved under the pylons and this open space provision is considered excessive. That is what the developers have to say after the Government has fast-tracked the development. Laying the cables underground was not considered, but even the green space under the pylons is considered excessive open space for the 2,000 families who will live in this development over the next four to five years.What do the builders' collective planning advisers have to say about other facilities? A respected firm, RPS McHugh planning and environment consultants, state: "It is our view that there is no demand for additional school facilities to serve the 2,000 houses". Some 2,000 homes can be built and no school places need to be provided. The Government's planning structures make the housing obligatory and it will be built – I do not have a problem with that – but the infrastructure, such as schools, green spaces, etc., is discretionary.Four crèche points are to be provided in this 2,000 unit development, each to have capacity for 50 children. The joint developers state: "We would ask the planning authority to reconsider the allocation of crèche facilities."  This would mean that instead of four crèche points, there will just be two. Instead of there being crèche places for 200 children in a 2,000 house development, there will now be crèche places for 100 children. I hope someone in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government reads this submission in the planning files of Fingal County Council.What do the developers have to say about play points for children, an issue much lauded by the Government? These are not playgrounds, but rather comprise a small slide and swing in large urban areas of intense development where green space has been reduced. The developers state: "The provision of six play areas within the modest scale of development is considered excessive . . . In the light of the above . . . it is requested that  the planning authority amend the provision of equipped play areas from six to two." My heart bleeds for what builders must endure. They have already made millions out of the previously built 4,000 houses to which they have not even had to contribute a school site. Instead, they received €3 million for a temporary school site from the Government.This is what we must deal with constantly when it comes to proper planning and development. That is why, although we have a problem with some of the technical details, we applaud the Bill's introduction and will support it. The defects we have identified could be easily dealt with if it received a further reading. If we are to build the housing that people require, someone in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats Party must put a brake on the excessive greed of developers.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	539	I support this Bill because it is an attempt to address an issue successive Governments have failed to confront. Most Members agree that the breath-taking cost of houses in this State and the massive price increases that have spiralled out of control in recent years are among the greatest scandals of our time. It is impossible to justify the present situation – the scandal of homelessness that is a blot on the State and the huge waiting lists for local authority housing.The average price of private houses in Dublin is now in excess of €320,000, with apartments costing between €250,000 and €500,000. In the background lurk those who profiteer and racketeer in new house prices and land values. A small number of multi-millionaires control the bulk of development land in the Dublin region. This is unsustainable and unjustifiable and no amount of tinkering with the system will change it. The Kenny report in the 1960s demonstrated clearly that radical measures were required but no Government had the courage to implement the recommendations of the report. The present Government has put the issue on the back burner once more. In the absence of any genuine attempt to confront the problem, I support this Bill as a timely measure that focuses on the urgent need to address the housing crisis and end the motivation for planning corruption.Since the non-implementation of the Kenny report we have seen corruption on a Sicilian scale, with a litany of Mafia style accounts being detailed before the tribunals. We have seen how individuals, in their greed to make millions by the stroke of a pen and the redrawing of a line on a map, set out to corrupt public representatives by paying councillors to do their bidding at meetings of Dublin County Council. We heard how so-called lobbyists like Mr. Frank Dunlop were paid large sums of money to get councillors on board. We have seen accounts of Mr. Dunlop herding in councillors and instructing them how to vote on rezoning at Dublin County Council. We have read of the same man turning up unannounced and handing over thousands of pounds to promi nent politicians at election time from unnamed admirers.All of this undoubtedly contributed to the creation of a handful of obscenely wealthy individuals at the expense of the decent PAYE taxpayer, who then spends a lifetime working to pay for a home of his or her own, and countless others who will never be able to afford to purchase a house. The price of development land must be taken out of the hands of such corrupt individuals.This obscene profiteering has gone on far too long. Even in the last few years, when a mildly progressive measure for 20% social and affordable housing was introduced – to my surprise – by a Fianna Fáil Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, the same obsessively greedy developers and builders banded together to obstruct and smash that attempt at reform and fairness. To the shame of the present Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach, this Government capitulated to the developers' lobby, just as surely as some councillors did at Dublin County Council as I have described. That progressive measure of 20% social and affordable housing was effectively abandoned, demonstrating the unseemly political influence of the builder-developer interests in this country regardless of the common good.As a member of Dublin City Council, I have seen few examples of land rezoning but there is currently an interesting planning issue before the council – the case of land beside Park House, a grossly over-scale monstrosity of an office block which was granted planning permission by the Minister for Local Government in 1972. So out of scale was it at the time that the Minister set as a condition of the planning permission that an area of land beside the development must remain as an amenity area in the interests of the proper planning and development of the district, which is overwhelmingly residential. What happened? In a subsequent development plan, the land was rezoned to protect the residential amenity and the zoning permitted the construction of apartments. The councillors' attention was not—

#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	542	I commend the Green Party on the Bill that is before us which I will support. It gives us the opportunity to investigate the scandalous cost of building land and housing.There were proposals in the Kenny report that would have dealt with this situation. As a young local authority official, I recall it was required reading, particularly for anyone going for promotion. There was a general expectation that the report would be implemented and it would have dealt with the scandal of the cost of building land for the past 30 years. Had the provisions of that  report been implemented, the various tribunals across the city would be unnecessary and the undermining of the democratic process, whereby politicians and lobbyists became involved in rezoning, would not have happened.The Bill raises the question of private property. That right exists in the Constitution but it was framed in a context that is fundamentally different from the reality of 2003. The right to private property is not absolute and rooted in it is a social responsibility. The making of exorbitant profits through speculation in land and housing developments is particularly immoral. This Bill would go some way towards restoring the balance between property rights and the common good. That is a balance that has been lost in recent years and needs to be secured for the future.The rezoning of development land should occur in the interests of society. Currently, the price of development land incorporates huge windfall profits for speculators and developers and has undermined the democratic process, as we have seen in the tribunals. Speculators gain as a result of decisions taken as part of the political process when it should be possible to internalise these profits and ensure they flow to local authorities and, through them, to residents of the local authorities. Implementing these procedures would allow local authorities to control the price of development and, therefore, the cost of housing would decrease.The purchase of land by local authorities must be addressed. Compulsory purchase orders are under-used by local authorities. Rezoning of land for particular purposes is a necessity but it is something that has been substantially abused over recent years. A number of changes should be made in the way rezoning occurs. The principal change I would welcome would be the introduction of a law confining the rezoning of land to those lands in the ownership of local authorities.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	543	I welcome the introduction by the Green Party of this Bill which seeks to provide measures to discourage land speculation. The Government and previous Governments have failed to address the disastrous results that have arisen from allowing land speculation to continue unabated. The distorted value of land bought at an agricultural price, once it has been rezoned for housing, is the cause of much of the corruption currently being exposed in the various tribunals. The excessive house prices in the Twenty-six Counties today are the result of the activity of land speculators and the failure of successive Governments to stop this activity. The Government must act now, as there is no sign that the housing market and the price of building land is about to decrease or stabilise without Government intervention. It is unacceptable that speculators and developers should be making huge profits at the cost of the community, which is then unable to house its own members.I want to address the disastrous effects which have resulted from Government inaction on the problem of land speculation. The hoarding of building land by a small number of speculators and developers has helped to maintain the high price of development land, which has resulted in the current unaffordable house prices.There is an unprecedented housing crisis in the State. The average cost of a house in Dublin has now reached €300,000, and the average price of a house elsewhere in the Twenty-six Counties is over €220,000. People on the average industrial wage cannot afford those prices.The housing crisis has led to a fundamental change in Irish society. The possibility of buying one's own home has become increasingly remote for a generation of young people. It has destabilised Irish society because it has created a culture where people see little point in saving because they know there is little or no hope that they will be able to afford to buy a house. Rising house prices have forced increasing numbers of people into an unregulated private rented sector for longer periods. The Government's feeble attempt to regulate the private rented sector, through the Residential Tenancies Bill, has fallen by the wayside and will not emerge again until the autumn at the earliest while the Minister, Deputy Cullen, addresses other priorities such as forcing through service charges.It is the Government's duty to ensure that all households have access to adequate and affordable housing. As part of this obligation, and in line with international commitments given by Irish Governments, the Government must tackle the root causes of rising house prices.The effect of land speculation on the cost of housing can be seen from even a cursory glance at the gap that exists between the cost of constructing houses and the price of houses. As the most significant contributory factor to the price of houses, the price of building land must be regulated.The failure to address the problem of land speculation must be seen in the context of the corruption that was rife in the zoning and planning process in this State for many years. In that climate of accepted corruption, there was no political will among the establishment parties to take on the speculators. Where do these speculators do their private lobbying? When people with disabilities come in here to try to influence legislation, they crowd into the Public Gallery. We saw an example of that yesterday with victims of symphysiotomy etc. Where do the speculators do their lobbying?A number of Deputies mentioned the Kenny report in their contributions. That the recommendations of the Kenny report on the price of building land have remained on the shelf from 1972 to this day is clear evidence of the lack of political will that has existed in the State towards crushing parasitic land speculators. We ought to reflect on how much better off we would be as a  society if the recommendations of the Kenny report had been implemented.The coalition parties must break their ties to the speculators and defend the interest of the ordinary people of Ireland who face a bleak future if this coalition fails to take radical reforming measures to deal with land speculation and the spiralling cost of building land.Sinn Féin is committed to tackling land speculation and has made an extensive submission on this, and other issues, to the Oireachtas All-Party Committee on the Constitution, which is currently examining the issue of property rights. We believe there is a number of mechanisms available to the Government to put an end to land speculation.A code of practice should be implemented to ensure that speculators are not profiting from the development of State-funded infrastructure by local and-or central Government. The State must have the ability to tackle the problem of landowners whose land has been rezoned for housing but who retain their land as a long-term investment. Landowners must not be allowed to profit from decisions which were intended to benefit society and address a severe housing crisis.Compulsory purchase orders should be used against speculators sitting on land banks and derelict properties. Compensation for land procured through the CPO process should, where compensation is necessary, be based on existing use value or existing use value plus a stipulated percentage as outlined in the Kenny report. It would not be justifiable for local authorities to be faced with paying the full market value for land which has been hoarded and which derives much of its value from the actions and decisions of that local authority, for example, zoning decisions and infrastructural development.To curb such speculation, Bacon recommended an annual tax on dwellings which were not owner-occupied. Sinn Féin agrees that the taxation system can and should be used as a mechanism to tackle speculation. Capital gains tax should be restored to its 1997 level of 40%. There should be an increase in capital gains tax on speculative owners of multiple dwellings. In the same way as the Derelict Sites Act allows for a derelict sites levy, legislation must be enacted to impose a levy on those speculators who are hoarding land.The people of this State face a grim future if the Government does not address the problem of land speculation. There has been far too much collusion by successive Governments with speculators and developers. From even a cursory glance at the succession of tribunals, one can appreciate the extent of the nature of that corruption. How can Irish people inflict that on others? An entire generation, mostly young people, are being deprived of adequate housing and are being forced to pay exorbitant rents to live in atrocious conditions. The Government could change all that if it had the will. In the past I called on backbenchers to rise up and ensure that happens  because I have no doubt the Cabinet will not oversee it. The Cabinet does not have the interest, the will or the guts to do it. I call on the Government backbenchers to do it because they will then be able to face the public with a commitment to honour the service they owe to them.

#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	546	This Bill proposes to make a number of changes to the Planning and Development Act 2000 in relation to the adoption of development plans and zoning in particular. However, it is clear from the contributions made by the proposers of the Bill that they are mainly concerned with other matters and the text of the Bill does not reflect those concerns. I propose now to deal with the matters they raised in their contributions.The major issue raised by contributors from the Green Party and their colleagues in the Technical Group related to land costs and the related matter of the Kenny report published in 1973.The Government of the day decided against implementing the central recommendation of the Kenny report, which was that local authorities should have power to designate and acquire land for development at existing use value plus a percentage of that value. An Oireachtas joint committee subsequently examined this matter in 1988 and concluded that there would be constitutional and practical problems in implementing the Kenny recommendations and that the issues would be better dealt with by other means.Subsequent Governments and the Legislature have sought to deal with development land issues through a range of measures, including taxation and improvement of planning mechanisms to permit greater levies on development. More radical measures were introduced by the Government to deal with house prices by increasing housing supply, in particular through the measures set out in Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000.Part V of the Act seeks to obtain gain for the community from the increased land values arising from zoning through the requirement that up to 20% of residentially-zoned land be made available to the local authority at existing use value, rather than market value. Despite claims made last night that Part V had been removed, this is not the case. With the logjam removed by the changes introduced in the 2002 Act, local authorities and developers are now working together to bring forward houses under this measure.The Government intends to address the issue of the cost of land required for development, including its impact on the affordability of hous ing. To move the discussions forward, the Oireachtas committee on the Constitution has been asked by the Taoiseach to assess the possibility of placing a cap on the value of development land. In doing so, the committee will have to consider the constitutional and practical issues involved. The Government will give due consideration to any recommendations made by that committee, including any recommendations for change to the Constitution. In that regard, the decision by the Supreme Court on Part V is welcome, as it appears to indicate new possibilities for the Government regarding restricting compensation for gains made through the planning process.As part of the overall examination of land costs for housing and other major infrastructure, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is also looking at identifying other necessary measures aimed at moderating land costs for housing and other essential public infrastructure. This work will be developed in parallel with the work of the all-party committee.Certain speakers also raised the issue of the role of elected members in adopting plans and variations to development plans and the establishment of a zoning commission. The central tenet in these suggestions is that zoning is not appropriate to local authorities or councillors. Zoning functions are only one of a range of significant planning policy functions for which local authorities are responsible, including adopting housing strategies or the record of protected structures, approving material contraventions of the development plan or specifying other important non-zoning objectives of their development plan.Placing this task at local level is in accordance with the general principle of subsidiarity which means taking decisions at the appropriate level. This is a central tenet of sustainable development and is in line with the recent constitutional amendment enshrining a role for local government in the overall government of the country. It is also the case that land use and zoning functions are generally local government functions in other countries. For all these reasons, land use planning is generally appropriate to decision making at local level.The key challenge is to ensure openness, probity, fairness and efficiency in the operation of the planning system. This is being addressed through the progressive implementation of a series of reforms of planning procedures agreed by the Oireachtas in the Planning and Development Act 2000. The Government intends to maintain close attention to this matter in light of the need to ensure the integrity of and confidence in the planning system.To return to the Bill introduced by the Green Party, the Government opposes it for the reasons set out by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage  and Local Government, Deputy Noel Ahern, in his contribution.

Our lack of competitiveness can be traced back to the housing and transport crises which arose due to corrupt planning which this and previous Governments allowed in recent years. We would give this Bill priority if we considered the social destruction taking place as parents leave their children in the pitch of night to make the long journey from their rezoned houses on the outskirts of the city into jobs located many miles away because of poor planning. In the current circumstances, this Bill should be the first legislation to be introduced by any Government taking office given the waste and wasteful nature of our society caused by poor planning. For these reasons, we intend to press the legislation.If the Government is not interested in the debate and the Minister cannot be bothered to come before the House and speak on it, even though virtually the entire Front Bench turned up last week to blather on the usual Private Members' motion giving out about this or that, that is its problem. We will press ahead with the Bill which addresses a serious issue. We would like the Government to treat it with the same seriousness and I call on the Minister to come to the House to give his view on the areas for which he would like to legislate.Yesterday Deputy Andrews made a valid point, namely, that we should consider taking the same approach as the Finnish Government, which has suggested legislating to solve the problem of significant increases in land values caused by rezoning. He then contradicted himself, in taking a rather arrogant swipe at the Green Party, when we stated our effort to enact legislation in this area was a waste of time. It is not a waste of time. We deliberately raised this issue in order that we could hear from the other parties exactly what their proposals are. We are happy to introduce a Bill concentrating on one narrow, but important issue.The response has been silence or the view that all is well; we are ticking along, making the planning process more transparent and housing supply is rocketing. We received no analysis as to  where housing is being built and what sort of society we are developing as a result. We heard numbers only – housing output has increased to 56,000 units – without any consideration of the fact that the whole country appears to be moving to Dublin. The city is spreading out to the rest of Leinster with people travelling 100 miles to work in it. The Government has offered no analysis, sense of direction or policy on this important issue.If Deputy Andrews were to examine his Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area which he represents and the wider south Dublin area, he would, I believe, be sufficiently concerned to accept the need for this Bill. These areas have suffered more than any others from the corrupt sprawl in which developers are willing to build houses with no bus services or schools nearby for the children who live in them. Our planning is based around the interest of developers in building on land. They are setting the agenda and local authorities are forced to accept it because the developers hold and make the profit on land. This is what drives planning policy and it is not working.We know from an interview with the Minister in The Irish Times some months ago that he does not have a particular interest in planning policy and appears to be happy to have a free-for-all, which is effectively already the case. Despite having strategic planning guidelines, it is clear they are being ignored by all the county managers in their rush to get as much land as possible developed in their respective counties.If Deputy Andrews were to examine the proposed development plan in his county and then listen to the dressing down county managers give to local authority councillors about not having rezoned sufficient land, he will see the current position on planning is unsustainable and incorrect. Large chunks of land are being zoned at an ever greater distance from existing schools, transport infrastructure and resources. The people will have to pay for all the new resources that come with such bad planning. If Deputy Andrews were to address that issue on his local authority, he would do a service.We have failed to provide joined up thinking in planning. The Green Party is proposing legislation which would once again involve the State in the process, not in a Soviet style in which the land is appropriated, but as a mechanism for removing speculative greed. Regulation is the correct approach. There are other options, for example, one could impose a tax on windfall profits. We do not know if the Government would support such a measure, nor what its overall position is, as it appears to be happy to allow the current, untenable situation to continue. It is correct for an Opposition party to clarify what action it would take and it would have been interesting to hear from the Minister what the Government would do if he had bothered to turn up for this debate.

When discussing planning, we inevitably have to reveal where we stand on the issue of property. Mr. Proudhon, who to many represented the extreme left, once famously said property was theft. This notion was clearly not acceptable to those who drew up the Constitution, which enshrines the right to private property. This right must be balanced against the public good. In the words of Thomas Drummond uttered in 1838, "property has its duties as well as its rights." Regrettably, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have forgotten the public good; they have forgotten that property has its duties. This is why they oppose this legislation. While they have said they agree with the sentiments of the Bill, they do not.This Fianna Fáil-PD Administration is the most right wing in the EU. It espouses the 1980s Gordon Gecko "greed is good" philosophy. Nowhere is this better exemplified than in its attitude to planning. To them, planning is not about people, it is about profits for their friends – the landowners, landlords and speculators. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have been good for them and, by God, they have been good for the parties. It is a beautifully symbiotic relationship.The greed of the few has been devastating for the many, particularly in the area of housing. According to the Housing Statistics Bulletin of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of 28 March 2002, there were 48,413 households on local authority waiting lists. This represents a growth of 76.5% from 1996 and shows 130,000 people in need of accommodation; a further 21,452 households cannot meet the costs of existing accommodation. In 1999, this group represented 34% and had increased to 44% by 2002. Clearly, this increase was due to the huge increase in rents. One quarter of people on waiting lists are on it for more than three years. A recent report, "Housing Access for All", states that one third of all households cannot afford a house and this rises to 42% in urban areas.Our Bill envisages the use of compulsory purchases as part of spatial planning. While we recognise that zoning is a necessity, it must be done differently. We would like to see a situation where only lands owned by local authorities could be rezoned. This would mean local authorities would have to first purchase the land, either voluntarily or compulsorily. The land would be bought at agricultural prices thereby eliminating speculation and windfall gains, which would go to local authorities, could go towards the provision of social housing.This Bill is about social justice. It would control the price of development land and therefore reduce house prices. Government Members should think of the constituents on waiting lists  they have to deal with every week. They should also think of what the actions of the Government has done to them.

If we ever get an opportunity to be in Government, we will introduce this legislation. That is why I commend this Bill to the House.The Minister has not bothered to turn up this evening. He cannot tell the difference between depletion of the ozone layer and global warming. Neither can he tell the difference between the needs of those who want to have a house and the needs of the speculators. That is the problem with the Government. It is a disgrace that the Minister has not bothered his barney to turn up here but this is the type of arrogance to which we have grown accustomed. We will not accept it for much longer. The day the Government goes out of office will be a good day for this country.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	556	Ar dtús, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil le mo chomhghleacaithe sa Chomhaontas Glas. I thank the Fine Gael, Labour, Sinn Féin and Independent Members who pledged support for this Private Members' Bill. I also thank members of the Government who spoke well of the Bill. I regret that there has been no contribution from the Progressive Democrats or the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen.It is the failure of the present system, and the Government, to address the huge and growing housing crisis that requires this type of radical action. The housing list has increased under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. According to figures from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the number of those on the list has increased from 27,427 in 1996 – 28% of rental housing stock – to 39,176 in 1999 – a massive 40% of rental housing stock – to the most recent figure from 2002 that was up to 48,413 – a huge 47% of rental housing stock.This is bad enough, but in the process a cabal of developers has increased its wealth in these years by speculating on agricultural land on the off chance that local authority members will oblige with a vote to rezoning that land for development. While wealthy developers bide their time, the 50,000 or so households struggling and anxious to get a rented home also have to wait. Of these, 25% have been waiting for a house for more than three years, 14% have been waiting for between two and three years and 22%  have been waiting for between one and two years. This is a real sickener for anyone who believes that having a place to live is a fundamental right. An Taisce also believes in the need for a place to live. It is a voluntary organisation and is not funded by Government, as some Members misguidedly think.For those homeless citizens forced to survive the bed and breakfast circuit and walk the streets by day, they could go to the Flood tribunal at Dublin Castle to get out of the rain. Apart from staying dry, the homeless citizen could eavesdrop on the evidence that explains why local authorities are unable to deliver the necessary number of houses and how certain developers had – and may still have – control of certain elected members and officials that would rezone land for payment in order to maximise personal profit and, in effect, minimise affordable or local authority rented housing stock.Our Bill would have two major effects. It would assist local authorities to purchase land at little more than agricultural prices in order that windfall profit from rezoning would go to the local authority rather than offshore private accounts. This is not only a measure to make available affordable land for affordable and local authority housing; it is also a measure to remove the greed factor behind so many rezoning decisions in the past. If anyone is to benefit from rezoning it should be the community as a whole and not a landowner, political party or individual councillor. Such is the power of certain developers that they are now wealthy enough to offer school or club facilities on condition of getting their way with rezoning votes or planning permissions.I urge the Government to accept this Bill, which is about ending waiting lists for housing. It is also about doing away with corrupt practices that have dragged the planning process, and politics, to such a level of ignominy. Let us learn from the Flood and Moriarty tribunals. Let us give Mr. Justice Flood something to smile about in his retirement by removing the temptation to profiteer from the development and planning process.If the Government votes down this Bill, it should be warned that it will not go away. Given that it is meeting throughout the summer, the All-Party Committee on the Constitution will hear appeals again and again for this type of legislative change from groups such as CORI and others. If the Government believes in democratic accountability, people before profit, and the right of each citizen to basic needs such as shelter, I urge it to support this Green Party-Comhaontas Glas Bill, An Bille um Pleanáil agus Forbairt (Leasú) 2003.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I do not propose to detain the House. There is a threat. There are those who are hell bent on causing mayhem, murder and the destruction of people's lives and property. It would be naive of us to think that we should dismantle our legal defences against that threat in present circumstances. The argument has been made that we should take the initiative and the risk and hope that they would be inspired by a dismantling of the legal protections in place to become more political. I admire the optimism of those who believe that, but consideration must be given to the dedicated way in which the dissident republican bodies have set about a calculated campaign to subvert the Good Friday Agreement and the risks they are prepared to take to kill other people. This is not simply a matter of legal preference but life and death. Last weekend in Derry we all saw how close we were to another mass murder atrocity being committed with a view to dividing Northern Ireland and repolarising it yet again, so as to undermine the Good Friday Agreement, destroy the political centre and make the extremists on both sides get into the political ascendancy. When all these factors are considered, one must hesitate when invited to accept the proposition to make a bold gesture by dismantling defences and leaving oneself defenceless against such a ruthless, anti-democratic, murderous and vicious conspiracy within the State.I echo Deputy Costello in that many of the views expressed by the minority in the offences against the State review are correct. We must always see jury trial not simply as desideratum but the norm towards which we are duty bound to re-establish the legal regime in our country. We have probably been derelict in the past in seeking to identify ways in which jury trial can be strengthened against ruthless people who would threaten jurors, including organised criminals who would not hesitate to blow the head off anybody – witness or juror – if they could avoid a prison sentence. Other countries have sustained jury trial in circumstances far more difficult than some of the ones we face. For example, organised crime in the United States has waged a half cen tury long war with the American state, yet jury trial has not been sacrificed as a response. We can move to strengthen jury trial.When I launched the offences against the State review in Dublin Castle, I expressed the hope that the political dynamic in Northern Ireland would lead to the circumstances in which an entirely changed situation would have made it possible in the short run to do away with the Special Criminal Court. I will not become involved in an argument here as to why that has not been possible, save to say that the discovery last Saturday of a 1,200 lb bomb in Derry, fully primed with explosives, and of a similar but smaller bomb in north County Louth shows beyond doubt that the threat is still there and that there are people who are willing to exploit the vacuum in Northern Ireland political affairs with a view to maximising polarisation and rekindling an undeclared civil war among the people there. We must move on from that.I passionately believe in jury trial and in the civil liberties of accused persons. If I could for one moment identify with the optimism of Deputy Finian McGrath and others, which is effectively to take the bold step and put behind us all of these extraordinary measures that have had to be taken to defend our democracy against this subversion, and for one minute in good conscience go down that road, I would do so. However, history and events would shortly show me up to have been extremely naive. A gesture of that kind will not be reciprocated in any sense by subversive republicans. They would regard it as open season and would commence an onslaught against the institutions of this State and against the peace process in Northern Ireland. They would regard it as an act of supreme naivety and folly were the Legislature of this State to abandon its defences against a murderous and well-planned campaign to undo the Good Friday Agreement.We will return to this motion regularly. It is my fervent hope that on the next or subsequent occasion on which we do so, this House will be able to take a different court. I am clear that everybody who supports democracy and the rule of law should not falter or run out of moral courage at this juncture. I accept fully what has been said by some of the Sinn Féin commentators on this debate that there is a sense in which all of us wish to move on to new territory and to put the past behind us. While these events are reflective of the past, I do not accept the proposition that it is right to experiment with the very safety and integrity of the State itself. I cannot experiment with it while hoping against hope that people as vicious as those in question have demonstrated themselves to be would reciprocate a gesture made by this House by calling off their activities and by stopping trying to kill people. All the evidence available to me suggests that any such gesture would be laughed at and scorned before being thrown back in our faces. I regret that we find ourselves in these circumstances.

As far as I am aware there is no printed version of the Bill following Committee Stage, which is an extraordinary state of affairs. We had the saga of the fisheries Bill which was dealt with adroitly in the House by the Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, and as the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, probably knows, I asked the Taoiseach to consider Deputy Browne for promotion to the Cabinet given that he had taken—

The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has the second longest list of outstanding legislation after the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

We somehow got through that and are now dealing with this Bill of which there does not appear to be a printed copy. I could not get one and Deputy Coveney did not get one.

With regard to these amendments there is a precedent for not accepting this type of amendment in the Industrial Development (Enterprise Ireland) Act 1998 and the IDA Act 1950 in that the name of the agency was not given an Irish translation. The reason is that those Bills and this one have an  international remit. The Bill will be translated into Irish generally in any event, but it is not proposed to specify the agency's Irish title in the legislation.

A major amendment is proposed on page 27 between lines 18 and 19 concerning ComReg and the provisions for the members of ComReg. That could have been anticipated so the Minister will have to bear with me in my general point. When I was my party's spokesman on social welfare and Deputy Ahern was Minister for Social, Community and Family Affairs, we worked on what we received in the initial Bill but this has not been the case here. I do not want to take up my colleagues' time as we have only 45 minutes in which to discuss the end of this important Bill which is being guillotined. It was on the agenda three or four times at least as a back-up Bill and was never taken. It should have been passed three years ago.I accept the Minister's comment about this amendment although I do not see what harm it would do to have the title in Irish.

The first official language of this State is Irish and next week we will debate the Official Languages Bill, which proposes to put the language back in first place in dealings with all State bodies. Here we have a Minister saying that because the digital hub is international, its title should be in English only. The titles of other international bodies, such as Bord Fáilte, are in Irish. The first title for this body should be in Irish. I have no problem with it being translated and if the title of the IDA and other bodies were in English only in the past, we should not replicate those mistakes. We should ensure that the first and official title of this body would be in Irish.

In page 7, line 2, after "Finance" to insert "and the Houses of the Oireachtas".As we do not have much time, I will try to skip through my amendments as quickly as I can. I recognise that most of the decisions regarding the digital hub need to be matters for Government in order that it can make a decision and move on. I  have tabled this amendment not because I want the Oireachtas to be involved in every decision regarding the digital hub, but because if a decision is made to extend the hub or to move a section of it to another part of the city or country that should be a matter for the Oireachtas to discuss. We have invested a large sum of money in the creation of the hub which I hope will be a great success and if we are extending or expanding that project, it will involve significant sums of money which need to get the go-ahead from the Minister of Finance. It is not unreasonable to suggest this needs to be debated and decided on by the Oireachtas as well as by the Minister.

My understanding is that the Minister may order, presumably on the recommendation of the Executive, that the digital hub be extended or expanded.

In page 7, lines 3 and 4, to delete ", contiguous to the boundaries of the digital hub".We had a long discussion on this on Committee Stage. The Minister was not there, but the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, and the Opposition parties had a long discussion. It was their view that the existing wording in the Bill may be too tight in its meaning, since it is essentially saying that, if the digital hub is to expand, it can only do so if the area of expansion is attached to its existing footprint. My proposal is that we leave everything else intact, deleting only the words ", contiguous to the boundaries of the digital hub". That gives the Minister and the Government the option of extending the digital hub concept and reality to perhaps half a mile away from where the existing digital hub is. I see no downside to accepting my amendment. The Minister of State, Deputy Browne, said at the time that the reason for having the present wording was that he wanted to keep the digital hub in a specific area of the capital which he was revamping to make into an IT centre, with all the other positive aspects which the digital hub has to offer. We can keep that strategy intact if we accept my amendment. There is no threat to it. However, if we decide for whatever reason in the future that we wish to extend the digital hub perhaps a mile away from where the existing footprint is, we are prevented from doing so under the existing wording, and that is why I propose that the last eight words of that paragraph be deleted.

On Second Stage, I referred to several foreign cities, including Seoul in Korea and Kuala Lumpur in Malaysia, where about 500  sq. km. – an area about the size of the old County Dublin – is effectively a digital hub with very fast broadband, media, e-learning and all the other kinds of facilities which are clustered here. I tabled amendment No. 4 because it seemed to me that there is a very coherent district represented in Dublin City Council, one of our five area committees, or "boroughs" as one might term them – the south central area. It is in the old historic heart of the Liberties, the old industrial centre. I am looking at an aerial map of the existing plans for the hub.Obviously, there is logic behind having closely clustered e-commerce, e-media and e-learning facilities. However, it seemed to me when we made the choice, and going on the early discussions, that some of our third-level institutions such as Trinity College, Dublin Institute of Technology and so on, felt discomfiture that they had not initially been involved and that we had looked to the United States. There is an opportunity to say from the start that we could expand the hub to the whole of the south central district of Dublin city, perhaps as a prototype. I am not ruling out similar developments in Cork, the Acting Chairman's own important centre of Killarney or elsewhere around Ireland.

I do not disagree with amendment No. 3, but there is a coherent area in the south central area of Dublin city, and perhaps we might say upfront that the possibility is there. I know that the Minister has specifically and very clearly designated the area at the end of the Bill, but I thought he should consider it. I tried to reflect that in other amendments too, since I felt that the south central community should be directly represented on this  board, particularly given the history of the project.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I cannot accept either amendment, for the whole rationale behind this legislation is to ensure that companies have a competitive edge, and to do so they must be clustered within a small area. If we extended it, or allowed it to be extended, more broadly, even over relatively short distances of a few miles – not to mention down to Cork, the north side of Dublin, Dundalk or Killarney – that would dilute the whole rationale of what a digital hub is about. It is an attempt to have a centre of excellence within a very small geographical area. That was the specific reason those words were inserted into the Bill. However, any new areas added need not be exactly adjacent to the existing area, even under the wording that is there. It would depend on the circumstances in each case.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	607	Perhaps the Minister could clarify what the words ", contiguous to the boundaries of the digital hub", mean.

I agree with the Minister when he says that for the digital hub to work it must be a confined space. We should not extend it to other areas until we have proof that it works here. However, if in a year or two we decide that the concept of a digital hub should be expanded somewhere else to create another centre, perhaps in Dublin, it surely makes sense for the executive that has been successful in this digital hub to be able to expand its power somewhere else. We are attempting only to leave the option open. No one is suggesting that we double or treble the size of the digital hub and spread it across a ward of Dublin. It is eminently reasonable, but clearly the Minister is not going to accept it.

In page 7, to delete lines 8 and 9.I heard the Minister's reply to the earlier comment regarding section 5. The spirit of this amendment was to curtail the power of the Minister, who had extended the narrowly-circumscribed boundaries.I would still prefer if it were open to the full expansion of the south-central district of the city. The spirit of my amendment seeks not to leave it open to the Minister to reduce the area in question. In other words, the Minister would have to come back to the Oireachtas if it is covered by section 5, as he said in respect of an earlier amendment.

In page 7, line 35, after "property," to insert "equity or investment holding,".Could we also take amendment No. 11 with amendment No. 8 because the two are related although they are not grouped for discussion?

I shall address No. 8 first, but my arguments may wander slightly. While no amendments were accepted on Committee Stage, we had a good and lengthy debate. I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has conveyed to the Minister his opinion that amendments Nos. 8 and 11 should be considered as he thought they contained much wisdom and would add to the Bill. Unfortunately, we did not pass it on Committee Stage but, hopefully, we can do so on Report Stage.The concept I have is not necessarily that the agency would become a major equity or stockholder in its work, but at the same time I wanted to leave the option open. On amendment No. 11,  I was seeking to provide the agency with the ability to be as enterprising as possible in its operations. There is a great deal of concentration on bricks and mortar in the digital hub and already most of the money has been spent in this area. Many of the provisions in the development plan for the Bill relate to property. Coming as he does from one of the most enterprising areas in the country, the Minister will be aware that enterprise does not come from bricks and mortar but from imagination, communication, innovation and sometimes from parties and strange circumstances.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	618	Geography.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	619	It is important to encourage the agency to develop an enterprise culture to look at the option of setting up venture capital funds, innovative sabbaticals or schemes where students can work part time in companies or workers can leave companies and go into the third level research field for a certain time. It should seek to strengthen specifically the educational links between a national college of art, Media-Lab Europe and companies in the digital hub, and concentrate not on a bricks and mortar centre but on a place where social and cultural activities take place which would enhance an enterprising culture. I do not want the budget to go down the Swanee of chardonnay and press receptions where expensive budgets are thrown at PR consultants. It is important to recognise that if the digital hub is to work, it must be more than bricks and mortar. If the agency is to have a valuable role, it will have to consider innovative techniques, such as setting up venture capital funds not necessarily for the State or the agency to invest in but primarily for outside bodies. We should not rule out the possibility of the agency taking seed capital in a small holding. That is the spirit and the purpose my amendment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I appreciate the Deputy has put much thought into this amendment. However, I draw his attention to section 13(3) which states:The Agency may, with the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Finance, acquire, hold and dispose of shares or other interests in a company and become a member of a company.What the Deputy wishes to achieve is already provided for. Therefore, I do not see any need to accept the amendment.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	621	I take the Minister's point about section 13. I would argue that the purpose of any such holdings, largely with regard to subsidiary companies, is that they carry out the work of the agency rather than hold equity stakes in companies which may not necessarily be involved in the actual bricks and mortar work of the  agency on a day to day basis. I take the point that section 13 allows the agency to have a shareholding in another company. My reading is that it is primarily for the purpose of its own operations, rather than holding investment stakes in other companies. Even if it duplicates section 13, there is no harm in replicating that intent in the section with which I am concerned.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	622	If the Deputy examines section 13(2), he will see that the agency is allowed to enter into joint ventures or partnerships for the purpose of fulfilling any of its functions. In effect, it could enter into the type of liaisons suggested by the Deputy.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 8, line 2, before "enterprises" to insert "new or expanding".I pressed this amendment to a vote on Committee Stage and was unsuccessful. I understand the point the Minister made at the time that we do not want to give the impression by the wording of the legislation that certain enterprises are not welcome in the digital hub. Certainly, that was not the intention of my amendment. I was attempting to emphasise that we are trying to promote and drive new and expanding enterprises, as opposed to facilitating existing enterprises or businesses that may be accommodated in Citywest or wherever at present. The whole idea behind the digital hub is that it would offer something new in Ireland, a facility that would attract new business or encourage existing business to expand. I had hoped the Minister would bring forward a wording to address those concerns but he chose not do so. While I understand the point the Minister made, we could have put a wording in place that would emphasise that we are seeking to attract new or expanding businesses as well as welcoming existing firms in Ireland to come to the digital hub should they be deemed suitable. The wording of my amendment does not eliminate the possibility of an existing company in Ireland relocating in the digital hub. All it does it put a change of emphasis on what the hub is for, which is to attract new and expanding businesses or technologies. This was the whole purpose of the digital hub and hence the reason for the amendment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I understand what the Deputy is seeking but the words "new or expanding" would restrict the type of enterprise that could go into the digital hub – neither I nor the Deputy would want that – particularly a company which is successful abroad and may wish to set up a sub-company in the digital hub for a particular reason. From that point of view, we could not see how we could put one's view into words other than in  the strategic plan which the authority would bring forward from year to year. The intention is that it would be new, innovative companies but we cannot be prescriptive. If we were we might well exclude an agency or company that would be of benefit to the digital hub in the future.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	625	The reason I was comfortable with this wording was that this section of the Bill states, "The functions of the Agency shall be to. . . " It then formulates strategies to encourage. It asks the agency to formulate strategies to encourage individuals and enterprises to come to the hub. Existing agencies may well come to the digital hub but we do not need strategies to attract them. The strategies required are ones which will attract new investment or expand existing businesses. By accepting my wording we would not exclude a Microsoft, Dell or Apple from relocating into the digital hub. However, the strategies we are asking the agency to follow should primarily be about new and expanding businesses.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 8, line 12, after "interests" to insert "and their representative social, economic and cultural development bodies".This refers to one of the functions of the agency and seeks to amend section 8(g) which is to “consult with local community interests in or adjacent to the digital hub”. I wish to extend that to include the phrase, “and their representative social, economic and cultural development bodies”. It is a weakness of the Bill that as a result of the behaviour of the Government in imposing guillotines, it has wasted many weeks since last July and we are now trying to run our way through important legislation in a couple of minutes.This amendment is related to my amendment No. 23 in which I seek that of the 14 members of the digital hub agency at least two would represent community bodies in the digital hub and adjoining districts. One of these should be a worker representative from the companies working in the agency area and one should be a city councillor. It is astonishing that it is not proposed that a locally-elected public representative be here. We have the city manager. I do not expect we will get to that amendment because my colleague has yet to move amendment No. 11, which is important. If we had time, this is an issue on which I would call a vote. I ask the Minister to reconsider amendment No. 21, and this related amendment.The south central area of Dublin city includes our rebel Liberties, historic Thomas Street and James's Street and the historic echoes of Robert Emmet, Theobald Wolfe Tone, Henry Grattan  and the great fathers of Irish republicanism, the historic Liberties city and the Guinness workforce and their historic contribution. It is astonishing that we do not say directly that some of their representative bodies, SICDA, the south inner city partnership, and all the other bodies, should be consulted. My part of the city learned about community development from the south central part of the city 20 years ago.One of the problems we have with this legislation is that the local academic institutions and local community bodies received no consultation whatsoever. In regard to the private company that operated the district, we had the astonishing situation where the Comptroller and Auditor General criticised it in his report. This is what we are legislating on.The Minister should accept amendments Nos. 10 and 21. We want people who are directly elected. We have had enough of quangos and non-elected intendants or whatever, dictating policy. We need to have community involvement. Clearly they should be expert in digital media developments, that is what we want. I applaud the effort that has been made to liaise with the local schools and local community. However, there should be direct representation for those outstanding local community bodies who have done so much to pull Dublin south-central, and this historic part of it, up by the boot straps. They should be included in the Bill.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	627	I support what Deputy Broughan has said. In case we do not get to it, I also recognise the Minister's amendment No. 23 (a) which includes on the agency a representative of the local community in the digital hub. It also includes the city manager and an officer from Dublin City Council nominated by him or her. That is progress and clearly the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, was listening to Deputy Broughan when he made these points on Committee Stage.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I support Deputy Broughan particularly in regard to amendment No. 23. I do not have a copy of the Minister's amendment No. 23 (a). I would find it remarkable if the Minister did not accept that a member of the city council should be on this sort of body. The local authority is under enough attack at present in terms of withdrawal of its powers. In those circumstances to give the city manager a position and not a member of the actual council would be remarkable. I would put a city councillor on the board first ahead of a community representative because ultimately councillors represent the democratic processes of State and the people of the local area. They should have a position on the council.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	629	I would not want the message to go out that there was no consultation with local  communities. There was substantial consultation which involved dealing with residents' associations, community groups, business representatives and public representatives. It included over 150 meetings. Contacts were established with some 140 community groups and a questionnaire was distributed in early 2001 to 10,000 postal addresses in the area.We have looked at the issue. As Deputies have indicated, under a later amendment I propose that we bring forward an amendment whereby we would allow a representative of a local community in the digital hub to be on the board and also the city manager or an officer of Dublin City Council. It would be possible for a member of the city council to be on the board as the representative of the local community. That is not excluded. As far as I am concerned that amendment does deal with the issue of local community interests, which is the term in the legislation and which is appropriate to cover all the circumstances required.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 8, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following:"(j) formulate strategies to encourage co-operation between companies operating in the digital hub area and third level educational institutions in research and development projects;(k) liaise with local educational and research institutions including the National College of Art and Media Lab Europe to promote the sharing of facilities, information and skills within the area;(l) arrange cultural and social events to encourage interaction between those involved in different companies in the hub and in other relevant institutions;(m) permit the provision of an employment advisory centre for small businesses operating within the hub and arrange possible internship/scholarship schemes for third level post graduate students temporarily working with companies based in the digital hub;(n) where appropriate, establish venture capital funds for the investment equity seed capital in enterprises established within the digital hub. The Agency may publish an annual report outlining the status and extent of such investments and the criteria for the management of the fund.”.Another example where a cultural centre worked or where a cluster was created which produced creativity, ingenuity and other activities relates to  the Spanish poet Lorca. If I remember correctly, he was based in Madrid for a time in a state institution which was deliberately designed, built and developed to encourage cross-fertilisation between different artistic disciplines. In that period of time he met Picasso and Miro. They were brought together by this institution at a young age. A remarkable flowering resulted from that. Clusters can be very successful when trying to develop creativity.How do we develop that type of creativity? I mention Lorca and Miro because it is people of that stature we should attract into the digital hub. We want people with imagination and people from outside the loop who will provide the products people will want tomorrow. They will provide the digital content we will want. That is what we should aim for if that is the type of centre we want to create.We must think beyond the bricks and mortar. We must look at things like venture capital, as Enterprise Ireland is already doing. Venture capital funds allow small seed capital stakes to be taken in small businesses. We must look beyond that also. We should look at scholarship systems for educational establishments which would link in with the companies in the hub. We should look at cultural and social events so that we get the type of creative hub for which we are looking. We must go beyond the bricks and mortar.I hope the five sections I include in my amendment, which would fit in well with any potential development plan, would be an addition to the Bill. They would not restrict the agency in a manner that it would have to be compelled to include them in its thinking. Rather, it would have the option of doing so and be steered towards it.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I appreciate the efforts the Deputy has made in regard to this amendment. Much of what he refers to will be dealt with in the development plan that the agency will bring forward. It has already produced plans for the development of the hub and an updated plan, in line with this section of the Bill, is already in place.In regard to paragraphs (j) and (k), I refer the Deputy to section 9(2)(d), which adequately caters for the situation to which the Deputy refers. The digital hub has already been involved in a number of successful cultural events in the area involving the local community and some of the companies in the area. The support for small business, as referred to the Deputy's suggested paragraph (m), is central to the strategy which has been enunciated by the DMDL to date. The digital hub offices have been designed to include facilities for this very purpose. In addition, the digital depot, previously known as the Guinness printworks building, is being refurbished as a joint venture between DMDL, Dublin City Council and Enterprise Ireland. In effect, that means  that small companies will have access to the expertise of this development agency as well as the support and advice available from DCC in the context of the integrated area plan for the Liberties and the Coombe.The reference to the internal scholarship scheme also goes into detail which probably is unnecessary in legislation. However, such arrangements form part of the longer term aims of the digital hub. This will be dealt with in the development plan that the agency will produce. With regard to the proposed paragraph (n), I agree that there is considerable potential for the agency in its role as a supporter of new enterprise. Again, I draw the Deputy's attention to sections 13(2) and (3), about which we had a debate earlier.Regarding the question of reporting, it is a standard requirement of the agency to include any investments in its annual report under the Department of Finance code of practice for governance of State bodies. Therefore, on that basis, many of the Deputy's suggestions would be better dealt with in the development plan.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I take the Minister's point that aspects of the amendment could be read into various sections, including section 13, regarding the venture capital fund. However, it is stretching it to suggest that the idea I have proposed could be included under section 13.If we are setting direction to the digital hub development agency, all we are asking it to consider in the development plan is the management and refurbishment of property. That is down to fairly basic minor detail, its having to consider the disposal and acquisition of property and setting a budget. We are setting the board a fairly straight-laced approach in terms of what it can read into the legislation.I take the Minister's point about paragraphs (j) and (k) in my proposed amendment in that paragraph (d) caters for the educational aspect. Therefore, I will not press those points. However, the other three proposals are a valuable addition to the Bill. If we do not insert them, the new manager of the digital hub may say that his or her job is to run a property business, keep the budget tight and occasionally involve educational institutions. I hope the Minister sees the wisdom in using this legislation to make a statement that we are looking for an agency with pep, one which is innovative and one which is making creative decisions. If we maintain it as a property management company and merely require its budgets in the development plan, we are setting a narrow agenda for this agency from the start.

It would be helpful if these five additional paragraphs were accepted because it would set out in  law, from the start, the need for the hub to remain innovative, to have a dynamic and to be creative. Otherwise, we cannot guarantee that whatever dynamism or innovation is there at the start remains in future. There may be some repetition involved but if it is laid out in the five paragraphs, in addition to the other specific responsibilities which are prescribed in the section, it would be helpful and encourage the type of ethos and vision that is in line with the thinking of the people behind the digital hub. The amendment should not be rejected.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	634	I cannot say any more than I already have said. All of the issues to which the Deputy refers will be taken care of in the development plan under the functions of the agency. It is unfair to say that the agency will be a property development company. It is not. The whole idea is that the agency will work with the local community from an entrepreneurial and enterprise perspective, but also to integrate with the community and make it a vibrant area, not just for enterprise, but for culture. That has already been taken care of and is identified in the Bill.

In page 8, to delete lines 36 to 41.These amendments were prompted by the history of the project. I do not want to go back over the Second Stage debate. However, I made the point that the two major projects launched by the Taoiseach were perhaps to be a memorial to him when he passes on to some other destiny. The way in which this and the Abbottstown project were established through private companies left much to be desired.In this case, we had the extraordinary situation whereby the chief executive of Digital Media District Limited, Mr. Paddy Teahon, had to resign when it became known he was on the board of a property company, Insignia Richard Ellis Gunne, which was involved in the purchase of property for the portfolio of the digital hub. The Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Browne, said this referred to ancient history. However, since we have had this situation, it is correct to raise it in the House. The project and the first company which ran it was seriously criticised by our distinguished Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. John Purcell, on the basis that great public projects such as this should not be managed by private companies. The Taoiseach should have looked after the project at Abbottstown,  which was his big one, and this one, which was a minor one, of which he did not take sufficient care.My amendments were tabled on the basis that I am fearful of events which happened before we reached the stage of the present chief executive and chairperson.

He was unfair in what he said. The man named was involved in this enterprise and was successful in getting it up and running. The reason he opted out was on the basis that there was a possibility that a company with which he was involved might make a proposal, which it did do not in the end, to be part of the development of the area. The Deputy should be careful about what he says in that respect.In regard to his gratuitous remark about Abbottstown and this project, these are flagship projects and, as the Taoiseach said today, there are not many people complaining about the aquatic centre, about which there was a great deal of controversy. The aquatic centre is now one of the showcases of the Special Olympics. The Deputy is unfair in what he said.

#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I understand that amendments Nos. 53 and 56 are being discussed together. The Bill stipulates who will be the members of this commission, namely, the Ceann Comhairle, the Cathaoirleach, an appointee of the Minister for Finance who must be a Member of either House, four Members of the Dáil, three Members of the Seanad and the Secretary General. These amendments propose that, in addition to those 11 members, there should also be two members of the staff of these Houses. They propose an opportunity of voting for two staff members to the commission.In this day and age, it is ridiculous to set up a body such as this, which will ignore the staff of the Houses. We have 226 elected representatives between the Seanad and the Dáil and 800 to 900 members of staff. Their fate in terms of salaries, terms of employment and working conditions will be determined by the commission. However, this Government does not see fit to give them a say in the running of the Houses by allowing them to elect members to this commission. This is regrettable.I have been in Leinster House for 14 years. In those 14 years, I have never encountered anything but courtesy from the staff of these Houses. Wherever one goes, from the front gates, where one meets the ushers, to the general office, from one's office to the restaurant and the bar, one meets helpful, courteous and dignified people. I have yet to meet someone who is not worthy of working here or who does not do a good job. It is negligent of this Government to turn its back on those staff members.I cannot understand how the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, will not concede to staff members being on the commission. I hope when he replies that he will outline some logical reasons why those people are excluded. Is the Minister of  State afraid to have staff members on the commission? Is he afraid they might have some say in the running of these Houses? They would bring much to the commission in their involvement in the running of these Houses. The Minister of State, unfortunately, is presiding over a situation that will exclude them. In recent decades, we have had a system of State boards on which there are worker-directors. However, in the Parliament, we are setting up a commission and ignore any possible input from the staff. There is no logical reason for this. It amazes me that we can preside over this exclusion.Ministers may wonder how we will proceed with this issue. I assure them I will call for a vote on this amendment. The Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Members can then pass through the lobbies and state that they do not want staff members on this commission. That is the question that will be put to them. Then they can go out of this Chamber and see the people on whom they have turned their backs who will feel they are not worthy of becoming partners in the running of the Houses. By becoming partners, the staff will become the guardians of democracy in this State.What is the logic of such exclusion? I do not want a highfalutin response from the Minister of State. I want clear, straight facts why this Government does not want staff members on this commission. We must hear a full and logical explanation and must set it out clearly to staff why the Government is turning its back on them.We have excellent, courteous staff members who do their jobs extremely well and of whom we can be proud. When we bring visitors to the Houses – not just from the State, but from all over the world – the staff treat them in a manner befitting this House. However, the Minister of State and the Government do not see fit to allow the staff the courtesy of having a say in the running of the Houses. It is regrettable and I will press this amendment to a vote.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	647	I will be happy to support amendments Nos. 53 and 56 as the acceptance of either would establish the principle of worker representation on the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission.I wish to record my great disappointment that I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle advising that my three amendments Nos. 55, 62 and 63 were deemed inadmissible as a result of an assessment that they may involve a potential charge on the Revenue. This is very strange because I tabled these amendments on Committee Stage and there was no question that they would involve an additional charge on the Revenue. It is apparent from the reading of the Ceann Comhairle's letter and the advisers involved that one or other of the Minister of  State's amendments on Committee Stage opened the door for a potential payment in lieu of services on this commission, or at least this is what I am advised. I am surprised by that. Surely the addition of two further places on the commission to accommodate two worker representatives would hardly represent a serious challenge to the Exchequer. However, I must accept the ruling and I share the information with colleagues. It is most regrettable.Deputies Paul McGrath and Burton and I have articulated on Committee and Report Stages the case for worker representation. It is one of the key elements within the amendments tabled on both Stages. I echo the words already spoken. The Minister of State must explain why he believes there should not be representation for some 500 other people who serve the daily workings of the Houses of the Oireachtas, from secretarial assistants to people serving at porter and usher grades to all the other services within the confines of this campus. I find the position adopted by the Minister of State incredulous in this day and age. There are real and valid reasons that representatives of employees of the Houses of the Oireachtas should have active participation in the commission, not least of which relates to their aspirations for advancement in their respective areas of employment.I hold both the Superintendent and the Captain of the Guard in the highest esteem and there are no two more gentlemanly figures in the service of this institution. However, I understand that both are appointees of the Taoiseach and no one who works in the lower grades within their respective areas of responsibility in the Houses can aspire to their positions through natural promotion. This is something that should be examined and explored, with no disrespect to the current occupants of these positions.These are real areas that must be addressed by the commission and, in all justice, it is this body that should address them. Worker representation is the only way to ensure we have the full understanding of whatever deficiencies, disappointments and failures the Houses present to those who give their daily effort here. It is not only the labours of elected Deputies and Senators that are appreciated but those of all who make the Houses of the Oireachtas work. It is only in coming together that we can ensure the necessary improvements that will deliver both a Dáil and Seanad that will serve the people better.Representatives of workers at varying grades have repeatedly made their case. As I said on Committee Stage, trade union representatives in the Houses of the Oireachtas have presented their case to the partnership committee, arguing strenuously for worker representation. It is incumbent on each of us to accede to this valid request. I put it to the Minister that it is our duty  and responsibility at this juncture, in turning a new page in the history of the Houses of the Oireachtas, to ensure that we get off on the right foot and that we see real reform and real partnership between Deputies and Senators, parliamentary secretaries and assistants and all other grades of employees within this campus working together to ensure a better Parliament in service of the electorate who have sent us here.I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the arguments presented by the Opposition Deputies and the members of the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service in this regard. I fully support Deputy Paul McGrath's position, which I expect will be echoed by Deputy Burton. This is an issue on which we will certainly challenge the Minister of State and his colleagues in Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats by calling a vote.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	648	I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment. As previous speakers said, there is no doubt that we have excellent staff in the Houses. Regardless of what Member of whatever political party with whom staff members must deal, they do an excellent job. When the Minister of State wore a different hat, I remember the Houses being taken over by certain organisations. Despite this, the staff of the Houses did an excellent job and I never saw them rattled or upset.If there is to be reform and change in the Houses, we must bring the staff along with us, and there is no better way to do this than to have a representative or representatives on the commission. We will see their point of view and they ours. It is important for the workings and running of the Houses that staff are represented. We are fortunate to have such excellent staff. One can telephone them when the Dáil is in session or in recess. If one requires certain information or to send people to the House on one's behalf, staff members go out of their way to do the job. They should be represented on this commission.As Deputy Paul McGrath and other Members said, we will shortly test Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrat Members to see if they will allow the Government to prevent the staff of the Houses being represented on this commission. I know Fianna Fáil Members were very quiet about the dual mandate and many regret now that they did not have the courage to vote against it when they had the chance and wish they had a second opportunity to do so. They will shortly have an opportunity to ensure the right thing is done in respect of this Bill, namely—

When the farmers needed the Minister of State, he saw the view on the other side of the fence. If he wants to discuss that, we will start on it now.However, that is not the substance of the amendment being discussed which relates to worker representation on the commission. I compliment the staff of the Houses for the excellent job they have done. It would be wrong if the commission were established and they did not have the representation they deserve. They deserve it and the Government knows that. The Minister should do the right thing. On the last occasion he accepted some of our amendments, even though it caused him a few problems, and I compliment him for that, but he should do it again now. We are lucky to have the staff who work in these Houses and they should be represented. The Minister of State could avoid the vote in a few minutes' time by saying the Government will accept representation of the staff of the Houses and he would be rewarding them for the wonderful job they have done over the years.

It is not normal for Civil Service offices to have worker-directors or any similar arrangement where their institution is a Department headed by a Minister. There cannot be such a situation where a Minister is head of a Department.The fundamental thrust of the Bill is to put the commission in relation to the Offices of the Houses of the Oireachtas in the same position as a Minister in his Department. It is reasonable that the commission's workers would have the same representative and participatory facilities available to them as their colleagues who work in Departments. There are partnership committees, conciliation and arbitration for all staff and management advisory committees for senior staff. Below commission level a deepening of those fora could facilitate staff participation but for the reasons I have outlined I cannot accept the amendment.

The purpose of this Bill is to allow for the self-governance of the Houses  and in any modern democracy that must include the participation of the staff. The Labour Party's amendment is carefully worded to ask the Clerk of the Dáil not to be a voting member of the commission because, as the Minister said, he is analogous to a departmental Secretary General and will be Secretary General of the new commission. We want the funding available to the commission to go into resourcing the Opposition and backbench Members of all parties to allow them to do their job as parliamentarians holding the Government to account. To do that we should have on the commission of the governance of this House the insight and experience of the staff of the House, many of whom have been and will be here far longer than us.
#PaulMcGrath	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-party	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-dob	unknown-#PaulMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I am extremely disappointed with the Minister of State. The arguments he put forward do not stand up. He is relying on precedent but this is new legislation and he can create the precedent. If the will exists, it can be done but, obviously, the will does not exist and the Minister of State is shunning the staff of the Houses.

He showed signs of not wanting to take responsibility for this in referring to the Minister, but he is the Minister with responsibility and he must take at least equal responsibility for this decision. It is not enough to compliment the staff within the Houses and then say that we will not accord them the opportunity of full participation in the new commission.As I indicated earlier, our parliamentary assistants are full participatory members who have equal status with the elected Members of this House in our parliamentary group and that has been an enriching and broadening experience for each of us. I commend the idea to the Minister of State and all parties here. They are missing access to a wealth of information and experience and are ignoring a reserve of great value. The Minister of State is making a fundamental mistake.

I urge the Minister present, the Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy Brian Lenihan, to listen carefully to the genuine case of the teachers, parents and pupils of the school who face a serious staffing problem in September 2003. I demand support for Belgrove school.The background is that the number of pupils on the school roll was 324 at the end of September 2002, which was one pupil short of the number necessary to qualify automatically for a 12th classroom teacher required to cater for the numbers coming through from the junior boys' school in September 2003.In March 2001 Belgrove boys senior and junior schools, which share a common campus, received approval by the Department of Education and Science to proceed with the planning procedure to build two 12-classroom schools. The junior boys' school, which is the feeder school to the senior boys' school and provides nearly all of its intake of pupils, received approval around the same time to recruit a 12th classroom teacher. This has resulted in the position that there will be one extra class to be catered for by the senior school next September, arising from an intake of three classes from the junior school totalling 75 pupils and two classes, totalling 69 pupils, graduating from the senior school. In other words, unless the senior school receives approval to recruit an extra teacher, 11 teachers will have to cater for 12 classes, necessitating the three incoming classes being condensed into two  classes, one of 37 and one of 38 pupils. This is unacceptable given that the maximum size set by the Department is 29 pupils.Total numbers enrolled at the school will increase from 330, to which may be added as many as six pupils, based on the school's experience of further applications from the area. The parents and children involved are extremely angry and concerned at this prospect which they fear will result in disruption to their children's education and will set back progress. They are also at a loss to know the reason the status quo of three teachers cannot be maintained for the coming year, given that the numbers will be adequate at the end of September 2003 to qualify automatically for an additional teacher in 2004.At a packed meeting of the parents on Tuesday, 13 May attended also by most of the parents of the incoming boys, parents expressed anger and frustration at the manner in which the school is being treated by the Department. They are also concerned at the extra pressures which will be placed on the teachers who will be required to teach oversize classes. While recognising the demands on the Minister's time and the pressure on resources, I ask him to reconsider the school's application in light of the facts I have outlined.If we are serious about education and developing schools, the Minister has a duty to intervene and grant the 12th teacher and if he does so, we will all win. I urge him to reconsider his position on this matter and allow the school to get on with the job of providing a top quality education service to the pupils of Belgrove senior boys' school in Clontarf.

I am glad to have the opportunity to outline the position regarding the school in question. The mainstream staffing of a primary school is determined by reference to the enrolment of the school on 30 September of the previous year. The number of mainstream posts is determined by reference to a staffing schedule which is finalised for a particular school year following discussions with the education partners.The staffing schedule is set out in a circular which issues from the Department of Education and Science to all primary school boards of management. Accordingly, all boards are aware of the staffing position for their school in any school year. The staffing schedule for the coming school year, 2003-04, is outlined in the Department's circular 9/03, which issued to all primary schools in February 2003 and is available on the Department's website.The allocation of additional teaching posts in recent years for improvements in the staffing schedule and for children with special needs,  together with a decline in enrolments, has helped to ensure that the overall pupil-teacher ratio in primary schools has improved substantially. This includes a decrease in the overall maximum class size in primary schools by reference to the staffing schedule from 35 pupils in the 1995-96 school year to 29 pupils in the 2002-03 school year.The school referred to by the Deputy had an enrolment on 30 September 2001 of 317 pupils which warranted a staffing for the 2002-03 school year of an administrative principal and 11 mainstream teachers. The school also has the service of a learning support teacher and resource teacher. The enrolment of the school on 30 September 2002 was 324 pupils. The appointment figure for the 12th mainstream class teacher is 325 pupils, as pointed out by the Deputy. As the school did not attain this figure, it was not possible to sanction the additional teacher. The school submitted an appeal to the staffing appeals board for the allocation of an additional teacher. The appeals board considered the appeal on 9 April and the appeal was rejected. The school authorities were notified of this decision on 10 April 2003.The independent appeals board on mainstream staffing was established in August 2002 and commenced operation at the beginning of the 2002-03 school year. The purpose of the board is to allow for the independent consideration of appeals, under certain criteria, against the mainstream staffing schedule as issued to schools. The appeals board allows for equitable and transparent treatment of all primary schools and its decision is final. It is not open to the Minister for Education and Science or his Department to interfere in this process.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	686	I am grateful to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for affording me the opportunity to raise on the Adjournment the crisis in school places in Castleknock community college. I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Noel Dempsey, to stop hiding and agree to meet with the parents of students at Castleknock Community College. I also ask the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, who is a Deputy for the area, to meet with the parents to discuss the crisis that has developed at the school regarding a shortage of places.Some 50 children are now on a waiting list for places for September 2004 due to their not being successful in the recent lottery for places at the school. Castleknock Community College recently held its annual lottery for school places for children now in fifth class who expect to attend secondary school in September 2004. As Minister of State, I was involved in the successful development and building of this popular school that has always had a high demand for places. Due to the  exceptional amount of house building and development in the school catchment area, student numbers have steadily risen and now stand at over 1,110. While the management, principal and teachers of the school are anxious to facilitate the students, they cannot do so unless they have the facilities to accommodate them.In 1998, Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats promised the school a purpose-built gym and other facilities to cope with the large number of pupils. However, although the facilities were promised and had gone to planning and various other steps in the Department's procedures for permitting building works, nothing has happened. In the context of the Government cutbacks in education, the school is now left in the no man's land of the waiting list of works to be completed. It is on the secondary list. It might hear from the Department next year but it might not, we do not know.Enormous distress has been caused to children and parents who had been reassured as recently as during last year's general election campaign that there was no need to worry. They now find themselves with few options as to where to attend secondary school. Children are being separated from their friends and classmates and face the prospect of attending schools far from their homes, if they can get a place. Dublin 15 has been targeted for enormous levels of house building, yet the Fianna Fáil-PD Government, and its developer-builder friends, supporters and donors refuse to accept that building thousands of new homes requires a complementary investment in school places at both primary and secondary level.The Government can clearly address the current situation by giving the go-ahead for the additional facilities promised. In the interim, it could provide temporary accommodation to meet the immediate shortfall in resources and places. We do not want to hear any old guff or witness the extreme cynicism in the context of next year's local and European elections where the Minister and the Minister of State will get another letter, co-signed by the Taoiseach and various other luminaries in Fianna Fáil to suggest the school will get a prefab. The parents and the children deserve to put out of their distress now.

I do not need to be invited to meet my  constituents; I have met many of the parents concerned and share their concern about this particular and peculiar form of lottery for attendance at a secondary school for students currently in fifth class in primary school. Deputy Burton conflated two entirely different issues in the course of her contribution, one of which was the question of access to the school while the other relates to an enlarged physical education hall. These are entirely distinct issues.

Castleknock Community College, Diswellstown, Dublin 15 is one of a number of post primary schools in the Dublin 15 area. The school operates under the aegis of County Dublin VEC. The school's accommodation was built to cater for 1,100 pupils and is at full capacity. The question of the capacity of the school is determined in the first instance, not by the Minister for Education and Science or County Dublin VEC, but by the board of management of the school.In regard to the provision of a physical education hall, the school currently has a hall of 393 sq. m. In response to an application in 1999 by County Dublin VEC, and based on the long-term projected enrolment at the school, it was decided that a physical education hall of 806 sq. m. should be provided. In August 2000, the VEC was given approval to appoint a design team to commence architectural planning on the project. The project is currently at stage 1 – site suitability, briefing and site report – and is included in section 7 of the published 2003 building programme. However, given the level of financial commitments to be met from projects already in construction, the Department of Education and Science does not envisage that it will be in a position during this year to allow architectural planning for further large scale projects to progress beyond their current authorised stage.

The Deputy will note that I did not circulate any letter on this subject during the recent general election campaign. The timing of when such projects, including this PE hall, can proceed is dependent on the financial allocation for 2004 and subsequent years.The Department of Education and Science has recently been made aware of the 50 pupils who have not been allocated a place at the college for September 2004 and I am well aware of it too. It is understood from the school authorities that 210 pupils have been accepted for enrolment for September 2004. This is the maximum number of  enrolments the school can cater for without creating overcrowded conditions for pupils and staff. This has been the traditional position of the board of management at this school. The school authorities have advised that it has been the pattern that between 17 and 25 pupils offered a place might not accept it, in which event further offers will be made. The decision on the allocation of places has been taken while students are in fifth class. I understand and accept the stress this has caused children attending schools in the locality and the divisions it has caused in classrooms.The position in the Dublin 15 area is quite complex because, while some schools in the area are full to capacity, others are in a position to offer places. Officials from the Department of Education and Science will make contact with all of the schools concerned to determine how any anticipated difficulty in September 2004 can be averted and to reiterate the need for a co-operative enrolment process in the area. Every effort will be made to accommodate pupils in their local school. However, no absolute guarantees can be given in that regard. The objective will be to ensure, to the greatest possible extent, that the existing schools can between them cater for demand within the area generally.Fingal County Council is to be commended for providing for the large-scale construction that has taken place in Dublin 15. It has gone a long way towards meeting national housing needs. This had to be done despite rigorous opposition from some local political interests that are not concerned about meeting national housing requirements. Based on the pace and extent of housing development in the Dublin 15 area, the Department of Education and Science has concluded that further educational provision will be required into the future and a site has been reserved by Fingal County Council for a second level school in the Phibblestown area.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	694	I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter on the Adjournment although I am disappointed that the Minister for Health and Children is not here to deal with this himself. This saga has been going on for a number of months and no progress has been made.The parents of two autistic young adults are in the Visitors Gallery this evening because they are angry and frustrated that their requests for places for their children with the Irish Autism Society have been refused over a long period. The reasons put forward by the Eastern Regional Health Authority for refusal to transfer the young adults to the facility reputedly relate to a review of the Irish Society for Autism. In the first instance, I found it annoying to deal with the ERHA on this  matter and to be either ignored or kept waiting for an extensive period of time for any substantial reply to a number of questions put by me. When a substantial reply did finally arrive, it referred to the review being completed and some recommendations being made to the society. The answer is so vague as to be useless. It includes terms such as, "some suggestions about advancing the implementation of those recommendations", and so on. There is no timeframe for the implementation plan. It offers no insight into the reasons for the review or of the gravity or otherwise of the need for the recommendations to be implemented. In the meantime, the parents are becoming more frustrated with the system and the two young people awaiting placement are in limbo and uncertain about what the future holds for them.These parents are only concerned about getting the best quality service for their children. They want them to be secure and comfortable in their environment. They want to be assured that the service that is being provided is the most suitable for their children. I suggest that nobody knows better the psychological needs of the children than their parents.Can the Minister give me some indication of the reasons for the delay in implementing the recommendations, in auditing them and in reaching an agreement between the autism society and, specifically, the South-Western Area Health Board? Does the delay relate only to the fact that there is a cost involved to the health board? Is this a cutback by another name? The intransigence of the health board on this issue is beyond belief.Autism is described as one of the most distressing forms of mental disorder of which the most outstanding characteristics are extreme aloneness, difficulty in relating to other people and severely impaired or no speech. Sadly, it is not a passing ailment that will be cured with medication in a few weeks or months. The Irish Society for Autism met and agreed a way forward with the health board in April of this year, or so it thought. Any outstanding issues were not considered to be substantial by either side. Why is it then that two months later there is no progress? The autism society thought it had answered all the queries that arose in that review process.I am asking the Minister of State to examine this case and to ensure that the two boys in question are given the opportunity to have a reasonable quality of life through being able to access the appropriate adult service. Their names are John and Mark. They are real people. They are not statistics, and it is not good enough to make scapegoats of John and Mark or their parents because of what seems like another cutback by stealth. This week we have been lauded in this country for our response to the athletes taking part in the Special Olympics, and rightly so.  However, John and Mark are also special and they too would like to be given an opportunity to attain their potential.

Certain matters of a general character are set out rather extensively in the reply. I thank the Deputy for raising the case. I appreciate it relates to two individuals named Mark and John.Since 1997 the Department of Health and Children has allocated significant levels of funding across the disability sector. This has resulted in very significant and unprecedented developments in the quality and quantity of health-related services.Additional funding of €27 million has been allocated to services for persons with disabilities and those with autism in 2003 to meet the full year costs of 2002 developments and to further enhance the services in the sector. This funding is in addition to the very significant revenue investment, amounting to €288 million which has been made in these services in recent years and which is built into the ongoing budget base.Approximately €100 million in additional ongoing revenue has been provided with regard to the maintenance and development of services for people with physical and sensory disabilities. Such services include, residential, respite, home support services, which includes personal assistance services, therapy services and day care services. A significant proportion of this funding, more than €20 million, has been provided specifically for home support services. A further €81 million has been provided in once-off grants for capital projects and issues such as the provision of technical aids and appliances.Between 1997 and 2002, an extra €188 million in revenue and €139 million in capital funding has been provided, making a total additional investment of €327 million for the maintenance and development of services for persons with an intellectual disability and those with autism. Included in this funding is €27.2 million, which was allocated to meet identified needs in existing services.The additional funding provided by this and the previous Government between 2000 and 2002 was used to put in place, in addition to a range of other services, more than 900 new residential, 380 new respite and around 2,000 new day places for people with an intellectual disability and those with autism.In the current year, further additional funding of €13.3 million has been allocated to services for persons with an intellectual disability or autism to meet the full year cost of the 2002 developments and to further enhance the health related support services for children with an intellectual disability or autism. This funding brings the total extra investment in these services to €340 million over  seven years. Of this total amount, over €200 million has been built into the ongoing budget base.In particular €14.6 million has been invested in health-related support services for children with autism or an intellectual disability nationally between 1998 and 2002. A further €4 million has been allocated to these services in 2003. This includes diagnostic and assessment services, early intervention, home support and outreach support for children of schoolgoing age.Despite this very significant investment, demographic factors are contributing to growing waiting lists for residential services in particular, even though the numbers of people in receipt of services, including full-time residential services, continues to increase. The increased birth rate in the 1960s and 1970s has resulted in large numbers of adults in their late 20s and early 30s requiring full-time residential services. In addition, people with an intellectual disability are living longer than previously adding to the need for services compared to previous generations. This has also been the international experience in service provision for this population.The overall economic position in 2003 has had implications for all aspects of public investment, and this is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services.This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of services across all service programmes, including services for people with disabilities. While it is regrettable that the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health board and other service providers regarding service provision this year.With regard to the details supplied by Deputy Upton, responsibility for the provision of services is a matter for the relevant health board. From inquiries made by my Department, I understand that discussions are ongoing between the South-Western Area Health Board and the Irish Society for Autism regarding matters of mutual interest. The South-Western Area Health Board is currently awaiting a response from the Irish Society for Autism regarding the audit of the service and other related matters. When this process is complete the board is prepared to open the service for admissions pending funding. I trust that all matters will be resolved shortly to the satisfaction of all concerned.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	697	Ground rents are a feudal tax, a hangover from the days of British colonial rule in Ireland, and their abolition must be facilitated. Sinn Féin does not agree that ground rent landlords should be compensated. As a legacy of colonialism, ground rents have been unjust from the start. Therefore, to compensate would legitimise what is manifestly unjust. It is scandalous that this has not been dealt with since the coming into existence of the Twenty-six County State.Ground rents represent an ongoing injustice against hundreds of thousands of Irish people who have suffered at the hands of land speculators, both native and foreign, avaricious builders and many opportunists in the legal profession since the foundation of this State.On the question of so-called constitutional difficulties, I expect the Minister of State will say he is sure I would not want the Government to introduce a Bill that is unfair or inequitable. He is correct. However, I would call on the Government to bring forward legislation now and allow it to be tested in the Supreme Court as was done with Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2002. If it is unconstitutional we can then proceed to a constitutional referendum to allow for such legislation.Householders whose leases are about to expire are placed in an unacceptable position whereby they are forced to choose between buying a freehold on their house for one eighth of its value or signing a new lease for a drastically increased rent. With the value of houses going up, people whose leases are due to expire are justifiably angry and concerned.An example outlined by ACRA related to a householder in Dublin whose ground rent lease has expired who is struggling to hold on to the family home. The ground rent landlord is demanding a sum of €54,000 for freehold interest plus legal fees of €127 per hour until agreement is reached. The amount demanded is based on a formula in the current legislation which allows the landlord to claim one eighth of the market value of the family home. The alternative for those who cannot afford to buy out the expired lease is to sign a renewal of the lease for 35 years.The formula for the new ground rent per annum is computed on the basis of the open market rental value of the house. Many of those who find themselves in this invidious position are elderly and have no income other than their pension. They spend their remaining days in fear, yet the Government says there is nothing it can do.Ground landlords are statute-barred from claiming more than six years' arrears, yet this is ignored by landlords who continually try to intimidate defenceless tenants and extract the maximum amount of money from them. In 1997, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, then in Opposition, com mended the Fianna Fáil Private Members' Bill on ground rents to the Dáil. He stated: "All Members accept that its preparation involved an enormous amount of teasing out and discussion to ensure its provisions were justified on constitutional grounds."  Why was the Bill constitutional when Fianna Fáil was in opposition and unconstitutional when it is in Government? Has the Government come under pressure from powerful vested interests?I ask the Minister of State in his reply to outline how he intends to overcome the apparent difficulties in introducing this legislation. Is he telling the House that it is beyond the capabilities of his Department to right this wrong? Is the Government committed to tackling this issue? Recently, when an Opposition Deputy sought to ascertain the publication date of the ground rents abolition Bill, a senior Cabinet Minster was heard to quip, "ring the Land Registry". I give this example to outline the dismissive attitude of the Government to those campaigning for the abolition for ground rents.ACRA has campaigned for the abolition of ground rents since 1973 and we are told that all of the major parties support the abolition. People have waited 80 years for this legislation. How much longer must they wait?

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	704	I have considerable sympathy with the Deputy's concerns about ground rents. The development of ground rents in this country evolved over hundreds of years in a particular legal context. An odd feature of the system was that it was a peculiarly Irish legal development,  which involved pyramid titles and a vast number of intermediate lessors whose eventual claim to rent, essentially, involved a rather nominal sum but still represented a substantial burden to real owners of land.I welcome the fact that the Deputy has raised this matter which successive Governments have attempted to tackle. The Government's legislative programme makes provision for the publication of a ground rents Bill during 2003 with a view to abolishing ground rents. The fact that the Bill is included in the programme is an indication of the Government's intention to act in this matter.The current position is that under the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978, there is a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple by the owners of dwelling houses. Part III of the Act provides a special procedure, operated at low cost by the Land Registry, whereby owner occupiers of dwelling house may acquire, readily and relatively inexpensively, the fee simple in their property. The purchase price in most cases is, at present, approximately 23 times the ground rent.The Act contains a provision for the determination of applications of the purchase of a fee simple in cases where the consent of all the necessary parties is not forthcoming. In such cases, the Registrar of Titles will determine the application by arbitration. The Act also makes provision for the circumstance that the ground rent landlord cannot be found. This is not an obstacle to a tenant negotiating directly with the owner of the ground rent for the purchase without reference to this legislation.It is generally accepted that the present arrangement for the purchase of ground rents under the 1978 Act works well and since its introduction, more than 70,000 householders have availed of this low cost purchase scheme operated by the Land Registry. However, the scheme does not apply to buying out ground rents which have less than 15 years to run. The arrangements here are different in terms of the calculation of the amount payable to the landlord. Instead of a multiplier of the annual ground rent, the amount payable is based on the value of the house, which is up to a maximum of one eighth. I have been advised that this provision arises because the value of a lease to a landlord increases the closer is the lease to expiry. I appreciate that this is a difficult position in which tenants may find themselves and it has been compounded by the increase in house prices in recent decades. The advice to tenants whose leases can be affected by the 15 year provision is to arrange to buy out their ground rents in good time.The Deputy stated that successive Governments have used the excuse of constitutional difficulties for their failure to introduce legislation on the ground rents issue. In response, let me state  that any Government must ensure that any action taken on this issue, or on any other issue, is in conformity with constitutional requirements, which the Government is obliged to ensure are respected when taking any action. It would not be appropriate to enter into the details of this matter pending the completion of the work that has now been undertaken in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Suffice to say that the constitutional difficulties referred to concern the respective rights of ground rent tenant and landlords. I am sure the Deputy would agree that the Government should introduce a Bill that is fair and equitable and that will not affect the constitutional rights of any person. We are working to achieve this solution.One constitutional difficulty on which I will comment, and which has been a accepted by many Governments, is that the abolition of ground rents without appropriate compensation would not, in all circumstances, be in keeping with our constitutional obligations. While this matter is receiving attention in the Department,  the House should appreciate that it has proved to be very complex and, as yet, has not been resolved. The Minister believes it is vital, before introducing any legislation regarding the abolition of ground rents, that these constitutional issues be addressed and resolved. Pending the resolution of these issues, it is not possible for the Minister to indicate when the Bill will be published.The abolition of ground rents is a complex and emotive area and it is vital that the right decisions are made and the proper course of action pursued. It is also important that the introduction of any new legislation would not have the effect of worsening the current position from the viewpoint of the ground rent tenant and landlord. It is the Government's intention that any Bill dealing with the abolition of ground rents will be in line with constitutional requirements and will, at the same time, deliver a better solution for ground rent tenants.The Dáil adjourned at 11.20 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 26 June 2003.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	705	The foreword to the White Paper contains a statement of the Government's commitment to building an inclusive society in which community and voluntary groups can play a vital role. The Government's vision of society is one in which the active involvement and participation of citizens is vital to the health and well-being of society and its citizens.Active citizenship is one of the key concepts that underpins the vision and philosophical basis for the White Paper. The concept is one of creating a vibrant and active society where the participation of citizens is encouraged and fostered through State support for a responsive community and voluntary sector. The aim is to achieve the creation of dialogue between citizens and the State with the objective of addressing issues in a spirit of partnership and co-operation where responses are informed by the views of ordinary citizens are heard.The White Paper defines active citizenship as the active role of people, communities and voluntary organisations in decision-making that directly affects them. For many years now, social partnership has played a key role in enabling the voluntary and community sector to contribute to major economic and social planning. In addition, there is continued support for active citizenship at local level through: local area partnerships; community development projects; the community fora which operate in each city and county development board; once-off grant schemes administered by my Department; and funding and support for community based projects such as the local drugs task forces, RAPID, Leader and PEACE.

Its membership is broadly representative, from Departments and State agencies to the social partners and the wider voluntary and community sector. The forum was first convened in May 2000 and has met on three occasions since then. Issues discussed at previous meetings of the forum included progress on the implementation of the White Paper on rural development, farm incomes, the national spatial strategy, rural transport, rural tourism, rural planning and financial services in rural areas.The last forum meeting was held on 17 January 2003. I expect to have at least one further meeting of the forum this year. The agenda items will be determined by rural development priorities at the time.

In the region of €21.3 million has been provided this year to meet my Department's commitments under these programmes.There are currently some 190 community development projects and issue based groups supported under the CDSP, of which 160 are in receipt of core funding and 30 are approved in principle for inclusion in the programme. Notwithstanding the current tight economic situation, I am pleased to confirm that I will be able to allocate funding to 15 of these groups with effect from September 2003, in fulfilment of Partnership 2000 commitments. In this regard, each project will receive a renewable one-year contract for funding totalling €60,000 and assistance towards start-up costs up to a maximum of €27,000 per project. The 15 groups were selected with priority being given to areas of greatest need, particularly with reference to RAPID and CLÁR. Pre-development work is under way in the remaining 15 proactively targeted areas and I hope, subject to available resources, to be able to fund these groups also in 2004.

The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research – to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.Since it was launched in May 2001, Departments and agencies have made considerable progress in implementing the actions set out for them in the strategy. The interdepartmental group on drugs, which I chair, meets regularly in conjunction with the national drugs strategy team, to assess progress being made in achieving the targets set out in the strategy. Any obstacles to the implementation of any of the actions are brought to light at these meetings.

As pointed out in the national spatial strategy, in many rural areas, the combination of a high dependency on a changing agricultural base, a scarcity of employment opportunities and resultant out-migration, has weakened their demographic, economic, social and physical structure.My Department is committed to maintaining the maximum number of people in rural areas and to strengthening rural communities economically, socially and culturally. To this end my Department is involved in wide range of investment programmes, both EU and national, to promote this objective. The Leader+ programme is an EU initiative designed to encourage the implementation of integrated, high-quality and innovative strategies in rural communities. The initiative is delivered by 22 local action groups. The allocation for Leader+ for the period 2000-06 is €73.6 million and the initiative is co-funded by the EAGGF.The national rural development programme is a sub-measure named the area-based rural development Initiative within the agriculture and rural development priority of the Border, midlands and western and southern and eastern operational programmes. The programme closely complements the Leader+ initiative but focuses more on mainstream activities, primarily rural-agri-tourism. Again an element of innovation is required for all activities funded. The allocation for 2000-06 is €75.7 million and the programme is co-funded by the EAGGF.

I was also responsible for selection, launch and implementation of the Leader programmes in Ireland. The Deputy has identified specific areas and the following is the position in relation to those areas.The area based rural development initiative is an EU assisted Leader type programme catering for areas of the country not covered by the EU initiative, Leader+. It also provides funding nationwide for rural tourism activities which are delivered by all Leader groups. The Initiative runs until the end of 2006 with a total of €75.7 million being made available for the duration of the programme. The allocation for 2003 is €9.47 million.A limited number of pilot rural community development projects are being supported from the rural development fund. A provision of €5.7 million is available for the rural development fund for the period 2000-06. The allocation for 2003 is €950,000.These projects operate through a variety of community-based initiatives. They are intended to work as a method of reducing rural deprivation in the long-term, at a low cost to the State, through creating sustainable development.Progress on the farm relief services measure of the national development plan is satisfactory. Total investment over the lifetime of the programme, 2000-06, is €8 million of which €1.25 million has already been spent.

The waterways under the remit of the body are the Barrow navigation, the Erne system, the Grand Canal, the Lower Bann navigation, the Royal Canal, the Shannon-Erne waterway and the Shannon navigation.Since its establishment in 1999, Waterways Ireland has undertaken a number of design projects, including replacement of a swinging bridge at Milford, supply of piles and floating moorings at Ballyconnell and Shannon Harbour, lightweight fill alternatives at Cloonbreany Bog, County Longford, provision of a retaining wall at Bagenalstown and the development of new facilities at Ballinasloe. County Galway. Major capital project works have been carried out to improve the navigational infrastructure at Keshcarrigan on the Shannon-Erne waterway; Boyle, County Roscommon; Limerick city; Ballinasloe, County Galway; and Spencer Harbour on the Shannon navigation. Restoration of the Royal Canal continued with the construction of a new bridge adjacent to Pake Bridge, County Longford, and the reconstruction of bog embankments through Cloonbreany Bog, County Longford. At Ballyconnell, on the Shannon-Erne waterway, works were carried out to extend the existing public mooring.In the context of the national development plan, Waterways Ireland will continue to upgrade facilities along the Shannon navigation, continue the provision of facilities and complete the dredging and reconstruction programme along the Grand Canal and Barrow navigation, and complete the reconstruction of the Royal Canal to reopen it to the Shannon as resources permit.Further ongoing projects include work on the provision of a marina and harbour at Ballyleague, County Roscommon; the extension of moorings at Scarriff quay, County Clare; additional moorings at Shannonbridge, County Offaly; and the reconstruction of canal embankments on the Royal Canal through Begnagh Bog, County Offaly. In the North, proposals have been agreed for developing the navigational infrastructure on the Erne system and the Lower Bann navigation by developing new jetties, installing new markers and point moorings, upgrading pump-out facilities and improving signage.

The measures involved have an important contribution to make to this long-term process and the distinctiveness of the programme is characterised by its two main objectives: addressing the legacy of the conflict; and taking opportunities arising from peace.While this initiative is being delivered through five main priorities, my Department is involved in delivering three of them by managing measures aimed at: economic renewal; social integration, inclusion and reconciliation; and cross-Border co-operation. Key target groups of the programme include victims of violence, ex-prisoners, women, unemployed and under-employed people and other vulnerable groups such as Travellers and minority groups.My Department, through Area Development Management Limited, ADM, and the Combat Poverty Agency, CPA, has overall responsibility for the implementation of ten measures of the Peace II programme in the Border regions of Ireland and two cross-Border measures in conjunction with the Community Foundation of Northern Ireland and Co-operation Ireland. These programmes have a budget of €97.6 million, of which €64 million, 65.8%, has, to date, been committed to projects under the measures involved. This figure includes over €30 million committed to cross-Border projects. A total of 700 applications were received, of which 368 have received funding approval. Some €13.4 million has been paid out by projects up to the end of March 2003. The provision to finance these measures in this Department's Vote for 2003 is €11.187 million.In the context of cross-Border co-operation in agriculture and rural development, my Department is a joint implementing body with the Department of Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland for priority 5 measure 6 (a) and 6(b) of the Peace II programme. The total public funding provision, North and South, for these measures over the lifetime of the programme 2000-04 is €7.351 million.Grant aid of almost €1 million has been allocated to priority 5 measure 6(a) under a single project titled North-South Rural Voice. A letter of offer under this programme will issue in the near future. Under priority 5 measure 6 (b) of the Peace II programme support will be given for the development of non-traditional farm based enterprises in the eligible cross-Border area. Projects are at the second and final stage of the assessment process, that is – economic appraisal – following which letters of offer will issue to successful applicants. The provision in the Department's Vote to finance these measures for 2003 is €1.44 million.

Discussions have taken place with the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism regarding the potential that tourism, particularly cultural tourism, can offer in helping to create and sustain employment in the Gaeltacht. In addition, the various recommendations in the report relating to enterprise development and employment creation have been discussed between officials from the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment and its agencies, Údarás na Gaeltachta and my Department.I would like to re-iterate that the Irish language is the most important natural resource of the Gaeltacht. Indeed, future development of the Gaeltacht depends in no small way on the preservation of the language. Accordingly for 2003, I have agreed with Údarás na Gaeltachta that 20% of its capital budget should be allocated for the development of ventures and enterprises that have a clearly defined Irish language focus. In this regard I should mention the new Údarás na Gaeltachta incentive scheme Fiontraíocht Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, which I launched recently and which supports the recommendations of the working group.Also arising from the working group's report, Údarás na Gaeltachta has formulated an action plan to tackle the significant unemployment problem in the northwest Donegal Gaeltacht. A senior official has been appointed to the Údarás office in Gweedore and a committee has been formed under the chairmanship of Mr. Peter Quinn to assist in implementing the action plan. I understand that the work of that committee is ongoing on an active basis.

Because of the diverse nature of the scheme, the funding was initially allocated across the Votes of ten relevant Departments. However, with effect from 25 June 2002, certain responsibilities of a number of Departments, including the Department of Agriculture and Food, transferred to the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. My Department has been in communication with the Department of Agriculture and Food, which has indicated that no funding is available for the scheme in its 2003 Estimates.I understand that the funding presently available for the scheme in 2003 is €1.827 million, spread across six Departments as follows:

As the Minister responsible for co-ordinating the implementation of the programme I remain, with my other ministerial colleagues, fully committed to RAPID. However, I am on record as saying, that there are certain elements in relation to the RAPID process with which I am unhappy. One of these is the difficulty in quantifying the amount of spends in RAPID areas brought about by re-prioritisation. In addition, plans received from the RAPID areas are varied, ranging from small low cost local actions to large scale proposals with considerably higher cost implications.I am endeavouring to separate small-scale proposals, which can be dealt with at a local level by the partnerships and the city-county development board, CDB, structure, from the large proposals that have to be dealt with at a central Government level. Over the coming weeks and months, discussions will take place with the area implementation teams, AITs, partnerships and CDBs in relation to implementing this proposal. My Department will also be discussing the issue with the south and east and BMW regional assemblies.My Department supported by ADM Limited, co-ordinates the implementation of the RAPID programme. Plans have been prepared for each of the 45 areas and proposals from these plans have been forwarded by ADM Limited to relevant Departments for consideration. As regards my Department, proposals from the RAPID plans fall to be considered under the young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, the community development programme, CDP, and funding for local drugs task forces. The estimated cost of these proposals is in the region of €65 million. In the case of proposals relevant to the YPFSF, proposals submitted under the RAPID plans will be considered in the context of decisions to be made under round II and in light of the overall funding position for 2003.

During 2002, the national drugs strategy team carried out a comprehensive review of the work of the LDTFs. The recommendations of this review have been discussed at meetings of the Interdepartmental Group on Drugs, which I chair, and many of the recommendations are currently being implemented. One of the review's recommendations is that two additional staff – a project development worker and an administrative assistant – be appointed to each task force. However, as my Department is currently engaged in examining the scope for greater cohesion and integration across community and local development initiatives, I do not envisage the question of additional staff for the task forces being considered until this process has been completed.

The strategy contains 100 individual actions, under the four pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and research, to be implemented by a range of Departments and agencies.My Department also has responsibility for the work of the 14 local drugs task forces, LDTFs, which were established in 1997 in the areas experiencing the highest levels of drug misuse, particularly heroin. In total, the Government has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in the two action plans of the task forces since 1997. These projects provide a range of services in the areas of prevention, treatment and rehabilitation.In addition, services for drug users in all health boards have increased substantially over the last number of years. For example, in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area, treatment services have expanded from 12 locations in early 1997 to 57 currently. Most of these services offer a range of treatments including methadone maintenance, methadone reduction, outpatient detoxification, counselling and alternative therapies. In relation to methadone maintenance, there were 1,350 places available on the central methadone treatment list at the start of 1996, whereas currently there are approximately 6,600.Outside the ERHA, treatment clinics have been established in the South-Eastern Health Board, Mid-Western Health Board, Western Health Board and Midland Health Board. General practitioners and pharmacists also provide treatment services and their involvement has also increased over the last number of years. Services are also provided by a broad range of voluntary and community agencies which are funded through grants from health boards.I should point out that more people are receiving treatment than the figure mentioned by the Deputy. In addition to those on the central methadone treatment list, other opiate users are receiving a range of detox or drug-free treatments in both residential and non-residential settings. Other users would be clients of needle exchange programmes, outreach services and other interventions for chaotic users.

Amongst other things, this report will include the latest available statistics in relation to treatment, seizures and all relevant surveys or research released in that period.The Deputy will appreciate that many of these statistics, including the Garda and Customs and Excise figures for 2002, will not be available until later in the year. Accordingly, in order to ensure that the report is as up to date as possible, I would propose to publish the first report on the strategy later in 2003.

However, as was outlined in the progress report on An Agreed Programme for Government for the period June 2002-June 2003, the Government is committed to increasing both the quantity and the quality of Irish-language broadcasting nationwide. The progress report noted that as part of the Governments reforms of public service broadcasting, RTE's statement of commitments commits it to increasing the amount of Irish and bilingual programming; the Government will shortly publish legislation aimed at providing 5% of the television licence fee for a public service broadcasting fund to develop additional public programming, including Irish language programming; and the Government will also establish TG4 as a separate statutory body, in line with legislation already enacted.

The remit of the board is to prepare a plan for the disbursement of moneys from the Dormant Accounts Fund for the purposes of programmes or projects that are designed to assist the personal, educational and social development of persons who are economically, educationally or socially disadvantaged or persons with a disability. The Deputy will appreciate that while this is a broad remit, it is clear that, in effect, the moneys must be directed at projects to help disadvantaged persons and communities, as well as those with a disability.I understand that the disbursement plan is currently under preparation by the board and will be submitted for ministerial approval shortly. The board will publish the plan as soon as it receives approval. Decisions on disbursements from the fund will be made by the board as provided for under the legislation.

CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. They are, for the most part, operated in tandem with the lead Departments or public utilities, as appropriate, thus ensuring efficiency and effectiveness as well as meeting the needs of the people in the CLÁR areas.The Leader programmes, operated by my Department, provide approved local action groups with public funding both, EU and national, to implement multi-sectoral programmes for the development of their own localities. The bottom up philosophy of rural development requires that the local Leader group is the decision-making authority in relation to approving actions falling within its business plan. The approval of grants by groups is made within detailed operating rules drawn up by the Department and approved by the European Commission. Within these rules each group will assist a wide range of entities including private companies.The White Paper on Rural Development is also relevant. The White Paper addresses a wide variety of issues including access to services. While primary responsibility for the operation of those services rests with the individual government departments and state agencies, my department pursues particular issues as they arise, for example, matters in relation to rural transport, rural post offices, and broadband with the departments/public utilities concerned.Responsibility for support for companies in rural areas rests with agencies such as Enterprise Ireland, SFADCo, Údarás na Gaeltachta, the Western Development Commission and the county enterprise boards. However, in conjunction with the Tánaiste, I am advancing a review of supports for enterprise in rural areas so as to see how best these can be strengthened and enhanced.My Department through the Gaeltacht and islands programmes assists with the provision of basic infrastructure. As well as this my Department directly subsidises ferry and air services to a number of inhabited off shore islands.

The RDTFs, which represent a team-based response to illicit drug use, are made up of nominees from State agencies working in the region, the community and voluntary sector and elected public representatives. It is intended that all of the RDTF members will  work in partnership, in a manner similar to the local drugs task forces.The existing regional drug co-ordinators are acting as interim co-ordinators for the RDTFs. Given their knowledge and experience of the local drug problem and their relationship with local agencies and groups, I believe that they represent a significant resource which will greatly facilitate the on-going development of the task forces.The initial work of the RDTFs will involve mapping the prevalence of drug misuse in their regions. They will then identify the broad strategies that are necessary to respond to these needs. Following on from this work, they will profile the services and or supports that are already in place or are planned to deliver these strategies. Finally, the RDTFs will identify gaps in the strategies and prioritise the actions that are needed to address them.The RDTFs have an administrative budget at their disposal during 2003 to carry out their work in identifying needs and I anticipate that these budgets will be fully utilised. The funding of the RDTFs in future years will form part of the annual Estimates process and my Department and I will be treating this issue as a priority.

He agrees with the broad thrust of the Commission's proposals under the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, in so far as rural development is concerned, which is to extend the range of on-farm rural development measures to promote food quality, meet higher standards and foster animal welfare. However, the Commission is also proposing to introduce a system of modulation, which would reduce direct payments to farmers receiving over €5,000 a year to provide additional funds for such rural development. There is an intrinsic contradiction in this proposal to reduce farmers incomes, which will be damaging the economies of rural areas in order to provide funds for certain rural development measures. My colleague has made his overall opposition to the proposals clear in the Council of Agriculture and Fisheries Ministers and his objective in the negotiations is to preserve the benefits to Irish agriculture and to rural communities achieved under the Agenda 2000 agreement.

The total population in the extended CLÁR areas has increased from 284,000 to 362,000.CLÁR funds, or co-funds, with other Departments, State agencies and local authorities, investment in selected priority developments. These measures support physical, community and social infrastructure across a variety of measures such as electricity conversion, roads, water and sewerage, village enhancement, health and sports projects. The measures introduced under the programme reflect the priorities identified by the communities in the selected areas whom I consulted at the outset. These measures were agreed with the lead Departments or State agencies, as appropriate. Other measures may be introduced this year, depending on needs identified.It is not practical here to list all the measures and the expenditure details, so I am arranging to send them to Deputy Wall.

The enactment of this legislation will be a critical factor in addressing many of the issues raised in the report.The Deputy will also be aware that I established an advisory committee in October 2002 to advise on the actions necessary to facilitate the practical implementation, where appropriate, of the various proposals contained in the report.Among the issues and initiatives being considered and progressed at present are: the commissioning of a comprehensive linguistic study of Irish usage in Gaeltacht areas which will form the basis for the development of the Gaeltacht as an Irish-speaking area and for a review of Gaeltacht boundaries. Tenders for the award of this study are currently being sought and it is expected that the study will have commenced by the autumn; the presentation of a submission in regard to critical issues affecting the Irish language in primary and post-primary education in the Gaeltacht; proposals for the restructuring of Irish language pre-school services in the Gaeltacht; recommendations in regard to new structures for youth organisations in the Gaeltacht; and the linguistic impact of planning policy in the Gaeltacht.Consultations are continuing with relevant Departments and other organisations in relation to progressing these issues.The transmission of the Irish language from one generation to the next is critical for its survival. In this regard, an action plan aimed at advising parents in Gaeltacht areas, particularly those with young children, of the advantages of choosing Irish as the household language, is currently being formulated by a sub-group established by the advisory committee. It is intended to bring forward proposals in relation to this action plan in the near future.In addition, my Department is engaged in a review of schemes which play a significant role in strengthening the usage and transmission of Irish in Gaeltacht areas in general, namely, scéim labhairt na Gaeilge and the language assistants' scheme.

The LDTFs develop local action plans, based on their identified priorities, which are funded from my Department. In total, the Government has allocated or spent over €65 million to implement in the region of 500 projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997.In this context, a number of the LDTFs have identified services specifically for homeless drug users – in particular outreach teams and drop-in centres. However, it should be noted that the bulk of services for homeless drug users are either funded through the local authorities and the health boards and significant funding has been provided in this regard.

Despite the tighter budgetary situation, my Department has continued to honour all commitments to the 155 core-funded projects throughout the country funded on a contract basis under the CDSP. Funding allocations to individual projects this year have been at least maintained at 2002 levels and have been increased in many cases. I am aware that the key staffing positions in these projects are dependent on continued core-funding and I will be endeavouring to maintain and build on that support to local projects in the coming years, subject to available funding. In this respect, I was delighted to be able to announce recently the establishment of a further 15 community development projects which will receive one-year renewable contracts effective from September 2003. This expansion of the CDSP, at a cost of €900,000 annually, further underlines my commitment to community development and I have further plans to induct an additional 15 new projects into the programmes next year, again subject to available resources.

In 1997, when I was first appointed as Minister of State with responsibility for the islands, just four ferry services were in receipt of State support. This figure has now risen to 14. A list of these services follows for the Deputy's information. The Deputy should also be aware that my Department is currently seeking tenders for the provision of the Tory Island ferry service for the period from 1 September 2003 to 31 August 2004.In response to issues raised in the 2001 report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in relation to State-subsidised transport services to the Aran Islands, my Department has advanced the following measures: additional staff have been assigned to the islands division of my Department so as to strengthen control and compliance with contractual requirements; as a consequence of effective monitoring, which includes the scrutiny of sailing logs and regular spot checks, monthly payments are reduced in respect of any contracted sailings not provided; increased frequency of spot checks is being pursued; a new software package has been developed to further enhance and facilitate monitoring procedures; and, a comprehensive study to determine the effectiveness of currently subsidised services and to advise on appropriate performance indicators is being commissioned at present. It is intended to appoint consultants this week to carry out this study and it is envisaged that the findings will inform the decision-making process in regard to future contracts for island transport services.

The average participation rate on the programme during 2003 is expected to be in the region of 22,500, which amounts to a reduction of 5,000 places approximately phased over the year. The allocation of places and renewal of individual CE projects is a matter for FÁS.

At the time of answering Question No. 152 of 20 May 2003, there was no parliamentary time available to hold a debate on trade issues in the Dáil. However, I am happy to inform Deputy Naughten that since that time the Chief Whip, Deputy Hanafin, has allocated time for such a debate on Friday morning next, 27 June. I will be participating in this debate with various other Government colleagues who have an interest in the WTO negotiations.

The application for statutory redundancy payments was treated as a matter of priority so as to ensure that most of the workers affected received their cheques before Christmas. Any remaining claims were processed as quickly as possible thereafter. A total of 452 payments under the insolvency payments scheme, covering a variety of such matters as wages, holiday pay, and minimum notice entitlements etc. have to date been paid to the employees, with applications from the liquidator in respect of any remaining insolvency entitlements being processed by my Department as quickly as possible. A further 159 minimum notice claims are expected to be authorised for payment very shortly.

This special programme was centred mainly on the Curragh Camp and the bulk of the contracts was completed by 2002. The Curragh programme covered 14 major projects at a total cost of €50 million. A small number of remaining jobs will be integrated into the normal building programme for 2003.The building programme for the Curragh for 2003 includes provision for the upgrade of accommodation, security requirements, roads and squares, painting, stores and general maintenance, and, subject to availability of resources and other priorities, the programme of investment will continue at the defence forces training centre in the Curragh Camp.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	765	The main recommendation contained in the interdepartmental task force report on the future management and development of the Curragh of Kildare is that a statutory body should be established under the aegis of the Department of Defence to manage the Curragh, with the exception of the Curragh Camp. The necessary legislation to give effect to this, and to other recommendations of the task force report, is being prepared at present and it is expected that heads of Bills will shortly be submitted for the approval of Government.My Department will continue to protect the archaeological sites and monuments situated in the Curragh Plains until the new authority is established within the legislation currently being drafted in my Department. The entire area of the Curragh under section 12 of the National Monuments (Amendment) Act 1994 is a recorded national monument. My Department ensures that the terms of the 1994 Act are adhered to before any works, alterations or signage are permitted.

An application was submitted by the person named in relation to this quota. However, as the conditions of the scheme were not satisfied, an allocation was not made. An appeals procedure was put in place in relation to this scheme and almost 2,000 appeals were received and assessed. The outcomes of such appeals were notified to the appellants last week. There is no record of the person named having submitted an appeal.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	769	I propose to take Parliamentary Questions Nos. 163 and 164 together.The funding for round two of the scheme of investment aid for the development of commercial horticulture under the National Development Plan 2000-2006 for the year 2003 was €1.4 million. A total of 206 applications were received with grant aid of €7 million being sought in respect of investments of €21 million. The grant aid of €1.4 million was awarded to 129 applicants.A selection committee consisting of Department officials evaluated all applications. In making the selections a wide number of factors were taken into account in the allocation of the grants within the funding limits. These factors included: the relative value of the output of each of the sectors to the horticulture industry; compliance with conditions of the scheme; previous applications for grant aid under round one of the scheme and the track record of the applicant; the needs of the sector as well as the effect on the individual enterprise; the need for the prioritising of investments in environmental projects, new technology and specialised equipment; and capacity of having the investment completed within the specified timeframe.Details have been supplied of the number of projects assisted per sector, the actual approved expenditure in each of the six sectors of the horticulture industry, and the average grant per applicant in that sector. The person referred to by the Deputy received a grant in the first round of this scheme which was paid to him in 2002. I regret that limited funds did not allow for a grant to be paid in this second round. It will be open to those who did not receive grants in this round to apply in 2004 subject to funding being available.

My Department has pointed out the potential implications both for farmers who have already retired under the early retirement schemes, and for the younger farmers who have taken over their holdings. I have also raised the matter at the Council of Ministers where the CAP reform negotiations are at an advanced stage.

These options include extending the existing station using an adjacent site and building a new station on a greenfield site. The provision of a new station will be carried out in accordance with the priority given by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and will depend on the availability of appropriate funding.

This involves setting aside 1% of all construction budgets, subject to limits, for an artistic element.The sum of €14,267.92 was expended under the 1% for art scheme in connection with the project for the new prefab office building in the Athlone campus. The works were purchased in September 2001. These art works will remain permanently located in Athlone.Guidelines for the acquisition of art under this scheme by Departments with construction budgets are set out in the public art research project steering group report to Government 1997 and also in the Office of Public Works Art Management Handbook 1998. The art works located in the Department of Education and Science campus in Athlone were purchased under the Government's per cent for art scheme.

The provision for this purpose in 2003 is €245,000. Gaeleagras na Seirbhíse Poiblí was established in 1971 with the general aim of promoting the Irish language throughout the public service. It provides Irish language training for civil servants to enable them to deal with the public through Irish. Gaeleagras pursues this aim through a range of activities such as day and evening courses, proficiency testing of Irish among civil servants for promotion purposes, special courses for targeted groups and residential courses in the Gaeltacht.

That decision has not yet been taken and before it is taken it is vital that all concerned are fully consulted, be they staff concerned about their futures or departmental management concerned about the delivery of public services.I am not in position at present to state when the Government will make a decision on the matter but while the deliberative process is ongoing, it would be premature and inappropriate to identify a particular location which might be selected for inclusion in the new programme of decentralisation. I am aware of the case made for Athy and it will be given consideration, along with all submissions received on behalf of towns around the country, as part of the deliberative process.
#TomParlonPD	unknown-#TomParlonPD-party	unknown-#TomParlonPD-dob	unknown-#TomParlonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	783	Given the nature and specific functions of Farmleigh House and estate as a State residence for visiting dignitaries and as a venue for high level Government meetings and functions, it is not considered to be an appropriate or suitable location for a children's playground for the local community. While a successful public access programme has been in operation since Farmleigh opened in 2001, necessary security restrictions during official use of Farmleigh means that the estate cannot be open for public use seven days a week. It is sometimes necessary also to close the estate and house to the public at short notice. In these circumstances, it would not serve the interests of the local community nor would it represent good value for money to devote resources to developing a children's play ground at Farmleigh as a community amenity when access to that facility by the local community may be restricted to a significant extent and in an unpredictable manner.The provision of community amenities such as children's playgrounds falls principally within the local authorities' area of responsibility. The question of providing a children's playground for the Dublin 15-Dublin West area should be raised with the community or parks divisions of Fingal County Council.

This breaks down as €27,856,913.94 on the State Laboratory and €33,272,759.85 on the Department of Agriculture and Food laboratories.The estimated cost, including siteworks, construction costs, design team fees, VAT, inflation, etc., of building new laboratories at Backweston is €199.3 million. This breaks down to €78.7 million for the State Laboratory and €120.6 million for the Department of Agriculture and Food laboratories.It is expected that practical completion of the State Laboratory will be achieved by April 2004 with practical completion of the Department of Agriculture and Food laboratories following by early 2005.

L. Forristal, DD, Bishop of Ossory. The response stated that to consider capital funding for refurbishment of accommodation for the St Kieran's College Outreach Centre, Kilkenny, a firm proposal should be made by the National University of Ireland, Maynooth, to the Higher Education Authority in the first instance. To date no proposal regarding St. Kieran's has been submitted by NUI Maynooth to the Higher Education Authority.The authority, at my request, is undertaking a review of all capital projects in the third level sector to establish prioritisation and agree rephasing in preparation for a building programme in 2004 and future years. As part of this exercise, the authority has established a working group, and all relevant third level institutions including NUI Maynooth have been invited to make submissions to this group on all their capital requirements.

However, practical support for gaelscoileanna is demonstrated through the payment of increased capitation grants for pupils in these schools. In the current school year 2002-03 the standard rate of capitation grant paid by my Department to primary schools was €111.58 per pupil. In the case of gaelscoileanna the capitation grant paid was €137.50 per pupil.

Furthermore it requires the maintenance of Irish as the primary community language in Gaeltacht areas. This position is reflected in the report of the Gaeltacht Commission 2002 which provides the basis for future policy on the Irish language and the Gaeltacht.

This is in accordance with guidelines agreed between my Department and the education partners.The school in question had an enrolment of 180 pupils on 30 September 2002, which entitles the school to a staffing of a principal and seven mainstream class teachers for the 2003-04 school year. The agreed appointment figure for the eighth mainstream class teacher is 193 pupils.An independent appeals board was established to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board operates independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision is final. A circular outlining these new procedures issued to all primary schools.The staffing of the school referred to by the Deputy for the 2003-04 school year was considered by the appeals board and I understand that the board of management of the school was notified of the decision of the appeals board in April 2003.

The representatives were advised that recognition as a mainstream school could not be granted since the requirements for curriculum provision and patronage were not being met.Given the emphasis of the school, the representatives acknowledged that it might be more appropriate to apply for recognition as a special school and indicated that they would consider submitting a proposal in this regard to the special education section of my Department. No such proposal or application for funding has been received to date.

While the figures recorded a slight decrease in overall visitor numbers of 0.3% compared with the same period last year, foreign revenue earnings from tourism increased by almost 10%. The indications from the tourism agencies and industry generally is that 2003 is proving to be yet another testing year for tourism. The Iraqi war, the spread of SARS and a continuing sluggishness in the economies of our main source markets have all combined to produce a difficult international marketing environment.With an increased Exchequer investment in tourism marketing this year, Tourism Ireland and Fáilte Ireland have been able to implement a strong and sustained campaign of marketing activities in our key source markets. The marketing programmes for Britain, continental Europe and the US have all been boosted in recent weeks to ensure that Ireland is ideally positioned to capitalise on the upturn in consumer confidence in the wake of the Iraqi conflict. For my part, I have lent my support to these efforts in the field with visits to Germany, Britain and France earlier this year and an upcoming week long visit to the east and west coasts of the US at the end of this month.

Within this overall framework, however, some two-thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintaining existing levels of service across all service programmes, including services for older people.While it is regrettable the level of investment in these services achieved in recent years could not be maintained in 2003, my Department will work closely with the health boards and other service providers on service provision this year. I am examining all options to ensure that the new unit in Birr opens at the earliest possible date.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	820	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on residency and means rather than income. Any person who is accepted by the health boards as being ordinarily resident in Ireland is entitled to either full eligibility – category 1, i.e. medical card holders – or limited eligibility – category 2 – for health services.Persons in category 1 are medical card holders and are entitled to a full range of services, including all out-patient public hospital services without charge.Persons in category 2 – non-medical card holders – are entitled, subject to certain charges, to out-patient public hospital services including consultants services. The Health (Out-Patient Charges) (Amendment) Regulations 2002 provide for a statutory charge of €40 per visit for an attendance at accident and emergency departments. This charge is levied only on persons who attend at accident and emergency departments without a referral note from their doctor and applies only for the first visit of any episode of care. Other than this charge, which refers only to visits to an A & E department, there are no other charges for public patients attending outpatient public hospital clinics.There are a number of people who are exempt from this charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations. Also exempt from these charges, in respect of treatment for the particular condition, are children suffering from prescribed diseases, i.e. mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy.Where exemptions do not apply, the charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship. My Department has asked Mr. Michael Lyons, Chief Executive Officer, Eastern Regional Health Authority to examine the matter and to respond to the Deputy directly.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	831	Arising from concerns about the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice in the past, the chief  medical officer at my Department, in April 2001, asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists for its comments and advice on the matter. The institute represents obstetrical and gynaecological opinion in Ireland, acts as an advisory body on matters relating to education, research and administration in the specialty and seeks to raise standards in obstetrics and gynaecology in this country.The institute replied in May 2001 to the CMO and confirmed that from around 1920 until around 1960 symphysiotomy procedures were carried out on selected patients in Dublin, mainly at the National Maternity Hospital and the Coombe Hospital. In the case of Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, my Department was informed by the North-Eastern Health Board that 188 such procedures were performed at the hospital in the period 1955 to 1982, with some 158 of these being performed prior to 1970.The institute advised that excellent results were claimed for the procedure which had the effect of permanently enlarging the pelvis and allowing women to undergo normal delivery. This was at a time when caesarean section had a high mortality rate due to sepsis, one of the leading causes of maternal death at that time. The institute stated that in properly conducted cases complications were rare. Published medical reports of the time indicated favourable results for the procedure. Many of the cases referred to in these reports were emergency admissions with obstructed labour where sepsis following caesarean section would have carried a significant risk of maternal death.From 1950 onwards, the operation of symphysiotomy for obstructed labour was gradually replaced by the modern caesarean section, as antibiotics were available by then to treat infection and sepsis was less of a hazard. The institute also stated that the operation of symphysiotomy remains an accepted indication for the management of a trapped after coming head of a breech, but that caesarean section is now recommended for all mature infants who present with a breech presentation.We must be cautious about judging procedures and interventions which were used in previous generations in the light of current knowledge and experience. Enormous medical advances have been made in obstetric practice since the 1950s and procedures were not as advanced then as they are in Ireland today. Under the circumstances, I have no plans to establish an inquiry into the use of symphysiotomy in obstetrical practice. I am aware that a request has been made by a group, representing women who have experienced this procedure, and I have agreed to meet this group on the issue.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	833	I propose to take Questions Nos. 230, 231, 233 and 234 together.The Deputy has referred specifically to the Brennan report. However, the questions relate to the health service reform programme more generally. The health service reform programme was announced on 18 June last. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service, known as the Brennan report, and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, known as the Prospectus report, which were also published on the same day.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	834	The health service reform programme was announced on 18 June last. The reform programme has drawn on the conclusions and recommendations of the two reports, the Commission on Financial Management and Control Systems in the Health Service – known as the Brennan report – and the Audit of Structures and Functions in the Heath System, known as the Prospectus report – which were also published on the same day.The health services are all about people – the patients and clients who receive services, and the people who deliver those services. I take the opportunity to reiterate that there have been many improvements and gains made in recent years within the system. These include the introduction of new services, the extension of existing services and significant increases in activity across the board. This reflects very positively on people working in the health system in responding to the challenges presented by factors such as increasing demand, an ageing population and technology growth.Both of the reports I mentioned emphasise the valuable role played by staff in the system. Both acknowledge the considerable value of human resources as a key strength of the system. By definition these are people who are professional, efficient and care passionately about the health services. They will also be key to implementing the reform programme.
Questions Nos. 233 and 234 answered with Question No. 230.

My Department is advised that emergency medical technicians in the South-Eastern Health Board withdrew from on-call and related stand-by duties with effect from 10 May 2003. Emergency medical technicians from ambulance bases in Gorey, New Ross and Enniscorthy are taking part in the industrial action.My Department, through the Department of Defence, requested the assistance of the Army to provide on-call cover for the duration of the dispute. On foot of this request the Army medical corps agreed to provide on-call cover for the board and is operating two ambulances in the region, one based in New Ross and one based in Gorey. These locations were identified by the board to maximise the assistance being provided by the Army medical corps. I am advised that the board has engaged the services of the Labour Relations Commission and that, under its auspices, talks are under way with SIPTU in an effort to resolve the dispute. I understand these talks are continuing.

Where an individual wishes to receive medical treatment in another EU member state, he or she must apply to the local health board for authorisation for the treatment in question. The health board assesses each individual application on the basis of criteria issued by the Department, which includes the submission of the necessary medical evidence by a hospital consultant. If authorisation is granted, a form E112 is issued which confirms the health board's commitment to pay the cost of treatment.

While information regarding the number of NCHDs in possession of a certificate of satisfactory completion of specialist training, CSCST, is not yet available for 2003, the medical training bodies indicated to the Department in 2002 that there were approximately 35 doctors in possession of the CSCST employed in the public system at the time. The report of the National Joint Steering Group on the working hours of non-consultant hospital doctors, 2001, indicated that NCHDs worked an average of 77 hours per week. The data available to my Department regarding average NCHD working hours does not allow identification of the working hours of individual doctors, including those in possession of CSCST.

The personnel strength, all ranks of that station on 30 June 1993 was five. Resources for Rush are augmented from within the district-division as required. The area is also patrolled by the district detective unit and the divisional traffic unit.Rush is in the Balbriggan Garda District of the Louth-Meath Division. The personnel strength, all ranks of the Louth-Meath division on 20 June 2003 was 520. This compares with a personnel strength, all ranks of 482 on 30 June 1993, which represents an increase of 38.It is the responsibility of the divisional officer to allocate personnel within a division as she or he sees fit. Garda management will continue to appraise the policing and administrative strategy employed in the Rush area with a view to ensuring an effective Garda service is maintained.The situation will be kept under review and when additional personnel next become available the needs of Rush Garda Station will be fully considered within the context of the overall needs of Garda Stations throughout the country.

In recognition of the fact that the holiday centre had hosted the Community Games finals for many years, it was agreed with the proprietors that the games would continue to be hosted at the centre. As such, the games were held there in 2001 and 2002 and are scheduled to take place there again in August of this year.Funding provided by my Department to facilitate the holding of the games in Mosney was €339,095 in 2001, €165,000 in 2002 and a sum of €150,000 was made available for this year. In making these subventions available, together with agreeing to make the Mosney Centre available, recognition has been given by the Government to the fact that the Community Games is a unique national organisation which provides an unparalleled opportunity every year for children to participate in sports and pageantry. The RIA will continue to liaise with representatives of the Community Games on the use of Mosney in future years and in the context of the overall budgetary situation going forward.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	867	The specification of lime mortars for conservation works is recognised internationally as a complex and evolving process. Present best practice favours the use of non-hydraulic mortars with the addition of "pozzolans" or additives to impart the appropriate degree of strength for the circumstance in which the mortars are to be used. This practice is an improvement over the use of cementitious mortars, which have been demonstrated to have adverse effects in the long-term on the integrity of structures that were originally constructed, and for centuries repaired, in lime mortar.This approach does not permit the use of a single standard specification and there is expert consensus that tailoring the mix to the particular conditions of the site is essential. Although the aggregate used in the mixtures for the works may change, as may the proportions of pozzolans added in, the ratio of aggregate to lime in Kells remains at present at three to one. Detailed work regarding the use of variations in lime mortar mixes has been carried out by my Department and presented to the Building Limes Forum, an international group of expert conservationists formed to research and promote the use of lime in conservation works, at its annual gathering in Kilkenny in September 2002.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	868	My Department and the majority of Departments use a standard payroll system supported by the Department of Finance centre for management and organisation development or CMOD. At present, weekly payslips on the standard CMOD designed corepay payslip provide the maximum amount of information possible within the capacity of the system involved, in terms of details of basic pay and plus payments. They also clearly denote all deductions made. Further information on rates of pay and hours worked is available from local centres.Having regard to the wide dispersal of my Department's staff and the tight scheduling requirements of the weekly payroll system, it would be impractical to operate a system whereby individual employees' signed for their working hours. Furthermore, such a procedure would involve duplication of existing systems, where hours worked are recorded on individual time clock cards or attendance books. It is open to my Department's staff to raise any query regarding wage payments with their local centre in the first instance. In the event of failure to resolve issues locally, the matter can then be raised with either the personnel or accounts sections of my Department, as appropriate.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	869	As indicated in my reply to Questions Nos. 113 and 115 of 12 June 2003, the staffing complement involved in human resource matters in my Department is 78. In common with arrangements across the Civil Service, the persons assigned to this work are predominantly officers in general service grades for whom specific professional qualifications are not prescribed. This is considered to provide the most appropriate mix of skills and  operational flexibility. It also allows mobility, personal development opportunities and skills transfers which would not be available to my Department if recruitment and assignments were more narrowly based on prescribed qualifications for specific posts. Nevertheless, many officers in these areas have obtained third level qualifications ranging from masters degrees in HR and IT, primary degrees in computer science and engineering and diplomas and certificates in various aspects of IT and HR to specific training tailored to the work undertaken in different operational areas.I am satisfied that audits conducted by my Department's internal audit unit are professional, comprehensive and impartial and that its objectives, as an independent appraisal function for the review of internal control systems, are met having regard to the resources available. Internal audit work is concerned with the adequacy of internal control as a contribution to the proper, economic, efficient and effective use of resources while financial audits are generally the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General. As a consequence, I do not accept that professional accountancy qualifications are an essential requirement for all internal audit work.The imputation in the question in relation to the professional skills of my Department's internal audit unit is not correct. The position is that a general service officer, who has a professional qualification in internal auditing and who has completed a number of courses in internal auditing, manages the unit. He also has wide experience of audit work, including experience in two other Departments. The support staff of five persons includes three officers with professional accountancy qualifications. The remaining staff have completed two external training courses in internal audit.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	872	Section 47 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 enables planning authorities to enter into agreements with any person with a legal interest in land in their area for the purpose of restricting or regulating the development or use of the land, either permanently or for a specific period. Such agreements may be used, for example, where applications are made for housing for family members on farm land where, under the development plan, planning permission for housing would not normally be granted.In circumstances such as these, where it is proposed to grant permission as an exception to the general planning policy for the area, permission for a house may be granted subject to a requirement that the house is occupied by a family member and to a requirement that a section 47 agreement is signed to ensure that remaining land is kept available for farming by restricting further housing development. I have no proposals to amend these provisions.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	873	Information on the number of dwellings completed by local authorities for elderly people in 2001 and 2002 is set out in the following table. A breakdown, by individual local authority, of the total number of houses completed by local authorities and the voluntary sector in 2001 and 2002 is contained in my Department's annual housing statistics bulletins, copies of which are available in the Oireachtas Library.The statutory assessment of local authority housing need is undertaken every three years. The most recent assessment undertaken by local authorities, in March 2002, indicated that a total of 48,413 households were in need of housing, of which 2,006 were elderly person households or 4% of net need. Detailed information on the results of the 2002 assessment was published in my Department's September 2002 quarterly edition of the housing statistics bulletin.Under the terms of my Department's voluntary housing capital assistance scheme, as amended in November 2001, up to 25% of sheltered housing accommodation in a project which is funded under the scheme may be made available for allocation to elderly emigrants returning to this country from abroad who satisfy the eligibility criteria. To qualify for accommodation provided under the scheme, applicants must be elderly persons who emigrated from Ireland to another country and be either in existing social housing or private rented accommodation in their country of residence. In addition, their circumstances must be such that they could not provide suitable accommodation for themselves out of their own resources on returning to this country. The assessment of the circumstances of such emigrants is undertaken by the Safe Home organisation, without the need for applicants to return for assessment. This avoids the need for elderly applicants for accommodation provided under the capital assistance scheme to return to be formally assessed as being in need of social housing by the relevant housing authority here.

I have spoken many times of the need for a settlement pattern that would allow for the regeneration of rural areas, particularly those which have suffered continuous decline. Government policy on rural development is set out in the White Paper published in August 1999. As a result the Government is committed to ensuring the economic and social wellbeing of rural communities and providing the conditions for a meaningful fulfilling life for all people living in rural areas. The aim is to have vibrant and sustainable communities able to enjoy a standard of living and quality of life which will make them attractive communities in which to live and work and where individuals and families will have a real choice as to whether to stay in, leave or move to, rural Ireland, whether in farming or otherwise.

I am pleased to advise the Deputy that under the local development social inclusion programme, which is administered by ADM Limited, funding of some €698,451 was provided to the action south Kildare community group in 2002. A further €626,616 has been allocated to action south Kildare under this programme in 2003. My Department also provides core funding to a community development project in Athy, County Kildare under the community development programme; €73,744 was provided to this project in 2003 and a further €20,000 has already been provided in support in 2003. I have also recently announced my intention to provide core funding to a community development project in Newbridge, County Kildare, funding in the sum of €60,000 to be made available from September 2003 on a one year renewable contract basis.The Deputy will be aware from material provided on foot of my response to Parliamentary Question No. 24 of 26 March 2003 that my Department received five applications from groups in County Kildare under the CAIT II scheme. In 2002 it received 12 applications under the funding scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector. The assessment of applications under this scheme is at an advanced stage and it is now expected that this process will be completed by the end of July.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	880	Three schemes relating to community development were transferred in the manner referred to by the Deputy, the community development support programmes (CDSPs); the  scheme of once-off grants; and the scheme of community support for older people.The CDSPs provide financial assistance to locally based groups involved in anti-poverty and social inclusion initiatives in their communities towards the staffing and equipping of community resource centres and other specialised projects and initiatives. Some €21.3 million has been provided this year, compared with an outturn of some €22.5 million in 2002, to meet my Department's commitments under those programmes.My Department is also responsible for the operation of a scheme of once-off grants, which benefits voluntary and community groups which focus on tackling poverty and disadvantage and work from community development principles. The sum of €2.356 million is provided in this year's Estimates to operate that scheme, compared with an outturn of some €2.662 million in 2002, which is being advertised in the national and local media from today. My Department also operates the scheme of community support for older people, and €3.444 million has been allocated to it in 2003, compared with an outturn of some €2.69 million in 2002.The Deputy will be aware that two other schemes, the grant scheme for national federations and representative bodies in the voluntary sector, 2003 provision: €1.827 million, and the grant scheme for training and supports in the community and voluntary sector, 2003 provision: €600,000, which had been established but had not yet become operational, have also been transferred to my Department. I look forward to allocating that funding at the end of July. In general, I can assure the Deputy that the allocations made in the current year will be sufficient to meet the obligations arising from the schemes outlined above.

Support of some €7,469,161 was provided to the 14 local drugs task forces (LDTFs) in 2002, bringing the amount allocated or spent to implement around 500 projects contained in the plans of the task forces since 1997 to over €65 million. A further €2,452,089 has been allocated for the support of the LDTFs in 2003. Further funding of more than €11.5 million has been allocated to LDTF areas under the premises initiative, including €4,309,000 in 2002. An allocation of €1,192,000 has been provided under the premises initiative in 2003.Assistance to a value of €59 million has also been provided under the young people's facilities and services fund in task force areas and selected urban areas where a drug problem exists or has the potential to develop. That includes expenditure in 2002 of €15,933,099, while the allocation for 2003 is €10,879,386.

The Deputy will also be aware from replies to previous questions of the range and nature of schemes within the remit of the Department.Data such as that included in the census figures published last week will be of significant value to my Department in supporting the development and implementation of policy initiatives across the range of the Department's activities.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-06-25 00:00:00	Prelude	885	My Department recognises the right of customers to be dealt with in Irish if they so wish and makes every effort to ensure that a service through Irish is available and of a high standard. Each year budgets are allocated towards aspects of customer service in my Department which include the provision of services through Irish. Those include the training of frontline staff, the translation and printing of forms and leaflets, and the provision of signage in public areas of the Department's offices.To date, no specific budgets for the development of the Irish language have been allocated to the statutory agencies under the aegis of my Department, the Combat Poverty Agency, Comhairle, the Pensions Board and the Family Support Agency. However, budgets allocated to those organisations may be, and in some instances have been, allocated to the development of Irish, mainly through the production of Irish information leaflets. The principles of quality customer service, introduced interdepartmentally and adopted by my Department in 2000, have been extended to those agencies and include a commitment to provide quality services through Irish and/or bilingually and inform customers of their right to choose to be dealt with through one or other of the official languages.The enactment of the Official Languages (Equality) Bill 2000 will further strengthen the remit of public bodies, including those under the aegis of my Department, to provide quality customer service through Irish.

The policy of the Government in recent years has been to increase the amount spent on child benefit for all families substantially. The Government's commitment to that policy is reflected in the substantial resources we have invested in the child benefit scheme since 1997, with total expenditure reaching €1.9 billion when the current programme of multi-annual increases is complete.Child benefit is a monthly payment to parents to assist with the ongoing costs of raising a child. It would not be appropriate to pay it by way of an up front lump sum in the manner suggested by the Deputy. According to figures collected under the quarterly national household survey by the Central Statistics Office for the final quarter of 2002, there were an estimated 116,700 students aged 19 to 22 years. Extending child benefit to that category would therefore cost around €185 million per annum.Any proposals to extend child benefit entitlement to students over 19 years or to all students up to the age of 22 and in full-time education would be costly and would have to be considered in the light of available resources and overall budgetary priorities. The Government has already recognised the need to target resources at persons on low incomes with children in third-level education. Consequently, child dependent allowances are payable to the age of 22 where the parent of a full-time third level student is in receipt of a long-term social welfare payment.From October 2003, child dependent allowances will also be extended to age 22 to people on short-term social welfare schemes for six months and where the child is attending a full-time course of education or training. The measure is estimated to cost €0.63 million in a full year, short-term schemes include such payments as unemployment benefit and assistance, disability benefit and supplementary welfare allowance. The higher education grant scheme is the responsibility of the Department of Education and Science, and the question of the means assessment for the scheme is a matter for that Department.

Where those participants are unable to find employment during the summer period, they may, subject to satisfying the usual qualifying conditions, be entitled to unemployment benefit or unemployment assistance. For that reason, it is not possible to state what savings will accrue as a result of the measure. However, if all BTEA participants found work during the summer period, savings of some €12.5 million would accrue.It should also be noted that BTEA participants progressing to the next year of their course or progressing in qualifications will have their BTEA reinstated from the beginning of the new academic year, irrespective of whether they were employed or in receipt of an unemployment payment during the summer.
