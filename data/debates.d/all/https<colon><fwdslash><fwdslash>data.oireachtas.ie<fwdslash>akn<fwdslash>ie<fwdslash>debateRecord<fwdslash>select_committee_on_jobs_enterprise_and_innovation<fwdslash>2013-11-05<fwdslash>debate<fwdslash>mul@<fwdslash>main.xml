          <p eId="para_9">This meeting has been convened for the purpose of consideration by this committee of the Companies Bill 2012, which was referred to the select committee by order of the Dáil on 25 April 2013. I welcome Deputy Sean Sherlock, Minister of State at the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation with responsibility for research and innovation, and all his officials. I thank them for all the co-operation in recent months, especially through Ms Elaine Cassidy, to get to this stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_10"> As this is one of the largest Bills in the history of the State, with the prior agreement of members we have set aside four days this week and the same next week for its consideration. In addition, we have booked Friday, 22 November and Friday, 29 November to conclude our consideration of the Bill if necessary. Is that agreed? Agreed. Should our consideration of the Bill on Thursday 14 November progress well, it would be proposed to sit later that night to conclude our consideration. Is that agreed? Agreed.</p>
          <p eId="para_11"> As discussed in our private session the following arrangements will apply. Sections grouped in accordance with the list circulated to members will be disposed of by one question. I refer members to the grouping of amendments for the purpose of debate. We will now proceed to our consideration of the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I would like to get some background information from the Minister of State. My amendment relates to Irish-registered non-resident companies. A report published in 1998, which tackled this problem, stated that a company must carry out some activity but did not state that the company should be managed or controlled within the State. A report by the Department of Finance in 1998 recommended that this be addressed in some way. My amendment, with amendment No. 7, tries to do that. We say that not only should the company carry out some activity within the State but that it must also be managed and controlled within the State, particularly for tax purposes. We would like some feedback from the Minister of State on this amendment.</p>

        <speech by="#SeanSherlock" eId="spk_15" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Jobs,_Enterprise_and_Innovation">
          <from>Deputy Sean Sherlock<recordedTime time="2013-11-05T10:10:00+00:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_39">This series of amendments inserts the words "managed and controlled" into sections of the Bill. The objective appears to be to cause all companies registered in Ireland to be tax resident in Ireland. As Minister of State with responsibility for jobs, enterprise and innovation, I am not in a position to consider the full impact or consequences of any change to tax law. Such an exercise is within the functions of the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> The proposed amendments are illegal under EU law and international law. The provisions would fall foul of the EU law of freedom of establishment, a core aspect of EU law. The European Commission closely monitors compliance with this law. The Commission has recently required Ireland to change a provision of Irish law which required that at least one director of an Irish company be resident in Ireland. This provision would go much further, effectively requiring all management activities to occur within the State. This is clearly a hindrance to cross-border trade within the European Union and significantly trammels the ability of a company from another EU member state to establish in Ireland. This proposal would put Ireland in breach of obligations under double taxation agreements with other countries. This is unprecedented and would be highly prejudicial to Irish commerce and to Ireland's reputation internationally. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting these amendments.</p>

We want to get through Committee Stage, but it is important that members are aware that they can discuss any issue that arises. In fact, a proposal can only go forward on Report Stage if it has been discussed here. If members have any concerns about anything the Minister of State has raised, I urge them to address it today.

          <p eId="para_101">I do not accept that there is any sense of pulling anything out of the hat in terms of the substance of the legislation. Section 59 is effectively a new section which stipulates that during the transition period, the law applicable to an existing private company limited by shares will be contained in Part 16. There is still some work to be done on that. I ask members for some latitude in terms of the sheer volume of the legislation. I am proceeding in accordance with the protocol that we notify the committee of our intent to introduce amendments on Report Stage. There is no attempt to pull anything out of the hat at the last minute in terms of the entirety of the procedure. However, there are issues that will arise between now and Report Stage.</p>

I assure members that any outstanding concerns they might have will be dealt with by way of a briefing session after Committee Stage and before Report Stage. We have had very useful briefings from the Department on numerous occasions in the past. If there is a list of new amendments on Report Stage, we can have a briefing session, as we have done before. Report Stage will take place on the floor of the Dáil and there will be unlimited time at that stage to discuss any issue. There is no agenda here to slip proposals through without debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">To clarify, there is no intention to make substantive changes to the law itself in terms of its qualitative aspect. However, there has been some engagement since Second Stage with practitioners, in the light of which several amendments will be introduced on Report Stage. The word "technical" is not quite correct, but their purpose will essentially be to make the law more efficient in the longer term. That is the main reason I expect to bring forward further amendments on Report Stage.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_284">"In addition to the primary duty owed to the company under <i>section 224</i>, the directors shall owe a general duty to its employees and to its members.".</p>
          <p eId="para_285">We would not have companies if they did not accept that their primary duty is to make money because they would not survive if they did not. At the moment, saying that the directors shall have regard to employees is not a duty. While acknowledging that the primary duty of a company is to its members and to ensuring they are sustainable from a financial point of view, there should be more protection for employees and there should be a duty to them in the interests of corporate responsibility. Stipulating that the directors shall have regard to their employees has no strength because it does not represent a duty and is just a token gesture. If we were to include the employees, it would not mean that the employees would always be seen to be in the right in a dispute but it would give the courts an opportunity to interpret it as they saw fit depending on the information put before them.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">Under existing law, directors are required to have regard to the interests of employees. This amendment would change it to a duty to employees. This may mean that members and employees would have a directly enforceable right against directors where they act contrary to their respective interests. This would compromise the fundamental structure of the directors' relationship with the company, which is described to be fiduciary, that is to say it requires directors to prefer the interests of the company over their interests or those of others, even where those others include some members of the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_287"> The amendment puts into question the status of the law of oppression, which is the principal protection of minority shareholders under the current law and much of the employment law. Such a vague and general declaration of a duty without any explanation as to how it interacts with existing law would serve to create great uncertainty in company law. This is directly contrary to one of the key objectives of the Bill, which is to clarify directors' duties. The amendment may also breach constitutional property rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_288"> Ultimately, bolstering protections for employees should be done using employment law. These provisions only serve to complicate company law and do nothing to protect employees of partnerships and sole traders and public employees. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_291">I understand where Deputy Wallace is coming from but I also understand where the Minister of State is coming from. It is probably better addressed within employment law but perhaps the Government needs to look at that because there is no indication that we will address the area of employees under company law. The Minister of State comes from a county where we saw a pretty high-profile dispute last year about employees in a company that was going into liquidation, so there is certainly room for improvement in respect of employees' rights and conditions. While this may not be the legislation to deal with it, I understand where Deputy Wallace is coming from. It is something that must be dealt with and if it is not going to be dealt with in this legislation for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State, it probably needs to be dealt with by another committee in respect of employment legislation.</p>

          <p eId="para_292">I would also argue that employment law is a different area. Employment law does not have the capacity to cover all situations where employees' interests are not being catered for by the company in a fair manner. Including this amendment, which puts an obligation on companies to behave with a greater sense of responsibility to their employees, might be different. It would not be the way things happen in most of the developed world. That is because of the privileges given to companies. While I understand that we would not have them if they did not have certain privileges, I believe that the protection of employees' interests in certain situations should be strengthened. For example, employment law is not much good to one when companies are going out of business. This amendment would give greater protection to employees.</p>

          <p eId="para_311">I move amendment No. 59:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_312">In page 240, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_313">"(c) environmental law;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_314">(d) health and safety law;</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_315">(e) employment law,</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_316">and relevant obligations relating to <i>paragraphs (c)</i>, <i>(d) </i>and <i>(e) </i>shall be interpreted in accordance with both national and European Communities law;".</p>
          <p eId="para_317">This amendment is a bit more self-explanatory. It extends the obligations on directors in respect of their compliance statements to cover not only tax and company law, but also public interest considerations such as environmental, health and safety and employment law. It is hoped that this will encourage a wider sense of corporate responsibility towards society and shared natural resources rather than just towards a company itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_318"> In today's language, these amount to externalities and are not considered as being costs to the company. Externalities are unintended side effects of the market economy and are the impact of commercial transactions that fall outside the two parties to that transaction. For example, when a consumer buys gardening tools and materials, a positive externality is experienced by others in the community, as the consumer uses those materials to make an attractive garden from which everyone in the community can gain enjoyment and benefit. On the other hand, if a consumer hires a contractor to cut down the trees on his or her property in order to park an extra car, the community experiences a negative externality, as the scenic beauty, shade, animal habitat and fresh air provided by the trees are lost.</p>
          <p eId="para_319"> Externalities can be positive or negative. For the companies that organise the production of goods and services in the professional economy, however, they are to be ignored. Since externalities do not directly affect the responsible parties, profitability is not harmed by them. This principle has led to significant economic impacts. For example, the large-scale outsourcing of America's mass production has had considerable effect, including the decline of large urban regions due to depressed demand, resulting in increased rates of crime, family strain and domestic abuse. These are external side effects of corporate investment strategies, as they do not directly hurt earnings. Too often, capital is pushed forward despite these side effects. The world would be a better place if companies had a responsibility to consider externalities.</p>

          <p eId="para_320">Notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy has been brushing up on his neo-Marxist economic theory - it sounds vaguely familiar from my college days - this question was dealt with comprehensively by the Company Law Review Group, CLRG, in its 2005 report on directors' compliance statements. If members will pardon my use of acronyms, the CLRG decided that such extra duties would do little to increase compliance and would merely result in an increase in red tape at significant cost to business. The set-up cost for a business was an estimated €90,000 and its ongoing annual cost was estimated at €40,000. A streamlined version of the director's compliance statement proposed by the CLRG, which is a statutory body, removed the requirement that the statement should include a declaration that the company had complied with all other enactments that could affect its financial performance. This was found to be the most burdensome aspect of the statement and also the least relevant, as companies were already legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas. Their inclusion in the compliance statement did not add substantive duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_321"> More than 80% of the CLRG's members, including members representing the Financial Regulator and other public bodies, agreed to a more balanced version of the director's compliance statement. There is a strong EU impetus towards less unnecessary regulation to make EU businesses more competitive. This amendment would create unjustifiable and disproportionate costs on Irish businesses and disadvantage Ireland competitively, as we would have gone beyond other countries. The current compliance statement has received support from industry and regulators alike. For these reasons, it is intended to preserve it in the Bill. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting the amendment.</p>

          <p eId="para_322">One of the reasons that we are in this situation is that so much bureaucracy and red tape was stripped away. While there is such a thing as red tape that has no benefit for anyone, much of it was designed to ensure that companies behaved in a certain manner, even in their own best interests. In the past 20 years, companies have made many decisions that were not in their best long-term interests. For example, some companies are making decisions based on three-month thinking because everything is driven by the markets and what they can sell. The companies are not concerned about where they will be in five years' time. There is nothing to stop them from making decisions that are not in the interests of their long-term health. Claiming that companies that have regard to the environment and take a more direct duty towards health and safety and employment law will not be able to compete amounts to a race to the bottom. That is where we are heading in a canoe without a paddle.</p>

          <p eId="para_324">I beg the Chairman's indulgence. To a certain extent, I understand the motive behind the amendment, but one must factor into the equation a corpus of environmental, health and safety and employment law. The issue of negative or positive externalities does not arise. We must ensure that there is robust legislation. Every citizen is subject to the existing corpus of law and companies are legally obliged to comply with all Acts of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">That is already inherent, thereby rendering the amendment unsupportable in that sense.</p>

However, section 225 does not impose such a duty on directors to their employees. Section 225 provides that the matters to which the directors are to have regard in the performance of their functions shall include the interests of the company's employees in general.

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_351">In page 248, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_352">"<b>237</b>. Upon incorporation of a company, the Companies Registration Office shall issue to all listed directors a document setting our a summary of this Chapter in plain language, to include the duties provided for and the consequences for breach of such duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">This allows for the dissemination of a director's duties as set out in Part 5. The purpose of this codified version of the duties, which currently exists in a combination of common law and statutory provisions, is to act as a signpost as to the standard of conduct expected of directors. </p>
          <p eId="para_354"> This amendment will facilitate the wider dissemination of these duties to all new directors upon the incorporation of a company. This would educate them fully on their responsibilities and, in a broader sense, promote a culture of corporate responsibility. Currently, this role is fulfilled by a solicitor at the expense of the company and many start-up companies do not have the means for such legal advice. Also, where there are volunteer directors, for example, in the property management sector - there are many of them around Dublin city at the moment - who are also subject to additional requirements under the Multi Unit Developments Act 2011, they may not have the means to seek legal advice regarding the legal duties owed by them. </p>

The Companies Registration Office already sends these documents to directors of newly formed companies. However, because most companies are formed by company formation's businesses, the documents generally do not get to the directors at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_357"> More important in this respect is that people applying to be registered as directors must acknowledge that they understand and accept their responsibilities as directors when completing form A1 or form B10, that is to say, before they receive the paper copy. Therefore, I am not in favour of adopting this amendment. However, even though this is not a matter for primary legislation, I acknowledge that the idea is a good one. For this reason, I will consider introducing a live link to the relevant ODCE documents so that directors can read and understand their duties online before completing the electronic form when it becomes available.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Is the Minister of State saying that on the online form a link will be provided to the duties? I agree with Deputy Wallace that it is important. Even the issue of voluntary directors is becoming more prevalent. Particularly in an area in which both myself and Deputy Wallace would have an interest such as the League of Ireland, we are seeing a lot more companies being run by supporters who are taking over football clubs and appointing directors. It happened in my own case. It would be useful, therefore, to have that live link. There is obviously an obligation on a director to get that information and to understand his or her duties, but we should make the information as accessible as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_362">There is an onus on anybody who becomes a director - in whatever capacity, be it voluntary or otherwise - to read the material. I recently joined the board of a crèche and have not yet got around to reading a large amount of documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_363">There is only so far one can go. If there is an issue with the access of the language that is a different issue altogether. The Minister of State has made it clear that there is no shortage of material available in regard to the obligations on people who set up companies of which they become directors. The problem is getting people to read it. It is up to the individuals concerned to do so. As I said earlier, I accept that if the language is not accessible for some people that might be an issue. However, there is no shortage of ways of accessing the particular information.</p>

          <p eId="para_364">When we were building apartment complexes we set up management companies. The idea was to operate them for as long as we could following which the owners of the apartments would take them over. That has been the practice for a number of years. The level of trouble coming down the tracks in regard to management companies in Dublin is frightening. There are huge problems with them. People who have become voluntary directors on these management companies do not know what they signed up for but will find out when they end up in court.</p>
          <p eId="para_365"> Would it be possible to provide that people intending to take up positions as voluntary directors on management companies attend, perhaps, a one-day course in regard to the responsibilities involved and the pitfalls in that regard? I do not believe the people signing up to these management companies fully understand what they are letting themselves in for.</p>

          <p eId="para_368">I do not think anybody would disagree with the sentiments expressed. This is not a matter for primary legislation. It could be dealt with through the ODCE and CRO simplifying the language or ensuring that people are made aware in the starkest terms of their obligations in relation to any legal entity of which they become part. That is perhaps all one can do. If somebody decides to become part of a community-voluntary body or legal entity, there is only so much that the State or Government can do to legislate in respect of that decision. One would expect that people when signing up to such bodies are fully aware of their obligations. People have a personal responsibility to find out their obligations. If it is possible to simplify the language around those obligations the matter should be taken up by the ODCE and CRO.</p>

          <p eId="para_402">Since group financial statements relate to a corporate group, the group financial statements of a subsidiary, which is also a parent company, would not give any more information than the group accounts of the company at the top of the corporate group. Therefore deletion of this exemption would benefit no one other than the lawyers and accountants who would have to prepare and file thousands more group financial statements than they do at present.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Many foreign direct investment companies rely on this exemption to avoid having to prepare intermediate level group accounts that simply replicate a part of their general top level group accounts. The economic benefit of investing in Ireland would be substantially eroded by requiring these companies to prepare many different sets of group accounts. This would also be a departure from established international practice. Most notably this exemption exists in the United Kingdom. This deletion might constitute a breach of articles 7, 8 and 11 of the seventh accounting directive. For those reasons I am not in favour of changing the section.</p>

In the case of an Irish-registered but non-resident company which is a holding company or a subsidiary company, and which is just based on activity and is managed and controlled outside the State, are we saying that the group accounts would cover the activities of the particular company that is registered within the State?

          <p eId="para_405">I am not sure I understand the question. This is effectively avoiding a duplication or proliferation of reporting mechanisms. The Deputy seems to seek greater clarity on those companies that are Irish-registered but non-resident companies. Section 301 reads: "Subject to its not having elected to prepare IFRS group financial statements and to <i>subsection (4)</i>, a holding company is exempt from the requirement to prepare group financial statements if the holding company (the “lower holding company”) is itself a subsidiary undertaking and its holding undertaking is not established under the laws of an EEA state and one or other of the following cases applies."

          <p eId="para_419">I have a quick question on the definition of shares. My understanding is that the definition of shares in section 306(5) applies to shares quoted on any securities or other markets referred to in section 1071. Under my reading, that would exclude shares quoted on the Nasdaq or the SEC. Therefore, if a director was to make gains on a company based on the Nasdaq or the SEC, those gains could be exempted from being disclosed. Is that the case?</p>

          <p eId="para_470">The language in section 371 is quite vague in comparison with the language in sections 367 to 369, inclusive, as to what are the limitations of an audit opinion. My worry is that the section would be used to dilute the requirements of sections 367 to 369, inclusive. Does the Minister of State have thoughts on this with regard to Report Stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_472">The provisions of section 371 refer to how an audit opinion is valid "from the date of signature" and I believe there is a lack of clarity in section 37(5) as to the meaning of what is "a true and fair view as at the date [of] the original ... financial statements", whereas section 367 is quite precise regarding dates in respect of the original statutory statement. The worry is that section 371 allows for a material event to be missed or to be excluded from the final revised accounts, whereas sections 367 to 369, inclusive, are quite specific.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">While this matter has been referred to the company law review group, I will give the Deputy some thoughts on it here. The question effectively pertains to the requirement that an audit give a true and fair view sufficiently robust to ensure accurate accounting. That is the aspect.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">Fair enough. As EU law requires that statutory audits give a true and fair view, this already is inherent within EU law. While I will not go into the particulars of the directive, Article 35 states "an audit opinion, which shall be either unqualified, qualified or an adverse opinion and shall state clearly the opinion of the statutory auditor ... as to whether the annual financial statements give a true and fair view in accordance with the relevant financial reporting framework". Thus, any change to the current phrasing in section 337 could contravene EU law. On the question of the revised audit and begging the committee's indulgence, I propose to revert to it on Report Stage with a fuller response.</p>

There is nothing to stop any of us saying we are a prescribed accountant other than we do not have a membership certificate.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">The maximum period is 18 months but it can be done straight away.

          <p eId="para_729">It brings together the various compliance and enforcement provisions found in existing legislation, a change that will provide greater transparency. The giving and acceptance of restriction and disqualification undertakings from directors are facilitated, thereby saving costs and court time. One of the Bill's most far-reaching reforms involves the introduction of a new four-tier categorisation of offences. This follows on from a recommendation of the Company Law Review Group, CLRG. It is proposed that, except for the most serious offences, namely, fraudulent trading and market abuse, all offences under the Companies Acts should be categorised according to this four-tier scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_730"> At the higher end of the scale, category 1 offences carry, following conviction on indictment, a term of imprisonment of up to ten years and-or a €500,000 fine.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">A further new provision allows a trial court to order a person convicted under the Bill to remedy any breach thereof in respect of which he or she is convicted.</p>

          <p eId="para_734">One of the questions that has arisen in relation to this section is around prosecutions of breaches of company law and whether the Bill will rectify this issue. The answer to that is that corporate offences are by their nature difficult to investigate. The fact that white collar criminals have gotten off lightly in the wake of the economic crisis should not lead to the conclusion that the law is flawed. Corporate criminal investigations often require the gathering and examination of large volumes of complex documentation, which can be painstaking and time consuming and necessitates wide consultation with experts, including forensic accountants and lawyers. Equally, people may be unwilling to give evidence voluntarily in circumstances where they have worked with or have close business ties to an alleged offender. As a criminal must be proven guilty beyond all reasonable doubt, many plausible cases of wrongdoing will never be successfully prosecuted. This must be taken into account in terms of the context of this section.</p>

          <p eId="para_736">This section is also substantially unchanged from that provided in existing law. However, the court may make an order restraining a company or an officer of the company from removing his or her assets from the State or reducing those assets below a specified amount. This extends to the current law in that it also applies to the company and not, as provided under existing law, only to officers of a company. The circumstances in which an injunction can be granted are now limited to cases where the primary cause of action also arises under this Bill. Alternatively, the cause of action must arise under the provisions of the constitution of the company or relate to the holding of an office of the company.</p>

          <p eId="para_765">The section has some changes when compared with the existing legislation. It deals with the declaration by the court restricting a director of an insolvent company in being appointed or acting as a director. The court will make the declaration restricting the director upon application from the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the liquidator of an insolvent company or a receiver of any property of the company. The restriction is for a period of five years and the restricted person may not be appointed to act in any way, directly or indirectly, as a director or secretary or to be involved in the formation or promotion of a company, unless that company meets the required capitalisation levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_766"> It provides a defence for directors where they can show that they have acted honestly and responsibly in respect of the conduct of the affairs of the company, whether before or after it became insolvent, and where the court can see no other reason that it would be just and equitable that the director be restricted. The subsection has been amended, and that is as compared with the Companies Act 1990, in so far as a new proviso has been inserted in line with a recommendation from the Company Law Review Group. The additional requirement is that the person concerned "...has when requested to do so by the liquidator... co-operated as far as could reasonably be expected in relation to the conduct of the winding up of the insolvent company". The reason for the insertion of this provision is to promote greater co-operation by the directors and other officers with the liquidator. Subsection (3) sets out the capitalisation requirements for a company which has a restricted person acting as director or secretary or taking part in the formation or promotion of that company.</p>
          <p eId="para_767"> Provision is made for restrictions involving a guarantee company to ensure that a company may not escape a capitalisation-type requirement by reason of not having a share capital. The requirement here is that at least one of the members of the company must give a guarantee of not less than €100,000, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. In the case of an investment company, subsection (3) will be read as if the requirements are that the value of the issued share capital of the company is not less than €100,000 and that an amount of not less than €100,000 in cash has been paid in consideration for the allotment of shares in the company, subject to the amendment's being agreed to. A person restricted arising from his or her conduct in relation to a company limited by shares is restricted as regards all other company types as well.</p>

This is a new section to deal with a situation in which a director becomes disqualified under the law of another state. In such a case, where the company fails to notify the registrar of such a situation, as required by section 150(8) of this Bill, the relevant director will be deemed to be subject to a disqualification order for a period not exceeding the remaining period of the foreign disqualification. This section is new and tightens up the position under the current law whereby a person is only required to notify the registrar of their disqualification under the law of another state upon becoming a director of a company and not where the foreign disqualification occurs subsequent to their becoming a director of an Irish company.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">This is a new section. It is proposed that, subject to a small number of exceptions, such as fraudulent trading and market abuse, the majority of offences under the Companies Acts should be classified according to a four-tier system. As I outlined earlier, category 4 offences will be prosecutable only on a summary basis and on conviction will give rise to no more than a class A fine, currently set at €6,394 by the Fines Act 2010, previously £5,000. That is an amount no greater than the District Court can impose for any other criminal offence. Category 3 offences will likewise be prosecutable only summarily but on conviction may give rise to a prison sentence of up to six months or a class A fine or both. </p>
          <p eId="para_786"> Both category 2 and category 1 offences attract the same consequences when prosecuted summarily, namely, a class A fine or imprisonment of up to 12 months or both. Both these categories may also be prosecuted on indictment. In such a case, a category 2 offence will attract a fine of not more than €50,000 or a prison term not exceeding five years or both. A category 1 offence will have a penalty of a fine of not more than €500,000 or up to ten years in prison or both.</p>
