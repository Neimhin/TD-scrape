The terms of reference clearly state that the committee is required to take into account a number of factors, including the desirability of having electorally preserved natural communities or hinterlands of  populations areas.  However, in one example, the electoral division of Drummin has been transferred to the Dingle electoral area from Killorglin even though Killorglin was under populated already — one has to drive through Drummin to get to Killorglin.

In view of the importance of this request, I hope the Ceann Comhairle will agree to it being taken.

Is the proposal for dealing with Nos. a11, b11 and 11 to 13, inclusive, without debate agreed to?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20192	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	18	Before this House agrees to co-operate with any motion being taken without debate, we need some clarity on important issues that have arisen and have been raised here day after day on the Order of Business.  What is happening regarding the €110 million assigned for the support of elderly people in nursing homes and the €50 million assigned for the support of people with a disability?  Last night, we heard the Taoiseach say he was aiming to protect the most vulnerable in our community, yet despite Deputies on all sides asking what is happening regarding patients in nursing homes who are facing chronic bills and whose families are stretched beyond the limit in trying to cope, there has been a deafening silence from the Government.Equally, there are serious concerns in regard to disability services, with one of the main service providers announcing last week that it must close its doors to young people born with Down's syndrome and other disabilities and that it will be unable to offer their parents any service forthwith.  Some €50 million was committed to the development of day care centres, respite centres and residential care centres — which, in many cases, are offering care to people whose principal carers have died — but we are now told that the Health Service Executive has issued an instruction to these agencies that they cannot accept any more clients, not even an emergency client, without the written sanction of the national director of care.  We voted through this money for the purpose of assisting the most vulnerable in the community and we are entitled to know what is happening to it.  Is it being raided to finance other activities for which it was not assigned?  Will it be assigned for the purpose we intended and which the Taoiseach seems to support, namely, helping vulnerable people?This is the second time in less than a fortnight that a planning regulation which proposes substantive change in legislation has been put before us with no opportunity for Second Stage debate.  It is little wonder that people think the Dáil is out of touch when we have the Government putting forward proposals on important principles and expecting them to go through without debate.  The Government cannot expect the co-operation of the House if, day after day, Deputies are obliged to ask what is happening in regard to clear commitments on the allocation of moneys and where decisions that ought to have been implemented are not happening.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I have questions on two matters on today's Order of Business.  The first, No. 13, is a proposal by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to provide exemptions from planning regulations for significant extensions to schools and in the case of, for example, wind turbines of 8 m in width and 20 m in height.  These are not small turbines in people's back gardens but large turbines of some 60 ft. in height.  The proposals also encompass combined heat and power systems, 300 sq. m in size and 8 m in height, and with flues of 20 m in height.  Under this proposal, therefore, biomass, heat recovery or composting developments of some 1,000 sq. m, which is the size of a small housing estate, will be entirely exempt from planning regulationsThis proposal has serious implications for local residents.  Wind energy and biomass developments half of the size or even the same size as an adjacent housing estate will be totally exempt from the planning process and there will be no requirement to provide an environmental impact statement.  This is not the way to provide transparency in planning matters, which I understood was a hallmark of the Green Party.  We are opposed to this provision.The second item I wish to raise is No. b11, a proposal by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, for a referral to the Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of further exemptions from planning regulations.  The Labour Party spokesman on the environment, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, has spent the past several days trying to find out what is encompassed in these additional exemptions, but nobody can tell him.  We will not accept this proposal.Will the Tánaiste ask the Minister to come to the House for a debate on provisions that will affect the residents of every housing estate in the State?  Anybody could wake up in the morning to discover a biomass development the same size as their housing estate right alongside it.  These developments will be governed by the same planning regulations as pertain to kitchen extensions, conservatories or porches.  We all welcome the exemptions that exist in those cases but we do not welcome this proposal.  Nor will the constituents of Members on the Government benches when they find such developments taking place beside their own housing estates.

Three of the matters to be decided upon without debate are back from committee.  These are No. 11, motion re section 12 of the Employment Equality Act 1998; No. 12, motion re the Risk Equalisation (Amendment) Scheme 2008; and No. 13, motion re the Planning and Development Regulations 2008, as referred to by Deputy Burton.The critical point is that a request is being put to us to endorse these proposals without debate and with only the simple notation "back from committee".  There is no briefing note or even a short memo to tell us how these matters were addressed in committee.  While committee meetings are open to all members, it is not physically possible to attend them all.  I am sure this is a difficulty not confined to parties of small numbers such as Sinn Féin.  Few Members will have any idea of the detail of how these matters were addressed in committee, whether they were discussed or merely noted on the nod.  We do not know whether opposition was expressed to the proposals and whether divisions were called.  This is bad practice.Matters coming back from committee and before the House for approval without debate should include an appended notation from the relevant secretariat indicating exactly what happened at committee.  It is too late for this raft of proposals but I hope the Tánaiste, Chief Whip and others will accept the common sense of my suggestion and that it is in all our interests to do our business properly.  I strongly urge that the practice I have proposed becomes the norm into the future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I will respond first to the points made about today's Order of Business.  I was of the opinion that the party leaders at least would be familiar with or have been given a background note on these proposals.  I am asked the same question every Thursday on these types of motions.  I propose that in future, in respect of all motions coming back from committee, a short briefing be made available to all the Whips and to those who wish to be familiarised with the proposals.  Such an approach would provide clarity.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	22	That would be helpful.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Committee meetings sometimes finish late but we will ask that each clerk make a note available to all the relevant parties.  That will address the issue.Deputy Burton asked specifically about the motion being referred to committee, No. b11.  This refers to the fact that there is duplication of consent procedures.  Where, for example, permissions are given under ecological perspectives, comprehensive assessments have been made and it has been concluded that there is a duplication issue.  This will be discussed in committee and, if needs be, following on from committee——
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	24	With respect, and the Tánaiste is being very helpful——

I will ask the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government or somebody in his Department to brief the Deputy on this prior to the committee meeting, which I assume will be next week.  If Members are not satisfied with the outcome of the discussions in committee, this can be brought to the Whips' attention and we can deal with it in the full forum of this Chamber.Deputy Bruton raised a matter which is not necessarily relevant to the Order of Business, but I will address it so that we can progress the business of the House.  The issue of nursing homes subvention funding has been raised on numerous occasions.  Unfortunately, the fair deal legislation has been subject to unavoidable and unforeseen delays.  We expect the legislation in July.  That being said, an allocation has been made available through the fair deal.  The Minister for Health and Children has carefully considered the question of allowing some of the funding allocated for the fair deal to be used for nursing homes subvention.  Officials from her Department are in discussions with the Minister for Finance and we would hope to have a decision fairly quickly.  We are addressing the issues of concern that we all have in regard to the fair deal.

Are we now seeing a U-turn by the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources on the separation of transmission within the electricity system, which again is legislation designed to improve the competitiveness of structures for people competing abroad?  Is there an action plan to fast-track those legislative elements that would help to make up a competitiveness action plan?  What is the Tánaiste's strategy to fast-track them?

I think the Deputy is referring to the announcements on the National Treatment Purchase Fund and the fact that a number of hospitals are not participating in it, which is disappointing.I do not propose to introduce any new legislation on competitiveness re prices, as it is not a competitiveness issue.  Nothing has occurred that has been anti-competitive, however, there are grave concerns about the non-transfer of the benefits from sterling to euro.

We discussed it briefly at the Whips' meeting last night.  On 28 May, Deputy Gilmore raised the matter and the Tánaiste indicated the last two reports were expected in mid-June.  Can she confirm if they have been received?  If so, when will they be published?  I understand they are required to be published within 14 days.  If they are available, rather than letting the matter go stale, it would be desirable that they be discussed here immediately after their publication.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	12986	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	195	I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Snodaigh.  I echo the sentiments of our spokesperson, Deputy Rabbitte, on this Bill.  The legislation, as it is put to us, and the subsequent statements by the Minister, would leave one wondering what is the purpose and content of this legislation.  There are few meaningful sections in the Bill.  The culture and sale of alcohol in this country would probably be better dealt with in the sale of alcohol Bill.  However there are some good provisions in the Bill that are worthy of support.In this country we cannot talk about alcohol without its having some very deep cultural meaning.  Our relationship with alcohol has been ambiguous and we have spoken about it since Adam was a boy.  In my research I came across a study in the Journal of Statistical and Social Inquiry Society of Ireland entitled Issues for Irish Alcohol Policy: A Historical Perspective with some Lessons for the Future, published in 1991.  The author of that report, Mr. Daniel McCoy, cited a quotation: “No one can be competent to discuss the drink question unless he has thought over it sufficiently to realise how complicated the subject necessarily is.”  On page 21 of that study the author refers to historical views of the relationship we have with alcohol in this country:Irish drinking was seen as convivial rather than ritual and was used as a bonding with people of the same or other groups.  Irish people ... have a "social acceptance" of drunkenness something that is completely opposite to the Islamic view.While I do not advocate that we all turn to Islam, neither do I advocate some of the points raised in this piece of legislation that seeks to modify behaviour.  For example, I do not believe the provision on sale of wine in supermarkets is good.  I am glad the Minister has seen fit to reverse that trend.  The vast majority of people drink responsibly and like to imbibe and share a bottle of wine in their homes.  The notion that somebody would have to go to a supermarket that has an off-licence and ask for a bottle to be handed out by a member of staff so that he or she could handle it before purchase is ludicrous.  I am glad the Minister has reversed that provision.I want to speak briefly on theatre licences.  There should not be uniform closing times for nightclubs.  Having hundreds of people spilling out onto the streets at one given time is not an effective method of regularising alcohol consumption, if that is the modus operandi of the Bill.  By modifying or regulating closing times in a very uniform way one will not modify behaviour.  The core of the legislation should be to seek to change the culture.  By staggering closing times, particularly for nightclubs with theatre licences, there would be more of a drip-feed onto the streets and it would be easier to control.  The legislation proposes to have CCTV cameras installed and that would be a good way to monitor the behaviour of clientele exiting onto streets at night time.  However restricting licences, particularly theatre licences, will not be a good way of modifying alcohol consumption.  The two do not correlate.I have attended the Gaiety Theatre, which has a late licence, on a number of occasions.  According to its website, this weekend four different events will take place simultaneously in the theatre's four bars.  There will be a live band playing indie and retro music, on another stage there will be northern soul and there will also be some hip hop.  In a city the size of Dublin one is catering for a wide range of musical tastes and a clientele that likes to go out clubbing.  These people do not necessarily see themselves as deviant in any way when they have taken alcohol and will go home after enjoying a responsible night out.  Curbing that person's behaviour through legislation will not necessarily create a panacea for how alcohol is consumed in this country.  The vast majority of people behave responsibly, like to go out and have a varied night, such as the night provided by a facility such as the Gaiety Theatre.  Restricting those types of licences will not necessarily change the culture.  Although the alcohol advisory group made recommendations with regard to closing times, not all of its recommendations are necessarily contained in the Bill, from what I have read.  I repeat Deputy Pat Rabbitte's point that the sale of alcohol Bill must deal with the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption in this country by modifying closing times and the right to be able to purchase alcohol in a supermarket or off-licence.  Making provisions whereby a certain aspect of a supermarket has to be closed off and all alcohol moved behind a counter was totally ludicrous.  I welcome the changes announced in the Minister's speech and the overtones in that regard.With regard to early morning houses, while I understand the Bill must go through Committee Stage, as it is constituted at present it almost criminalises those who have early morning licences and seeks to convey an impression that anyone with such a licence is the purveyor of all sorts of iniquity.  Many people, some of them constituents of mine, have worked either as dockers or have worked night shifts all their lives.  Due to their pattern of sleeping following a night shift, they will enjoy a pint in the morning in the early house and will then proceed home in a proper and orderly fashion.  Of course, there have been instances where early houses have probably had some degree of anti-social behaviour but this is not outside the norm of any other establishment holding a normal licence.The advisory group did not undertake any quantitative or qualitative studies.  I do not know of one licensee in the early morning trade to whom I spoke who had a visit from any departmental official during the framing of this legislation.  I believe this measure was included as an afterthought and I am glad the Minister has made some concessions in this regard.In conclusion, I am glad the Minister has seen sense.  If we are talking about the cultural aspects of alcohol consumption, the link between the cultural aspects and education have to be expounded more vociferously by the Government.  The only way we will change the culture is by a process of education.  I do not believe some of the provisions in the Bill would necessarily change that culture and, in fact, they would drive alcohol more into an underground mode.  While I welcome the Bill in some respects, I am glad the changes the Minister has proposed will now be made.

According to the figures released by the Central Statistics Office in March, over the past five years public order incidents have increased by almost 60% and in parallel with this the Health Research Board has pointed to a 21% rise in the number of new alcohol treatment cases.  Alcohol abuse is a major contributing factor to anti-social behaviour, assaults, incidents of criminal damage, domestic violence and is often involved in murder.The intended focus of the Bill was to be on public order but the consequences of alcohol misuse are many and are not fully addressed by it.  Hopefully, we will see other Bills which address the other aspects of alcohol misuse in Ireland today.  The other consequences of this misuse include the cost to individual health and to the health care system as a whole, as well as the costs of crime and to the economy in general in terms of absence from work.While this Bill is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there is an urgent need to adopt a public health approach to reducing the harm caused by alcohol.  The total number of alcohol-related hospital discharges in this State rose by 92% between 1995 and 2004.  Many of these admissions included episodes of alcohol poisoning, liver cirrhosis, suicide or chronic disease, and bore a direct link to the increased levels of alcohol consumption.  The majority of cases involved people under the age of 40.While welcoming the Bill in general terms on behalf of Sinn Féin, I would like to put on record our disappointment at the unjustifiable failure of the Government to act on most of the 100 recommendations made by the Strategic Task Force on Alcohol which reported in 2004.  This is the  modus operandi of a Government which has long-fingered action by commissioning report after report and then failing to implement or enforce the expert recommendations in those reports.  In the meantime, the availability of alcohol has continued to increase at a pace never seen before.Last year, the total number of off-licences issued in the 26 counties was 4,261, some 320 more than the previous year.  That is almost one additional premises selling alcohol per day.  This sharp increase in the number of licensed premises in the State makes policing the sale of alcohol near impossible.I reiterate the comments made by two consultant psychiatrists to the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs recently.  They argued that without a mechanism to ensure enforcement, the Bill will have little impact.  Outside of publishing this small piece of positive legislation, what does the Government intend to do to ensure the existing legislation and provisions contained within it are enforced?For example, I was assured by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in reply to a parliamentary question earlier this year that the facility known as dial-a-can, which allows young people in particular to obtain alcohol by ordering on-line or over the telephone without having to enter a licensed premises, is already prohibited.  If this is the case, why are so many businesses freely advertising this facility to dial-a-drink, with payment on delivery?  Why are these businesses not being prosecuted?  I remain unconvinced that the issue is adequately addressed in existing legislation.  It is impossible for the Garda to police the sale of alcohol where the sale occurs at a multiplicity of private residences.  Garda action alone will not stop this practice and section 17(3) of the 2003 Act should be tightened up and extended to expressly stipulate that it is also an offence for persons other than the licensee to engage in such activity.I will now turn to some of the sections of the Bill before us.  Section 4 reduces the hours of off-licence sales and this is to be welcomed.  Section 6 extends the grounds on which the District Court may refuse to grant new off-licences.  This will include the grounds pertaining to the existing number of off-licences and other shops selling alcohol in the area and will also allow local residents to object.  Again, this is welcome, but we could have done it a few years ago and thereby addressed the huge rise in the number of off-licences — almost one a day last year, as I said earlier.  The Government's delays have allowed for a grossly excessive number of off-licences to come into being to the detriment and often against the wishes of local communities.With regard to late night opening, section 9 aims to make the special exemption orders which permit extended opening hours contingent on CCTV in the venue and on compliance with fire safety standards and so on.In addition, the powers of the gardaí to object to special exemption orders on public order grounds are to be strengthened, which is positive progress.  However, we may still have a situation where a significant number of venues in one area close at the same time, which means the public order flash points outside venues, at taxi ranks and fast food outlets will continue to be problematic.  What Sinn Féin proposed in its submission to the alcohol advisory group would be more effective in addressing alcohol related public disorder in entertainment zones and town centres.  International evidence suggests that staggered closing times, combined with additional measures to mitigate against crawl drinking helps to prevent dangerous late night fracas.  This Bill will not address the problem of drinkers spilling out onto the streets at the same time unless we amend it on Committee Stage.Sinn Féin is in favour of the liberalisation of our licensing laws in line with European models, involving flexible opening and closing times to prevent drink-related disorder.  We also promote the involvement of local authorities and local communities in the liquor licensing control process.  To this end, local licensing fora should be introduced and should include elected representatives, statutory authorities, licensed trade representatives, community representatives and other stakeholders, such as those involved in addiction services.  These licensing fora could operate as part of the existing or forthcoming council structures such as the joint policing committees and play a key role in the process of dealing with or deciding on the number and type of outlets where alcohol can be sold, the number of licences granted and the hours and days of sale.  In addition, the local licensing fora could also consider complementary issues in the interests of community safety and quality of life, such as the number of taxi ranks, necessary street lighting and the hours of sale of fast food outlets in their area.I welcome this Bill and hope we will be able to add to it on Committee Stage to improve it and enable it to address some of the issues that I and other Members have raised.  I also hope that other legislation and provisions required to address alcohol related incidents in our hospitals will be forthcoming.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	197	I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak on this Bill and its proposals, which I see as very important in our changing society.  We have heard many comments on the measures proposed in this Bill, most of which are welcoming.  I am encouraged by the broad recognition that legislation is required to restrict the availability of alcohol and that restricting alcohol is not only desirable for the future, but absolutely vital for the progression of Irish society.Simply put, far too many people in Ireland have far too great a dependence on alcohol and this is leading to misuse.  Those lucky enough to have avoided dependency on alcohol are still amenable to binging or heavy drinking sessions.  Ireland has the highest rate of alcohol consumption in the EU, with average consumption at 21 units per week in people over the age of 15, and this is not taking into account the 20% of adults who do not drink at all.  Irish drinkers regularly consume five or more drinks in one sitting.These statistics make it easy to see where our young are getting their habits.  Our young people are starting to drink, and drink heavily, at far too young an age.  The negative consequences of this, combined with the misuse of drugs, can be seen on our streets daily.  Groups of youngsters, who are clearly drunk, litter our open spaces and engage in what is primarily harmless but still intimidating behaviour.  Sadly, more often these days, this behaviour tips over into criminal anti-social behaviour and not just alcohol-related harm.It is worth noting that half of 15 to 17 year olds admit to being regular drinkers, with one third admitting to being "really drunk" in the last 30 days.  This is a stark figure when one thinks of the recently completed State examination and the upcoming results.  Occasions such as these generally result in heavy all-day drinking sessions, starting at midday and ending in the early hours of the morning.However, as the CSO suggests, young people are not the only ones taking advantage of the easy availability of alcohol.  The National Youth Council has been lobbying on this Bill and has advertised the shocking and surprising statistic that adults are five times more likely to be convicted of drink related crimes than under age drinkers.  Accident and emergency departments are filling up with people incapacitated by alcohol and this has been attributed to weekend overcrowding in hospitals.  Over a quarter of all injuries treated in accident and emergency departments are alcohol related.  Approximately 36% of fatal car accidents are caused by excessive alcohol consumption.  Our hospital wards are full of people suffering from illnesses to which our modern alcohol-loving lifestyles have contributed.  Obesity, diabetes, heart attacks and blood disease are all on the increase because of the lifestyle we as Irish people are adopting, which includes a great deal of alcohol.The Garda Síochána is dedicating an unprecedented amount of hours to dealing with public order offences and drink related crimes.  It is estimated that half of our homicide cases are alcohol-related.  Indeed, between 1999 and 2005 the rate of alcohol-related offences doubled, while among juveniles, the incidence trebled.Our love-affair with alcohol is reaching epidemic proportions.  I am not in any way suggesting our society is falling apart.  Nor do I believe alcohol is an evil responsible for everything that is wrong in Ireland.  However, the consumption of alcohol and its excessive availability is damaging our society beyond what is healthy and this Bill will help prevent further injury.The Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008 adopts proposals from the alcohol advisory group and seeks to tackle the availability and excessive consumption of alcohol.  The concerns of the Government were shared by a variety of stakeholders, from the National Youth Council to the Irish Medical Organisation and even the Drinks Industry Group of Ireland.  The former Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Brian Lenihan, and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, must be commended for spearheading the research of the advisory group and ensuring the quick delivery of this Bill.  Credit must also be given to Dr. Gordon Holmes for leading the advisory group.This Bill should be viewed as a step in the right direction.  It represents a step towards redressing the imbalance in our lives caused by alcohol.  The Bill tackles one of the largest roots of the problem, namely alcohol accessibility.  Sadly, education alone is not sufficient to stem the growing problem of alcohol related harm.  Hopefully this Bill and the upcoming sale of alcohol Bill will address this epidemic.The biggest difference will be made by the restrictions which will be placed on off-licence sales.  I represent one of the youngest constituencies in Ireland, Dublin North, where it is common for me to receive complaints of under age drinkers setting up for the night in local parks, green spaces and beaches.  They come equipped with cans of beer and naggins of spirits and become rowdier as the night goes on.  I also receive complaints about adults congregating in apartments whose behaviour becomes noisier and more reckless as they drink.  These are the scenarios which often end in violence and disorder.  These two groups have not started the night in the pub.  Their alcohol was bought in the supermarket or the local off-licence.  By restricting off-licence trading by three hours in the morning and two and half hours at night, the Bill will put to bed the after-pub visit which often ends in violence.  I appeal to the Minister to ban home deliveries by off-licensed premises.  I have had quite a number of complaints about so-called dial-a-can.  This issue must be tackled.I would like to see provision in the Bill for staggered closing hours of local pubs.  As a Deputy representing Dublin North, I am concerned about the number of late night pubs and clubs operating in the places like Swords.  Staggering closing times would cut out seemingly harmless occurrences like street congestion and taxi queuing.  Circumstances where 400 or 500 people pour out on to the streets, all wanting to avail of the same taxis and takeaways at the same time, often lead to violence and need to be avoided at all costs.I also welcome the measures requiring supermarkets and convenience stores to force customers doing their shopping to go to a separate cash register in a separate area of the supermarket to buy their alcohol.  I imagine that the expectation here is that people will put far more thought into their alcohol shopping rather than simply stuff bottles of wine into their shopping trolleys.  The segregation of alcohol from other groceries will also be effective in the identification of under age drinkers.  As alcohol will only be permitted for sale in these separated areas, there is no possibility of young people "smuggling" beer through with their basket of groceries.  I am glad that the Minister has met with the supermarket groups and other small trading groups.  I believe a code of practice, which is being proposed by these groups, will be a welcome alternative.  This illustrates the shopkeepers' willingness to work with the Government to tackle under age drinking and I welcome it.I also welcome the provision for test buying.  For too long, under age drinkers have succeeded in persuading off-licences to sell them alcohol.  Worse still, many off-licences simply turn a blind eye to older teenagers.  The provision in the Intoxicating Liquor Bill for test purchasing will ensure vigilance among off-licences and provide younger staff who, obviously, face peer pressure with a valid excuse not to sell to their under age friends.  It will also put power into the hands of members of the public to refuse to buy alcohol for young drinkers.In the same vein, I welcome the enacting of Garda powers which will allow officers to remove alcohol from young drinkers or from anyone they believe likely to engage in an act of public disorder.  There has been too much ambiguity in this area until now and it is essential that we incorporate that move.  The fact that the offence can be punished immediately by a fine will be a relief to gardaí and serve as a real benefit to the courts system in reducing the number of court cases.I am also relieved that the loophole allowing clubs and pubs to operate under theatre licences will be closed.  It is shocking that over 100 similar licences were applied for in the first three months of this year.  These licences perpetuate the heavy drinking culture in our cities, allowing revellers to go from pub to club to late night club before arriving home in the early hours of the next day.  Similarly, I welcome the requirement on bars and clubs to install CCTV cameras where alcohol is being consumed, thereby ensuring that proceedings are constantly recorded.I echo the call for a national ID card, on which I have made statements previously.  A national card would go a long way towards eliminating under age drinking if it was the only means of ID requested of someone suspected of being under age.  My colleagues on the Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights might consider fining parents for criminal damage caused by their children.I have already mentioned the fear caused by young people hanging around at night and these fears are not always unfounded.  Much vandalism and criminal damage is undertaken and it is time someone other than the local authority or the victims themselves paid for it.  Anti-social behaviour is the most significant issue I have encountered in my constituency.  With the summer months approaching, speedy passage of this Bill is essential.  The greatest fear of most residents is seeing young people bringing their cans on to the local open space, into parks or, in my case, on to the beach during the long evenings, drinking and becoming rowdy.  Unfortunately, this often results in damage and attacks on people.I mentioned the issue of parental control.  Parents have an important role to play.  Quite often, we see young children out on the streets at 11 p.m., 12 a.m. or perhaps later.  Obviously, their parents do not know where they are and it would seem that they do not care either.  As a society, we must try to address this issue and make parents responsible for their children, ensure they know where they are and endeavour to keep them under control.  Fining parents for criminal damage caused by their children's actions is one way of getting parents to seek to find out where their children are.Regulations regarding advertising and alcohol promotions, such as two for one promotions, are essential.  I appeal to everybody in the House to allow the speedy passage of this Bill to ensure it is law before the summer.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	200	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Intoxicating Liquor Bill 2008.  Given that nobody in this country has not been affected in some way by the excessive consumption of alcohol, whether it is in their own homes where they have watched the downward spiral of an alcoholic family member or through the death of a loved one on the roads through an alcohol-related car accident, I am delighted to have a chance to address this issue here in the House.The Government has been accused of tiptoeing around the problem of excessive alcohol consumption and as a consultant psychiatrist said recently, landing "light jabs" is useless.  What is needed is a knock-out punch.  The medical profession has long claimed that the Government is looking at Ireland's drink problem through the bottom of a glass.According to a new report entitled Alcohol-Related Harm in Ireland by Dr. Ann Hope, alcohol abuse results in more than one quarter of all accident and emergency cases being alcohol-related.  This is a very serious problem.  Half of all violent killings and a quarter of severe domestic abuse cases are alcohol-related and alcohol consumption is impacting on road fatalities, cancer levels, unplanned pregnancies and public order.  Of particular worry to me is the rise in alcohol misuse among young adults and teenagers, with damage caused by such misuse being potentially long term and irreversible.The Government must increase the tax on alcopops and super-strength drinks to curb the binge drinking culture among young people.  The money raised from such taxes could be used to slash duty on lower strength drinks and provide other non-alcohol-related leisure facilities for our young people in youth cafes.  I see little point in forcing the expense of partitioning a shop to create an area in which to sell alcohol on convenience stores as this would put them under extra financial pressure in respect of matters like staffing and security cameras.  What effect the small concessions the Minister gave on this matter on Tuesday will have remains to be seen.  I thank the Fine Gael spokesperson, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for putting pressure on the Minister in respect of this matter.  The Deputy received this among other concessions.The tax increases would focus on alcopops such as vodka-based WKD and powerful lagers such as Tennent's Super Strong Lager.  This would force potential problem drinkers to buy less or to switch to weaker products.  Talking to gardaí, taxi drivers and others whose lives are made miserable by the behaviour of binge drinkers has convinced me that we need action against super-strength drinks and alcopops.In light of the Hope report, it is essential the price of problem drinks is increased and the price of those with lower alcohol levels decreased.  This has worked very well in other countries, particularly the US, and I have no doubt it would work well in Ireland.As I mentioned on the Order of Business on Tuesday, I am surprised the sale of alcohol Bill has not yet seen the light of day.  Surely if the Government was serious about tackling this problem, it could have set aside its historical aversion to joined-up thinking and produced this Bill to coincide, to some degree, with what we are discussing to maximise the effect.  The Fine Gael spokesperson on this issue, Deputy Charles Flanagan, is pushing very hard for it but, by the time the sale of alcohol Bill is published and makes its way into this House, the impetus will be gone and this Bill could be regarded as merely an interim measure with limited long-term effect.Currently Ireland has the highest level of binge drinking in Europe.  More than one third of the population regularly indulges to this level and the problem is greatest among the 15-24 year age group, although it is not confined to them.  In 2002 a ban on alcohol advertising was recommended by the strategic task force.  Two years later the same group demanded that legislation be introduced without delay to reduce the exposure of children to alcohol advertising.  A couple of months ago, six years on from the first call for a ban, the Government called for a voluntary code.  This is a long way from the statutory code promised by the Government in 2003.This Bill was set to remove the right to early morning selling of alcohol, which has been a feature of this country for over 80 years, being first sanctioned in 1927.  The original Act to make this provision stated that early morning trade was needed to cater for those attending early markets and fairs or for those whose trade or calling left them in need of refreshment at unsociable hours.  I remember my grandfather going into fairs at 5 a.m. or 6 a.m.  The men always had breakfast at the local hotel or pub at 7.30 a.m.  Having been out the night before, they would have to drive cattle to the fair on the hoof.We have come a long way since those times.  Today it is hard to say whether this provision is likely to have any real impact on the problem of excessive alcohol consumption and its associated problems.  Currently, as was the case 80 years ago, early morning drinking is very much the preserve of those such as dockers, whose jobs involve anti-social hours and who have developed a lifestyle which is a social outlet and involves pubs operating so quietly that it is difficult to know if they are even open.  This is the case in this city and others, as well as in the west of Ireland.  The clients are regulars and have an air of ownership and belonging that leaves the casual visitor standing out as a stranger.  It would not have been beneficial to deprive these people of a simple, long-established social ritual, which goes well beyond the pint in hand.In my considered opinion, this was carrying the nanny state too far.  Hard-working people enjoying a drink after a night's work, while most of us are waking from a good night's sleep, hardly constitutes a threat to national safety or the health of the nation.  I had strongly opposed this element of the Bill and am pleased the Government has given in to pressure from Fine Gael and other Opposition parties, particularly Deputy Flanagan, rather than persist with such an unpopular measure.

Who is the Government fooling by making such a statement after a U-turn?  It is only fooling itself.However, one of the most important sections of the Bill gives the Garda Síochána powers to limit the impact of drunkenness, covering such areas as safety and the maintenance of public peace, allowing gardaí the right to seize alcohol where necessary, which applies to drunken disorder by groups of late night revellers rather than tired, quiet citizens enjoying the right to a drink out of normal hours.No right-minded person in this country claims that Ireland does not have a problem with drink.  It costs the State a fortune in policing and puts extra pressure on our health services throughout the country.  Extra security has to be taken on in accident and emergency units at weekends when binge drinking occurs.  People must be more responsible.  When a person comes to the age of 16 years he or she has a duty, as a citizen of the State, to become more responsible.

We should encourage them to do so, as should sporting organisations and schools because everybody has a part to play.

It is very important to discuss this matter because it is a problem in the public arena which we have not discussed sufficiently.

He has great connections in my constituency and I was delighted to see him elevated.  I wish him well.

#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	211	People in my constituency, especially parents, are very worried about the excess amount of alcohol being drunk by young people.  There is a culture of late nights and long sessions, starting at the beginning of the weekend.  At a clinic recently I met a young man who had run into some difficulties because of excess alcohol consumption.  He told me about his difficulties and said the reason was that he had spent the entire weekend drinking.  He and his friends had got involved in something for which they were really sorry.  Half way through the conversation he asked me: "What else have we to do?"  I felt really sorry for that young man, as I do for all young people who ask themselves what else they have to occupy them.  As a society, that is something we must address.Deputy Bannon referred to sporting organisations.  There are a huge number of competitive sports and we all hope for our own counties to succeed.  However, many people could participate in sports.  As a country we have neglected sport and allowed alcohol to take over.  There must be another way that young people can channel their time.  Perhaps I am departing from the Bill but we must examine this as a country, particularly when people have more free time and longer weekends.  The culture has changed and we must deal with it.  Whether the changes were brought about by Deputy Flanagan, he related the views of many small business people and small supermarket owners.  When this Bill was published, they were up in arms and I have never had as many letters from people in my constituency who were concerned about legislation.  The changes are very welcome and sensible.The Minister's approach of talking to the users is a good one and when something sound is done, we should commend it.  I commend the Minister on dealing with the problems of small supermarket owners, who thought they would have to chain off their wine areas.  It should not be made any more difficult for the person who goes to mass on Sunday and buys wine in the local supermarket.  In effect, this measure was in the legislation but was removed, which I welcome.Other issues should have been addressed in this Bill, such as the fake identification cards that young people are using right around the country.  We must address this matter.  I have heard of several instances of young people with forged identification cards.  If we are serious about tackling under age drinking, we must address this, but there is no mention of it in the Bill.  While we are discussing under age drinking and the problems related to it, we should tackle the causes of it.  Top of the list should be measures to deal with fake identification cards.  We can see it in cities, towns and villages.  The Bill makes no reference to this and I wonder if we are serious about tackling the culture of drinking.We need more presence and a different direction from the Garda Síochána.  We must take them out of the barracks and put them onto the streets where people are located.  In any town or village where people are socialising at the weekend, gardaí should be on the street.  If young people who have a few extra drinks see a garda walking up and down the street, they will behave in a different way.  We need a greater Garda presence around the country.  Someone has taken the policy decision that gardaí should be in groups of two or three in a squad car or on country roads, but they should be on the streets in order to be effective.  Unless that decision is made, we are not serious about tackling the problem.If we are to tackle our drinking culture, we must educate our young people about the harmful effects on people's health.  We have only skirted around the problem.  There is much to be learned from organisations such as Alcoholics Anonymous that could be brought into schools.  The area of drugs is within the remit of the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran.  We have failed to drum into people the harmful effects of alcohol.  Young people will listen if they are told in a responsible and proper way.  An example is the way young people deal with drink driving.  They just do not do it because they have been properly educated.  They get taxis and make arrangements.  The same thing should be done with the harmful effects of drink on our young population.I have heard the issue of alcopops raised several times.  When Deputies John Deasy and Olwyn Enright were first elected to this House, they said the issue of alcopops should be addressed.  We must discuss it, but it is not included in the Bill.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I wish to be associated with the good wishes to Deputy John Curran on his elevation to Minister of State.  I am sure he will prove to be an effective Minister of State.I welcome this Bill, which I believe to be an honest attempt to bring some order to a situation that has spiralled out of control over the past few years, particularly with regard to special exemptions, the exploitation of loopholes in relevant legislation and other reasons.  The current situation is not what we intended when we framed previous legislation and this Bill addresses many of the deficiencies that exist in the sector today.We have to remember the amount of change that has taken place in our society in the past 20 years.  We have acquired a very large number of new residents who have different traditions, traits and habits from ours.  Society has not stood still and we have inherited a large number of difficulties resulting from the greater existence of wealth than was there half a generation ago.  This legislative measure should help put things right and steer us back on track.  I have met many people in the industry and they are broadly happy with what is proposed.Most of the stakeholders in the industry are genuine in their attempt to curb youth and adult excesses, particularly binge drinking, and to bring about a genuine change in public order.  There are some minor concerns and during my contribution I will allude to the changes I suggest and the measures I would like to see introduced.  Having said that, this may not be the appropriate legislation under which some of these should be introduced.I commend Dr. Gordon Holmes and the members of the alcohol advisory group on their work, but elected Members, through our unique experience, have a valuable role to play as well.  I applaud the Minister for the changes he is proposing to the legislation and thank him for listening to me and other Members of this House.  I have had to rewrite some of this contribution as a result.I am concerned about the number of reports in other areas that have been introduced by unelected people and which are slavishly implemented.  At times we do not make enough use of the vast resources we have on all sides in this Chamber.  We have had reports produced on behalf of vested interests and if advisers are paid enough, they will provide whatever advice one wants and the conclusion one requires.  These are put forward as independent reports and recommendations and occasionally find their way into law and Members of this Chamber are somewhat sidelined by this from time to time.  This is not the case today, but we have seen instances in the past where there has been a rush to legislate on less than reliable evidence.As it was originally framed, section 8 of the Bill would have been impractical in some cases because smaller operators would have found it difficult if not impossible to comply with the separation provisions contained therein, chiefly because they would have been hampered by fire regulations which probably would have meant they would have needed a new fire certificate.  Additionally, because of the change of the physical layout which might require a new door to the street, they might have had to go through a lengthy and expensive planning process.Putting in a separate till would mean providing extra staff and imposing extra costs, thereby handing the advantage back to the larger multiples.  We should foster competition, not reduce it or put obstacles in its way.  Some of the larger operators seem to be abusing their position, as was recently instanced by the report which shows the difference in supermarket prices in this jurisdiction and those in Northern Ireland.If we are to introduce these measures, they should be for stores of a particular size.  I am not sure what the optimum size would be, but it would not take a great deal of effort to establish it.  This would not cause particular difficulty or any significant increase in staff for the larger supermarkets.  A particular threshold of store size should be introduced over which the provisions of the Bill would apply.  A year in which to implement the changes as envisaged in the Bill might be a bit tight and it may be necessary to allow more time to see all the changes comfortably implemented.As well as dealing with the economic side of the problem, this is important social legislation and we should take the time to get it right.  The Minister responded positively and sensibly here and has given the retail sector the opportunity to bring in a voluntary code to properly regulate this area.I agree that these regulations should not apply to wine as those who purchase this particular beverage are of the more mature segment of the population, whether that be in age or attitude or both, and would need to be able to access the bottles to browse the labels and descriptions.  Once more the Minister has taken a sensible approach and recognised this.I have no difficulty with the requirement to keep spirits and high-alcohol drinks behind the counter.  However, in the case of wines and beers, a shuttering device should be allowed to fulfil the intent of the legislation and to close the area completely outside of the normal trading hours for alcohol.  This would give the small local store a chance to compete with the bigger operators and keep them in business for the benefit of the local population.  After all, these are the people who continue to provide a service late into the night when the supermarkets are long since closed.  In any event, wine is not a source of public order problems, as anyone close to the situation on difficult nights will testify.A variety of groups came to see me when this measure was announced.  I expected them to seek a change to the earlier closing time of 10 p.m.  This was not the case however.  There was universal agreement on it as the same circumstances will apply to everybody, endorsing their desire only to be able to compete on equal legal terms with the bigger players.Let me turn to the case of the approximately 80 licensed premises which open at 7.30 a.m.  This has its roots in tradition and they cater for a very specific clientele.  They facilitate factory workers coming from night shifts, taxi drivers, nurses, security personnel and all-night workers in the markets, as well as a myriad of others in a variety of trades and professions.  There will always be a legitimate need for what I might loosely describe as out of hours services.  Recently, I saw where one particular business runs early morning dances for the same segment of the population, which are highly successful and give those people the same benefits and opportunities which the mainstream working population enjoys.There are generally no public order difficulties in these licensed premises and they should be allowed to continue to trade at their unusual hours.  An argument was put forward by the alcohol advisory group about late-night revellers eventually arriving at these places, but in practice they are not tolerated in these houses as it is seen to be bad for business.  They accept that their regulars who come from work will not continue to go to these pubs if late-night revellers come in full of drink on a regular basis.  To a great extent, they are self-regulating and they should be allowed to trade as heretofore and not made subject to the 10.30 a.m. opening time as universally proposed.  These traders depend on their early morning business and are conscious of the need to mind it.I am aware their licences also allow them to pursue an off-licence trade.  I do not think this is desirable and there may also be a problem under competition law.  In the interests of equality this should not be allowed, with early morning houses having to wait for off-licence sales until 10.30 a.m. the same as the rest of the industry.  This is not likely to grow as a problem as the number of such businesses is small.  However, we can make sure of it by applying a cap, confining the number to that which obtains at present.  If any public order problems were to arise, the Garda should be able to deal with these at the time of the renewal of their liquor licence at the annual licensing court.  There is adequate scope for this.  This part of my speech was written prior to hearing the Minister's speech and we are on the same wavelength.I referred earlier to the selling of wine.  There is a proposal with regard to wine that retailers should now go for the renewal of their licence to the District Court and not to the Revenue Commissioners as is the case at present.  I do not have a problem with this, but I wonder whether it is practical.  Approximately 4,000 of these licences exist and they may clog up an already overstretched service.  I do not feel there would be any difference between the courts or Revenue administering these licences, because there are no significant anti-social behaviour implications around the selling of wine.I welcome the limitation on special exemption orders.  They are far too easy to obtain and should only be allowed for bona fide reasons.  It is proposed to strengthen Garda powers with regard to the public order offences aspect of these licences and their objections should be strongly noted.  We should aim for a situation where these are hard-earned and only available to those who run a properly controlled and disciplined house.  These licences only foster late-night drinking and tend to facilitate teen drinking because they are often at a time of local celebration.  They have a history of trouble and I wonder how many traffic accidents with tragic results have been caused as a result of these late exemptions.  They have little to offer the community and I have no doubt that there are spouses and children who dread the annual festival with the particular problems drinking can bring.I note the proliferation of theatre licences granted recently, sometimes under very spurious circumstances in trying to get around the liquor laws as they now stand.  It is no harm to put a curb on these licences, because I foresee a situation where even the most unlikely theatres, with threadbare productions, will be entitled to licences late into the night.One of the important measures in this Bill is section 13 which extends Garda powers with regard to the confiscation of containers of alcohol in the possession of people and intended for the use of those under 18 years of age.  I have received complaints from people throughout my constituency about people, young and old, drinking in open areas and other public places.  The law to date does not appear to be strong enough to deal with this.  Some towns and cities have by-laws, but these do not seem to have the same perceived effect as statute law and do not seem to be implemented with the same vigour.Section 18 also refers to the interference with the peaceful possession of a person's property.  This would be particularly relevant to house parties.  The legislation seems to stop short of clarifying Garda powers on this.  Often these parties cause more of a nuisance than anything else.  This seems to be a difficult area to deal with and perhaps something needs to be put into the legislation.  Perhaps the Minister will clarify this later.  I realise it will be difficult to implement the law with regard to private dwellings or with regard to the possibility of a crime being committed, but house parties, where the drink flows freely until the small hours of the morning, have a particularly bad record of late.  Many unlawful deaths and cases of violence have been associated with these parties and we need to clarify the law and the use of powers by the Garda in this area.I thoroughly agree with the concept of test-purchasing by gardaí where they send in a young person under supervision to see whether the store or public house operates the age limit properly.  I note the industry also agrees with this and has not made any complaint or protest about it.  I welcome the strengthening of the law with regard to the closure of properties because of selling of alcohol to people who are under age.  Will the entire outlet close for a period, or will it only be the area of the premises selling alcohol?  The legislation does not appear to spell it out clearly and I ask the Minister to clarify this.A number of provisions are not contained in this Bill and, on reflection, it may not be proper to include them but I would like to make reference to them.  I never agreed with the abolition of the groceries order in March 2006 and it has not reduced prices.  Can the Government ban the selling of low cost alcohol?  I would like that to be introduced and I am mystified by the attitude of officials of the Competition Authority in their submission to the alcohol advisory group, when they said calls should be resisted for the reintroduction of a ban on below-unit cost selling of alcohol or for minimum prices for alcohol.  They went on to state such measures make the sale of alcohol more profitable across all retailers and bars and, thus, encourage its sale and are contrary to the aim of reducing excessive alcohol consumption.  They have no problem with an increase in price through excise duty, which suggests that they agree that price increase would be a factor.  If they are opposed to the low cost order, there seems to be a contradictory position.  They are saying if the price of alcohol is increased, sales will increase and, in the other circumstances, it will not.  The Minister should consider bringing in a regulation that the sale of wine and spirits should only be allowed to those aged over 21.  It follows that between the ages of 18 and 21, only beers or drinks below a certain level of alcohol content would be allowable. I would like tougher, perhaps criminal, sanctions for those who purchase drink for under age people.  That practice is widespread and we are not being tough enough in this area.  It is not difficult for young people to ask an adult to purchase for them as often an older sibling will do so or someone who will do it for a portion of the drink bought.  It is very difficult to apprehend these people, but when we do, the law should be strict enough to discourage this practice as much as possible.  It is a despicable practice with potential disastrous consequences for under age people.Garda identification cards should be made mandatory for all of these drinking establishments.  One of the submissions received suggested anyone under the age of 25 entering a public house should have a card.  I have no difficulty with this, as other jurisdictions, whose regimes are far more liberal in other fields, implement strict guidelines in this regard.  This would be a major part of the solution to the problem and the Garda ID system should be implemented without further delay.It is some time since the then Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, declared we had a crisis of alcohol in this country.  That was an honest statement from a Minister whose Department has had to deal with the fallout of the folly of individuals who overindulge in alcohol and the society, which not alone allows such excesses, but almost encourages them through our communal behaviour.  Society in Ireland has paid a high price for our drinking, with our general hospitals, mental institutions, women's refuges and jails filled with the victims of overindulgence in alcohol.  It is time we took a realistic stance on the matter and seriously directed our attention to the advertising of alcohol in public places, the sponsorship of high-visibility mainstream events by drinks companies and the casual promotion of alcohol in television programmes.  During a recent home produced television programme, alcohol advertising signs were clearly displayed in a scene involving under age children.  This should not have been allowed to happen.  There should be an official watchdog for this purpose and we should not have to depend on some member of the public making a complaint.Stronger action must be taken.  We have allowed a situation to develop where alcohol has all but taken over a great number of lives and where excessive drinking on a weekly basis is the norm among a large percentage of our population . The expression, "drowning in a sea of drink" may be emotive but it is not an exaggeration.  Historically, we, as a nation, have had our difficulties with drink but we have not learned from them.  This measure is balanced, allowing leeway where it is logical, yet trying to eliminate dangerous situations for our citizens.  We have much more work to do, but let us, as a start, ensure these measures are implemented in order that we can remove some of the risk for our people, particularly the young and vulnerable, who are often the targets of exploitative advertising, not only for alcohol, but for a wide range of goods.  I commend the Bill to the House.
#DeirdreClune	unknown-#DeirdreClune-party	unknown-#DeirdreClune-dob	unknown-#DeirdreClune-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I am grateful for the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  Members have given their views on the state of the nation in the debate regarding alcohol consumption and that is why the debate is important.  A number of the measures in the Bill attempt to reduce the availability of alcohol and to focus on binge drinking and licensing.  Dr. Gordon Holmes and the alcohol advisory group should be commended both on their recommendations and the speed with which they reported following the Minister's request.Ireland has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption per capita in the EU.  While we all recognise that, we sometimes need the figures to underline how stark is the problem.  Our consumption is 30% higher than the average in the Union.  Binge drinking levels are high and such drinking spans age groups and is not only confined to young people.  Drinking is associated with celebration in Ireland and, as Deputy Kenneally said, it is part of our culture, as highlighted on radio and television programmes, to ask what one is doing for the weekend with the reply being, “having a few pints”.  We are all guilty of this but we should be cognisant of the major problem we face.  Media contributors should be aware their comments, however loose and conversational, can have an effect, particularly on young people.In 2006, a national study of the behaviour of school aged children found that 50% of those aged between 15 and 17 reported they take a drink and one third had been "drunk in the previous 30 days".  While that may not be surprising, what we can do about it?  A total of 40% of proceedings taken each year for public order offences involve intoxication in a public place.  I know from dealing with local gardaí what a problem this can be for them during the summer, in particular, when the evenings are long and young people congregate in open spaces or in places where they cannot be seen.  Many of them drink and gardaí are powerless to take the alcohol from them.  Hopefully, the measures in the Bill will permit gardaí who suspect young people are drinking and have alcohol in containers to seize them.  The more authority the Garda can be given in this area, the better.I agree the abolition of the groceries order has resulted in the proliferation of below-cost selling of alcohol.  Multiples in the area I live sell a number of brands of beer for less than €1 and they have special offers for weekends, barbecue nights and bank holiday weekends.  Like it or not, young people are getting their hands on these products, leading to long-term damage in many cases.  The problem lies in the fact that, while some can recover and get a bit of calm and sense when they reach 18 or 21 years of age and are allowed into nightclubs and bars, others can be particularly vulnerable and inflict long-term harm on their physical and mental health.In April, the HSE released a report entitled, Alcohol Related Harm in Ireland.  It showed that not only does alcohol have a negative effect on drinkers' health, but it plays an increasing role in the harm caused to many others in terms of violence, murder, road accidents and the effects of excessive drinking during pregnancy.  Some findings suggest that individual consumption of alcohol has increased by almost 3% and that 28% of all injury-related attendances in accident and emergency units are alcohol-related, which places significant pressure on a stretched service and causes nurses, consultants, registrars and other staff hardship.  Being at the coalface, they must deal with the problems, but there are no guidelines.  Everyone who presents is a patient and must be dealt with.  The situation is not pleasant for the staff and can frustrate their attempts to deal with genuine cases.Alcohol is a contributory factor in many fatal road accidents.  I welcome our debate on reducing the alcohol limit, in respect of which the Minister for Transport was questioned last week.  The allowable blood-alcohol level is decreasing across Europe.  Ireland must consider this issue because alcohol can affect people's judgment.  For example, intoxication is a factor in a large number of road accidents and fatal crashes.  I commend the Road Safety Authority on its television advertisements, which are stark, necessary and effective.It is estimated that alcohol is involved in 25% of severe cases of domestic abuse.  Half of men and more than one quarter of women agree that drinking alcohol can contribute to their having sex without the use of contraception.  While we are all aware of these issues, we must be reminded of them.  Dr. Joe Barry, who has been to the fore in highlighting the dangers of alcohol abuse, stated:This report shows that alcohol related harm is not only confined to the negative consequences experienced by the drinker, such as illness and disease, but extends to others as well, which too often can lead to physical injury or even death.  Inevitably, this also causes strain on health services and its staff.This echoes the concerns of staff working in accident and emergency units.  Many high-profile accident and emergency consultants have publicly outlined the pressure under which they operate when dealing with alcohol-related admissions.The Bill does not amend many matters that others and I would have liked to have seen addressed, but I look forward to the debate on the control of alcohol Bill later this year.  An important issue in respect of which other committee members and I have received submissions is that of the display of alcohol.  I welcome the Minister's dealing with this issue.  Originally, the Bill provided that such displays would need to be cordoned off from public view, but this provision caused concern.  On Tuesday, the Minister stated he would consider the introduction of a voluntary code.  While we must examine its details, I expect they will be thrashed out on Committee Stage.  I ask that the Minister be conscious of the importance of policing the code.There has been a proliferation in the number of off-licences, garages, forecourts, convenience stores and supermarkets selling wines, beers and spirits.  A primary concern cited in the 2004 report of Dr. Barry and his alcohol advisory group related to the availability of alcohol and it recommended that the number of premises in which it could be sold be reduced.  Unfortunately, there has since been a significant increase in that number.  It is important that controls are introduced.  While the Minister should not be led by the degree of hardship suffered by small stores and supermarkets that have invested in upgrades, any changes to which he agrees should ensure independent policing of what should not be a completely voluntary code.The Minister proposes that, to operate a wine licence, people should go to a District Court as opposed to the Revenue Commissioners.  Anything that increases the difficulty level would be good.  Those who apply for licences recognise that it is a serious legal matter and that their licences should be treated with respect.I cannot but support the proposed changes in terms of opening hours and the availability of alcohol, namely, 10.30 a.m. to 10 p.m. on weekdays and 12.30 p.m. to midnight on Sundays.Recently, I spoke to a local garda regarding the sale of alcohol to under-aged people.  The garda expressed the view it was not believable the relevant provisions would affect young people who drink under bushes or behind trees because they get their drink earlier in the evenings.  However, it will discourage binge drinking.Regarding on-licences, I welcome the provisions in respect of nightclub opening hours and the important obligation to possess CCTV systems.  Cork held a good debate recently following late night public disorder issues.  A committee, Cork Cares, was established wherein representatives of nightclubs, bars, the Garda, taxis and fast food outlets tried to develop an arrangement for working together so that, for example, all nightclubs would not spill their patrons onto the streets simultaneously, taxis would be available and fast food outlets would have a direct line to the Garda in the event of disorder in their queues.  When people gather together and communicate, they can be effective.  Recently, an 18th birthday party in a hotel got out of hand and the hotel evacuated 300 young people onto its grounds.  The Garda was called immediately and, accompanied by a fleet of taxis, removed the young people in groups of four.  As a result of such communication and co-ordination, a situation that could have become messy, to say the least, was dealt with.I am glad the Minister reviewed the proposal regarding the early morning licensed premises.  I have spoken to local gardaí on this issue and they do not find that many public order offences occur at such premises.  Many have spoken to the proprietors of these businesses who advise that one of the mainstays of their business is the provision of breakfast and other food for people on finishing shift work.  As is the case for many licensed premises, the provision of food is one of the mainstays of their business.I would have liked the age at which alcohol can be sold in off-licences to have been raised to 21; that would have been a positive step.  We have a serious problem of alcohol consumption.  I do not want to degrade those running off-licences, but I am concerned that some proprietors do not provide any training for their staff.  I have confidence in that respect in regard to licensed premises; their proprietors are serious about retaining their licence which is extremely important to them, and they are concerned to ensure that they do not serve alcohol to those who are under age.  That is my experience and that change has come about in recent years.  I have a concern in that respect about off-licence premises.  The training of staff therein is minimal.  The mandatory training of staff who sell alcohol should be required.I would prefer the law to provide that alcohol could not be sold to people under the age of 21.  It is difficult for the gardaí to track down the sale of alcohol to those who are under age.  Those who are over the age of 18 often buy alcohol for a younger brother or younger friends.  If the age limit at which alcohol could be purchased was raised to 21, we would be dealing with a more responsible cohort of people and that might eliminate some of the under age drinking which is a major problem.On the issue of the closure of premises that have been found to sell alcohol to those who are under age, I welcome the changes proposed in terms of  increasing the days and times when premises will be shut down.  I was alarmed by a newspaper report two years ago about the case involving the sale of a bottle of vodka in a garage premises to a 15 year old girl on the night of the junior certificate results.  The judge presiding over the case initially fined the owner of the premises €100 until he was reminded that he had to order that the premises be closed down.  He then ordered that this premises be closed from 2 p.m. to 6 p.m. on Saturday.  That punishment did not fit the crime in this case.  Alcohol was sold in that premises to a 15 year old girl and it was obvious there was a junior certificate party — the girl was getting on a bus to go to a disco in a local hotel.  All the signs indicated that the girl was under age.  This comes back to the issue of the training of staff.Hopefully, we will deal with the sale of alcohol Bill later this year.  Education is an important factor.  A joint policing committee was held in Cork recently, which was well attended by members of the Garda Síochána from the various districts, public representatives and community representatives.  The focus of the meeting was on under age drinking and public disorder.  The chief superintendent, in his opening statement, said that he viewed policing as a very small part of what was required to deal with our alcohol problem.  Most of us would turn to policing to solve the alcohol problem, but it is a problem that is inherent in society.  Education is important in addressing this problem, particularly the education of parents to ensure they are informed about the products for sale and what their children can get up to.  I attended a meeting organised by the local drugs task force last year and was alarmed when someone showed us Jaffa Cakes and jelly beans soaked in vodka.  Parents need to be aware of these products.  Children are not innocent.  If parents approached this issue with such awareness, they would be more in tune with what their children can get up to.  It is important to heighten the awareness of this problem among parents and to do so on a regular basis because each year there is a new crop of 13 to 15 year olds.  Parents cannot hear enough about the dangers in this areaI welcome the Bill.  I look forward to learning the details of what the Minister proposes in the voluntary code and the change in the structures within supermarkets.  They are important and we will hear about them during the Committee Stage debate.  When we discuss the sale of alcohol Bill towards the end of the year, I would like more radical changes included in it to ensure we send out a strong message that this country is in trouble and that we need to tackle our alcohol problem in a more serious manner.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I warmly welcome the provisions of this Bill.  Alcohol consumption is an integral part of Irish life that can, and often does, lead to problems for individuals and for the wider community when it is misused.  Alcohol harm is visible throughout Ireland — on the streets, in the courts, hospitals, workplaces, schools and homes.  Our first concern is to ensure the protection of our young teenagers.  Despite the tendency to blame under age drinkers, the vast majority of alcohol harm occurs among the adult population where it manifests itself in terms of accidents, hospital admissions, street violence, drunk drinking, alcohol poisoning, suicides, alcohol dependency, cancers and cirrhosis.  Our focus is on young teenagers who deserve the protection of the legislation and on gardaí in our communities who deserve the support of legislation to deal with issues related to anti-social behaviour.Alcohol consumption per capita in the Irish population increased by 17% during the past 11 years with the average consumption of pure alcohol per person in Ireland over 15 years of age being 13.36 litres.  This figure has been mentioned previously in the debate.  Having regard to the fact such alcohol consumption is 30% above the EU average and, in particular, that up to 20% of adults do not consume alcohol, the amount consumed by those who do is even greater and this increases the likelihood of alcohol related harm and public order offences.  Abuse of alcohol is also common among those aged under 18 years of age.  This happens everyday in our communities and we are all concerned about what is happening to our young teenagers.  We have statistics in this area.  The 2006 national study of health behaviour in school age children found that half of those aged 15 to 17 years reported being current drinkers and more than a third reported having been “really drunk” in the previous 30 days.We need to strengthen our resolve to tackle alcohol related problems.  We need to take responsibility both collectively and individually.  We also need to examine our social acceptance of alcohol and the signal that it sends particularly to our young people.  We must ask ourselves if adults provide an appropriate example to younger people in regard to alcohol.  It also needs to become socially unacceptable for people to be excessively drunk on our streets.  This change can only occur when we stop excusing such behaviour.  It is a change which can be achieved, but it can only occur through multi-sectoral action.In order to tackle the problems of alcohol misuse in our society, I support the view that we need to take a twin-track approach in terms of strategies and interventions.  On the one hand, we need to target vulnerable populations and, on the other, we need to have policies to target the population at large in order to be effective in addressing this issue. This is the policy approach being taken by the health promotion unit of the Department of Health and Children.  We firmly believe that certain additional measures are required, particularly regarding price and the ease of availability of alcohol.  It is for these reasons that we have a particular interest in and warmly welcome this legislation.The Bill contains important reforms of the licensing laws and public order legislation to address the adverse consequences of alcohol misuse in our society.  I particularly commend the Minister on the changes proposed in this legislation in regard to addressing public order problems.  Many communities are concerned about the abuse of alcohol by persons under the age of 18.  This legislation gives gardaí powers to seize alcohol from persons they adjudge to be under age and who cannot satisfactorily prove that they are over 18, and to move them on from the location in which they are consuming that alcohol.  This will be particularly welcomed by communities concerned by the anti-social behaviour of young people congregating in unoccupied and derelict buildings and building sites, at river banks and on the streets.  A person who fails to co-operate either in handing over the alcohol or in providing his or her name, age and address may be arrested and charged with an offence.I also welcome the powers afforded to gardaí to dispose of the seized alcohol provided they retain a record of it.  I am aware of reports in my own area of parents coming to the local Garda station seeking the return of alcohol confiscated from their children.  I am amazed at such behaviour, which raises serious questions of parental responsibility.  I welcome the introduction of fixed charge penalties, or on-the-spot fines, and the arrangements being made for the payment of these charges.  These measures provide gardaí with stronger powers in regard to early intervention and assistance in the prevention of offences. The facilitation of the gardaí in responding to and preventing unacceptable behaviour will be welcomed by communities throughout the State.I also welcome the reduction, by 29 hours per week, in the time during which mixed trading premises may sell alcohol.  It always amazed me that people could purchase alcohol in the supermarket on the way to work.  The legislation provides for the restriction of off-licence sales to the period between 10.30 a.m. and 10 p.m., and to between 12.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sundays and on St. Patrick's Day.  Like other speakers, I warmly welcome the provision whereby applicants for a wine licence will require a District Court certificate.We are discussing this legislation against the background of a substantial increase in the number of off-licences and the impact of this on the availability of alcohol in communities.  In the six-year period from 2001 to 2007, data from the Revenue Commissioners show that the number of off-licence permits issued for the sale of spirits and beer increased by 70%, from 790 to 1,300.  These statistics merely confirm what is evident in communities throughout the State.  The number of wine-only off-licences almost trebled in this period to 3,600.  I welcome the provision which will permit gardaí or local residents to object to an application for an off-licence on the basis that it is not required to meet the needs of residents or because there is already a sufficient number of such outlets in the locality.I also welcome the provision whereby the District Court may require the installation and operation during licensing hours of a closed circuit television system.  This will be beneficial in deterring people from loitering in the vicinity of off-licences and in combating secondary purchases, that is, where under age persons try to persuade or pressurise adults to purchase alcohol on their behalf.  We are all aware of this happening outside supermarkets and other retail outlets.I strongly support the proposal to separate alcohol products from other products in supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations.  We must send a strong message from this House to the trade.  I understand from the Minister that the proposed codes of practice are under consideration merely as an initial step.  We will all be satisfied if agreement can be reached on the operation of these codes so that they can achieve effective structural separation which is subject to independent verification on an annual basis.  That is precisely what we want to achieve, whether it is done through the code or via the eventual implementation of section 8.  The structural separation of alcohol products within premises, with the associated requirements regarding signage, warning signs, in-store advertising and staff training standards, must be overseen and enforced through an independent audit and verification mechanism.I am aware of several pubs whose owners have taken advantage of the loophole in regard to theatre licences.  In such cases, the objective is to allow for the sale of alcohol into the early hours and all the publican may have to do to satisfy the Revenue Commissioners of the authenticity of an application for a theatre licence is to provide some live music, additional seating and so on.  Section 10 of the Bill closes off this loophole by stipulating that the sale of alcohol before and after performances in premises with theatre licences will only be permitted during normal licensing hours.  I am extremely pleased with this provision.I strongly support the proposal in section 13 on the introduction of test purchasing, whereby gardaí will be permitted to send a person aged 15, 16 or 17 years into a licensed premises for the purpose of seeking to purchase or being permitted to consume alcohol.  Parental or guardian consent in writing will be required.  We are hopeful this measure will lead to greater use of the Garda age card and to a stronger culture of compliance with provisions regarding under age drinking.  Some shop premises and supermarkets act responsibly within their communities but those who do not should be aware that they may now be subjected to test purchasing.I agree with Deputy Clune's comments on the effectiveness of the television advertisements which feature actors representing nurses, shopkeepers and other members of the community saying they have had enough of the consequences of the abuse of alcohol by others.  Next Tuesday, 1 July, new strengthened codes on advertising and sponsorship by the alcohol industry will come into effect.  The new codes should not be viewed in isolation but rather as one measure in a package of policy measures to address alcohol-related harm.  In tandem with this, the health promotion division of my Department is commencing a process to identify areas in regard to alcohol advertising, promotions and sponsorships where legislative measures may be necessary to afford greater protection to young people.  In addition, we are establishing a working group to examine the extent of existing sponsorship, including the terms and length of contracts.  This group will seek to give direction on concerns regarding the extent of sports sponsorship by alcohol companies.I assure the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform that the health promotion unit of my Department is strongly supportive of this legislation.  We welcome the important reforms of the licensing laws and the public order measures it contains.  I am extremely pleased to see the Bill being implemented in advance of the summer recess.  It will do much to address the adverse consequences of alcohol misuse in our society, particularly in terms of availability and access and Garda powers to deal with public order offences.  Recent reports indicate that anti-social behaviour is a problem in many communities, particularly where young people congregate beside the river, in the forest, on the street or even in playgrounds.  The additional powers for gardaí in this legislation will have a significant impact in communities.  I welcome the Bill and wish it every success.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I welcome the Bill and the debate and compliment the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the former Minister in that Department, Deputy Brian Lenihan.  While alcohol is part of the social fabric, for too long it has been widely abused.  Legislative reforms are needed to tackle public disorder and alcohol-related harm resulting from excessive alcohol consumption.  Every weekend we see evidence of this need on our streets and in the accident and emergency departments of our hospitals.  The problem is not confined to large urban centres but also affects small towns and villages across the country.The Bill will give effect to reforms recommended by the Government alcohol advisory group, which I thank for its work.  The Bill tackles the increased visibility and availability of alcohol through retail outlets with off-licences, while tightening the conditions under which premises with on-licences qualify for special exemption orders permitting them to remain open beyond normal licensing hours.  It also places renewed emphasis on enforcement of licensing law, particularly in regard to underage drinking.The Bill also strengthens public order provisions by including measures to curtail alcohol consumption in public places, especially by those under 18 years, and allowing the Garda to seize alcohol.  The Garda Síochána will also have powers to seize alcohol from any person, regardless of age, where the consumption of alcohol in a public place is causing, or likely to cause, a breach of the peace.We have one of the highest alcohol consumption levels in the European Union.  Average consumption of pure alcohol per person over 15 years of age in 2006 was over 13 litres, a frightening statistic.The proposals in the Bill represent a coherent and carefully balanced package of practical measures and reforms which are designed to reduce access to alcohol, including its visibility within retail outlets, while also strengthening measures to tackle public disorder and anti-social behaviour on the streets and in our communities.I welcome the new Garda powers to seize alcohol which are in addition to existing powers to deal with public order offences.  The new powers will permit early intervention by the Garda and help to prevent offences taking place.  There has been too much of an increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences in recent years.  At the same time, there has been a remarkable increase in the scale and frequency of alcohol promotions and price discounts.  The result has been a marked increase in alcohol availability and visibility within these mixed trading premises.  I feel sorry for people grappling with problem of alcoholism who have to enter these premises to buy their groceries and see all the alcohol promotions before them.  That is not a satisfactory situation.The Bill provides for the separation of alcohol products from other products in premises which are engaging in mixed trading, such as supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations.  There is a need to curtail the availability of such products in these outlets.  We also need to support our traditional pubs because in the main they have served us well over the years.  They were very careful in regard to their licences which had to be renewed every year.  They were pragmatic in regard to how they dealt with underage and overage drinking and persons whom they felt could have consumed too much alcohol.  They were sensible people in the main and compliant with the legislation.The proposals set out in Part 2 contain reforms relating to the sale and consumption of alcohol, including measures to improve compliance with and enforcement of licensing law.  Section 4 proposes generally to restrict off-sales of alcohol to the period between 10.30 a.m. and 10 p.m.; and 12.30 p.m. to 10 p.m. on Sundays and St. Patrick's Day.  The existing concession which permits the sale of alcohol from 7.30 a.m. to 10.30 a.m. in supermarkets and convenience stores is being repealed.  That is a welcome measure.At present, a wine retailer's off-licence may be obtained directly from the Revenue Commissioners with a District Court certificate.  Applicants for a spirit retailer's off-licence or a beer retailer's off-licence require such a certificate.  As recommended by the advisory group, section 5 provides that in future an applicant for a wine retailer's off-licence will also require a District Court certificate.Section 6 extends the grounds on which the District Court may refuse to grant a certificate for a spirit, beer or wine retailer's off-licence.  Similar grounds already apply to applications for on-licences under the Intoxicating Liquor Act 2000.  Objections may be made at the relevant District Court hearing by the local Garda superintendent and local residents or residents' groups.  When granting a certificate, the District Court may also impose a condition that a CCTV system be installed.Following discussions with the trade bodies representing supermarkets and convenience stores, the Minister is considering whether a code of practice proposed by the sector is a workable alternative to section 8.  As part of the code, the sector would sign up on a voluntary basis to implementation of arrangements which, if implemented, would achieve the Bill's objectives.  In particular, the code will require the display of alcohol in a specified part of the premises.  It is vital to the success of any code that all supermarket multiples and convenience store groups sign up to it and implement it in an effective manner.  Not only should they sign up to the code in writing but they should implement it in spirit and provide evidence to that effect.The Bill is long overdue.  I am pleased it is to be enacted before the summer recess.  I hope, with the co-operation of all parties, that it will lead to an improvement in social life in Ireland.I commend the Bill to the House.
#BrianOShea	unknown-#BrianOShea-party	unknown-#BrianOShea-dob	unknown-#BrianOShea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	218	Cuirim fáilte roimh an mBille seo, An Bille Deochanna Meisciúla 2008.  Tá sé thar a bheith caoithiúil.  Dár ndóigh, beidh Bille díolacháin alcóil ag teacht níos déanaí chun na reachtaíochta go léir i dtaobh alcóil a thabhairt suas chun dáta agus cruth níos éifeachtaí a chur air.  Tús atá sa Bhille seo, mar tá níos mó reachtaíochta le teacht.  Tá fadhb mhór againn maidir le meisceoireacht, go mór mhór i leith daoine óga.  Tá cultúr ann faoi láthair a chaithfimid a athrú go práinneach.  Dar ndóigh, tá sé thar a bheith deacair cultúr a athrú, ach sin í an fhadhb agus an dúshlán atá romhainn.The report of the Government alcohol advisory group does not paint a pretty picture in regard to alcohol consumption.  It does not require this report, however, to inform us there is a problem of major proportions in regard to the three areas examined by the group under the excellent chairmanship of Dr. Gordon Holmes, namely, the increase in the number of supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations with off-licences and the manner and condition of sale of alcohol products in such outlets, including below unit cost selling and special promotions.This brings me to an issue which was raised by Dr. Holmes when he addressed the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights.  He pointed out that there was a major problem in identifying the unit cost.  This issue is addressed to some extent in the legislation.  So far as I am concerned it is not acceptable that companies are trading here and producing a range of products, the abuse of which causes major problems in society, and yet it is not possible to ascertain the unit cost.  One person put it to me that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, the former Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, had indicated that the removal of the groceries order, in regard to below cost selling, had not brought about any reduction in prices and asked whether we should consider bringing back that order for alcohol products.It is not good enough to proceed on the basis that it is impossible to get down to the basic unit cost.  The State should not accept a situation like that and we should certainly deal with it as a matter of urgency.  The increasing number of special exemption orders that permit longer opening hours and that are being obtained by licensed premises around the country was the second issue the advisory group was asked to examine.  The final point was the use, adequacy and effectiveness of existing sanctions and penalties, especially those directed towards combating excessive and under age alcohol consumption.The report qualifies the problem in a coherent way.  It points out that Ireland has one of the highest levels of alcohol consumption in the European Union.  Our consumption levels in 2006 were approximately 30% above the EU average.  The report focuses on the problem of binge drinking in particular, which it describes as a cultural attitude to alcohol consumption.  It presents two hallmarks of binge drinking as going out to get drunk and the consumption of alcohol before going out.  The report states that binge drinking is more common in Ireland than in other EU countries and that the Eurobarometer survey published in 2007 indicated that 34% of Irish drinkers consumed at least five drinks per occasion compared with 10% of the EU population.  The report further states that the 2006 national survey of health behaviour in school-age children found that half of children aged 15 to 17 years old reported being current drinkers and just over a third reported being really drunk in the previous 30 days.  The 2004 ESPAD report on alcohol and other drugs among students in 35 European countries found that 86% and 79% of 15 and 16 year old students perceived the availability of beer and sprits respectively to be very easy or fairly easy.  That does not paint a pretty picture.  The key word is culture.  In any society or group a culture is something that is difficult to change.  It takes time and commitment to do so.I find it difficult to come to terms with some of the things I have encountered.  For example, I understand research carried out by the Health Service Executive indicated that alcohol is being passed on to younger people by older siblings or parents.  I heard of an incident in another constituency where a staff member of a supermarket presented himself to a lady who had bought bottles of beer and was giving them to a young person.  It turned out he was her son and she became quite abusive towards the supermarket employee.  She said she would do what she liked with the alcohol.  It is unfortunate that such attitudes appear to prevail and one can only wonder where it will lead.Provision is made in the legislation for test purchasing, which allows for young people aged between 15 and 17 — with the written permission of their parents — to go into all categories of outlet where alcohol is sold with a view to exposing premises that break the law.  That is to be welcomed.  Obviously there are risks attached and the situation must be handled delicately.  That is a move in the right direction and I believe good will come of it.It has been put to me also that if we are to deal with the sale of alcohol to minors, there is a need to make the Garda identity card mandatory so that anyone aged under 21 would have to produce it in order to purchase alcohol.  Some people might consider that draconian but I believe it could be effective in preventing people under 18 from buying drink at least without the knowledge of the staff or owner of a retail outlet.Another issue that has been raised with me relates to the penalties paid by people who are caught buying alcohol for minors.  It was put to me that one can find individuals outside supermarkets who can make €50 in a relatively short time buying drink for people who are under age.  The penalties on conviction for this offence have been described as laughable.  I do not have direct experience of the fines as we do not hear a great deal about them.  I also understand there is great difficulty in securing convictions in this area even when people are clearly identifiable on CCTV handing over drink to young people.  I accept the legislation makes provision for an increase in the fines but from what I can gather from people in business, enforcement is as important as the sentences.  Whatever difficulties exist must be confronted and we need to introduce the appropriate measures to make sure that people who engage in this despicable practice are sanctioned.  It is a sad state of affairs that anyone would supply drink to minors but especially family members.  From what I can gather from people in business, doubling the size of the fine on first conviction from €1,000 to €2,000 with subsequent convictions up to €5,000 is not the solution.  Rather, the solution lies in a more effective regime for securing convictions.  I am not aware of what difficulties exist in terms of securing convictions under the law as it stands except that I have been told that this is the case.I raised the issue of violence with the previous Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, when we discussed the legislation.  Serious incidents have occurred, including death, in private houses where excessive drinking occurs.  Private houses are exempt in the legislation.  If serious violence and death is resulting from excessive drinking in private houses we need to address the issue.  I accept that a man's home is his castle and the home is sacred but life is the most precious thing of all.  The Garda is well aware of houses where excessive drinking occurs.  We need to come up with legislation that will enable the Garda to bring these people before the courts.  More importantly we need interventions that will prevent very serious violence possibly resulting in death.  I hope the subsequent sale of alcohol Bill will address such issues.  This Bill, which is to streamline and update existing legislation, is most welcome and has been presented by the Minister as an initial step.Getting back to the concept of culture, legislation can only achieve so much.  We need to change the culture with the support of parents in the measures we introduce.  Changing culture does not happen overnight.  Many people are very concerned over where all this is leading.  Some years ago I was dropping one of my children at a disco on a Saturday night.  Two scantily clad girls aged no more than 15 were standing outside the premises and were very drunk.  I do not believe they got the drink in the premises outside which they were standing.  They had got the drink elsewhere and had been refused admission.  I spoke to the Garda on the following Monday.  The Garda took the following approach, which had considerable merit.  When gardaí came across children who were inebriated, they brought them home and presented them to their parents.  I was told that in many cases the parents were shocked to see their children's condition.  They were going out sober and coming in very late when the parents were asleep in bed.  The parents did not see them when they were under the influence of drink.  The children stayed in bed until lunchtime the following day, by which time they were no longer inebriated, although they may have had sick heads.  The parents were simply not aware of what was happening.  That approach is effective and should be welcomed.An applicant for a wine licence is now required to appear before the District Court, which is a progressive step.  However, it has been pointed out to me that there are 5,000 to 6,000 wine licences.  Is it a good use of District Court time to require people to appear annually for renewal?  Would there be another way to achieve the same effect without using up court time?  Across a range of areas court time is a very scarce and valuable commodity.  Perhaps there could be a screening system whereby only those licensees to whose licences there had been objections would be required to go before the courts.  In addition to cluttering the courts, there is the issue of the expense particularly for smaller operators needing to appear before the courts.  This matter needs to be considered sympathetically.  They may need to hire a solicitor or a barrister and possibly even an engineer.When we were speaking with Dr. Holmes I raised the issue of the proliferation of off-licence outlets.  When planning applications were submitted the attitude of the local authority was that the market would sort out whether there was a need for an additional off-licence in an area.  I am very pleased that the adequacy of number of licensed outlets in an area will be borne in mind, as it will make a positive contribution to the matter we are discussing.  I wish the Minister well with the legislation.  Some parts would benefit from amendment.  It is worth getting it moving to get something done.  We also need the sale of alcohol Bill brought before the House as quickly as possible.  Legislation is one part and tackling the culture is the other.  The Bill contributes in terms of one aspect of the problem.

#SeanConnick	unknown-#SeanConnick-party	unknown-#SeanConnick-dob	unknown-#SeanConnick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I welcome publication of this Bill.  I hope this debate gives us an opportunity to examine not only the specifics of this Bill but also the wider issue of the place of alcohol in Irish society.  Alcohol has always played a central role in Irish social life.  For the vast majority of people, a trip down to the local pub to have a few drinks is an important part of their week and is a central part of their social life.  The local pub is the centre of many local communities and plays an important role in combating social isolation and loneliness, particularly in rural areas.In recent years a culture of both drinking at home and binge drinking has arisen.  In the six-year period up to 2007, the percentage of alcohol sold by the off-licence trade in Ireland has risen from 30% to 52%.  While a wide range of factors has contributed to this, such as the impact of the smoking ban, stricter enforcement of drink-driving laws and the cost of drink, the problem that arises from this increase is that this new culture of drinking at home diminishes the social aspect of going to the local pub and leads to people drinking for the sake of drinking.This increasing culture of binge drinking is having a very negative impact on family life and society.  Family break-ups and domestic violence fuelled by alcohol are increasing rapidly.  A recent HSE report showed that more than a quarter of domestic violence incidents took place as a result of excessive alcohol consumption.  The same report showed that 46% of all murder and manslaughter cases involved alcohol and that public order offences increased threefold between 1996 and 2002.People's attitude towards alcohol consumption is primarily a matter of personal responsibility.  In a mature society, there should be no need for Government to regulate people's private lives and every citizen should be free to drink alcohol responsibly.  Unfortunately as we have shown in recent years, a growing number of people are not prepared to take personal responsibility for their drinking and for their actions while under the influence of alcohol.  As a result the Government has been left with no choice but to introduce Bills to regulate people's access to alcohol.  I welcome the publication of the Bill and commend the Minister for the speed with which it was introduced.  The Bill, and the forthcoming sale of alcohol Bill, will help to moderate our society's relationship with alcohol.The number of premises that can sell alcohol for consumption off the premises has ballooned in recent years and has certainly been one factor in the increase in drinking the country has witnessed.  While it must be recognised that the vast majority of retailers adopt a very responsible attitude towards the sale and promotion of alcohol, I very much welcome the Bill's proposals to restrict the hours that these premises can sell alcohol and the new licensing regulations for them.  Proposals to restrict alcohol promotions and reduced-price sales are particularly welcome.  I know of a number of cases in my constituency where publicans purchase certain brands of drinks not from their wholesalers but from the local supermarket.  If members of the public are able to buy drinks from a supermarket cheaper than a publican can buy them in a wholesaler, we have to assume this is encouraging people to purchase far more alcohol than they normally would.  This form of pricing on the part of retailers is adding to the culture of excessive drinking we have seen develop in recent years.  I acknowledge the submission made recently by the Vintners Federation of Ireland to the Government alcohol advisory group.  Its proposals on this form of discounted selling in the off-trade have much merit and I hope they will be incorporated in any final regulations devised on the issue of the reduced price sale of alcohol.I particularly welcome the Minister's decision earlier this week to defer section 8 of the Bill on segregation.  This was causing a great deal of concern, particularly among smaller grocers and the supermarkets.  I am delighted that, following his meeting with the representative groups of the organisations, they decided a code of practice would be put in place and that it would be independently monitored.  I was also struck by the responsible attitude of the many convenience store owners who visited my office or called to see me at clinics in recent weeks regarding this Bill.  They described how they can effectively monitor the sale of alcohol.  Whether in Bunclody, New Ross, Ramsgrange or whatever area of Wexford, I was struck by how responsible the owner-operators of the supermarkets were.  I also welcome the fact that the segregation of wine has been exempted.  This was very important to the supermarkets and the customers.  People like to browse the wine aisles and read the labels when purchasing a bottle of wine.  Putting it behind the counter or in a controlled area may have been a step too far.One area of this Bill which will need some clarification is the proposal to serve closure orders on premises which are found to have served alcohol to minors.  While any proposal such as this which will encourage extra vigilance against under age drinking is welcome, there is some confusion in the retail sector about its implementation.  This should be clarified before these proposals are implemented.  Retailers and shop owners are unsure whether a closure order served on a shop will see the closure of the off-licence section of this shop for a particular period of time or the closure of the entire shop.  I ask the Minister to clarify this issue for retailers before he implements this proposal.  I also welcome the reprieve for the early licence holders.  There are very few of them left and we could refer to them as old Ireland.  The Minister's decision on them was very welcome.  They have not contributed in any way to the anti-social behaviour we have seen.An issue relating to the sale of alcohol for consumption off the premises on which I would like to see a new focus is delivery services.  Certain off-licences offer a service whereby customers can phone in an order for drink, have it delivered to their door and pay the delivery man on arrival.  Although this practice is not widespread, this form of delivery service makes the task of preventing minors from purchasing alcohol far more difficult.  It also opens up the legal issue of where the sale of alcohol takes place, in the off-licence when the phone call is made or in the home when the delivery man accepts the payment.  Although there are regulations to cover this form of transaction, they are not strictly enforced and I would like to see the Garda vigorously target any business offering this service.  I recently heard the story of a group of people who put a call in to an off-licence and got a taxi driver to deliver slabs of beer to a remote location.  This kind of practice must be tackled very seriously.  It leads to no control on the sale of alcohol.I want to turn to nightclubs and theatre licences.  This is a complicated area and I am not sure tackling them as this legislation proposes is the way to go.  They need much more consideration and thought.  Citizens have the right to go to nightclubs, leave at a reasonable hour and go to a fast-food outlet without the fear of being assaulted.  This is where personal responsibility plays a role.  This is a law and order issue.  It is a citizen's right to socialise in a safe and happy environment inside and outside clubs.  Sequential closing is working quite well and I am slightly concerned we are moving backwards.  Speaking to a number of people, particularly in cities where there is a large number of clubs, sequential closing has worked by moving people around the city at different times.I wonder about Sunday closing times.  We live in a very different time.  Why we are making an adjustment on Sunday night closure is beyond me.  It may not need to be carried out.  I would like to see a much more detailed study on nightclub and theatre licences.  There has been a proliferation of theatre licences and this has caused some concern.  Some operators trade for approximately 31 hours per week and open only late at night until the early hours of the morning.  Some of the recommendations in this Bill will see their opening hours reduced from 31 to 23 hours, which will probably make them unviable.  I would like to see a particular study on this area.I welcome the proposals to tackle public disorder, such as granting the Garda power to seize alcohol from people who appear to be under age or when there is a reasonable fear of public disorder.  However, I believe we can go further in empowering the Garda to combat public disorder.  The Local Government Act 2001 gives local authorities the power to pass by-laws outlawing the consumption of alcohol in public places.  There is a strong argument for implementing this on a nationwide basis and making the enactment of these by-laws compulsory.  As a member of New Ross Town Council and a former member of Wexford County Council, the difficulty with the planning laws is that we have had a staggered arrangement on opening hours for takeaways.  Somebody is granted planning permission with a closing time of 9 p.m. while somebody else has a closing time of 11 p.m. but because another takeaway has been in existence for longer, it can trade until 2 a.m., 3 a.m. or 4 a.m.  We should examine this on a nationwide basis and consider introducing it through our town councils.I am also chairman of the JFK Dunbrody festival in New Ross.  We run a festival every year and this is its eighth year.  We run an alcohol-free concert area policed by the Garda, volunteers and committee members such as me.  It has been a major success story.  While we implement the by-laws fairly rigorously during these events, we allow the occasional drink to be taken where tables and chairs are put in front of a pub.  However, we absolutely clamp down on young or older people carrying a glass or a can along the streets.  That is something we have seen much more of on the streets of our towns throughout the country.  I welcome this aspect of the Bill.Education is one of the areas in which we have to tackle this culture of alcohol abuse.  Disposable income is one of the reasons for it.  Young people I talk to all seem to have a job and when going out for a night, they have €100 to €150 with them.  With no shortage of money, they can all afford the five drinks they would have on average, or in many cases much more.  Education is one of the most important aspects and I would like to see a very dedicated and strong education programme put in place to try to tackle alcohol abuse.One proposal which was common to almost all submissions given to the Government's alcohol advisory group, and which I support, was a call for the introduction of a national ID card.  We have reached the point where a national ID card is the only workable solution to the problem of under age drinking.  Although the vast majority of premises owners are extremely diligent in their duty not to serve minors, they are facing an uphill struggle at times to identify people who are under age.  A national ID card system that is rigorously enforced will be one of the most effective weapons against under age drinking.  If the Minister does not have sufficient time to introduce this measure before the implementation of this legislation, and I do not think he has, I would urge him to consider it in the context of the sale of alcohol Bill.I commend the Minister on introducing this Bill and the speed with which he wishes to enact it.  There will be strong support for the measures contained in the Bill.  As I have outlined, I have concerns about some areas and I hope the Minister will take these concerns, and the concerns of other Members, into account when seeking to enact the Bill.  The Bill is not a cure-all but is the start of a process of tackling the abuse of alcohol.  That must be a welcome development.
#JohnOMahony	unknown-#JohnOMahony-party	unknown-#JohnOMahony-dob	unknown-#JohnOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Bill, which attempts to address a major problem in society that is at crisis point throughout the length and breadth of the country.  I also see the Bill as an opportunity.  In recent months, I have spoken to young people — I am a parent myself — as well as gardaí, publicans and off-licence holders.  All of them recognise there is a problem.  In life, I have found that when people can be made to recognise there is a problem, they can at least concentrate on the solution.  This Bill is part of that solution, but only a part, and a start rather than an end in itself.I have spoken with young people who have got into trouble.  They sometimes say they have nothing else to do or nowhere to go and so on.  As noted by several speakers today, we must consider the wider issues involved.  As Deputy O'Shea said, no off-licence holder wants somebody outside making money by buying drink for young people and no publican, or at least very few, wants to serve drink to underage people.  There is an opportunity which everybody needs to grasp by working together.I was glad to hear the Minister's point on the advertising codes which will be introduced, which is related to the issue of sponsorship.  As one who has been involved in a sporting organisation for many years, the GAA, which has benefited from sponsorship and funding from the drinks companies, I feel the time has arrived for sporting and voluntary organisations to consider this issue.  I accept there is a difficulty and that this will entail major consultation as to how the funding these organisations receive can be replaced.  This has to happen right across the board.  Over the years, the GAA has been highlighted more than any other organisation, despite the fact it is appointing or will eventually appoint a substance abuse officer in each club throughout the country.  Everybody realises there is a problem but we need to work together.In that spirit, it is in everybody's interest — publicans, off-licence holders, members of the public, gardaí and drinks companies — that this issue is tackled once and for all.  It is important that people can socialise in a responsible manner and that everybody can walk the streets without fear of being attacked while still allowing the drinks retailers to provide a service and earn a living.There is little need to produce arguments to convince public opinion that something needs to be done to address the problems caused by the abuse of alcohol in our cities, towns and villages throughout the country.  One has only to walk the streets of our towns and cities on any weekend night to witness the problems the abuse of alcohol is causing in society — broken bottles and glasses, threatening behaviour, graffiti on walls, fights and rowdyism is the picture with which we are presented.  We wake up on weekend mornings to listen to the latest news bulletins detailing the deaths, stabbings and violence that have taken place as a direct result of alcohol abuse.In this regard, it was noted earlier that much of this violence takes place at house parties and so on.  Publicans will obviously suggest that in the controlled environment of the local pub, when somebody had too much drink taken, that person would not be served and could be brought home.  The publicans bemoan the passing of that time.The evidence is also provided in many reports.  Dr. Anne Hope in her recent study for the HSE gave an overview of more than 30 recent studies relating to alcohol consumption.  Among its many graphic facts, the study stated that 46% of those who committed murders were intoxicated, a third of fatal accidents were caused by alcohol and 28% of all injury attendances in accident and emergency departments in acute hospitals were alcohol-related.  The report also confirmed that chronic alcohol conditions had increased among young adults and more women than ever before are now affected by the abuse of alcohol.  The suggestion that the number of new alcohol-related cancers would more than double for females and increase by 81% for males before 2020 is frightening, as is the finding that alcohol affects an adolescent brain differently from an adult brain and that damage from alcohol use during adolescence could be long-term and irreversible.The reasons to tackle alcohol abuse and underage drinking are many but the above data alone make a compelling argument in regard to people's health and lifespan.  A solution would free many beds in our hospitals and accident and emergency units.  The Bill is seen as an attempt to address some of the problems associated with the misuse of alcohol and in that context it is to be welcomed.  All sides agree there is a problem but getting everybody to agree to the correct solutions is a much more complex issue.We must remember that the vast majority of publicans, off-licence holders and retailers are responsible people and see the need for correct procedures and laws with regard to the sale of alcohol.  They also deserve due consideration in this legislation so they can continue to earn a living and continue to give employment.  The local publican, we should note, is suffering because of modern trends and there has been a massive increase in drinking at home and at house parties.  The pub is being used less for a social drink.  This is to be regretted because it was always mostly a safe haven and controlled environment where the publican was responsible and refused to serve if someone had too much to drink.  This will not happen in the other settings we have discussed.Section 8 provides for the separation of alcohol products in premises that are engaged in mixed trading.  This constraint had not been fully thought through and its full implementation for the small rural village or town off-licence holder would mean closure of that outlet because the return would not justify retaining it.  It would cost tens of thousands of euro to make the structural changes and provide the extra staffing levels.  Even if these changes went ahead, it is my belief, having spoken to many of those involved, that it would do nothing to reduce alcohol abuse because in many ways these small convenience stores are not the problem.  By and large, they know their customers and therefore there is less chance of their abusing the system.  The real problem exists in the large multinational stores where one can fill trolleys off the shelves with all kinds of drinks being sold at below cost prices without any checks or scrutiny.I welcome the fact the Minister has held discussions with the supermarket and convenience store owners with a view to putting into effect a voluntary code of practice as an alternative to implementation of section 8.  This, of course, would have to be seen to work and be independently verified.  I am glad the trading bodies recognise there is a problem and are willing to play their part in resolving it.I also notice the Minister proposes amendments to the Bill which would not require wine to be segregated, allowing the customer to browse before purchasing.  This seems reasonable because if all other voluntary safeguards are in place, there should not be any problem with abuse in regard to wine.Some of the biggest problems associated with alcohol abuse in our society are caused by underage drinking, below cost selling and secondary purchasing.  All three, of course, are linked and can only be tackled if there is a unified approach by all the affected parties — retailers, gardaí and, of course, parents.  There must be stringent application of an identification card system that is seen to work.  For instance, some of the identification cards used at present can easily be forged, especially when they are not strictly monitored.  Any card that is misused should be withdrawn and its misuse treated as a serious offence.  A properly operated identification system would be a major step forward in stamping out under age drinking and reducing trouble on our streets.Parents have an enormous responsibility in this area.  They must have greater awareness of where their children are at critical times of the day.  Amounts of pocket money must be monitored and supervision and a presence in the home is crucial at certain times.  In this context, the fact that there will be less money available to be spent on alcohol in a time of recession is no bad thing for the health of all concerned.  This is one of the few benefits of the economic problems we have at the moment.It is quite striking that when on holidays in France or Italy, one sees young people socialising together, sometimes even enjoying a glass of wine, without the slightest hint of rowdiness or threatening behaviour.  The drink culture in Ireland has been widely discussed and we must examine the culture in other countries to determine why it does not seem to lead to the problems we experience.  We must ask why some of our young people feel it is a fun thing to get off their heads on alcohol, with little thought for the consequences.  We must also determine why the behaviour of our young people differs from that of their counterparts in mainland Europe.With regard to young people and the image of them that is portrayed by abuse of alcohol and the anti-social behaviour and violence that goes along with it,  we sometimes forget that there are thousands of young people who can socialise and enjoy themselves without getting into trouble or causing annoyance to anyone.  The pity is that their activities never make the headlines.  We are not interested in good news.  I have seen at first-hand, for instance, the fantastic work done by No Name clubs.  The club in my area of Claremorris has more than 200 members, who engage in many activities every week in a drink-free environment.  A few months ago I attended the national gathering of the No Name clubs in Castlebar where more than 1,000 young people spent the weekend involved in various events and competitions, all driven and led by themselves, in a wonderful carefree atmosphere where alcohol was not a factor.  The event was held in a hotel where drink was readily available in bars.  I could not believe the atmosphere and the fun the young people were having.  They had a fantastic time.  For the young people involved in such clubs there are huge benefits by way of increased confidence, self esteem and empowerment.  Unfortunately, such an event merits very little media coverage locally or nationally.  One needs to have broken glass and drunken brawls outside nightclubs to make the headlines.On the night I attended the No Name event I walked down the street and less than 500 metres away I came across a group of four or five drunken youths, one of whom was collapsed on the footpath.  The images on the streets of the drunken behaviour is what makes the news in the following weeks' newspapers but the question we must ask is which group of young people enjoyed themselves the most.  The answer is very obvious.Having worked with young people for many years as a teacher and in voluntary organisations, I have always believed in a carrot and stick approach.  Many of the provisions of this Bill are welcome and necessary.  Rules, regulations and laws need to be strengthened in many areas, but there is also the need to use a carrot approach towards people and organisations who are steering our young people in the right direction.  Organisations like the No Name clubs, Foróige and all the sporting organisations need support, encouragement and resources to be able to provide the facilities and opportunities for our young people to develop and enjoy life to the full in a carefree and safe environment.  In some small towns and villages, sports and recreational facilities are located in schools or clubs and cannot be used at night because money is not available to pay a caretaker.  In some cases, the amounts of money needed are small.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, has done great work in supporting rural communities.  However, support must be given on a broader scale because, in the long run, it will save money.Garda juvenile diversion programmes are doing wonderful work in keeping young people out of the courts.  I raise this issue against the background of figures released recently showing that the number of children involved in crime has jumped by 20% in just two years, with alcohol related offences the main cause of the increase.  The aim of the Garda juvenile diversion programmes, funded by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform is to divert children from offending behaviour and keep them out of the courts.  Young people who get into trouble are given a second chance if they buy into corrective measures by agreeing to apologise to or compensate a victim and by getting involved in recreational activities.  The positive results of this scheme for the small investment involved are startling.  Approximately 87% of young people dealt with reached their 18th birthday before going to court and 75% of those going through this system avoided the courts up to the age of 25.  I had first-hand experience of the work going on in this area in my constituency where there are two youth diversion schemes, one in Ballina and the other in Castlebar.  Considering that most of the young people helped under these schemes avoid going to prison, the amount of money saved by the State is considerable.  It is estimated to cost more than €100,000 per annum to keep a person in prison.  That money would fund a youth diversion scheme for 70 or 80 youngsters.  I call on the Minister to expand the youth diversion scheme.  At the moment there are only 100 juvenile liaison officers nationwide but there should be one officer in every Garda district in the country.  It would reduce the numbers of young people going to prison.  The benefits would be enormous for vulnerable young people in helping them to cope with the pressures of modern life without falling off the cliff and ending up in jail.  There would also be considerable savings to the State.  The traffic corps have quite rightly been well-resourced to deal with road traffic issues but attention must also be given to the youth diversion programmes and adequate resources must be put in place to support them.  It would be money very well spent.I welcome the measures in this Bill that will help to tackle problems caused by the abuse of alcohol in a structured and even handed way, without closing down all retail outlets.  Other countries have done it successfully and there is no reason we cannot do it too.  This Bill on its own will not solve everything to do with alcohol abuse.  It is merely one piece of a jigsaw of measures that must be implemented by the Government to support parents and volunteers working with young people to provide alternatives to the drink culture that is enveloping our country.  The Bill must be seen as a start rather than an end.  There is much more work to be done.

I could not fault anything the Deputy said because he took a balanced and reasonable approach to the problem.  We must face the reality of the huge damage the over-consumption or abuse of alcohol is causing in our society.  Nobody is talking about people who take a social drink.  However, the reality is that on every index, no matter which one we look at — crime, illness or accident and emergency units — the abuse of alcohol is one of the primary causes of the problems we face.People socialising and meeting people is a good thing regardless of whether they drink.  However, at all levels of Irish society, and it is not something confined to the young, we have a major problem with alcohol.  If we look at the self-inflicted damage it does to individuals, the damage it does to people on a night out, rows, matters mentioned by Deputies, problems caused within families and the huge problems it causes with domestic violence, we get some measure of the problem we are facing.It is right that we are changing the law which I, obviously, support as a member of the Government.  However, I also think that the fundamental thing we must do here is to send signals to people about acceptable behaviour.  In other words, the Irish people need to change their attitude towards alcohol.  I can never understand the view that one cannot celebrate something, have a good time or go out for a night unless one gets so intoxicated that one cannot go to work the next day.  I do not understand why anybody would do that.As the Deputy said, 28% of injury attendances at accident and emergency departments in hospitals relate to alcohol-related incidents.  It is reported that almost two-thirds of those would never have happened if alcohol had not been involved.  Everybody talks about the problems in terms of the health service and waiting in hospitals.  I remember one Christmas where it became very snowy and everyone was warned to stay at home.  I understand that the accident and emergency departments were empty because people were not out and about consuming too much alcohol and getting into trouble.If we look at the pressure times in hospitals, we can see they are at the weekend when a considerable amount of socialising takes place.  I asked about doctor call-outs in a certain rural area.  I understand that in many areas, there were very few call-outs for grazes, cuts, knocks and blows on weekdays.  Come the weekend, there is a constant stream of call-outs, not for anything fatal but fundamentally because of alcohol.Therefore, not only do we have to take physical steps, as we are in this Bill, to limit the availability of alcohol in certain ways, we have an even bigger job in changing mindsets, people's attitude towards alcohol and the acceptance of the abuse of alcohol.  I look forward to the code of practice in respect of advertising.  People say that one cannot ban advertising.  Let us see what the code of practice does.  The counter argument must always be that people would not spend millions on advertising if it did not sell more of their product.  There are one or two advertisements, particularly one, that create an entire scene involving alcohol.  One must have alcohol when one is on the way to the party and get more alcohol when one gets there.  One then sees at the bottom of the advertisement a little sign telling people to drink responsibly.  I do not know who is codding who because while I accept that no drinks company per se sets out to sell alcohol to the point of excess, they very cleverly send the subliminal message in some of these advertisements that unless one is literally drinking from afternoon to night, one has not had a full day.Therefore, it will be interesting to see how this code of practice works.  Will it deal with the problem we face in respect of the glamorising of the abuse of alcohol and change matters in respect of advertisements that give totally the wrong impression?  We are talking about desensitisation, creating norms and things that are considered acceptable.  Unfortunately for many people in our society, the total abuse of alcohol is considered to be the norm and the abnormal thing is to not get bombed out of one's mind.  As long as this attitude persists as a social standard, we will have a major problem.The other myth we should debunk is the one that the abuse of alcohol is confined to the young.  Young people's attitude towards to alcohol is influenced by that of their parents and whether they have seen a reasonable use of alcohol while growing up.  We focus too much on this as if the young lived in a parallel universe that had no connection to what they saw or what was around them when they are growing up.  Therefore, in trying to tackle this problem, we must confront the issue right across the different age groups.As Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, my Department has responsibility for the drugs problem.  One thing that comes across time and again is the association of alcohol with drug abuse.  In many cases, a mixture of legal and illegal drugs is being used.  I am no expert on this but I understand that in certain areas, drugs are used with alcohol with literally lethal results.  Again, this is part of the culture of not regarding the use of alcohol as a social outlet involving restraint but of having to be literally out of one's mind before one thinks one has had a good night out.  I have met professionals who have told me that people with very good careers who had huge prospects in life have had them ruined by one night where they used a combination of alcohol and drugs.Tá fadhb an-mhór againn sa tír seo leo siúd, agus níl sí ag dul i laghad.  Caithfidh muid, mar Oireachtas, díriú ar an gceist seo.  Tá ceart againn dlithe a thabhairt isteach a dhéanfaidh i bhfad níos deacra é do dhaoine óga ól a fháil.  Ag an am céanna, is cuma cad iad na dlithe a cuirfidh muid i bhfeidhm — mar a bhfuair siad amach i Meiriceá  — ní dhéanfaidh siad aon difríocht mura n-athróidh muid dearcadh an phobail.  Creidim go bhfuil ról ag an tOireachtas, ní hamháin dlithe a dhéanamh ach iarracht a dhéanamh cur ina luí ar an bpobal nach bhfuil éinne in aghaidh óil, an fhad is nach bhfuil sé ag déanamh dochar don duine féin nó níos tábhachtaí fós, dochar do na daoine timpeall orthu, bíodh siad ina gcónaí in éineacht leo nó cairde leo nó daoine a castar orthu ar an tsráid.  Tá mé den tuairim go bhfanann muid amuigh, mar phobal agus mar thír, i bhfad ró-dheireanach san oíche.  Deirtear linn nach bhfuil aon am dúnta ar an Mór-Roinn.  Tá sin fíor, ach mar sin féin, téann daoine abhaile ag 11 i.n. nó ag an meán oíche.  Ní chreideann siad go gcaithfidh siad fanacht go ndúnann chuile áit.Ach tá nós ag fás in Éirinn, de réir mar a thuigim é, go mbíonn daoine ag ól sa bhaile sula dtéann siad amach.  Ansin bíonn siad ag ól sa phub.  Nuair a dhúnann an pub, téann siad ar aghaidh go dtí an nightclub.  Dá mbeadh áit ar bith oscailte ina dhiaidh sin, rachaidís ann freisin lé n-ól agus le n-ól agus tuilleadh a ól.  Téann siad go dtí cuid mhaith de na háiteanna seo mar go bhfuil an t-ól ar fáil.  Sílim go gcaithfimid breathnú ar chuile thaobh den cheist seo agus iad a phlé.  Má táimid ag caint ar an mbrú atá ar an eacnamaíocht, srl., creidim nach iad na rudaí atá ag tarlú i mbainceanna Mheiriceá an dúshlán is mó roimh na tíre seo.  B'fhéidir gurb é an dúshlán is mó atá roimh na tíre seo i láthair na huaire ná an costas airgid agus — níos mó ná sin, an costas sóisialta — atá mí-úsáid alcól ag cur ar dhaoine.  Creidim gur céim bheag sa treo ceart atá sa Bhille seo.  Táimid ag díriú ar na hathruithe seo agus ag iarraidh aird an phobail a dhíriú orthu.  Sílim gur Bille an-mhaith atá anseo.  Mar a dúirt an Teachta a labhair romham, fear a bhfuil cáil air a bheith i mbun cúrsaí spóirt agus ag plé le daoine óga, níl anseo ag deireadh an lae ach tús díospóireachta.I believe this is just the beginning of a dialogue and I hope the people in this House stand up, in all facets of their lives and in all roles they play, to preach moderation.  I hope we will try to change the attitudes of our society.  Of all the challenges facing us, such as the economic challenges emanating from changes in America, one of the greatest is the total and widespread abuse of alcohol.  This is a challenge which is within our own control and for which we can blame no one else.

Like most parents, I like to think my children are young angels but, having six of them aged between 19 and 29, I have seen some things over the years that would make the hair on Deputies' heads stand on end, if they had any.  Young people are very inventive and excessive drinking is a problem not just among children, but young adults.I was working on the door of a local disco approximately a year ago.

#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	229	I saw every young person who went into the hall and there was no alcoholic drink on their person as no one who had drink was allowed in.  When the disco was over at 1.30 a.m. and the lights were switched on, the floor was littered with empty cider cans, noggins of vodka and baby Powers bottles.  I do not know how the drink got into the hall but it shows how inventive young people are.  They do not see the dangers of excessive drinking.I welcome the fact the Minister has eased the regulation relating to small shops and supermarkets.  Not to have done so would have caused severe hardship because some shopkeepers do not have the space to segregate alcohol as required.  I understand the representative body has met the Minister and given an undertaking that its members will police this themselves in a strong fashion.  I welcome that as these people have to survive.  They do not make their money selling alcohol but it is a necessary part of their business and I am glad the Minister recognised that aspect.I was in a multinational supermarket recently and, walking past the drinks shelf, I saw a bottle of a well-known lager for sale at 89 cent while, not far away, there was a bottle of Coke at €2.  Something must be done to address below-cost selling of certain beers.  When a bottle of lager is selling for half the price of a bottle of Coke, something is definitely wrong.Parents also have a responsibility.  There is a bottle of whiskey or vodka in the press in every house and the presses are not locked.  My house is the same as everybody else's in this regard and young people today will get their hands on drink if it is available.  They even take the whiskey out of a bottle and replace it with water.  It sounds funny but it happens and parents must be more responsible.  They must realise that their children will do this.  We all think our children are angels but they are not.  Once they get into a group, peer pressure prompts them to act in the same way as other young people.The Minister mentioned the damage being done by drink to young people and there is no doubt about it.  I do not know how we can sort it out.  Some people can drink but, once they get married, they have other things on their minds such as a mortgage and they can move away from it.  Others, even if they are married, do not seem to be able to get out of the habit of drinking regularly on Thursday, Friday or Saturday nights.  They damage themselves and their families and it is impossible to put a cost on the problem.  We should do anything we can to solve it.I have noticed a recent tendency for football matches to be shown at 12 p.m. on Sky on a Saturday or Sunday, which brings people into pubs much earlier than heretofore.  On Saturday or Sunday, when they are not working, people go into a pub at 12 p.m. for a match which lasts until 2.30 p.m. or 3 p.m. and another is shown after that.  They do not leave until 6 p.m. or 7 p.m. and that causes excessive drinking.I was asked a question today about off-licence sales.  An off-licence opens at 10.30 a.m. and closes at 10.30 p.m. but what is the situation as regards off-licences on licensed premises, which have seven-day licences?  Their opening times are the same but are they also expected to close at 10.30 p.m?  I cannot see how that would work.  Maybe the Minister will come back to me to clarify the point.I wish the Minister well in his endeavours.  We should do whatever we as a Government, and as politicians in general, can to stop excessive drinking by young people, especially those who are under age.  I have seen young adults, aged 18, 19 or 20, some of whom are brothers or sisters of younger people, going into off licences, supermarkets or pubs and handing the drink to the younger people when they come out.  They may even charge the younger people and make a profit in the process.  This must be stamped out by dealing with such actions severely.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	230	I wish to share time with Deputy Andrew Doyle.  I will have 12 minutes and Deputy Doyle eight.I congratulate my parliamentary soccer colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews, on his new position.  I wish him the best in his role.  I have long been an advocate of intervention, especially through youth participation.I welcome many elements in this Bill.  The small shopkeepers to whom Deputy Scanlon referred had a major battle on their hands when this Bill was published.  They would have had to invest €60,000-€100,000 in building a separate section in shops, as well as putting personnel in this area.Without analysing this measure too critically, one might have thought it would curb young people's access to drink.  When I consulted with the shopkeepers and saw the code of ethics they have, such as ensuring that those who sell drink are over 18, I did not see the merit in the measure.  I welcome the fact the Minister has addressed this.  We must continue to examine this area.  Members have referred to a mandatory identification card system.  That is the way to curb the problem, not by putting extra costs on shopkeepers.Coming from a rural constituency, I saw this as another law that would possibly close local shops.  That was all it would do, it would not curb the purchase of drink by young people.  It was another element of the type of bureaucracy we are introducing that makes it virtually impossible for businesses to survive in rural areas.  It has created an urban-rural divide, and I do not refer to the east-west divide, which is too simplistic.  The divide is between urban and rural, even in areas that are predominantly rural.  People living in the countryside feel they are doing more of their business in urban areas.  Those providing essential services in the countryside are finding it ever more difficult to survive, especially with extra bureaucracy coming down the line.As legislators we must critically examine the cultural impact on people living in the countryside.  The Government has brought in laws that make it quite impossible for people to continue with their culture in their communities.  That is a sad indictment of the type of society we are trying to create.  This occurred to me when a shopkeeper told me he could not incur losses of €60,000 and would have to close his shop.When we critically examine the Lisbon treaty referendum we can examine a county like Donegal and specifically Oileán Thoraí where, according to anecdotal evidence, only one person voted "Yes".  Tory Island is the most peripheral part of Ireland and of Europe.  The further one gets from Brussels and Dublin, the higher the "No" vote.  I spoke to the Ceann Comhairle this morning about the high "No" vote in Kerry.  Something negative is happening in rural Ireland and we must become conscious of it.  We have driven a wedge between urban and rural areas and the people living in rural areas are not willing to put up with it anymore.  An example is the attempt by this Government to remove coastguard services from Valentia, County Kerry and Malin Head.  That is another element why people voted "No" in the referendum.  They focused on the local rather than the European picture.Perhaps I have digressed from the Bill.  I welcome the fact that off-licences will close at 10.30 p.m.  I passed one at 12.30 a.m. last Saturday and there was a mighty congregation of young people outside it.  The ban on below cost selling promotions is welcome.  However, as the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, stated, this is the beginning of the debate.  It is unfortunate it did not get going ten years ago.  This Bill is scratching the surface of our attempts to change the culture.  Deputy Scanlon expressed it succinctly when he said that young people are resilient and will find other ways of getting drink.  The major thing we must change is culture.  The only way to change any element of culture is by preventative measures and education.  No rule or regulation will change the culture of underage drinking.  The more rules and restrictions we impose on young people, the more they will step around them.  We must get to the core of what is happening in our culture.I welcome the comment by the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, that this does not only apply to young people.  There is overindulgence and we are all involved.  There should be a survey of the 166 Deputies in this House to see what age each started drinking.  Perhaps we were all 21.  We need a reality check when examining our culture.  In the constituency of the Acting Chairman, Deputy O'Connor, there are serious issues with underage drinking.  Anecdotally, it seems the age is dropping all the time and young people are getting braver at a younger age.We must examine community responsibility, intertwined with parental responsibility and a pro-active, multi-agency response.  I do not refer to producing more reports and policies on what we need to do.  We must get engaged at the grassroots level and examine the education sector.  Schools should not stop junior and senior infant classes at 1 p.m., nor at 3 p.m. for older classes, nor 4 p.m. for secondary students.  School must be ongoing.  Students do not pick up bad or deviant behaviour during school hours but during out of school hours.  The Minister of State has a role to examine the roll-out of intervention projects.  I have confidence he will do so.I received a call from a young person about The LOFT in Letterkenny, which Deputy Blaney knows.  It was a productive and useful intervention model, where young people could congregate after school in a non-alcoholic environment.  Young people do not necessarily want to engage in drinking.  The single biggest attraction for young people, and we are all the same, is to be with their peers and have some banter.  That is their main motivation.  Those who are good at sport can do it on the Gaelic field or the soccer field and those who are excellent at music meet their peers there.  However, the vast majority of young people do not fall into these compartments but they still want to be with each other.  I acknowledge the fact the Government funded The LOFT but young people are faced with a predicament.  The lease is up in September and the whole project is up in the air.We must realise that we do not need new buildings or to target special, multipurpose centres.  The community and enterprise section of Donegal County Council compiled an inventory and was amazed at the amount of buildings lying idle, either through the church, secondary school or primary school.  We have a bank of premises that could be used in a positive and productive way at inter-agency, local level.  I am not referring to inter-agency work at a policy level with briefs and bringing people together.  Every parish in the country has buildings that are not utilised.  All that is required is leadership through community initiatives in each of these parishes.I do not like speaking about what I was involved in because everybody likes to speak about their own projects and what works best for them.  However, I was employed as a youth worker on a peace and reconciliation project between 1997 and 1999 and I was on my own with one portakabin and every day after 3 p.m. 250 young people under the age of 14 crammed through the door.  I was not able to do the job on my own so I looked around the town and saw student gardaí, student nurses and people on FÁS and community employment courses.  Letterkenny had a database of people willing to engage and give up their time on a voluntary basis.  During this two year period, more than 100 people worked in the portakabin on a voluntary basis at no cost to the State, the parents or the children.  This is about co-ordination and utilising the voluntary goodwill in our communities.  It is intervention for young people after 1 p.m., 2 p.m., 3 p.m. and 4 p.m.  We still have a mindset that education stops once the school bag lands on the kitchen table and the children look for their grub.  This is when the problems start.After school and at weekends let us give our young people something positive in which to engage.  Let us give them the advantages to change the culture.  We can do this.  I know I used a negative example of the cultural shifts and changes in rural Ireland.  However, we can change this culture and the only way we will do it is through community empowerment and intervention, utilising the goodwill out there and showing some leadership.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I thank Deputy McHugh for providing me with the opportunity to speak on this Bill.  That so many Deputies from throughout the country and across the floor of the House have expressed an interest in speaking on it highlights the fact that it is an issue that affects all of our constituencies and communities.I note from the introduction that the Intoxicating Liquor Bill is a work in progress.  It is intended to be superseded by the sale of alcohol Bill which will be much more extensive.  We must recognise that it is not the full picture.  If the Government alcohol advisory group was slow to be implemented it certainly got its work done and this Bill has come before the House shortly after the group finished its work.  At least we are trying to address the core aspects.The challenge to legislators is that alcohol, which by its definition is intoxicating, presents challenges to people who either cannot or do not wish to handle it and people who wish to abuse its sale for profit.  We must try to allow for and encourage its responsible use while at the same time limiting and punishing those who seek to abuse it for profit.  I spoke at a school and told the young fellows there that in ten years' time one or two of them may be alcoholics and they all laughed at me.  They all thought drinking was great.  This is the culture to which Deputy McHugh and others referred which we must try to change.Even though we gave out about it, in years gone by the only place one could buy alcohol or get a take-out was in a pub.  The local publican and his or her staff in rural areas and in larger pubs in cities and towns had responsibility for the availability of alcohol.  To this end, it was easier to define.  Certainly, problems existed and it was probably considered that the country did not have any other social outlet at the time.  All of our families have experienced at some level or at some distance the implications of an alcoholic or alcohol abuse in a family.In revising the legislation, we are trying to address the way in which alcohol is available and youth access and access outside the control of drinking on an establishment must be addressed.  Access in stores, where alcohol is either on sale to get people in as a loss leader or available in-store anyway, must be controlled.  Sensible amendments have been made in that regard in so far as the local store in a village did not have the easiest access as those in charge were responsible.  The problem was in larger stores.Those in the drinks and retail industry have put forward sensible proposals on foot of a realisation on their part that abuse and misuse of alcohol and abuse of its sale in the long term will not suit them.  It will lead to more draconian law unless they take responsible action.  I would like to think that as responsible citizens they recognise the need to take corrective action.  One suggestion that was made is the introduction of a mandatory ID card.  RGDATA came up with a proposal similar to a PPSN card or an E111 card — this ID card would be a swipe card.  The software is available and the card should not allow a person under the age of 21 to buy spirits or wine, but only beer, with a limit of six, eight or ten in a day.  One could pay by cash or card, but the ID card would have to be swiped to clear the sale.  I understand we have the technology to do this.  It would be expensive but the cost of dealing with some of the consequences of not having such control far outweigh the cost of such a card.Another area that must be dealt with is punishment, particularly of those who sell alcohol knowingly to people who should not obtain it.  I know the sale of alcohol Bill will deal with this more fundamentally with regard to the responsibility of publicans not to serve somebody who is already intoxicated and not to pass the problem outside their door to a disco, pub, nightclub or theatre where disorder can take place.  The Garda, courts and emergency services end up picking up the pieces.It is timely that Deputy McHugh raised the broader issue of how we deal with the attitudes of children and youths to alcohol, alternatives for them and changing the culture of how we deal with it.  Most children in secondary schools are now on their three-month summer holidays, with sunlight for 14 hours a day.  If they do not have something to do such as a job, an activity or a summer camp, idle hands make for trouble.  When a bunch of young fellows are together, no matter how good they are, it will lead to problems.We need to examine this matter in the context of how we support local communities, be it with scout dens or youth clubs.  It is money well spent.  The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs and the Minister, Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, have a role to play in this, as does the Minister for State with responsibility for children, Deputy Barry Andrews.  I wish everybody well.  I look forward to the more substantive sale of alcohol Bill which I see from the legislative paper is due at the end of the year.  The measures and amendments outlined in this Bill make sense and their implementation and enforcement will be important.
#NiallBlaneyIND	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-party	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-dob	unknown-#NiallBlaneyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I wish to share time with Deputy O'Connor.I am delighted to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on this Bill, which was presented by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, who was ably assisted by his Minister of State, Deputy Barry Andrews.  The Bill tackles one of the most serious scourges in our society and it will go a long way to challenge the roots of the problem with which we are faced but it will not tackle all of them.  That is not the fault of the Minister.Many older people had their first taste of alcohol at home when they were young and this phenomenon is often overlooked by society.  No matter what laws are introduced, no law can dictate to people how they deal with alcohol in the home.  This is a serious problem, which cannot be addressed in the legislation, but which must be addressed by society at large.  I agree wholeheartedly with the sentiments expressed by my constituency colleague, Deputy Joe McHugh, about the availability of youth services.  I take much of what he said on board because his background is in dealing with our youth.  Many youth centres throughout the State have difficulty staying in existence and, as he correctly pointed out, many young people nowadays face significant disadvantages.  However, if these centres were maintained and communities were encouraged to keep them open, young people would have many advantages.  Voluntary participation must be encouraged.Binge drinking and excessive alcohol consumption is a phenomenon affecting our society not only in large towns and cities, but also in rural areas like my own constituency in Donegal.  This scourge has grown visibly over the past ten to 20 years and it affects both adults and young people.  Ireland has one of the highest alcohol consumption levels in the EU, a statistic about which we should not be proud.  It was found in 2006 that the average consumption of alcohol of each person aged 15 and over was 20.8 units per week but 20% of those surveyed did not drink and, therefore, the figure is higher.There is a very evident binge drinking culture in Ireland among teenagers and those in their early 20s.  It is now a case of when a teenager takes his or her first drink as opposed to whether a teenager takes a drink at all.  It has become almost unacceptable among young people to resist the temptation of alcohol.  A 2007 Eurobarometer survey found that 34% of Irish drinkers consumed five or more alcoholic drinks in one sitting compared to the EU average of 10%.  These are stark figures by any standards.  There are many reasons for this shift in attitude among young people, which is probably another day's work, but it is not possible to discuss our attitude to alcohol without referring to parental responsibility.  While there is significant onus on us, as public representatives, to implement policy in this area in an effort to limit the issues relating to excess alcohol consumption, there is a similar onus on parents to take responsibility for their children's behaviour and whereabouts.  One only has to visit a local town in any constituency after a teenage disco to witness the effects of under age and binge drinking, which is an extremely unpleasant sight.However, it is important to acknowledge the problem is not confined to young people.  It is also causing havoc in the workplace among adults.  A recent IBEC survey reported that alcohol and alcohol-related illnesses were cited by 12% of companies as a cause of short-term absenteeism from work by males and by 4% of companies as a cause of short-term absenteeism from work by females.  The incidence of intoxication in a public place by both juveniles and adults has soared beyond belief in recent years.  One only has to read a local newspaper to see the number of people before our courts or on court lists in any given week for alcohol-related offences.  It has become a serious problem, which the Government does not take lightly, and I commend the Minister and his predecessor, the Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, on their swift action on this matter.  Practical changes included in the legislation will be effective.I refer to a number of the Bill's features.  The proposed reforms give effect to recommendations from the Government alcohol advisory group, which carried out an in-depth study of the issues surrounding excess alcohol consumption.  The main effect of the legislation is to tackle the increased visibility and availability of alcohol, while strengthening measures to tackle anti-social behaviour.  More power will be afforded to gardaí, in that they will be able remove alcohol from those in possession under the age of 18 in a place other than a place used as a private dwelling.  This will enhance previous legislation, which makes it illegal for those aged under 18 to buy alcohol or consume alcohol in any place outside the home or in another person's home where they are present by right or with permission.  The Garda will also be afforded the power to seize alcohol from any person where its presence is likely to result in annoyance, nuisance or breach of the peace.  If there is any resistance during seizure of alcohol in these circumstances, gardaí will have the power to arrest and charge the individual with an offence.  Fines will subsequently be imposed upon such individuals, with the maximum fine being €1,000.  The Garda will welcome this legislation with open arms because members have great difficulty policing our streets under current legislation.  This will give the force a firm hand and I welcome its introduction.One of the major concerns of the advisory group was the significant increase in recent years in the number of outlets selling alcohol.  Alcohol has never been more widely available.  The number of licences issued for the sale of spirits and beer increased by approximately 70% between 2001 and 2007, with the number of wine off-licences almost trebling over the same period.  The increase in the scale and frequency of alcohol promotions and price discounts, particularly in off-licences and large shopping outlets, is more worrying.  These issues compelled the advisory group to recommend a restriction on the supply and visibility of alcohol in mixed trading premises.  As a result, the Bill imposes a restriction on the sale of alcohol in off-licences and on-licences to the periods between 10.30 a.m. and 10 p.m. and 12.30 p.m. and 10 p.m. on Sundays and St. Patrick's Day.  This rightly abolishes the provision that permits the sale of alcohol from 7.30 a.m. in mixed trading premises such as supermarkets, convenience stores and petrol stations, thereby reducing the time alcohol is available in such premises by 29 hours per week, which is significant and must be welcomed.No single measure or change in law will solve the problem of excessive alcohol consumption but the Bill goes some of the way towards tackling the issues surrounding the problem.  A change in attitude is required.  As a nation, we must tackle this together and society, as a whole, must bring about that change.  We have never been more educated about the consequences of alcohol abuse, yet it is spiralling out of control.  It is easy to point the finger at our youth but, as adults, we must lead by example and prove that responsible consumption of alcohol and a respect for alcohol is acceptable and fashionable in society.

Last night, I listened as Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned nearly every supermarket in Marino.  While I will not do likewise in respect of Tallaght — that Deputy McHugh mentioned Tallaght in his contribution makes it easy for me to do so — Tallaght is no different than anywhere else in terms of this problem, a fact conveyed strongly during the debate.I appreciate those in my constituency of Dublin South-West, particularly in Tallaght, who contacted me on this issue, including the local SuperValu and Centra supermarkets, as well as one of the theatre clubs in Dublin city, the Sin Theatre Bar.  Such feedback is good.  Like others, I have received much correspondence from and many representations by individuals.We should compliment the current and previous Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputies Dermot Ahern and Brian Lenihan.  The former has shown particular interest in the legislation and the latter signalled his intent in this respect.  For some time, I have been impressed by the contribution made by the former Taoiseach and my fellow Dubliner, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to the debate.  We all appreciate the contributions he has made — I received many e-mails concerning his recent article in the Irish Independent — and the issues he has raised.We should remind ourselves that the Bill originated amid the desire to address what many viewed as the problem of under age and binge drinking.  The Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, made a fair point, namely, young people are not the only people involved.  We were all young once and everyone faced challenges.  However, there are problems.  With a few exceptions during my youth, I have tended to avoid drinking, but I am not a teetotaller.  If this means I am leading a sad life, I apologise, but it has given me a perspective on the issue.  People should be able to go out and enjoy themselves in bars or nightclubs or via purchasing alcohol at off-licences without causing problems.  As politicians, we all know that, for many communities, it is an issue of young people in particular engaging in drinking and causing disruption after leaving pubs, nightclubs or local take-aways.  These matters are being brought to the fore and require attention.We all know of our communities' horror stories of crime and serious assaults.  How often have we heard of murder cases in which alcohol has obviously played a considerable role?  Everyone in society should be concerned about it.  In terms of drinking, I am from a generation in which the John Wayne "The Quiet Man" image of Ireland was all the rage.  It is our image abroad.  While that is fair enough, we should try to correct the problem, which has recently become connected to crime and violence.Deputy O'Mahony mentioned that one does not experience this abroad.  I was impressed by his brave statement as a prominent GAA personality.  I wish him well in that regard, at least until County Dublin meets County Mayo this year.  He discussed advertising in the GAA, welcome comments given his status.  The GAA must address those challenges.Concerning below cost selling and selling in supermarkets, I have taken on board the issues brought to my attention by local supermarkets.  A reasonable point was made, namely, one can go around many supermarkets and off-licences and discover that a can of beer is cheaper than a mineral can.  Something must be wrong with the system.  The Minister is correct to listen to concerns in this regard.  While every Deputy looks forward to more substantive legislation to address the issue, signalling this clear problem to the Minister is pertinent to the Bill before the House.A number of Deputies discussed underage drinking and IDs.  While a national ID system is a sensitive issue and incurs calls from civil liberties groups, I routinely carry ID just in case I meet someone who does not know me while I am travelling around my constituency.

Clear consideration should be given to the question of IDs.  People who do not look their ages go into off-licences and pubs.  We should support the obligation to present a proper ID.  The Minister is considering this matter, a nettle that has not always been grasped but should be now.I will not criticise young people, as we were all young once.  During my adult life, I have spent a great deal of time as a youth worker.  I often mention that my last real job was with the National Youth Federation, for which reason I sympathise with those tackling these issues.  I will not blame young people, but we should be responsible and I am not afraid to state that more control should be brought to bear on IDs.Many supermarkets in my constituency and elsewhere are concerned by some aspects of the legislation.  For example, they are confused by the temporary closure orders and the question of objections to the renewal of licences.  Physical problems are, according to supermarkets, presented by the Bill's measures in respect of the structural separation of alcohol products from other products in mixed use trading premises.  I hope the Minister will continue to examine this issue.  In recent weeks, efforts have been made to consider certain issues that have been brought to his attention and he has made relevant announcements.  As the Bill moves onto Committee Stage and amendments are tabled, much attention will be paid to those issues.

All Deputies have received representations in respect of theatre licences.While I support the aim of the legislation, we must remember the point from which we started, namely, an attempt to address the under-age and binge drinking problem in society.  The Bill's remit is wider, but other issues are of concern to interest groups and we should listen carefully to their comments and accommodate them where possible.  We are all trying to achieve the enactment of good legislation which will enable us to make progress on the issues that are of concern to our communities.

#OliviaMitchell	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-party	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-dob	unknown-#OliviaMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	240	I, too, welcome the opportunity to speak on this Bill, although it is not the first Bill dealing with the issue of alcohol on which I have spoken.  It seems we have a great deal of law covering the sale and excessive consumption of alcohol, drink driving and so on, but there is a lack of enforcement.  One of the areas in which there is a serious lack enforcement is maintaining public order.  Public order offences generally, although not exclusively, tend to be associated with underage drinking, certainly in the past decade or so.  We tended not to take such breaches seriously.  There was a tolerance and acceptance of it; people took the view, "sure they are only drinking like we do ourselves and they have to learn somewhere".  They have learned that in the fields, open spaces and laneways and have caused major problems in terms of intimidating and frightening people, particularly old people.  The problem has escalated to more serious vandalism and crime.  I hope this legislation indicates an intention to be serious about stamping out public order offences, particularly when children are young.  It is unforgivable that children as young as 12 are out drinking, particularly now in the summer when the weather has improved.Other concerns related to excessive drinking include health and other societal issues, but the issue in question is specifically public order.  I heard the Minister say during a radio interview yesterday that it is intended to codify all the legislation in this area.  I welcome that move.  I presume it will also include the legislation on the alcohol limit for drivers.  The raft of legislation in this area is complex and all we are doing is making many lawyers rich.  We are producing bad legislation because some provisions are inconsistent and, in many cases, contradictory.  It is probably not surprising that the gardaí do not enforce many of our laws; there are so many of them.The raft of legislation in this area must cause a major headache for gardaí right up to the Judiciary.  Despite that, great frustration in this regard is experienced at local level.  Councillors, in particular, bear the brunt of the dissatisfaction of members of the public over the apparent inability of the Garda to stamp out unacceptable social behaviour.  Some years ago we were told the solution was to pass more by-laws to ensure that people were not permitted to drink in parks and open spaces and that the Garda would be empowered to act on foot of such by-laws.  However, as soon as those by-laws were passed, there was some other barrier to enforcement of the law.I remember in the 1990s, prior to my time in this House, when we thought we had cracked this problem with the introduction of legislation under which the Garda were given powers to move on crowds, but that too failed to fulfil its promise.  Now we are again examining more measures.  It remains to be seen if these measures are the ones we need.  The nub of the problem as to why we have so much legislation and yet the problem does not seem to have been solved is that we do not know the cause of why Irish people drink so much.  Clearly, we drink more than other nations.  There is no gainsaying that, but until we know why that is the case it is hard to find a solution to the problem.Whatever the cause, there can be no tolerance of crime, vandalism or any other drink-related anti-social behaviour.  The problem is escalating because we have been so tolerant of it in the past.  It is now endemic.  Members, whether they come from the most rural or most urban area, report that the problems experienced are more or less the same.  There must be zero tolerance of drunken behaviour.  Whatever damage people do to themselves in their own homes, there can be no tolerance for drunken behaviour once it begins to impact on the quality of other people's lives and their right to enjoy a peaceful and non-threatening environment outdoors in parks and cities, as well as in their homes, because people are often attacked in their homes.  I feel sorry for people who live in end houses because they seem to be persecuted by marauding gangs at night, pelting stones at their houses and breaking windows.  We hear heartbreaking stories from people who suffer such anti-social behaviour week in week out.  In the period between summer and Hallowe'en, life is hell for people who live in an end house or near an open space or laneway.  To the extent that this legislation seeks to enforce the peace and maintain public order, I welcome it and I hope that this time we get it right.There is a second stream to this Bill, involving measures that fall broadly into the prohibition area.  They do not quite prohibit the consumption of alcohol, but they go down the road of prohibition, making alcohol more difficult to get, reducing the hours premises are open, locking it away and making it dearer.  These measures are not aimed only at underage drinkers, but will impact on all responsible adults.  I have serious doubts as to whether these measures will have any impact on the problem we are trying to address.  Perhaps initially there will be a drop in sales but people will quickly adjust to altered closing hours and so on.  I suspect all we will achieve is inconvenience for responsible drinkers and expense for retailers.  I make this point not to speak on behalf of any vested interest, but because prohibition has never worked and I do not believe these prohibitive measures will either, particularly when they are imposed on a population which has a predisposition towards drinking to excess.When one examines the evidence here and elsewhere, it is difficult to see that making alcohol less available or more difficult to get will reduce excessive drinking.  In countries with almost complete and easy availability of alcohol at any time and in any premises, they do not drink like we do, yet in countries where there is a strict regime of access to alcohol, there are serious alcohol problems.  I am thinking of some of the Nordic countries.  Neither does the price of alcohol seem to determine how much we drink.  Again, the experience here and elsewhere shows a correlation between cheap drink and relaxed drinking habits and between dear drink and serious alcohol problems.  I am aware representations were made by various retailers, but we must be careful not to be drawn into arguments about below low cost selling and so on and then make decisions based on arguments that are really about competition between different types of outlets, whether it be the multiples, the low cost German retailers or RGDATA type members.I do not know what are the cultural influences that cause us to drink more or how we can counteract them, but I suspect that going down the prohibition route is not the way to go.  However, there is one group in respect of whom I most certainly support an absolute and complete prohibition and that is underage drinkers.  This is where we can make a change by at least postponing access to alcohol.  Such a change might allow their brain cells to develop normally, even up to 18 years of age, and might reduce anti-social behaviour and that ultimately might produce a cultural change if young people can be diverted into other appropriate forms of entertainment.  It is absolutely unforgivable to sell alcohol to minors or buy it for them.  We should pursue addressing that issue to the end.  To buy alcohol for minors amounts to child abuse.  No measures to tackle such abuse are too stringent or extreme.It is clear that our children have absolutely no difficulty getting alcohol.  We see them in our green spaces, parks and laneways drinking all summer long between now and Hallowe'en.  Their conduct is characterised by drunkenness, raucous behaviour, open fornication in the fields, vandalism and joining rampaging mobs who terrorise innocent citizens and leave scenes of litter, broken glass and condoms in places where we are supposed to able to bring small children to play.  It is intolerable and citizens rightly demand a better standard of enforcement against such behaviour.  The tragedy is that in many cases the children we see drinking at all hours of the day and night are as young as 12 or 13.It is not only young people who engage in such behaviour, and I do not want to overstate that it is always young people who are involved, but too many of them do engage in it and it is the worst possible start in life for them.  Most of them survive having engaged in such behaviour and become responsible citizens, but too many are swallowed up by this culture of irresponsible, brutish drunken behaviour and lose respect even for themselves, never mind others.The one measure that can stop underage drinking and is supported by evidence throughout the world, which is absent from the Bill, is a national identity card system.  It is incomprehensible that this one, fail-safe measure continues to be resisted.  All the arguments against such a scheme — that it is a right-wing proposal that is restrictive of personal freedoms and so on — have been refuted.  On the contrary, it protects personal freedoms and may protect our children.  There is a myriad of good reasons for the use of identification cards, such as ease of travel, improved efficiency of administration of all State services, reduced fraud and, crucially, as an anti-terrorism tool.  However, none of these is more important than the compelling need to protect our children from excessive and unsupervised drinking.The existing voluntary scheme involving the Garda identification card is an absolute farce.  It has no standing among young people and offers no protection either to them or to alcohol retailers.  Every teenager in the State knows how to acquire a fake identification card.  This has been the position for years and it has spawned a huge industry for replacement birth certificates and passports, with a sudden increase in the number of lost passports.  There are undoubtedly other dubious spin-offs of which we are not even aware.The Bill introduces the concept of test purchasing.  I have no objection to this provision, which seems a reasonable proposal in the absence of an effective identification card scheme.  However, it is an acknowledgement that shopkeepers and off-licence owners can be fooled and that the current Garda identification card scheme offers no protection.We could stop the sale of alcohol to young people overnight via the introduction of an official, non-reproducible card containing a computer chip with personal information.  This Bill is concerned with curtailing anti-social behaviour associated with alcohol, most of which involves underage drinking.  The single most efficient measure in this regard is the introduction of an official identification card.  It would leave sales outlets, which receive so much criticism, with absolutely no excuses.  I am confident such a scheme will eventually be introduced, but this Bill represents a missed opportunity to do so.  We cannot continue to ignore a measure that would undoubtedly be effective.The Bill contains measures I welcome, some of them dealing with inadequacies in earlier legislation.  I welcome the provisions which give gardaí powers to seize alcohol and to anticipate public order offences by requiring offenders to desist from drinking where the consumption of alcohol can reasonably be expected to lead to a crime.  The absence of legislation allowing for this type of anticipation of crime was one of the issues which tied the hands of gardaí in the past in regard to public order offences.  There was no point in residents reporting incidents of underage drinking and anti-social behaviour because it was necessary for gardaí to witness the offence being perpetrated in order for action to be taken.  This will be a useful measure until such times as gangs of young drinkers realise they cannot continue to behave with impunity and that the Garda, with the co-operation of local communities, is serious about enforcing the law.I welcome the outbreak of common sense in respect of the amendments which the Minister has either introduced himself or accepted from the Opposition.  These include the changes in regard to the sale of wine, the operation of early houses and the code of practice measures that will be implemented on a trial basis by retailers.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	241	The wide availability of alcohol in our society has led to many social problems.  Easy access to alcohol in shops, petrol stations and supermarkets is contributing to underage and binge drinking.  Last year's Eurobarometer survey found that 34%of Irish drinkers engage in binge drinking more than once a week, compared to an EU average of 10%.  This illustrates the extent of the problem in this country.Walking into most shops, the first item that greets one is the display of wine or beer.  I welcome the proposal regarding the separation of alcohol products from the general retail area.  One often sees supermarket shoppers putting alcohol in their trolleys before they even look at the food.  I would go further and argue that alcohol displays in shop windows should be outlawed.I support the proposals to restrict the hours of sale of off-licences to between 10.30 a.m. and 10 p.m.  This will help to reduce the number of public order offences.  However, limiting opening hours for licensed premises on Sunday nights will not go far in solving the problems associated with alcohol abuse.  According to the Garda, Sunday nights are usually quiet.A shortcoming of the Bill is the failure to provide for staggered closing times for nightclubs.  It makes little sense to allow customers of all such venues to emerge onto the streets at the same time, particularly in Dublin's busy city centre.  This will serve only to facilitate anti-social behaviour and make policing more difficult.  However, I welcome the proposal to increase the provision of closed circuit television systems on busy streets.  I also welcome the Minister's announcement that early houses will not be negatively affected by this legislation.  The early houses located near the quays in Dublin have been serving alcohol to dockers and shift workers for many generations and do not represent any threat to public order.The increase in licences granted in recent years suggests that profit-making comes before respect for people’s health and well-being.  Between 2003 and 2005, the number of shops selling alcohol increased by 35%.  However, in spite of the increased availability of alcohol, we are doing nothing to shake off our reputation as binge drinkers.  We now have 4,300 off-licences in the State, or one for every 750 adults. In my own local area, there are 19 licensed premises within five  minutes of each other.  We have made alcohol so easily accessible that we should not be shocked at the extent of anti-social behaviour in our communities.I welcome the move to apply the same rules to wine retailers' licences as pertain to beer and sprit licences.  I agree that all types of alcohol sales should require District Court certificates.  Deputy Mitchell and other Members spoke about the absence of an effective identification card scheme.  Many underage people gain access to nightclubs using another person's identification card.  This is a serious problem and action must be taken to curb it.I am disappointed that the Bill does not implement expert recommendations on the labelling of alcohol products in a manner similar to the labelling of tobacco.  Messages warning of the potential damage to health caused by alcohol would encourage people to reconsider the volume of alcohol they consume.  It is particularly important that young people are made aware of the health issues.As a parent, I welcome the provision allowing gardaí to seize alcohol from individuals who appear to be under 18 years of age.  The introduction of on-the-spot fines for people found to be intoxicated or disorderly in a public place is a move in the right direction.  However, similar penalties already exist but seem to have been forgotten.  The State has an important role to play in ensuring licensing laws are enforced and that public order legislation is adequate and effective.  Garda juvenile liaison officers do a great job but they cannot be made fully responsible for the behaviour of our young people.  The bottom line is that individuals and parents must be responsible for their own use or abuse of alcohol.  I am frequently shocked to observe young people intoxicated as they leave their own homes.  I am confident they have not obtained this alcohol from a pub or off-licence but rather that it is freely available to them in their homes.At the end of the summer, 15 and 16 year olds who have obtained their junior certificate results will want to celebrate their success.  We must ensure there is a range of alcohol-free venues in which children can socialise.  It is wrong that young people going into these alcohol venues are charged outrageous entrance fees and between €4 and €5 for a bottle of water or soft drinks.  This is a growing problem that needs to be addressed.  Given that we speak about the need for areas in which children can enjoy themselves this is one that should be examined.

All rural social scheme participants who are interested in renewing their place on the scheme for the coming year are required to complete the revised 2008-09 renewal form and provide documentary evidence that they are engaged in either a farming or a fishing activity.  In the case of a fisherperson, a copy of a relevant licence or permit must be provided with their renewal form.The scheme is currently available to a wide variety of persons engaged in fishing activity.  Fisherpersons that meet any of the following criteria may be eligible to participate in the rural social scheme: a self-employed fisherperson on a fishing boat, which has been entered in the register of fishing boats and a self-employed fisherperson whose boat has been issued with a pot fishing licence.  The Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resources introduced this for small fishing boats such as currachs which traditionally have fished for lobster and were mainly unlicensed; a self-employed fisherperson who has been issued with a commercial eel fishing licence from one of the seven regional fisheries boards; a self-employed fisherperson who has been issued with a dredging licence for shellfish from one of the seven regional fisheries boards; holders of an aquaculture licence issued by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources; permit holders for shell fishing issued by a registered co-operative; and a self-employed fisherperson who held a commercial salmon fishing licence that issued from one of the seven regional fisheries boards.However, it should be noted that this latter category has not applied to new applicants since 26 July 2007.  The salmon hardship scheme had not been finalised by the rural social scheme renewal date in 2007 and an exception was made to allow participants holding a commercial salmon fishing licence at that time to renew their 2007-08 contract.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.For those existing participants who have still not received compensation under the salmon hardship scheme I am making a further exception for the 2008-09 contract year by allowing them to renew their contract again provided they satisfy all other conditions.  This category is being kept under review and local implementing bodies will be able to advise those participants of any further updates.Currently there is a provision for 2,600 participant places on the RSS, all of which have been taken up and quotas have been assigned to each of the implementing bodies.I am fully aware of the current situation regarding the fishing community, however, I am not considering a further expansion or revision of the rural social scheme at this time.  I advise anyone who may be interested in joining the RSS to contact their local implementing body which have been encouraged to form a waiting list of suitable eligible applicants to fill vacancies as they arise on the scheme.

Costs have increased by 40% due to the increased cost of fuel.  There are many in the fishing industry whose accounts have been taken from the previous year.  Also, they are not in receipt of job seeker's allowance.  Given that funding of €214 million has been allocated to the rural social scheme I ask the Minister to create a scheme that will allow more flexibility for fishermen to participate in it, particularly the self-employed who cannot go on job seeker's allowance because they are employed and whose accounts are taken from the previous year, otherwise the industry will not exist in a year's time.  I ask the Minister to at least give them some help in the short term until the fuel crisis is over.

I suggest the Deputy raise that matter with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.  I must have some way of gauging a person's income, the reason for which is simple.  There are only 2,600 places and we want to direct them towards those on low income.  For example, there could be a fisherperson who had other business interests or whose spouse or partner had a large income.  In all of these schemes family income is taken into account.  It would be wrong that such a person could get on the scheme to the exclusion of a person on a much lower income.  Therefore there must be some way of gauging a person's income.  If there is a problem with the means test, I suggest the Deputy take it up with the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I wish to ask a straight question in regard to the rural social scheme.  Is a person with a herd number eligible for the rural social scheme?  Has the Department changed the criteria in respect of the scheme?  Those in receipt of the rural social scheme received a letter today in which they were asked to give evidence that they are actively farming.  If there are changes in regard to eligibility for the scheme will the Minister please outline them to the House?

Initially we assumed that if one had a herd number one was an active farmer.  I recall that somebody in the Deputy's county wrote to the Department complaining that a person in receipt of the rural social scheme was not a farmer, that the herd number was inactive and long dead.  The person had no cattle or sheep but had the herd number.  That issue posed a dilemma.  Reluctantly, the criteria had to be changed, and we had to specify that the person had to be an active farmer.

On the form one must prove, in any one of four ways, that one is an active farmer.  For example, a letter from the DVO stating that one has an active herd number, that is, the DVO has a record of one having stock, would suffice.  Also a copy of one's area aid application for the current year would suffice.  If the person has a problem I suggest he or she gets in touch with the Department.  If one can prove one is an active farmer, genuinely farming, I promise there will be no problem.  Some people thought they had to comply with the four criteria.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	255	The programme in question showed instances of the availability of drugs in a number of locations, indicating a level of demand for these drugs.  However, I do not think it produced evidence of any new issues that we are not already aware of and that we are not currently working to address through the national drugs strategy.In terms of robust evidence of the drug situation in Ireland, I would place much greater emphasis on the results of the All-Island Drug Prevalence Surveys, carried out in 2002-03 and 2006-07 by the national advisory committee on drugs, NACD, in conjunction with its colleagues in Northern Ireland.  Comparisons between the two surveys indicate that the drug problem facing the country is changing to a degree.Evidence from the first bulletin of the 2006-07 prevalence survey, launched in February 2008, indicates that while rates of lifetime and recent, last year, overall illegal drug misuse have increased, the level of current illegal drug use has stabilised.  Bulletin 2 of the survey, which I launched yesterday, indicates there are variations between the different regions of the country, with prevalence rates tending to be higher across all age groups in the east, roughly from Dundalk to Cork.The increase in lifetime use for all drugs was expected given that older people tend to have less exposure to and usage of drugs over their lifetimes and that illegal drug use is primarily a youth or younger adult phenomenon.  Lifetime prevalence rates are likely to increase for a considerable period of time as older people, who have never encountered drugs, exit the survey cohort on reaching 65 years of age and are replaced by teenagers coming into the survey age range.  The increase in last year use is of more concern and it emphasises the challenging task we continue to face in tackling problem drug use.  Meanwhile, the overall stabilisation in last month use is to be welcomed and I am hopeful that, with the continuing valuable work being done through the national drugs strategy, this trend will continue.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.With respect to the suggested ease of availability, I emphasise that the Garda and the customs service of the Revenue Commissioners, as acknowledged in the programme, have been very successful in recent times in regard to the numbers of seizures they are making, the quantity of drugs being seized and number of convictions being obtained.  This is reflected, for example, in the 125 kg of heroin seized last year by the Garda with seizures at a similar level continuing this year.  Both these services are using an intelligence-led approach to interrupt supply.I fully accept that our approach to tackling the drug problem must involve a combination of demand reduction and supply reduction measures.  Our focus in terms of demand reduction is primarily on the areas of treatment, rehabilitation and prevention.  It is clear from the research outcome study in Ireland, ROSIE, carried out by the NACD, that treatment has a direct impact on demand for drugs with a significant reduction in the usage of drugs reported by those entering and staying engaged in treatment.  Overall numbers in treatment now stand at approximately 12,700, with 8,600 of those in receipt of methadone.  Successful engagement with treatment not only has significant benefits for the individual but also for their families, their wider communities and for society at large.  Meanwhile, we are progressing the implementation of the recommendations of the working group on drugs rehabilitation and I envisage significant progress in that regard in the coming years.As regards prevention, the national drugs strategy has focused in particular on education initiatives such as Walk Tall and the social personal health programme, SPHE, which are now in place in all schools, at primary and second level.  Last February, the HSE launched a new national drugs awareness campaign focused on cocaine.  In this context, I am also now making funding of €500,000 available for awareness initiatives at drug task force level to dovetail with the campaign at national level.  This initiative will augment the many existing drug task force projects that are focused on prevention.  Furthermore, around €20 million in current and capital funding will be provided this year under the young people's facilities and services fund, which aims to divert ten to 21 year olds away from involvement with drugs.Finally, as the Deputy is aware, the new national drugs strategy, which is being formulated for the period 2009-16, will continue to combine supply reduction and demand reduction measures, with the aim of achieving the optimum balance.  I envisage that the new strategy will have a significant emphasis on prevention, combined with treatment and rehabilitation measures to aid those already involved with drugs.  At the same time, the drugs problem is a global issue and there will always be a need to continue to have a focus on supply reduction.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I congratulate the Minister of State, Deputy Curran, on his appointment and wish him well in his new portfolio, which is a very challenging one.  I am sure he will approach it in his own capable way.The matter in hand came to light through an excellent programme from the TV3 series, "Undercover Ireland" by Brian O'Donovan and subsequent articles in the Irish Independent and the Sunday Independent.  As I understand it, there are two pillars under which drugs were to be challenged; one being a reduction in supply, with the second pillar relating to reducing the demand.  The Garda is finding it difficult to tackle the first pillar but I congratulate it on the efforts it is making.  The Government is failing badly in terms of creating greater awareness of drug use.  We are not using the various groups of people that are available to help us to highlight the threat of drugs.  Cocaine use has doubled since 2003 and one in four Irish adults takes drugs.  The reality is that we are not winning the war on drugs and all the media messages we get tell us that.  My contention is that we are not using the existing facilities and the people who can help to the best advantage.  When or how will the Minister of State address the matter?  Will he use all the national sporting organisations, local authorities and housing agencies to work together to highlight the drugs problem?  Everything I see in the media currently contradicts the Minister of State’s assertion that we are winning the war.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	257	I thank Deputy Wall for his kind comments at the outset.  Prevention and awareness are two different aspects of the problem.  We work with local authorities and sporting organisations.  They play a key role, primarily from the point of view of being a deterrent.  Local authorities work with soccer and GAA clubs, among other groups, through the young people's facilities and services fund on programmes that aim to divert young people away from drugs.Awareness falls into a couple of main categories.  Most of the awareness campaigns that we run are through the education system.  I refer to the SPHE and the Walk Tall programmes in schools.  In addition, we have run public awareness campaigns, for example, on cocaine.  This year the Department will spend €500,000 through local drugs task forces to deal with the dangers of cocaine use in local projects.  It is not fair to say we are not working with sporting organisations and national bodies.  Perhaps the manner in which we work with them is not necessarily highlighted but the involvement is evident through the work of the local drugs task forces to help divert people away from the drug culture.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	258	I thank Deputy Ring for asking this question because since I was landed into the Department, that is what I have been occupied with in recent weeks.As part of the process of developing the next national drugs strategy to cover the period 2009 to 2016, the steering group chaired by my Department, which is overseeing the process, is currently completing a comprehensive series of consultation meetings.  I am attending as many of those meetings as possible, as I see them as a key part of the process of developing a new strategy.  The consultation process includes public consultation meetings at 15 locations nationally; written and e-mail submissions; meetings with relevant Departments and statutory agencies; meetings with key sectoral groups and organisations; focus group meetings; and engagement with the Oireachtas.  All 15 public consultation meetings have now been held, with reports on all — except the final meeting in Croke Park — now available on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.  The report from this session will be available within the next week.  The feedback received from attendees at those sessions has been favourable and people felt that there was good interaction, with ample opportunity to air their views and opinions.The meetings sought to identify the concerns of individuals and communities on drugs, the successes of the existing strategy and the gaps that need to be addressed with a view to identifying what the main priorities should be for the new strategy.  While there were interesting regional variations, there was a reasonably significant level of consistency in the views expressed at the meetings.  Briefly, some of the concerns identified included the level of heroin use outside Dublin and the availability of drugs services generally outside Dublin, addiction to prescription and over-the-counter drugs, the level of acceptance of alcohol abuse in Ireland and the importance of engaging and supporting families, as well as family intimidation in some communities from drug dealers.In terms of what works well, the following are some of the issues that were identified, increased drug seizures; increased levels of funding that have been provided in recent years, particularly for community-based initiatives; integrated services — where they are in place they appear to work well; the community-partnership approach was also seen to work well; community employment schemes that target recovering drug users; and various individual initiatives in different areas.  A number of priorities for the future were identified and they included prevention measures in out-of-school settings as well as in schools; and an increased range and availability of treatment services, with a continuum of care for individuals and an integrated multi-agency approach.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.They also include more widespread availability of methadone, with options to move on from this treatment; a greater focus on rehabilitation of problem drug users; more family support measures; and a more integrated approach to the problems of illicit drugs and alcohol, with some favouring a joint strategy.With regard to the other elements of the consultation process, the Deputy should note that more than 120 submissions by e-mail and in writing have been received from various organisations and individuals.  The closing date for receipt of submissions is next Monday, 30 June 2008.Most of the meetings with Departments and agencies have been held at this stage, and the steering group has started to meet with key sectoral groups and focus groups.  All in all, it is hoped to have the overall consultation process, which will involve about 45 meetings in total, completed by mid-July.  Meanwhile, I encourage Oireachtas Members to make an input into the process in their capacity as elected representatives.  I am conscious that the current strategy grew out of a political consensus in the late 1990s and I would welcome a continuation of that broad approach.  Last week, I attended a debate in the Seanad that afforded Senators an opportunity to contribute to the process and I will meet with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 24 September to hear the views of its members.  The views of Deputies and Senators will continue to be welcome as the strategy is formulated in the coming months.  Following the end of the overall consultation process, work on the finalisation of proposals will continue with a view to having a new strategy developed by the end of the year.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	259	I congratulate Deputy Curran and wish him well on his appointment.  He has a very challenging time ahead given what we heard from the report of the national advisory committee yesterday.  The percentage of people in the west of Ireland using drugs has increased from 12.5% in 2002 and 2003 to 23%.  On the east coast 38% of people are using drugs.  The most staggering results that emerged yesterday is that 50% of young people in Ireland admitted to taking drugs compared with 40% of young people in America.  We have a more serious problem than America.  Did we ever think we would see the day?When will the draft strategy begin in earnest and when will it be in place?  Seven locations in the midlands have no drug treatment services.  What will be done to address that gap?  What does the Department propose to do about the Health Service Executive's cutbacks?  Will the Department have discussions with the Department of Health and Children?  What services will be provided between now and the end of the year to deal with the current crisis in drug taking?
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	260	I thank the Deputy.  The figures to which he referred are lifetime figures for anyone who has ever used a drug and they do not accurately represent what is happening.  We are more concerned with the figures for last month or last year.  I accept the point Deputy Ring made about the trend increasing outside the Dublin area.  The figures in the report published yesterday are very important because they also identify the different types of drug that are being used in different parts of the country.The consultation process is ongoing and we hope to conclude it by mid-July or the end of the month.  Apart from the public consultation meetings that took place prior to my appointment, I have attended many of the meetings.  The HSE is a key element in the equation.  We have met with the HSE and will meet with it again.  The role of the Department and my role as Minister of State is to co-ordinate the entire programme.  There are more than two pillars and more than a handful of service providers and that requires a co-ordinated approach.  The consultation process is due to finish before the summer.  The strategy is aimed at the period 2009 to 2016 and we hope it will be published sometime early next year.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	261	I am concerned about the lack of detox beds.  There is no dedicated service in Cavan, Laois, Leitrim, Longford, Offaly, Roscommon, Sligo, Tipperary north and Westmeath and something needs to be done.  We have a problem because the HSE is cutting back.  We need more treatment services because there is currently a lack of services.  I need a commitment from the Minister of State that he will talk to the HSE because when the Dáil closes down on 10 July it will make more cutbacks.  Something needs to be done.  There is no point pretending we do not have a problem.  We did that for too long.  We have a serious drug problem and we need to tackle it.  The previous national drugs strategy did not work and we need to implement the recommendations now to address the crisis that affects all sections of society.  The Garda needs to target some high profile people and bring them to court to show young people that it is not trendy to take drugs.

Perhaps aspects of it did not work but, nonetheless, significant successes are apparent.  On the Deputy's specific request, we are engaged in ongoing discussions with the HSE, and not just in the Deputy's area, as the strategy is a national one.  However, the Deputy's points are well made and were reflected in the consultation meetings we have had.

Is é an rud a léiríonn sin ná an easpa práinne atá leis an bhfochoiste seo agus an obair atá idir lámha acu.  Má thuigim i gceart an méid a dúirt an tAire, ní raibh ag an fochoiste ach cruinniú amháin ó bhunaíodh é i mí Aibreán seo caite.  Tá práinn mhór le gníomh gan mhoill.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	267	Against the background of the formulation of a new national drugs strategy for the period from 2009 to 2016, I have an open mind, at this stage, on a combined approach to tackling the problems associated with drugs and alcohol.  However, I favour exploiting the potential for synergies that exist in our current approaches.  In considering the five pillars of the national drugs strategy, it is clear there are considerable existing and potential synergies in the approach to drugs and alcohol across the areas of prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  Given that alcohol is a legal and regulated substance, the potential for synergies in the supply reduction area is, as the Deputy will appreciate, more limited.It is clear to me as a public representative, as Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy and as a father that people are increasingly exercised about the issue of alcohol use, and rightly so.  I am sure the Deputy is all too familiar with issues such as under-age drinking, binge drinking leading to potential public order problems and the levels of excessive drinking generally with the resultant health problems.  Alcohol is also seen as a gateway to the use of illicit drugs.As the Deputy will be aware, a steering group was established earlier this year to develop proposals and to make recommendations to me on a new national strategy.  The group, which is chaired by my Department, is conducting extensive consultations in this regard.  Public meetings at 15 locations were held as part of the consultations and I attended the last three, following my appointment.  At these meetings the question was posed as to whether synergies between alcohol and drugs policies can be improved, and whether a single substance misuse strategy is now appropriate in Ireland.  Generally the response favoured developing the potential for greater synergies as much as possible, with mixed views on whether there should be a fully combined substance misuse strategy.  However, the emphasis of attendees was on the need for a more co-ordinated approach, recognising the close links between the problems associated with drugs and alcohol, rather than on the details of the organisational and governance arrangements that might be put in place.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.My Department is also represented on the working group on alcohol and drugs which is chaired by the Department of Health and Children, and I am aware of its deliberations to date.  I hope to receive the recommendations of this working group in the autumn at a stage when they can be considered in the context of the finalisation of proposals for a new national drugs strategy.  Furthermore, my officials and I will meet the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Mary Wallace, next week to discuss the broad issues around the future approach to problems associated with alcohol and illicit drugs.  I am committed to developing the optimum approach to tackling the problems of substance abuse in the coming years and any strategies to be put in place will be aimed at achieving this.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I congratulate the Minister of State on his recent appointment.  Having listened to his reply, I am not sure that separating the misuse of alcohol is a good idea.  Alcohol and drugs misuse are closely connected and it makes sense to have a co-ordinated approach to tackling the problems such misuse creates.  What happened to the national alcohol policy that was introduced in 1996?  Action 19 of the national drugs strategy indicated that the early use of alcohol and drugs by young people coming to Garda attention would be followed by community policing, and health and social services intervention in order that the problem of drug misuse could be diagnosed early and hopefully halted.  Does the Minister of State believe this group has been effective in identifying young people at risk from alcohol and drug misuse, and providing early interventions?  I believe social services have failed to provide the aftercare and have not intervened in many of these cases, something which needs to be addressed.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	269	The issue of having a single policy has attracted considerable interest.  There would be one concern if we were to have a combined strategy for misuse.  How do we structure it and are the existing services such as local drugs task forces adequately resourced to deal with it?  Different people have different views, but the one message coming across loud at all the meetings was the point the Deputy made.  Everybody acknowledges that alcohol is the gateway drug to illicit drug use.  Our Department is represented on the working group on alcohol and drugs.  It is chaired by the Department of Health and Children and is due to report to us shortly.One final meeting that will be of critical importance and which is also part of our consultation for the next drug strategy will be between my Department and the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children with responsibility for the alcohol strategy, Deputy Wallace, next week.  From that meeting I can give Deputy Byrne some idea of how we are doing.  However, since it falls under two different Departments, where we go with it is not totally my call.  Whatever the final outcome, we need much closer relationships because there is no getting away from the point that alcohol is part of the drugs strategy.  Whether there will be two stand-alone strategies or a single one is up for debate and there are mixed views on where to go.  If Deputy Byrne wants, I will talk to her after that meeting next week.

Dá bhrí sin, i gcomhréir le forálacha Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003, tá fógra seolta agam faoi alt 15 den Acht chuig 21 comhlacht poiblí eile ag iarraidh orthu athbhreithniú a dhéanamh ar a gcuid scéimeanna agus dréachtscéim nua — a dara scéim teanga — a ullmhú agus a thíolacadh le daingniú laistigh de sé mhí.  Fágann sé seo go bhfuil beagnach 60 dréachtscéim teanga san iomlán á ullmhú faoi láthair.  Tá sonraí maidir leis na comhlachtaí poiblí a bhfuil scéimeanna aontaithe leo nó a bhfuil dréachtscéimeanna á n-ullmhú acu ar fáil ar shuíomh idirlín an choimisinéir teanga, www.coimisineir.ie.

Nach bhfuil na figiúirí sin suarach, agus trí bliana imithe?  Mar a dúirt an tAire ag an gcomhchoiste an lá deireanach, scríobh sé chuig 600 comhlacht maidir leis na dréachtrialacháin faoi alt 9 d'Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla 2003 ach ní bhfuair sé freagra ach as 20 dóibh.  An bhfuil na comhlachtaí éagsúla neamhshuimiúil san Acht?  An bhfuil siad ag iarraidh éalú óna ndualgais ó thaobh dréachtscéim, a nglacfaí ag an Roinn, a thíolacadh?

Is muidne a thionscnaíonn an t-éileamh le haghaidh scéimeanna, srl.  Is sinne a scríobhann chucu chun scéimeanna a iarradh.  Is fúinn atá sé.  Ar ndóigh, níl ach achmhainní áirithe taobh istigh den Roinn leis an obair seo a dhéanamh.  Is fearr é a dhéanamh go slachtmhar.  Má bhreathnaimid ar na comhlachtaí Stáit ar fad, feicimid go bhfuil baint an-bheag ag cuid acu leis an bpobal.  Tá baint an-mhór ag roinnt eagrais Stáit, ar nós an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh, an Roinn Talmhaíochta, Iascaigh agus Bia nó roinnt comhairlí contae, a bhíonn ag plé leis an bpobal go ginearálta, leis an Ghaeilge.  Mar shampla, bheadh i bhfad níos mó plé ag comhairlí contae ar nós Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe nó Comhairle Chontae Dhún na nGall leis an Ghaeilge ná mar a bheadh ag Comhairle Chontae Longfoirt.  Má bhreathnaimid ar an 141 comhlacht poiblí atá i gceist, beidh sé soiléir go bhfuil an cuid is mó dos na hoifigí tábhachtacha, ar nós Oifig na gCoimisinéirí Ioncaim nó an Roinn Gnóthaí Sóisialacha agus Teaghlaigh, istigh.  Baineann obair Oifig na gCoimisinéirí Ioncaim sin le gach éinne sa Stát.  Tá seans ann go bhfuil 60% nó 70% d'imeachtaí an Stáit clúdaithe le scéimeanna, ainneoin go bhfuil riar mhaith comhlachtaí Stáit — go leor acu comhlachtaí beaga — atá an-teoranta nach bhfuil clúdaithe faoi scéimeanna.  I ndáiríre, ní hiad na comhlachtaí nach bhfuil ag teacht leis.  Is dócha nach bhfuil na hachmhainní ag cuid acu daoine atá oilte a fháil chun déileála leis na scéimeanna seo.

Ní fios domsa go bhfuil éinne ann a dhiúltaigh plean a réiteach nuair a iarradh orthu sin a dhéanamh.  Maidir leis na húdaráis áitiúla, iarrfaidh mé ar oifigigh na Roinne liosta a sheoladh chuig an Teachta de na húdaráis áitiúla a bhfuil pleananna daingnithe acu.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	277	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 51 together.The young people's facilities and services fund, YPFSF, aims to assist in the development of youth facilities, including sport and recreational facilities, and services in disadvantaged areas where a significant drug problem exists or has the potential to develop.  The objective of the fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into these facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  The target group for the fund is ten to 21 year olds who are marginalised through a combination of risk factors relating to family background, environmental circumstances, educational disadvantage and involvement in crime or drugs etc.The fund operates in the 14 local drugs task force areas, 12 in Dublin, Bray and Cork, and in Galway, Limerick, Waterford and Carlow town.  Following an announcement earlier this year, the fund will be extended to Arklow, Athlone, Dundalk and Wexford in the coming months.  Since it was established in 1998, the Government has allocated over €150 million under the fund.  Over €66 million has been provided for capital developments, which include the building, upgrading, fit-out and refurbishment of approximately 220 youth and community facilities in the different target areas.  In 2008, current funding of the order of €17 million will be provided to support the employment of more than 350 youth and outreach workers, centre managers, sports development officers and administration staff.In this context, the Deputy should note that 24 sports development officers are currently being supported under the fund in the designated areas, including two in Limerick following a recent proposal from the Limerick regeneration agencies.  These officers use sport as a tool to engage young people in active recreation and leisure pursuits and facilities at the level to suit their needs.  The Deputy should also note that 13 "Football in the Community" development officers are also being employed under the fund, including four recently announced posts for Limerick city.  These posts are being co-funded by the FAI and, in the case of the nine posts in Dublin, by Dublin City Council.  A call for the development of further capital facilities in the amount of €4 million was announced earlier this year.  The young people's facilities and services fund development groups have submitted proposals for funding and these are under consideration at present.Overall, I believe the fund has had a very positive impact on communities since it commenced nearly ten years ago.  Over the years, the areas covered under the fund had been marked by a serious dearth of facilities and services and many of the clubs and community groups in those areas had traditionally not been able to access funding from other mainstream schemes to the same extent as more affluent areas.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Are the sports officers responsible to the local authorities or to the national organisations governing the particular sport involved, for example, soccer?  Is the FAI the only national organisation that has a link to the provision of training officers?  If so, why is this the case?  Why do the national organisations governing rugby, GAA or otherwise not have an input into ensuring a variety of sports for youngsters?Are there any RAPID areas that are not part of the local drugs task force areas and not in receipt of this funding?  If so, will the Minister consider applications in this regard and are such RAPID areas entitled to make such applications?

The FAI has embarked on this in its scheme.  However, it would be wrong to send out the signal that others do not.  I am aware that the GAA in Dublin has development officers.  Probably as a result of the structure of the GAA, there is only one GAA club in my village whereas there are several soccer clubs.  The GAA provides development officers who work with existing GAA clubs.  While it is a different model, we should not indicate that it is only soccer that has provided this linkage.  The officers are employed and work out of the local authorities rather than out of the FAI buildings.

As I have stated on a number of occasions, the Government is entitled, under Standing Orders, to send in any representative it wishes in regard to any matter.  I call the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Máire Hoctor, to reply.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	284	The Minister, Deputy Gormley, could not be present this afternoon owing to a prior arrangement.  He is in Cork attending a regional seminar on local government reform which was arranged a long time ago.  I am happy to deal with the issue and will outline to the Deputies the situation as it stands.As the Deputies are aware, Irish Ispat went into liquidation in June 2001, having been in difficulty for some time.  Initially, the liquidator took over the company's lease on lands and foreshore at Haulbowline Island, Cobh, County Cork.  The State, acting through the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in a co-ordinating role, took over custody of the site from the liquidator in June 2003, as mandated by Government.  The mandate required the Department to co-ordinate all legal actions in regard to the site and to cover issues such as ongoing site security, ongoing maintenance, other such issues arising once the site was vacated by the liquidator and also to enable a site investigation to be carried out to determine the best option, environmentally and economically, for site remediation.Steelworks have operated on Haulbowline since 1939 and at a time when such industrial activities were poorly regulated.  Inevitably, the nature of the activity generated very large quantities of hazardous wastes which were dumped on the island in an area which became known as the East Tip.  Since 2004 the Department, in complying with its mandate from Government, has co-ordinated all legal actions in relation to the site, carried out a comprehensive site investigation to determine the levels of contamination and remediation-development options at the site, set up ongoing environmental monitoring at established monitoring points, decontaminated and demolished the steelworks buildings and arranged for a site surface clearance contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited.  These steps have brought the site to a position where the Government can make an informed decision as to its future use and where a detailed risk assessment of the entire site with recommendations for the appropriate remediation required can be undertaken.The issue that has arisen relates to the uncovering by a subcontractor of sub-surface waste.  Sub-surface excavation of waste was not part of the Department's contract with Hammond Lane Limited.  Owing to the potential extent and nature of the waste, a lack of clarity around the minimum works required to remove this waste, the potentially wide range of practical measures that might be necessary to remove the risk of pollution and the fact that the removal or remedial works in a piecemeal fashion might cause environmental pollution, it was the considered view of the Department, following consultations with the Environmental Protection Agency and Cork County Council, that the required course of action in the short term would be to cap the exposed waste with inert slag material.  A detailed risk assessment of the entire site will be necessary once it is vacated on completion of the site surface clearance contract and when the Government has decided on the proposed future use of the site.This was not acceptable to one of Hammond Lane's subcontractors which expressed concern that liability might accrue to it as a consequence of any impact which the disturbed material might cause.  By way of reassurance and in the context of the then proximity of the end of the planned surface clearance works, the Department wrote to the contractor on 18 April 2008 advising that the back-filling approach was what was required.  It was stated that the management of the area which had been disturbed would fall to be determined by the Government in the context of the pending decision on the overall future of the site and the resultant more comprehensive remediation that might be required.  The contractor was also assured that it would not be expected to accept future liability.Despite these assurances and repeated instructions to stop unauthorised works relating to the sub-surface sludge pit, including by letter from the Chief State Solicitor on 23 May 2008, the contractor refused to leave the site and continued to operate without authorisation and in a piecemeal fashion, causing a potential threat to the environment.Following legal advice, the contract with Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited was terminated with immediate effect on 30 May 2008, with instructions to vacate the site by 5 p.m. Tuesday, 3 June 2008.  The subcontractors still refused to vacate the site and continued to operate without authorisation.  They only finally left the site following discussions with the main contractor, Hammond Lane Metal Company Limited, the only company with which the Department had a contractual relationship.The Department has already employed consultants to advise on any immediate environmental and health and safety issues posed by the unauthorised actions of the subcontractors and officials will be reviewing their proposals over the next few days and acting appropriately to ensure that any necessary steps are taken in the interim, pending a risk analysis of the entire site and determination by Government as to its future use.The Department is finalising a report to update the Government on the outcome of the extensive site investigation and the interim works carried out since 2004.  Decisions by Government on the future use of the site will determine the level and extent of further remediation required.I assure this House and local residents that the Department and other relevant agencies are properly engaged in the management of this legacy site in a manner that is consistent with good practice and the minimisation of risk to human health and the environment.  A coherent overall approach rather than piecemeal action, which could inadvertently cause problems to the local community and the environment, must be taken and that is the objective being pursued by the Minister and his Department.

I will call on Deputies in the order in which I received their questions, with Deputy Sherlock first.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	12986	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Will the Minister of State acknowledge that the projected cost of fully cleaning up the site is estimated to be in the region of €300 million and that this was a determining factor in the Government's decision to send a letter to the contractors on 18 April, as reported in today's Irish Examiner, stating that the required course of action would be to “cap the lagoon with inert slag material (or other such suitable available material), pending a detailed risk assessment of the entire site”?  The Government found out how much it would cost to clean up the site and is now seeking to spin the matter in such a way as to suggest that the subcontractors on the site were acting outside their station or ultra vires and is now seeking to put the blame on them.  When the Government realised that it had unearthed such a problem, it refused to acknowledge it and sought to cover it up.  Its intention, in the first instance, was never to fully assess and continue the works that are necessary on the site.  This is a bombshell to the people who reside in the vicinity of the site.  They thought that the Government was acting in good faith when it decided that the Haulbowline site would be cleared.  For the Government to state that the contract only covered above-surface works and not sub-surface works is an attempt to cover up the problem that exists from a subterranean point of view.  Its intention was never to expend the funds necessary to clean up the site and make it safe for those who reside and work in its vicinity.  I ask the Minister to specifically address the point in the letter dated 18 April 2008 because it is the most pertinent point relating to this issue.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	287	No such estimate has been reached yet in relation to this site.  The future use of the site will determine the nature of the rehabilitation and that has not been determined or even explored.  Costs were not the determining factor in this and, as I outlined in my response, the subcontractors were in breach of the contract in the work they were carrying out.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Two issues are at stake here, namely, public safety and the possibility of a cover-up.  In her response, the Minister of State said that sub-surface excavation of waste was not part of the Department's contract with Hammond Lane Limited owing to the potential extent and nature of the waste.  Does that imply that this material was not known about and was discovered by accident?  If so, serious concerns arise.  This is not a contracting issue, but a matter of public safety and a Government cover-up.What action has the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government taken today?  He is in Cork city at present attending to Green Party business in advance of next year's local elections.  Has he been to Ringaskiddy in his ministerial car? Has he been on the telephone to the Cork county manager and the chief executive of the Environmental Protection Agency and arranged a meeting with them to get this matter in hand?  Given his duty of care responsibilities, what plans does he have to reassure the local community and particularly staff working on the Haulbowline site regarding the future of the area and the greater harbour region?In her reply, the Minister of State referred to a risk assessment but such an assessment was carried out on the site six years ago.  What were the contents of that risk assessment?  Will the new risk assessment conflict with the one carried out in 2002 and will it give us different information?  Were the risks presenting referred to in the report published six years ago?  Where did that report go?  How accurate was that risk assessment in light of what we read in today's Irish Examiner?
On the "News at One" today, the Minister said he has had difficulties gathering information.  This week we witnessed a directive being implemented through a statutory instrument without the Minister coming before the House.  The Minister has a raft of options through which he can acquire the information he needs.  He can obtain it by circular letter, statutory instrument or directive.  There is no excuse for the Minister having difficulties getting information.  That is nonsense.  The Minister should consider her reply to this particular question.  In her response, the Minister of State spoke about how slag heaps are now being put back in.  Up to a number of years ago, there were a considerable number of slag heaps on this site.  I understand that several hundred tonnes of these were removed to provide the underlay for roadwork programmes.  One must ask where this slag has gone, particularly in respect of what is happening today.  Is this material in roads in Ireland or somewhere in Europe?  Has somebody gone away to examine where this material is located and whether is it safe?  In light of the mismanagement and inaccuracy of the health and safety information we received on this matter, this is a matter of importance that needs to be sorted out immediately.My own contacts in Haulbowline this afternoon have told me that there is no public or information notice there this evening telling members of the Naval Service or civilian staff who work on this site whether it safe for them to go to work tomorrow.

In her opening statement, she said that the Government carried out a comprehensive site investigation in 2004 to determine the levels of contamination at the site.  Did that investigation give the full extent of the contamination or have we discovered something new either today in the newspaper or when the German company wrote to the subcontractors telling them that it had uncovered high levels of contamination, including chromium 6?  Was that news to the Government or did it know about that in 2004 and the extent of the contamination?

That has not be determined yet.  Far more work must be done in respect of the full extent of that work and the future use of that site will determine the type of rehabilitation that will be carried out.  If it is for residential use in the future, a certain type of rehabilitation material will be used, whereas a different type of use for that particular site might determine a different type of rehabilitation material.

Could she tell me whether there is an aquifer under the site?  Could she tell me what she knows about the kind of material on the site?  Chromium 6, mercury, zinc and other materials have been mentioned.  What is there?  Is there leachate from the site?  We are told that there are unbounded lagoons.  Is there leachate from the site into the harbour?  Could the Minister of State assure us of the safety of naval personnel working and living within yards of this site?

All of us representatives from Cork have been involved in this case since the State took it over four or five years ago.  Does the Minister of State not accept we received assurances years ago that there were no serious hazardous waste problems with this site, that people in Cobh and Ringaskiddy had nothing about which to worry?  Now we are told in a newspaper story that the only work to establish what was happening at the site took place at surface level but anybody with a brain in his or her head knew the problem was underground, where waste material had been buried.

This is a very serious issue at the heart of Cork Harbour.  A couple of hundred yards from the site young people sail boats and Ireland's Naval Service headquarters are next door.  We are being told the Minister of State knew nothing of what was under the surface for five years after taking over a site that had been a steelworks.  Is that the case?  Is the Minister of State saying that until recently we knew nothing about what material was under the ground?The Minister of State said all hazardous waste had been exported to Germany.  Has other waste from the site been disposed of in Ireland?  If so, where?  Given the incompetence that has been shown in this issue, people will not believe the waste disposed of in Ireland is not contaminated.When did the Minister of State find out that chromium 6 was part of the waste material under Haulbowline?  Can she give me a date?  Has a Green Party Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government been in office for a year without telling anybody about it?  The Minister of State suggests we should come to a conclusion on how to deal with any hazardous material at the site only when we decide what to do with the site.  That is a secondary issue.  The first issue relates to human health and the environmental pollution of Cork harbour

#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	345	I wish to share two minutes of my time with Deputy Joe McHugh.  The need for funding for muscular dystrophy has been brought to my attention by a family who have two young sons, aged four and seven, with Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  After my initial contact with the family, all Oireachtas Members attended an information session on 9 April given by the representative association, Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, MDI, where all Members expressed support for and empathy with the families of the sufferers of this dreadful disease.  Prior to this meeting I had written to and received a response from Deputy Jimmy Devins, then the Minister of State with responsibility for disability and mental health.  The Minister of State said, "It was very positive that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has secured access for Irish children to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy registry in the UK, so that they can be considered for inclusion in the first systemic trial of this treatment."  However, the Minister of State went on to say there was no mechanism or budget for the Irish Government to fund UK health research, and recommended the matter be taken up by the Health Research Board, HRB.  He suggested that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland applied for joint funding but he admitted the organisation would have to compete with all other proposals and requests put for funding.  MDI made contact with the HRB, only to be told this year's funding was committed.  It received €50,000 through another channel within the HRB but it falls far short of the €1.5 million required.My aim in proposing this enabling legislation is to allow funding to cover research trials that are not taking place or available in Ireland for sufferers of such illnesses as muscular dystrophy.  The reasons the research does not take place may vary but inevitably it is because there are not enough people in the core group of sufferers, some 150 families, in this country to justify it.  Time is not on the side of these people.  We can directly fund operations in Great Ormond Street Hospital or in America and, given there was cross-party agreement on this issue, I ask that this funding be put in place.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	346	I record my appreciation to Deputy Doyle for raising this matter.  It took almost a week and a half for it to be accepted and I am delighted it has.  His persistence highlights the sense of urgency and immediacy for the families concerned.  Numbers form much of the basis for arguing which groups require financing but 150 families — a number which is growing — are affected by Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  In the Minister of State's previous role as chairman of a health board he would have been familiar with the issue.  Representations would have been made and there was a presentation to the Oireachtas joint committee on the issue.  In the meantime, the 18-year old son of one of the families which was lobbying approximately a year ago has passed away.  Families whose sons are aged eight, nine or ten are looking at a timeframe of maybe seven or eight years before they have to face a similar situation.I received a response to a parliamentary question this week indicating this Irish Government would not fund British research.  I know policy is policy and we must respect that.  At the same time we must be imaginative and there are other ways to ring-fence funding for these conditions.  The Government has indicated it would consider matching funding but the families do not have upwards of €750,000 to match the funding to achieve a total of €1.5 million.  Two families in my constituency have embarked on a crusade and raised upwards of €70,000 on their own from the community.  Their consciences would not be clear if the children pass away and they have not done their best.  They have lobbied politicians and are now out in the community and have raised €70,000 in four weeks.  We must assist them through transnational research.  We refer to co-operation, integration and working together.  It is not good enough for me to get a one line answer from the HSE, stating that the HSE does not fund British research, every time I table a question.  There is a transnational opportunity and a way around this.We cannot have families raising €70,000 off their own bat, with no assistance.  Their backs are against the wall and they know the children will die when they reach 18 years of age unless there is some intervention.  I ask the Minister of State for his indulgence.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	347	I recognise the concerns of Deputies Doyle and McHugh and that a number of presentations were made to the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I sympathise with the Deputies in respect of the one line response.  I will put the issue of transnational research to the HSE.I am pleased to take this opportunity to address the issue raised by the Deputies.  I wish to assure the Deputies that the Government is aware of the situation of families with children suffering from Duchenne muscular dystrophy.  While there are no guarantees with trialling new approaches to muscular dystrophy, I can understand the hopes of families for a medical advancement in this field.It is very positive that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland has secured access for Irish children to the Duchenne muscular dystrophy registry in the UK, so that they can be considered for inclusion in the first systemic trial of this treatment.  The Health Research Board comes under the aegis of the Department of Health and Children and is the lead agency in Ireland supporting and funding health research.  It provides funding, maintains health information systems and conducts research linked to national health priorities.  Researchers must be based in Ireland to qualify for funding under the Health Research Board's various schemes.  I have been advised that the funding of health research being carried out in the UK is not appropriate to the Good Friday Agreement, North-South Ministerial Council or the INTERREG programme.  Accordingly there is no mechanism for Irish Government funding of UK health research.I understand that Muscular Dystrophy Ireland held the first information day on advances in the care of Duchenne muscular dystrophy for families and doctors earlier this year.  The Government was pleased to be able to support Muscular Dystrophy Ireland by providing more than €9,000 under the national lottery towards the costs associated with the information day.Therapy services for adults with muscular dystrophy are generally delivered through primary care teams or community therapy services.  Due to relatively small numbers, staff are not dedicated to work solely with clients with muscular dystrophy.  The HSE advises me that the level of therapy staff employed in primary and continuing community care settings has increased significantly since the formation of the HSE.  In December 2007 there were 638 physiotherapy staff and 789 occupational therapy staff.  At April 2008, those staff numbers have increased to 670 and 796, respectively.  Therapy services for children with muscular dystrophy can be delivered through specialist disability providers or through primary and community care services.  Additional resources have been allocated to increase the level of multidisciplinary supports available to children with disabilities in the context of the implementation of the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.At present, the Disability Act 2005 gives children with disabilities under five years of age the right to an assessment of their health needs and a service statement outlining the services that will be provided.  In addition, the HSE is required to report annually to the Minister on levels of unmet, assessed needs.  The key HSE priorities for the future in developing primary care teams, home care packages and implementation of the Disability Act and the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act will lead to the ongoing development in multidisciplinary supports, which will benefit both children and adults with muscular dystrophy.In addition to those services, the HSE states that more than €2 million has been made available to date in 2008 to Muscular Dystrophy Ireland, a support organisation for individuals with muscular dystrophy and their families.  I wish to emphasise the Government's commitment to providing a high quality service to all people with a disability.  Having recently been appointed Minister of State with responsibility for equality, disability and mental health, it is my objective to move the disability agenda to a level which compares with the best in the world.  We will do so in partnership with all stakeholders.

It is a pity that someone from the Department of Transport cannot be here to hear the case I am making.The collapse of Mortons Circle Line bus service from Celbridge to Dublin has left a vacuum in the provision of transport services and severe difficulties will arise next week unless urgent action is taken.  The current difficulties were entirely predictable.  Bus Átha Cliath had a long-standing application for a change of route and an upgrade of frequencies before Mortons, which had a minimal service to Celbridge, launched an objection to the Bus Átha Cliath application and a counter claim.  The then Minister made a surprising decision, refusing the Bus Átha Cliath application and granting a licence to Mortons for 37 routes in and out of Celbridge.  This occurred in October 2006.  I warned that Mortons did not have the capacity to fulfil the licence requirements.  I suspected it was getting the licence to sell it on but that did not happen.Mortons never fulfilled the terms of the licence, only running on the prime time routes and cherrypicking.  Even then, it could not attract sufficient numbers to make that limited service viable.  The reason the company closed was that it could not get enough customers to make it financially viable.  This demonstrated the difficulties for a new entrant competing with a well-established service provider like Bus Átha Cliath.  I hope the reply will set the record straight on the claims by Mortons that it was crowded out by floods of Bus Átha Cliath buses.  In fact, Bus Átha Cliath was prevented from providing extra services to allow Mortons to get off the ground.  However, it never did get off the ground.  The old saying about the heat and the kitchen comes to mind.From next Monday, a sizeable number of citizens from Celbridge and Lucan and those along the route to Dublin will be left without a service.  They will be severely discommoded and many will be forced back into private cars on already heavily congested roads.  Others will not have that option.  An urgent solution is now required and is available.  I ask the Minister to request Bus Átha Cliath to step into the breach and provide a replacement service, at least on a temporary basis, to the people of Celbridge, Lucan and beyond.Bus Átha Cliath has the resources and capacity to do so but it needs the approval of the Minister.  I urge the Minister to include the cross-city service to Ballsbridge and Nutgrove, that was unique to the Mortons Circle Line service, in the solution.  This accommodated students from UCD and workers in the south of the city.  Although he is not present, the solution is available to the Minister and I hope he accepts the case I am making.  The Minister has a reputation as a man of action and I am confident he will demonstrate that by acting on this matter.  The solution is available.  Bus Átha Cliath has the resources available to fill the breach and not leave customers stranded next week.  Will the Minister request it to provide that service?
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	351	The Minister for Transport regrets very much the loss of employment and the loss of bus services in the Celbridge area arising from the withdrawal of the Circle Line services.  Any application for the introduction of new services to and from Celbridge will be urgently considered by the Department of Transport.This incident highlights what the Minister has stated since taking up office, that the bus licensing regime must be overhauled.  It underlines why the Minister initiated and brought the Dublin Transposition Authority Bill, currently in its final stages, to the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The next stage in this reform process is legislation to amend the Road Transport Act 1932 which provides the statutory basis for regulating the provision of public bus services by private bus operators.In accordance with the legislation, private bus operators apply to the Department for licences to operate scheduled bus passenger services within the State.  Dublin Bus is not subject to this licensing system.  However, the initiation or alteration of a bus service by the company is subject to compliance with a requirement to give advance notice to the Department and to compliance with the provisions of section 25 of the Transport Act 1958 concerning competition with licensed private operators.  It is therefore open to any operator to submit proposals to the Department of Transport concerning the provision of bus services in the Celbridge area.On 23 December 2002 Mortons Coaches Dublin Limited was issued with a licence to provide a bus passenger service on the Nutgrove-Celbridge-Nutgrove via city centre route.  Subsequently, the company applied for a significant increase of services and to operate them on a return basis on this route.  On 26 October 2006, the amended licence issued authorising the changes which would operate under the name Circle Line Bus Company, a subsidiary of Mortons Coaches Dublin Limited. The company made a number of complaints to the Department with regard to Dublin Bus services and these complaints have been the subject of ongoing communications between the Department of Transport, Dublin Bus and the company.  Dublin Bus had been operating in the Celbridge area prior to the granting of the licences to Mortons Coaches, and Dublin Bus advised the Department that it was conforming to its obligations with regard to its service authorisations.On 19 June 2008, the Department of Transport was advised that the Circle Line Bus Company was going into voluntary liquidation and that services operating from Celbridge would cease to operate from Friday, 27 June 2008.  I will pass on Deputy Stagg's comments to the Minister for Transport, who is unavoidably absent from the House.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	352	For many years, I have been campaigning for a dedicated law centre for Carlow run by the Free Legal Aid Board.  I welcome this opportunity to raise this important matter on behalf of the people of Carlow who need this service.The Legal Aid Board does a great deal of important work.  The many legal letters and negotiations it deals with for people are invaluable.  It provides legal advice, representations and services for those applying for asylum and it provides research for all organisations involved in the asylum process.  We are aware of the demand for legal aid in family law cases is increasing — it increased by 7% last year — in areas such as divorce, separation and child care cases.  The 17,500 people who were provided with services in 2006 and the 3,700 people who contacted the board looking for advice is testament to the role the board plays in the justice system.  However, Carlow is one of only three counties without a dedicated law centre.Carlow's legal advice centre only sits for a few hours twice a month, which is not good enough.  Carlow is a growing town and the county's population has increased from 46,000 in 2002 to more than 50,000 in 2006.  Carlow town had a 3% increase in its population during the same period.  We are bursting at the seams and we need a legal advice centre.Organisations in Carlow such as the South Leinster Rape Crisis Centre and Carlow Women's Aid have contacted me and other public representatives over the years.  They want this centre for the people of Carlow.  Imagine having no car and being separated, with two or three children and having to travel 24 or 25 miles to Carlow town by bus on a wet, ghastly day like today, looking for the services of the Legal Aid Board to find one has to sit in a room and wait for the service.  It is not good enough.  If we had a service in Carlow that was open five days a week, people could access it readily — the women and men of Carlow want it.The settlement pattern of County Carlow is spread out through many small towns and villages and there is a rural hinterland under the Blackstairs close to the Wexford border.  The clients who ring me and come to my clinics state they are desperate to get a service in Carlow town.  When one must wait several months to be means tested and see a solicitor, the long and time-consuming journeys from rural south Carlow to Kilkenny can eat up much time and disposable income in what are often difficult and traumatic lives for those in question.The Carlow legal aid centre has seven full-time employees.  We would like to squeeze some support from Kilkenny for Carlow.  The provision of such a service can be low cost.  I am certain that suitable premises could be shared by an existing service provider.  I ask the Minster to look favourably on this issue and this modest request.  It is in tight economic times that the services such as those provided by the Free Legal Aid Board come into greater focus.  Carlow must not be left out of the loop.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	353	On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter today.  The Minister is aware that the Deputy met his predecessor earlier this year and had a useful and thorough discussion of the issues arising, during which the Deputy had an opportunity to set out her concerns regarding access to civil legal aid services in Carlow.Civil legal aid services in Ireland are delivered and managed by the Legal Aid Board, in accordance with the provisions of the Civil Legal Aid Act and regulations.  The board's mandate is to provide a professional, efficient, cost-effective and accessible legal aid service and the Department works closely with the board at a strategic level to support it in delivering on this objective.  Of significance is the grant-in-aid provided to the board by the Department, which represents its primary source of funding.  The Minister is pleased to state this has increased substantially in recent years, by 40% since 2003.  The eligibility criteria for legal aid have also been updated and streamlined in recent years, greatly increasing the accessibility of the scheme to persons of modest means.While the funding provided is significant, there are undoubtedly many demands on the board's services and hence the efficient use of the resources available is of great importance.  The detailed management of these resources is a matter for the board to assess, taking into account the level of demand for services and the needs of its clients generally.  A key indicator at national and local level has been the waiting time for appointments with a solicitor and, while this would certainly not be the sole yardstick by which the board's services should be measured, it nevertheless represents an important strategic focus.  The additional resources provided in recent years have been of great assistance in addressing this question but, as I indicated on behalf of the Minister, the demands and the challenges of managing the service are considerable.In so far as the provision of services specifically in Carlow is concerned, the Minster would like to confirm for the information of the House that the board operates a part-time clinic in Carlow, which is supported by the full-time centre in Kilkenny.  The Minister understands the Carlow clinic is normally held on the first and last Fridays of every month or by appointment as necessary.  In 2007, 176 clients of the Kilkenny centre had Carlow addresses.  Persons living in Carlow can also attend centres in other adjacent counties if for any reason this would be more convenient.The Minister is further advised by the board that it is satisfied its clients in the Carlow area get a good service and that the board keeps the arrangements for providing the service under review.  In addition to the ongoing oversight of the service, the board is engaged upon a broader review of the efficiency and effectiveness of the legal services being delivered by the law centres throughout the country.  This review will examine how services are provided nationwide, examining the case profile at each centre as well as the costs of providing services and the various means by which legal needs can be delivered.  The review will make recommendations designed to facilitate the provision of a flexible and responsive service to the client while providing value for money to the taxpayer.One issue the Minister understands will be examined under the review is the extent to which the board provides services though part-time centres and he will pass on for the board's consideration the issues raised by the Deputy.  However, opening additional full-time centres in Carlow, or another location, would have fixed cost implications for the board associated with acquiring and maintaining the centre and staffing it on a full-time basis.  In an environment of considerable financial pressures, the Minister has a concern that this might not necessarily represent the best use of resources and could be counterproductive not only to the service generally, but also to the clients a new centre would aim to serve.  The Minister understands waiting times at the Kilkenny centre, whether for clients living in Carlow, Kilkenny or elsewhere, are well within the board's performance targets and compare favourably to other centres.  Diluting resources might make this more difficult to maintain.In any event, the Minister will await the outcome of the board's general review of its services and assess its findings in the context of how best to support the board in assisting persons in need of its service, given the many demands that will be made on the resources available to it and to the Department.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	354	When I tabled the issue, it included the words "and the need to ensure the protection of Irish jobs", which is my purpose in raising it.  I tabled this on behalf of Solas, an Irish-owned company that manufactures light bulbs.  The company contacted me and numerous other Members, including the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Taoiseach, because it has been excluded from the latest discussions on the future of the lighting industry.  Representatives of the company wrote to the Minister in this regard.  I tabled this matter last week but it was not selected for discussion, following which the Minister and Department had a change of heart and officials met Solas representatives earlier this week.However, the Minister's approach to the phasing out of light bulbs is still a significant problem.  He made this announcement last year.  Solas is the only Irish company manufacturing light bulbs.  It is 70 years old and it employs people in Clondalkin and Belfast.  A total of 10% of its output comprises CFL bulbs.  The company caters for approximately 50% of the domestic lighting market.  Management and staff have serious concerns about how the proposal to phase out energy inefficient lighting is approached.  They have raised concerns with the Minister, immediately writing to him when he made his announcement last December.  Having written to him repeatedly over many months, he met them, but they had a difficult time securing a meeting with him.  However, he has been unable to tell them the energy standards that will be imposed in January 2009.  Having met him again earlier this week, they are still not sure.  A ban on all bulbs of 60 watts and greater, which comprise 60% of the current market, is a possibility.Solas and other lighting companies say it will not be possible to achieve this by January 2009.  If the Minister presses ahead with this, shelves could be empty because there will not be enough light bulbs.  People who have dimmer switches will be unable to use them because CFL bulbs are not adaptable to such switches and other light fittings may not be adaptable.  The market could face significant difficulty and demand may be met by cheap imports, some of which will be of poor quality and could result in electrocution.  Hardship will be cause to those who cannot afford to replace their light fittings or the new CFL bulbs because they are much more expensive.All the lighting industry wants is the Minister to introduce this measure in a fair way by ensuring proper consultation in order that it can plan ahead.  Companies have not been informed what are the standards.  Figures are thrown out regularly but the Minister is trying to save face and do as much as possible by January 2009.  He does not care about Irish jobs, the impact on pensioners or people who have to replace light fittings because they will be unable to purchase the light bulbs they need.In addition, his proposal is illegal.  Under EU law, he is not entitled to do what he says he is entitled to do.  I have received correspondence from the European Commission, which states he cannot implement the ban as he proposes.  As a solicitor, I know he cannot do it.  However, the Minister is only interested in the public relations element of the proposal and the fact that he can say he was the first to ban traditional light bulb.  He does not care about the impact of the ban.  He refers to consultation but he is not consulting properly.  Only when this matter was tabled on the Adjournment last week and this week did the Minister re-engage with the only Irish company manufacturing light bulbs.I have no problem with phasing out energy inefficient light bulbs and the general consensus is that it is a worthy proposal, as long as it is implemented fairly.  The EU announced such a proposal long before the Minister and it should be implemented as fairly as the EU provided for.  The Union is consulting the industry and the public.  It proposes phasing out light bulbs over a number of years to allow companies to adapt.  A product cannot be unilaterally banned without allowing companies to adapt and purchase the machinery needed to manufacture the new product.  The Minister must stop being unreasonable about this matter.  He should consult properly and take people's concerns into account and do this in a way that is not illegal, according to European Commission law.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	355	I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  The programme for Government commits to phasing out the use of incandescent light bulbs in favour of more energy efficient alternatives.  While the national climate change strategy proposed a levy on low efficiency bulbs, a more direct approach is necessary.  In his carbon budget statement of 6 December 2007, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government announced that a minimum energy efficiency standard for lighting will be introduced from 2009 and advised that this measure will deliver emissions savings of up to 700,000 tonnes per year from residential lighting alone when incandescent bulbs are fully replaced in all domestic light fittings.As modern energy efficient lights typically use only 20% as much energy as their incandescent alternatives and last up to 15 times longer, significant savings for consumers are possible.  According to the ESB, one compact fluorescent lamp could save up to €170 over the lifetime of the bulb.  It has been estimated consumers could save €185 million in electricity costs per annum.  From both an emissions and a cost perspective, the energy efficiency standard being developed represents a significant positive initiative for consumers and the environment.Work on developing the proposed standard is ongoing and the Minister will announce details as soon as they are finalised.  The standard will create certainty for manufacturers and suppliers about the lamps that can be supplied, and stimulate the development of alternative lighting technologies in Ireland.  It will also provide the greatest assurance as to effectiveness of the desired environmental outcome, both in terms of reduced greenhouse gas emissions and in reduced energy consumption.  The Minister is engaged in discussions with the lighting industry on the format and scope of the proposed standard and he will consider all the issues raised, including any impact on jobs.Climate change presents us with an enormous challenge and the Minister is asking the lighting sector to be ambitious in moving away from old, inefficient technologies.  Exciting new technologies are emerging, particularly low energy halogen and LED lamps, and their introduction to the Irish market should be expedited.  The constructive engagement of the sector on the proposed standard, and the involvement of IBEC in facilitating the ongoing discussions, is very much to be welcomed.It is the Minister's intention that the proposed standard, once finalised, will be subject to public consultation and, as part of this process, he proposes to invite submissions from relevant stakeholders.  A fundamental objective of this consultation, in addition to the ongoing discussions between officials of his Department and the lighting sector in Ireland, is to ensure all the impacts of the proposed standard are identified and considered.  The proposed standard should be seen as a positive step for consumers in terms of the cost of domestic lighting and increased awareness of energy use on the environment.  It is also a very welcome development in national energy and climate change policy.

This particular scheme benefits all students who wish to improve their Irish and is not targeted specifically on youth or sports clubs.  My Department also provides assistance to local committees who organise summer camps through Irish in the Gaeltacht. The aim of this scheme is to further strengthen Irish as the normal everyday language among young people through a range of recreational and educational activities. A sum of €50 is paid for each participant attending a camp for 5 days and €100 for 10 days. While this scheme is aimed primarily at young people living in the Gaeltacht, up to 25% of places are available for those living outside the Gaeltacht who wish to participate.In addition, there are two schemes administered by Foras na Gaeilge which are targeted specifically at encouraging the use of Irish among young people aged 3 -16.  Both its Summer Camp Scheme (Scéim na gCampaí Samhraidh) and Youth Scheme (An Scéim Óige) offer grants of up to €5,000 (or £3,500 STG) on an all-island basis to groups wishing to organise appropriate events outside the Gaeltacht. The Summer Camp Scheme covers camps of 5 or 10 days duration, which offer a mix of formal classes and fun activities. The funding available is offered on the clear condition that it is to be used to keep participants' fees low. The Youth Scheme applies to events organised outside school hours which give students the chance to use the Irish language in a variety of activities, e.g. sport, computers, music, visual arts, etc.

Firstly, public meetings have taken place over the period 30 April to 14 May in Cork, Limerick, Dublin, Galway and Sligo.  Secondly, a survey that was devised to facilitate input from people who were unable to attend the public meetings is available online (at www.plean2028.ie), both in Irish and English. In this regard, I would like to point out that, in order to facilitate people wishing to participate in the process but who have difficulties in operating or accessing technology, surveys can be completed in hard copy also.In terms of the next steps in the overall process, it is proposed to commence preparation of a draft discussion document outlining principal issues for the proposed Strategy, taking into account the views and recommendations expressed by the public, both at public meetings and through the completed surveys, together with the views of other stakeholders.  It is expected that this paper will be available for further public consultation in the autumn.  Thereafter, my Department will prepare a draft Strategy for my consideration and for submission for Government approval by the end of the year.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	359	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11 and 20 together.Yesterday, I launched the 2nd Bulletin of the All Island National Drug Prevalence Survey 2006/07, which was undertaken by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs (NACD) in conjunction with their colleagues from Northern Ireland.  The Bulletin looks at the regional spread of drug misuse in Ireland and the changes that have occurred since the last study in 2002/03.  The first Bulletin, published in February last, indicated that while rates of lifetime and recent (last year) overall illegal drug misuse had increased, the level of current (last month) illegal drug misuse had stabilised.  While this conclusion is broadly reflected in the 2nd Bulletin, there are important variations in individual regions and around individual drugs, particularly in relation to the more prevalent illegal drugs such as cannabis and cocaine.The report, which is available on the NACD's website at www.nacd.ie, shows that there has been a significant increase in lifetime use of illegal drugs across all areas.  It also concludes that prevalence rates tend to be higher across all age periods in the east of the country, roughly from Dundalk to Cork.  The increase in lifetime use for all drugs was expected as older people tend to have less exposure to — and usage of — drugs over their lifetimes and given that illegal drug use is primarily a youth/younger adult (under 35s) phenomenon. Therefore, lifetime prevalence rates are likely to increase for a considerable period of time as the current younger population age.The increase in recent (last year) use is of more concern and it emphasises the challenging task we continue to face in regard to tackling illegal drug use in our society.  However, the report shows different rates of increase across different regions.  Meanwhile, the overall stabilisation in current (last month) use, although it varies across regions, is to be welcomed and hopefully, with the continuing work being done through the National Drugs Strategy, this trend will continue.  With respect to drug-related deaths outside of Dublin, I am aware that the Health Research Board is currently developing a comprehensive Drug Deaths Register, which they hope to publish later this year.  It will cover the 1998-2005 period and will identify regional variations.  The existing General Mortality register is the only register currently available but it is generally accepted that this understates the extent of drug-related deaths.With respect to heroin misuse, the 3 source capture/recapture study, currently being undertaken by the NACD, will provide valuable information on the changes in prevalence of heroin misuse in the country, including the level of regional spread.  The Steering Group established to develop the new National Drug Strategy, covering the period 2009 — 2016, will be examining in detail the findings of the Prevalence Survey, the 3 source heroin study and the findings of the new Drugs Death Register with a view to, among other things, determining the appropriate structures for delivering the Strategy.  In this context, the question of additional Local Drug Task Forces will be considered.  As I outlined at the public consultation meetings for the new Strategy that I attended, the Government is committed to the partnership process between the community, voluntary and statutory sectors.  However, I welcome the opportunity that the development of the new Strategy provides to re-examine the existing structures underpinning the Strategy with a view to putting in place the most appropriate arrangements to manage problem drug use in our society over the coming years.The actions in the National Drugs Strategy under the pillars of supply reduction, prevention, treatment and rehabilitation continue to target a reduction in demand of illegal drug use in our society.  As the Deputies will appreciate, there have been a number of successes in this regard, not least in the area of seizures and provision of treatment services.  Finally, the Deputies should note that getting problem drug users into treatment has had an important effect in reducing demand as the ROSIE study undertaken by the NACD illustrates.  The study found that those accessing and remaining in treatment report significant reductions in their levels of usage of illegal drugs.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	360	There has been significant success in relation to the supply reduction pillar of the National Drugs Strategy and both An Garda Síochána and the Customs Service of the Revenue Commissioners are playing key roles in this regard.  Their levels of drugs seizures have been well in excess of the targets set out in the Strategy and they include a number of significant operations.The Garda National Drugs Unit (GNDU) is the primary unit within An Garda Síochána charged with responsibility for drug supply law enforcement. At the end of April last, 62 people were assigned to that Unit.  Additional Divisional Drugs Units have also been established and they had a total strength of 340 people at the same date.  Both the GNDU and the Divisional Units are supported in their work by officers in the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation, the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Garda Bureau of Fraud Investigation.  Furthermore, as the Deputy will appreciate, Gardaí generally deal with drug related issues as they arise.  Data provided by the Gardaí concerning the number, volume and value of drug seizures for the period 2000-2006 inclusive, demonstrates the operational success of the intelligence-led approach taken by the Gardaí.Meanwhile, drug seizures by the Customs Service have also significantly increased in recent years, as have the number of supply detections.  I understand that the Customs Service is to acquire a second customs cutter and a second mobile container X-ray scanner and that these will be deployed next year.  The increased use of sniffer dogs has also proved fruitful.  At the same time, it must be acknowledged that trade in illicit drugs is a global phenomenon and no country has fully come to grips with it.  There has been a sharp increase in the production of heroin in Afghanistan and this has resulted in an increasing supply in Europe.  Similarly, production of cocaine continues strongly, with the resultant implications for supply in Europe.Among the recent initiatives at international level is the establishment in May 2007 of the Maritime Analysis and Operational Centre — Narcotics (MAOC-N), based in Lisbon.  It is expected that this Centre which involves seven EU countries (Portugal, Spain, France, Italy, UK, Netherlands and Ireland), will provide significant benefits in the gathering of intelligence about air and sea routes for drug trafficking via West Africa. The U.S. also has a number of liaison officers attached to the Centre.  In fulfilling its role, Ireland is deploying both Garda and Customs personnel to Lisbon.  In addition, the Deputy should note that I plan to liaise regularly with Garda and Customs representatives to keep up-to-date with developments in respect of their drug-related operations.  Reports on their progress are also made on a quarterly basis to the Inter-Departmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.  Gardaí are also represented on Local and Regional Drugs Tasks Forces.Finally, the Deputy should note that in the context of the consultation process for a new National Drugs Strategy 2009-2016, my officials and I recently met with senior officers from the Gardaí and the Customs Service. In these discussions, they both confirmed their commitment that supply reduction of illicit drugs will remain a priority for them over the coming years and that they will be key players in the roll-out of the new Strategy.

Each of these schemes and programmes encourage social and economic development, and support the growth of rural business and enterprises.  Further information in regard to these schemes and programmes is available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.  In addition to these schemes and programmes, the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007–2013, which was launched recently, will provide significant support for the development of rural enterprises under Axes 3 and 4 of that Programme.Axis 3 provides funding to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy. Though all measures in the programme have relevance, the primary measure supporting the development of rural enterprise is the Support for Business Creation and Development measure. The aim of this measure is to position rural areas so that they can provide economic activity of sufficient mass to attract people to live and work in rural areas. Under this measure, funding of the order of €48.26m will be provided over the life of the Programme for a wide range of rural enterprise activity. It is expected that approximately 10,000 new or existing micro-enterprises will be supported with the potential to create 7,000 jobs over the lifetime of the Programme.In addition to the schemes and programmes operated directly by my Department, the Deputy will also be aware that responsibility for the creation of employment in Gaeltacht areas rests with Údarás na Gaeltachta, a body that comes within the ambit of my Department, and the work of this body includes the development of rural enterprises. Information in relation to assistance provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts which, under sections 18 and 19 of the Údarás na Gaeltachta Act 1979, are laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Information is also available on its website at www.udaras.ie.Finally, the Deputy should note that the Western Development Commission, another body that comes within the ambit of my Department, has responsibility for fostering and promoting economic and social development, including rural enterprise and job creation in the Western Region. Information in relation to the support provided by the WDC is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts, which are also laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas.  Information is also available on its website at www.wdc.ie.

At that stage I will arrange for the report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas and the provision of copies to the Select committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs. Copies will also be made available to relevant Government Departments, Pobal, the Partnership Companies responsible for the delivery of the programme and other stakeholders. It will also be published on my Department's website.  The contents of the report will form a key input into the strategic direction of  the programme for the future.

I am attending as many of these meetings as possible as I see them as being a key part of the process of developing the new Strategy.  The consultation process includes:public consultation meetings at 15 locations;written/e-mail submissions;meetings with relevant Departments/Statutory Agencies;meetings with key sectoral groups and organisations;focus groups meetings; andengagement with the Oireachtas.All 15 public consultation meetings have now been held, with reports on all except the final meeting in Croke Park now available on my Department's website, www.pobail.ie.  The report from this session will be available within the next week.  The feedback received from attendees at these sessions was very favourable and people felt that there was good interaction, with ample opportunity for people to air their views and opinions.  The total attendance over the 15 meetings was a little over 1,200, giving an average attendance of approx. 80 people.   Details of the attendances at each of the 15 public meetings are provided in the attached table.  To date, over 120 submissions by e-mail and in writing have been received from various organisations and individuals.   The Deputies should note that next Monday, 30th June, is the closing date for receipt of submissions.With regard to the other elements of the consultation process, most of the meetings with Departments and Agencies have been held at this stage, and the Steering Group has started to meet with the key sectoral groups and the focus groups.  All in all, it is hoped to have the overall consultation process — which will involve about 45 meetings in total — completed around mid July.  Meanwhile, I would encourage Oireachtas Members to input to the process in their capacity as elected representatives — and, in this context, I understand that Deputy Ó Snodaigh attended one of the public meetings in Dublin.  I recognise that the current Strategy grew out of a political consensus in the late 1990s and I would welcome a continuation of that broad approach.Last week, I attended a debate in the Seanad that afforded Senators an opportunity to contribute to the process and I will be meeting with the Joint Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 24 September to hear their views.   The views of Deputies and Senators will continue to be welcome as the Strategy is being formulated over the coming months.  Following the consultation process, work on the finalisation of proposals will continue with a view to having a new Strategy developed by the end of the year.VenueAttendanceDún Laoghaire85Athlone30Hilton Dublin Airport Hotel75Galway100Gorey70Tallaght120Sligo70Dublin City (Southside)49Portlaoise30Limerick110Tralee65Cork140Waterford75Dundalk75Croke Park125

The closing date for receipt of these proposals is 4th July, after which they will be assessed in accordance with the criteria laid down by my Department.  Total funding available for these LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme is €425m, which is almost three times more than the amount available under the 2000–2006 programming round and I hope that project activity under the LEADER elements will commence in October 2008.

I indicated also that the lack of practical progress raised serious issues with regard to the continuation of interim funding for LEADER companies who have not fully cohesed and who have not taken concrete steps to comply with the Governance guidelines.  Some progress, considerable in some areas, has been made. However, I fully expect to see significant progress made in relation to any such outstanding matters.

The first Programme provides grants to smaller community and voluntary groups to support refurbishment work and the equipping of community facilities. The second Programme aims to enhance the capacity and activities of people and organisations working in the community and voluntary sector to improve governance and provide better quality services to the people they support.Funding of €9m is being provided for the Programmes this year.  Both Programmes were advertised in the first week of June this year and they contain some key improvements over previous programmes.  These include:an increase from €40,000 to €60,000 in the level of grants available for refurbishment work;greater targeting of the resources available on disadvantaged communities;simplifying the application process; anda broadening of the eligibility of both Programmes.My Department has also taken the opportunity to combine two previous schemes into a single Programme of Training Supports.  The revisions of the Programmes are designed to simplify access for community and voluntary groups and to ensure better targeting of the resources available.

#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	371	In a reply to a similar question on 15 May, the House was informed that one of the key purposes of the Charities Bill 2007 is to enact a reform of the law relating to charities in order to ensure accountability and to protect against abuse of charitable status and fraud. It is vital for public trust and confidence in the sector to be safeguarded and maintained. However, any matters that might currently be subject to investigation by the Revenue Commissioners are an internal matter for the Commissioners. As indicated previously, I have no statutory role in relation to the investigation of charities.I am pleased to say that during the development of the Bill, there has been a very productive working relationship between my Department and the Revenue Commissioners, who currently maintain a list of bodies that have qualified for charitable tax exemptions.  Also, in recognition of the value of the resource potentially available to the new Authority in terms of experience and expertise within Revenue, an amendment was introduced at Committee Stage providing explicitly for co-operation between the new Charities Regulatory Authority and Revenue in relation to the establishment of the Register of Charities, which is to be maintained by the new Authority.The new Authority, to be established in due course after the Bill is enacted, will also be required to secure compliance by charities with their legal obligations and to encourage better administration of charities. It will be an offence for a body not on the Register of Charities to claim that it is a charity, or to operate or fundraise in Ireland. The new Authority may call for documents and search records, enter premises on foot of a search warrant, impose sanctions, and co-operate with foreign statutory bodies on law enforcement matters.  There will also be significant penalties in place.  However, I would like to reiterate that while the new Authority will determine whether or not an organisation is a charitable organisation for the purposes of entry onto the Register of Charities, it will remain a matter solely for Revenue to determine whether or not any funds applied by organisations for charitable purposes should be granted entitlement to tax exemption.

The Programme for Government also contains a commitment to implement these recommendations.  As agreed by the Working Group, the HSE is taking the lead role on rehabilitation and I understand that the post of Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator is to be advertised by them shortly, and that it will be filled by September. In addition, I understand that the National Drugs Rehabilitation Implementation Committee — the establishment of which was recommended in the Report —  will be in place by September to dove-tail with the appointment of the Senior Rehabilitation Co-ordinator, who will chair it.A number of other rehabilitation initiatives that are also being progressed through the Drugs Strategy:steps are being taken to increase the numbers on drug-specific Community Employment Scheme places from 1,000 to 1,300;the Irish Prison Service is working to improve the operation of the Local Prisons Liaison Groups and to endeavour to ensure a continuum of care for problem drug users when they leave prison;the Dept of Education & Science is developing proposals for an Education Fund for drugs rehabilitation; andthe Dept of Environment, Heritage & Local Government is establishing a Working Group to progress the recommendations in the May 2007 Report in regard to accommodation issues for recovering drug users.In addition, my Department is providing funding of €750,000 for rehabilitation initiatives at Local and Regional Drugs Task Force level this year, as well as increased funding to the Family Support Network that will help to support the role of families in the rehabilitation process.  Overall progress on the implementation of the Report of the Working Group on Drugs Rehabilitation will continue to be monitored through the Inter-departmental Group on Drugs which I chair.  In this context, I can assure the Deputies that I will be working to ensure that progress will be made to implement the recommendations of the Working Group over the coming months.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	373	As the Deputy will be aware, my Department operates a range of initiatives, schemes and programmes in both rural and Gaeltacht areas supportive of the development and growth of these areas, including measures to reduce and combat the impact of unemployment. The schemes and programmes operated by my Department, which are specifically relevant to the Deputy's query, include the Rural Social Scheme, the Community Services Programme, the Community Development Programme, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme, the Enterprise Scheme for non-Gaeltacht offshore islands, the Gaeltacht Schemes and the LEADER Programmes 2001-2006, which will close shortly.  Further information in regard to these schemes and programmes is available on my Department's website at www.pobail.ie.Under the Community Services Programme, I can confirm that a total of 1,657 jobs were created in 2006 across the country, and this increased to 1,937 in 2007.  In addition, there are currently 2,600 participants on the Rural Social Scheme and a further 130 supervisor positions.  It should be noted that both these programmes not only offer employment opportunities in rural and Gaeltacht areas, but also significantly contribute to the social and cultural development of the communities in these areas.  This is also the case in relation to the Community Development and Local Development Social Inclusion Programmes, which are delivered by my Department and which target disadvantage and promote social and economic inclusion.The Deputy should also note that under the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007–2013, which was launched recently, significant support and funding of the order of €425m will be provided over the lifetime of the Programme, for the development of the rural economy, under Axes 3 and 4 of that Programme. The primary objective of LEADER funding is to improve the quality of life in rural areas and promote the diversification of the rural economy. This overall objective will be facilitated through a number of measures that either directly or indirectly support both the increase of economic activity in rural areas and an increase in employment rates. It is expected that over 12,600 full-time equivalent jobs will be created over the lifetime of the Programme under the various different measures.With regard to addressing unemployment rates in the Gaeltacht, my Department provides funding for a number of schemes in Gaeltacht areas, which are aimed at strengthening the Irish language as the everyday language of the region.  Some of these schemes also provide employment to Irish speaking people, both inside and outside of the Gaeltacht.  My Department also provides annual funding to Údarás na Gaeltachta, which operates a range of schemes and initiatives to create and maintain employment opportunities and support economic and social development in the Gaeltacht. Significant progress has been made in recent years in reversing the downward employment trend in the Gaeltacht and in effecting a transition from a declining manufacturing sector to employment in the services sector.I understand from Údarás na Gaeltachta that 1,038 new jobs in total were created in 2007 and that total employment in Údarás assisted companies now stands at 8,026.  This is the first year since 2001 that the full-time employment level has exceeded 8,000. Over 4,000 part-time jobs are also supported by Údarás. Further information in regard to assistance provided by Údarás na Gaeltachta and numbers of jobs created is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts which are laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Information is also available at its website at www.udaras.ie.The Western Development Commission, another body that also comes within the ambit of my Department, has responsibility for fostering and promoting economic and social development, including job creation in the Western Region. Information in relation to the assistance and support provided by the WDC, and numbers of jobs created, is published in that organisation's Annual Report and Accounts, which are also laid annually before each of the Houses of the Oireachtas. Information is also available at its website at www.wdc.ie.

Following a number of meetings between my Department, the Department of Transport, Iarnród Éireann and various interested parties it was agreed that my Department would provide funding for line clearance so as to ensure the preservation of the railway line between Claremorris and Collooney.  I announced €5m funding under the CLÁR programme on the 18th September 2006 to carry out the works.   To date, €3.5m has been spent.

The selection of these Local Action Groups is a competitive open process, which requires the business plans to be submitted by 4th July 2008. Until such time as these proposals have been evaluated, I am not in a position to say how many groups will emerge from the process.  In line with both the ‘bottom-up' approach of the LEADER method of rural development and with practice in previous funding rounds, each of the groups contracted to implement the programme employs its own staff and my Department does not have an input in this regard.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	377	The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within the 46 designated RAPID areas.  In terms of reviewing the programme, my attention at present is focused on an analysis of recent Census data with a view to ensuring that the boundaries of existing RAPID areas are appropriate.  A key concern will be to ensure that the effectiveness of the RAPID Programme is not diluted and that Government action continues to prioritise and target communities with the greatest needs. The Government has given a commitment to continue to prioritise investment in the existing RAPID areas and no area currently included in the Programme will lose its eligibility for priority treatment.Deputies will be aware that there was an evaluation of the RAPID Programme in 2006, which indicated that the experience of the Programme has been very positive in many areas and that it has made substantial progress in identifying the needs of disadvantaged communities and in implementing important local projects in response to those needs.  The evaluation recommended that a future Programme should be developed under a number of key Strategic Themes.  These were Community Safety & Anti-social Behaviour, Family, Youth, Physical Environment, Education, Health and Employment/Training.A national framework for the development of these strategic themes is now in place and will support the development of strategies and plans to respond to the issues within a local context identified by the Area Implementation Teams (AIT).  Each Department/Agency with responsibility for the strategic themes has prepared guidance for the AIT that includes objectives, performance indicators and targets.  These will be further developed within the AIT in each RAPID area.  I launched the Health, Family and Community Safety and Anti-social Behaviour themes on 30th January 2008.  Responsibility for the development of each strategic theme rests with the lead Department or Agency. I expect to launch the remaining four Themes later this year.Finally, I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  The individual schemes are subject to ongoing review to ensure that they remain responsive to the demands of the RAPID communities.  Where opportunities arise, the eligibility of individual schemes can be extended to reflect emerging needs identified by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  At present, there are 3.5 head of staff within the Department engaged in working directly on the RAPID Programme.

As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report on the provision of funding and progress on delivery with respect to projects under their responsibility in the RAPID areas.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section (http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID). The Deputy may find it helpful to access this information.I initiated the RAPID leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  Earlier this year I agreed to co-fund the provision of facilities in schools located in, or mainly servicing children from, RAPID areas.  Details of funding allocated to all areas since 2004 are contained in the appendix.Each of the 46 RAPID area makes applications under each cycle of each leverage scheme.  To date there have been three cycles of the Local Authority Housing Estate Enhancement Scheme, two cycles of the Traffic Measures Scheme and three cycles of the Playground Scheme. Applications under other schemes — Sports Capital Top Up, CCTV, Health, Graffiti Removal and Schools Facilities are made to the relevant lead Department.  In 2008 funding of some €1.5 million is allocated for current expenditure and of some €7.8 million for capital expenditure for the RAPID Leverage schemes.  The provision in my Department's Vote funds the community support and administrative costs of RAPID Area Implementation Teams (AIT) and Pobal and the capital cost of the RAPID Leverage schemes.Appendix  — RAPIDThe total allocation by my Department for each County is set out in the table below:CountyRapid AreaAmount(€)Dublin11,320,105CorkCork City, Mallow, Youghal4,777,560LimerickBallynanty & Kileely, King’s Island, South City1,649,023WaterfordWaterford1,204,023LouthDrogheda & Dundalk2,124,852WicklowBray829,154WestmeathAthlone709,860KildareAthy741,672GalwayGalway, Ballinasloe & Tuam2,161,881CarlowCarlow809,000TipperaryCarrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Tipperary Town1,904,093CavanCavan527,641ClareEnnis1,116,750KilkennyKilkenny1,072,500LongfordLongford530,566MeathNavan426,477WexfordWexford & New Ross1,044,628SligoSligo1,228,453KerryTralee697,603RoscommonAthlone66,000Total34,941,841Some €17.5 m outstanding commitments from the above allocations remain to be drawn down by the areas.

There are Gaeltacht areas in seven counties as set out in Statutory Instruments Nos 245 of 1956, 200 of 1967 and 350 of 1982. As with other areas of the country, the population of these areas vary from time to time. The most recent population figures based on the 2006 Census can be accessed from the Central Statistics Office at www.cso.ie.  As the Deputy is aware, my Department recently published the Report on the Linguistic Study of the Use of Irish in the Gaeltacht. This study makes a number of recommendations, including recommendations relating to Gaeltacht boundaries, which will be given due consideration by the Cabinet Committee on Irish and the Gaeltacht.

Indications are that at least 85% of the landholders on the trails will take part and that all landholders on the trails are willing to allow access to their land.  It is expected that the first scheme payments to landowners in the four areas will issue in the coming weeks.In tandem with the development of the Walks Scheme, my Department has reached agreement with Fáilte Ireland regarding the employment of 12 Rural Recreation Officers (RRO). Their role will be to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks. The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice. The RRO will provide vital support in rolling out the Walks Scheme.  All 12 of the RROs have recently been recruited.  The four pilot areas have been assigned RROs and it is anticipated that, when the scheme is bedded down in these areas, it will be rolled out to routes in the other eight areas where RRO's have been appointed.  It is expected that over time the scheme will be open to all existing National Waymarked Ways and Looped Walking Routes.  In the future, new Waymarked Ways, Looped Walks and Heritage Routes may also be included along with other possible trails.

The Programme, through which €425m will be made available to improve the quality of life in rural areas and to encourage diversification of the rural economy, provides for funding of agritourism activities under the following measures:Diversification into non-agricultural activities for farm families. Funding will be available, inter alia, for the renovation of farm buildings for tourism purposes and the provision of facilities for walking, cycling, angling and pony trekking. Funding will also be available under this measure for the development of niche tourism and educational services such as arts and crafts, speciality food provision and open farms. Funding of €16.6m will be available under this measure.Encouragement of tourism activities. Funding will be available for the analysis and provision of infrastructural needs for tourism, the maintenance of vernacular features such as disused railway lines, canal towpaths, &c., the development of the use of forests for tourism and recreation and the development of niche tourism such as arts and crafts, ecotourism, genealogy and archaeology.  Funding of €45.4m will be available under this measure.In addition the Rural Development Fund, which is operated through my Department, provides finance for policy-oriented research, evaluations and pilot actions in rural development and is currently providing assistance to a number of tourism related initiatives.

However, my Department, along with the Department of Culture, Arts and Leisure in Northern Ireland, jointly funds Waterways Ireland, which has responsibility for the management, maintenance, development and restoration of certain inland navigable waterways, principally for recreational purposes. The waterways under its remit are the Shannon-Erne Waterway, the Shannon, the Erne, the Grand Canal (including the Barrow Navigation), the Lower Bann and the Royal Canal. Waterways Ireland is also responsible for taking forward the restoration of the south-west section of the Ulster Canal from Upper Lough Erne to Clones. Waterways Ireland works with a wide range of interested parties, both public and private, in developing these waterways and their associated amenities. For completeness under the new Rural Development Programme funding will be available to groups to develop amenities associated with the Waterways.

This process continued until September 2006 when I published draft Regulations and laid them before each House of the Oireachtas.  Individual Government Departments would also have provided an opportunity for bodies under their aegis to comment on the draft Regulations during this period. Any comments received from such bodies would have been incorporated in observations received by my Department from Departments during the course of that consultation process.  As a result, a number of public bodies may not have felt a need to comment on the draft Regulations again when given the opportunity by my Department to do so in 2007.As the Deputy is aware, I had the opportunity of presenting the draft Regulations to members of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Arts, Sport, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs on 2 different occasions in late 2006. Both Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann approved the draft Regulations on 14 December 2006.  Following my discussions with the Committee, I considered it appropriate to give public bodies a further opportunity to comment on the draft Regulations.  Accordingly, at the beginning of 2007 my Department wrote to all public bodies covered by the Act (including Government Departments). As I indicated at a meeting of the Committee on 18 June 2008 when discussing the proposed Regulations, approximately 20 public bodies responded with comments and suggestions, some of which have been included in the revised draft of the Regulations, which was circulated to members of the Committee. The Committee is scheduled to meet again on 2 July next to discuss the Regulations for the final time.  In the meantime, Members have been invited to forward any comments/amendments that they may have to my Department. Following this meeting, I expect to be in a position to make the Regulations.As I indicated when the Deputy put this matter to me at the meeting of the Committee on 18 June, I do not consider that a further round of consultations would add value at this stage, having regard to the extensive, comprehensive consultation process which has already been undertaken.

Funding of the order of €6m is available this year to support volunteering programmes, which include the funding of 20 Volunteer Centres, including Volunteering Ireland, around the country.These Volunteer Centres encourage volunteering amongst all nationalities within communities in Ireland.  They endeavour to match volunteers with the skills requirements sought by local community and voluntary organisations and build volunteer management capacity within these organisations.  In recognition of the difficulties certain sectors of society can face in accessing volunteering opportunities, these centres also work to promote inclusive volunteering, challenging stereotypical perceptions of who can volunteer.  The Report of the Task Force on Active Citizenship of March 2007 makes a number of cross-cutting recommendations to engage and welcome newcomers within their local communities. My Department will continue to engage with other relevant Departments, to progress recommendations of the Task Force.

The closing date for these proposals is 4th July 2008.  I hope that project activity under the LEADER elements of the Rural Development Programme can commence in October 2008.

My Department has responsibility for administering a number of measures through the Fund.  One measure specifically focuses on supporting projects identified annually by RAPID Area Implementation Teams, based on a funding allocation to each RAPID area.  The other measures were run on a once-off basis and funded projects to enhance access to recreational and personal development opportunities for disadvantaged young people, flagships and to provide continuation funding from projects previously funded by the Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board.  While the status of applicants is not formally recorded, experience would suggest that the majority of applicants to my Department for Dormant Accounts funded activities are non-governmental organisations.In respect of the RAPID Additionality Measure, 200 applications were received in respect of the 2006 round of funding.  The majority of applications were from non-governmental bodies and none were from national sporting organisations.  Under the same scheme, 369 applications were received for the 2007 round of funding.  Again, the majority of applications were from non-governmental bodies and included 19 applications from a national sporting organisation.  The project promoters are in the process of drawing down grants under both cycles of this measure at present.The measure to promote enhanced access to recreational and personal development opportunities for disadvantaged young people attracted a total of 53 applications, all of which were from non-governmental organisations.  No applications were received from national sporting organisations. The Government approved funding for 51 organisations of which 50 have agreed to accept grants.  One organisation has decided not to take up its allocation.Under the Flagships measure, my Department received two applications, both of which were from non-government organisations.  Additionally, my Department processed 55 applications for continuation funding from projects originally in receipt of funding from the former Dormant Accounts Disbursement Board.  All applications were from non-governmental organisations.Experience would suggest that there are a number of reasons as to why groups do not draw down the funding they have been granted.  For example, some groups may decide that the project is no longer necessary or a priority.  Others may experience capacity issues in relation to their ability to implement the project.  Issues may also arise in relation to compliance with public procurement rules, planning permission and access to additional funding to complete the project.

In this context, my Department is in frequent dialogue with the Department of Foreign Affairs and other relevant parties to increase the supply of qualified personnel — for example qualified translators and interpreters — available to the EU institutions to service the requirements of the Irish language.As the Deputy will appreciate, given that responsibility for the Irish language and the Gaeltacht is central to my Ministerial remit, I have numerous meetings on a daily basis with a wide range of interested parties and I do not consider it would be warranted to detail all such meetings for a three month period in the context of a reply to a Question in the House.   I also meet regularly with the Taoiseach and my Ministerial colleagues to discuss the Irish language and other issues that relate to the exercise of my functions as Minister.

We do however consider proposals for rural based tourism/rural recreation from time to time. For example my Department has recently launched a Walks Maintenance Scheme which is in the process of being rolled out to four pilot areas at present and has provided funding to pilot projects such as Galway East Tourism Marketing Ltd which is a community based tourism company whose mission is to implement an integrated marketing strategy for the Galway East Region.Funding for rural tourism activities is also provided under the LEADER Programmes managed by my Department and are implemented by Local Action Groups.  In line with the bottom-up philosophy of rural development the Local Action Group is the decision-making authority in respect of all actions falling within its business plan.  In this context, all applications for grant assistance are received and processed directly by the Local Action Groups.  Consequently, my Department has no decision-making role in respect of applications made under the Programmes.The application process to select Local Acton Groups to deliver the LEADER element of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 is currently under way and once this is completed funding under the programme will be available to all rural communities and will include funding of €45.40m for the encouragement of tourism activities over the lifetime of the Programme.

The estimated VAT generated for the month of May is as follows:€mPetrol44.2Auto Diesel5.9Total50.1I am also informed that VAT returns do not require the yield from a particular sector or sub-sector of trade to be identified and precise figures of the VAT yield in May on these oil products cannot therefore be provided. The figures provided for May VAT receipts are estimates of the amount of VAT yield that would be generated by the volume of clearances of petrol and auto diesel for the month in question based on available price indicators. Mineral Oil Tax is paid in the month of clearance of the product but, depending on the nature of the registration status of a trader, VAT returns can be made monthly, bimonthly, quarterly, half yearly or annually and this will dictate the point in time when VAT on sales will actually be paid to Revenue.  It should be noted that the VAT content of purchases of auto diesel is a deductible credit for business in the Irish VAT system.

This was one of a number of customer service initiatives taken by Revenue designed to streamline the administration of claims, reduce processing times and therefore deliver an improvement in the quality of service to taxpayers.  Claims for health expenses are accepted and processed on the basis of the figures shown on the relevant claim form submitted by the taxpayer.  Some claims may subsequently be selected for a "credibility" check and where it seems from this ‘credibility' check that the claim is not in accordance with the taxpayer's circumstances, the taxpayer will be consulted to clarify the claim.  In these circumstances, certain documentation to support the taxpayer's claim may be sought, and it is for this reason that there is a requirement that certain records be retained.The relevant legislation — Section 886A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 — requires certain records to be retained for a period of six years.  I am satisfied that this is a reasonable period of time and is necessary for audit and examination/verification purposes and furthermore, does not impose an undue burden on taxpayers.  I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that no particular difficulties have been encountered with this requirement.  However, the matter will be kept under constant review with the aim of ensuring that no unnecessary burden is imposed on compliant taxpayers.

Revenue have advised me that claims for credits are selected for checking based on a number of criteria, primarily risk. Claims are also selected for checking on a random basis. Revenue's computer systems identify cases selected for checking/audit/investigation, but do not provide information on the specific credits or reliefs selected to be checked in each case. I have also been advised that where a credit/relief is checked, e.g medical expenses, and the supporting documentation, including receipts, is not provided or is incorrect, the relief claimed is withdrawn and the customer's tax credits or tax assessment is amended accordingly.

The standard expenditure sanction issued to the HSE for 2008 stipulated that the prior approval of my Department and the Department of Finance would be required in the event of any proposal to spend this money for any other purpose.  Clearly, it is essential that the HSE lives within its overall budget for the year. It needs to manage its activity levels and cost drivers appropriately to achieve this and I do not believe it is desirable to resort to using development funding to offset expenditure pressures arising in respect of ongoing health services.The HSE is currently reviewing its overall financial position for the year and roll-out of planned developments in disability services is being considered in that context. I have been in communication with the HSE with a view to an early determination on the matter.  The HSE has informed my Department that it plans to release €20m of the €50m additional funding for Disability Services.  The Deputy's specific question relates to the management and delivery of health and personal services, which are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive under the Health Act 2004. Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	409	Section 10(c) of the Adoption Act, 1952, as amended by Section 2 of the 1964 Act provides that, in order to be eligible for adoption, a child must be "illegitimate or an orphan" or be a child who has been legitimated, but whose birth has not been re-registered. The Adoption Act, 1988, does permit the adoption of any child (including children of marriage) but only in exceptional and very limited circumstances where the parents are shown to have completely abandoned their parental duties, and there is an expectation that they will continue to do so until the child reaches the age of eighteen. After its passage through the Oireachtas, the President referred the Adoption Bill, 1988 to the Supreme Court under Article 26 of the Constitution, for a decision on whether the provisions of the Bill were repugnant to the Constitution. While it was found to be Constitutional, and subsequently became the Adoption Act, 1988,  it was clear that these narrow circumstances, based on Article 42.5 of the Constitution, were the basis for the decision of the Supreme Court.The Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 was published in February 2007 and contained the Government's proposal to amend the Constitution in relation to children and included a provision to ensure that all children would be eligible for voluntary adoption, subject to appropriate consents. The Programme for Government of June 2007 committed to deepening consensus on the Twenty-Eighth Amendment of the Constitution Bill, 2007 and to this end, the Joint Committee on the Constitutional Amendment on Children [JCCAC] was established in November, 2007, to report back within four months, on the proposals set out in the Bill. The Committee recently received Dáil and Seanad approval for an extension of their timeframe to 30th November 2008. The Committee is now progressing with its work and the Government awaits the outcome of its deliberations before proceeding further with the proposed amendment of the Constitution in relation to children.

Accordingly, my Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have this matter investigated and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.As the Deputy may be aware, requests for assessment for intercountry adoption are continuously increasing. The recent study on intercountry adoption, undertaken by the Children's Research Centre in Trinity College, revealed that Ireland has one of the highest rates for foreign adoption in Europe. In addition, as a result of the increased number of children coming from abroad, a new and increasing demand for post-adoption reports from sending countries has been created. Both assessments and post-placement reports are being undertaken by HSE social work staff.The HSE has been assessing the provision of services in the context of moving from the health board system to a single executive. It has acknowledged that there is a divergence in the provision of services and is committed to addressing those differences. In a number of areas, the HSE has improved waiting times by contracting assessments out to non-statutory agencies with appropriate expertise.  It is important to note that couples find it frustrating that subsequent to undergoing an assessment with the HSE and receiving the Declaration of Eligibility and Suitability from the Adoption Board they must then wait  before receiving a referral for a child from the sending country (for some countries up to two years). This is an aspect that is outside the jurisdiction of the HSE and is dependant on the regulations that each individual country has with regard to Intercountry AdoptionThe HSE has undertaken a review of the intercountry adoption service. This review examined staffing, business processes, resources, strengths and options within the service and considered, inter alia, the issue of the commissioning of other providers to undertake some of the work associated with the assessment process. The HSE has indicated that it will contact the Department with a proposed strategy on the management of the service into the future based on this work and parallel discussions with professionals within the service. I would like to assure the Deputy of my attention to this issue and reiterate the importance of a rigorous and effective assessment system.

While I understand that this funding has now ceased, I must advise the Deputy that my Office is not in a position to provide funding to accommodate this project under the current provisions of the National Childcare Investment Programme (NCIP) which is implemented by my Office.The Office of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs provides funding on an annual basis to support activities set out in the Action Plans of the 33 City and County Childcare Committees. The total funding provided to the 33 City and County Childcare Committees in 2008 amounts to €13.3 million and represents an increase of more than 7% on the overall funding for the previous year.  This includes €295,360 in funding approved for Roscommon County Childcare Committee, which is one of the highest allocations per capita in the country.

#MaryWallace	unknown-#MaryWallace-party	unknown-#MaryWallace-dob	unknown-#MaryWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	416	The Food Supplements Directive, 2002/46/EC, has been transposed into Irish law by Statutory Instrument No. 506 of 2007.  That legislation is implemented by the Health Service Executive, under a Service Contract Agreement with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland (FSAI).  This ensures that consumers in Ireland are protected by the harmonised EU rules on the sale of food supplements, in particular the labelling of food supplements and chemical form of vitamins and minerals they contain.One of the objectives of the Food Supplements Directive (2002/46/EC) was to make provision for the European Commission to determine maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in food supplements.   The European Commission published a Discussion Paper on determining maximum and minimum levels of vitamins and minerals in June 2006.  The Irish response to this paper, issued in November 2006, gave Ireland's view that the Commission should proceed on a cautious basis, setting maximum limits for as many vitamins and minerals as possible.  It was considered vital that the safety of the general population and the needs of particular subgroups such as pregnant women, children, older people and those on various specialist diets be taken into account in formulating the position on this issue.Discussions are ongoing at European level on the development of a methodology under which maximum safe levels for vitamins and minerals in food supplements will be set. Those discussions will permit the European Commission and Member States to further develop future direction on this issue.  It is this Department's view that the setting of maximum levels for vitamins and minerals should not, in itself, cause major cost or hardship for consumers.

In the case of public transport services under my responsibility, these derogations included reduced rates to apply to fuel used for scheduled bus services. Scheduled bus services comprise bus passenger services provided by Bus Atha Cliath, Bus Eireann, private operators in accordance with bus route licences under the 1932 Road Transport Act and holders of Authorisations pursuant to European Council Regulation 684/92 as amended.While these derogations expired on 31 December 2006, Ireland, along with other Member States, sought retention of its derogations beyond that date.  However the European Commission, which is the deciding authority, has to date refused all such requests.  The Finance Act 2008 provided the basis for the removal of these excise duty reliefs with effect from 1 November 2008.My Department, in conjunction with the Department of Finance and other Departments, has been exploring whether alternative support mechanisms could be appropriate and could be done in a manner compatible with EU State Aid and other legal requirements.  My Department has also met the Coach Tourism and Transport Council, as well as CIE, on this matter.  My Department has also received a written submission from the Coach Tourism and Transport Council.  While my Department is in discussion with the Department of Finance on these issues, it is necessary to stress that, despite claims being made otherwise, introducing an alternative suitable mechanism is not a straightforward matter in the current economic climate.  I don't envisage any approval from the Department of Finance for a replacement scheme in the current economic circumstances.

The current directors are Mr. Francis Hackett, Mr. Chris Wall and Dr. Colin Hunt.Mr. Hackett became a "Minister's nominee" to the board following admission of the company's shares on the Stock Exchange on 2 October 2006.  Mr. Chris Wall was first appointed to the Board of Aer Lingus on 23 December 1998 and served as an independent director following the IPO. His position was re-designated as a "Minister's Nominee" from 31st January 2008.  Dr. Colin Hunt's nomination is also effective from the 31st January 2008.Under Company Law all directors are obliged to pursue the best interests of the company.  Subject to that duty the three Minister's Nominees have been mandated to seek to ensure that all future decisions of the company that have significant implications for wider Government, aviation or regional development policies are considered at board level.  In any such decisions, the State-nominated directors are directed to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives.  Decisions relating to the re-introduction of Shannon Heathrow services are commercial decisions for the company.

This increased funding is providing for additional services under the Programme together with expanded area coverage.  Pobal, which administers the RTP on behalf of my Department, makes specific allocations to individual RTP groups from funding provided by my Department. The management of the RTP is carried out locally and decisions regarding services and routes are made by the individual Boards of Directors.I understand from Pobal that Tumna Shannon Development Company, which operates RTP services in the north of County Roscommon, has received an increased allocation for 2008. This is in addition to funding under the Free Travel Pass scheme funded by the Department of Social & Family Affairs.  I also understand that Tumna Shannon Development Company was successful in securing funding under the Pilot Evening Rural Transport Scheme funded by the Department of Community, Rural & Gaeltacht Affairs.At present, there are two RTP community transport groups operating in County Roscommon, Tumna Shannon Development Company and Aughrim Kilmore Rural Transport Limited.  As part of the expansion of the RTP going forward, Pobal envisages that these groups will combine to provide RTP services for the whole of County Roscommon, in order to achieve better value for money. The combined group will be asked to prepare a Strategic Plan for the county for the period 2008-2010. It is envisaged that this Strategic Plan will be completed by September this year and submitted to Pobal for appraisal.  An allocation of funding will then be made for the RTP for County Roscommon.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	423	I remain deeply concerned at the situation in Somalia. The country has been without an effective government since 1991. Despite an initial period of stability after Ethiopian troops and Transitional Federal Government (TFG) forces defeated the Union of Islamic Courts (UIC) the situation worsened significantly in December 2006. Fighting in Mogadishu since October 2007 has prompted hundreds of thousands to flee the capital, adding to the humanitarian crisis. In total, approximately one million people have been displaced since the start of 2007, while up to two million need humanitarian aid.The Djibouti agreement, which was signed by TFG Prime Minister Nur Hassan Hussein and the opposition Alliance for the Re-Liberation of Somalia on 9 June, represents a first step in the right direction.  However, many armed groups remain outside the process and, as indicated above, the security situation in Mogadishu and surrounding areas remains extremely poor.  The humanitarian situation, which was already precarious, has also deteriorated further in terms of security and access for agencies. In this regard agencies face random violence, piracy, kidnapping threats, landmines and general banditry. The humanitarian situation is compounded by lower than expected rainfall during the 2007 rainy season which has led to a deepening drought in several regions of the country. The total rainfall was insufficient to replenish water sources, regenerate pasture, and for rain-fed crop development. The combined effects of poor rains, conflict and displacement have severely exacerbated the food security situation.Ireland's commitment to resolving the ongoing crisis in Somalia is demonstrated by our status as the seventh largest bilateral contributor to humanitarian endeavours in Somalia in 2007. Irish Aid has allocated €4.88 million to Somalia thus far in 2008. In total Irish Aid has allocated more than €18 million in funding for aid in Somalia since 2006. Additionally, our commitment has been complemented by three successive deployments of members of the Rapid Response Corps to assist the office of the UN High Commissioner for Refugees with its work in Somalia. Overall Ireland will continue to extend every possible assistance both to ease the humanitarian situation and to support the promotion of internal dialogue and national reconciliation within Somalia.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Grants-in-Aid are defined in the Department of Finance's Public Financial Procedures as differing in a number of respects from other voted grants.   For example, one of the characteristics of a Grant-in-Aid is that any unexpended sum issued from a Grant-in-Aid Subhead is not liable to be surrendered to the Exchequer at the end of the year.  However, strict instructions are in place to avoid monies being paid out which could remain unexpended at the year-end.Only one Subhead in my Department's Vote is designated as a Grant-in-Aid Subhead.  This Subhead relates to the part-funding of the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority (IAASA).  My Department funds 40% of IAASA's core overall administrative costs, with the balance being provided by way of a levy on the prescribed accountancy bodies.In 2007, a gross sum of €957,000 was paid in respect of IAASA's costs from the Grant-in-Aid Subhead in my Department's Vote.  This is the full amount of the Authority's payroll costs, the payment of which is administered by my Department.  However, as the total payroll costs exceed the 40% limit on Departmental funding, IAASA makes a refund to my Department to ensure that the Exchequer's net contribution is within the agreed limit.  Thus in 2007, a refund of €310,095 was made to the Department by the Authority, leaving a net Exchequer payment of €646,905 to IAASA for the year.For 2008, provision has been made for a gross payment of €1.547 million for IAASA in my Department's Vote. This amount will be reduced by an estimated refund of €398,000 from IAASA, leaving a net payment of €1.149 million.  The increase in the Exchequer payment in 2008 reflects the fact that IAASA had a number of vacant posts in 2007, which led to the Authority underspending on its original allocation.

The priority under the current round is to continue to support those projects remaining within the programme.  Of the 57 projects with the current round, 34 have been completed, 11 are under construction or about to start construction, 2 are out to tender and the remaining 10 are at various stages in the process.A sum of €184m has been provided in the National Development Plan 2007-2013 for supporting existing projects in the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme and for new projects to be selected following the launch of a new round of the Programme.  The terms and conditions of a new round will be devised taking into account the recommendations of the Value for Money and Policy Review report on the existing Programme which has been completed by the Department and which will be published shortly.The launch of the new programme will be a matter for discussion as part of the Estimates process which will start shortly between this Department and the Department of Finance.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities including South Dublin County Council, on behalf of Lucan, to submit applications under the terms that will apply.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	435	This Department's role is to assist social welfare recipients with heating costs, both through their basic payments and through the household benefits package with fuel, electricity and gas allowances. These schemes have been improved significantly in recent years.  The national fuel allowance scheme assists householders on long-term social welfare or health service executive (HSE) payments with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. Fuel allowance is now payable for 30 weeks and benefits over 290,000 people at an aggregate cost of €170 million this year. The payment rate has also increased to €18 per week or €21.90 for recipients living in designated smokeless areas. The allowance represents a contribution towards a person's normal heating expenses. It is not intended to meet those costs in full.Electricity and gas allowances under the household benefits package, are payable throughout the year to over 355,000 pensioners, people with disabilities, and carer households towards their heating, light and cooking costs at an estimated overall scheme cost of €159m in 2008.  The supplementary welfare allowance scheme can also be used to assist people in certain circumstances with specific heating needs due to infirmity or a particular medical condition.The income maintenance needs of those on social welfare payments have been met in recent years through increased primary social welfare rates. Government policy has focused on significantly increasing social welfare rates to ensure that people can meet their basic living costs, including heating, throughout the year and also achieve an improvement in quality of life. This is a more costly approach than increasing fuel allowance as the increase is paid for the full year and not just the 30 weeks of the winter heating season. Since December 2001, overall inflation has increased by 27% while energy product prices have increased by 65%. However, increases in social welfare payments have been between 71% and 88% in the same period.  Any changes to social welfare programmes to assist with heating costs will be considered in a budgetary context. However, the main focus of the Government will be on increasing social welfare payments in real terms to enable social welfare recipients to better meet heating and other needs.

Local community and voluntary groups — with the support of my Department —  administer the Scheme. Individual applicants must be 65 years of age or over and have a genuine need for the security equipment.A maximum individual grant of €300 is provided under the Scheme in respect of the once-off installation cost of socially monitored alarms. The private commercial suppliers engaged by the community groups charge the ongoing monitoring costs that usually arise with such alarms. I understand these costs are of the order of €80 per annum per individual, which equates to approximately €1.50 per week.  Given that the Scheme has benefited in excess of 100,000 older people to date, the Deputy will appreciate that the cost to my Department of providing funding for monitoring costs would be considerable.  Accordingly, I have no plans, at present, to introduce such a subsidy.

The areas covered by the Drugs Task Forces are detailed below. Projects are submitted through Drugs Task Forces to the National Drugs Strategy Team who make recommendations to myself, as Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, on funding.Over 440 Local Drugs Task Force (LDTF) projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving funding from my Department.  The 2008 allocation of €22m for such projects shows an increase of 9.5% over the amount spent in 2007.  In the region of 170 of these projects focus on treatment and rehabilitation.  Across the ten Regional Drugs Task Force (RDTF) areas, work is progressing on the implementation of their Action Plans with the level of expenditure expected to increase by over 40% this year. Expenditure in 2007 on the ten RDTF plans came to over €7m and the increased provision in 2008 will allow for the full year cost of the approx. 155 community projects already in progress and the start of roughly another 40 projects this year.  In 2007, a total of 67 treatment and rehabilitation projects were approved for funding and this is expected to rise to around 90 in 2008.In addition, as part of a €2m funding package announced earlier this year to support rehabilitation and to address cocaine use, an amount of €750,000 was earmarked for rehabilitation-focussed projects.  The funding will be allocated to suitable projects over the coming months.  Under the Premises Initiative Fund, which addresses the accommodation needs of community drugs projects in Task Force areas, nearly €4m has been approved in 2008 for 15 capital projects, a number of which focus on rehabilitation.Local Drugs Task Force areasBallyfermotBallymunBlanchardstownBrayCanal CommunitiesClondalkinCork CityDublin North EastDublin 12Dun Laoghaire / RathdownFinglas / CabraNorth Inner CitySouth Inner CityTallaghtRegional Drugs Task ForcesEast Coast Area RDTF — Dun Laoghaire/ Rathdown and East Wicklow.Northern Area RDTF — North Dublin City and Fingal.South-Western Area RDTF — South Dublin City, South Dublin, Kildare and West Wicklow.Midland RDTF — Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois.Mid-West RDTF — Clare, North Tipperary and Limerick.North-Eastern RDTF — Monaghan, East Cavan, Meath and Louth.North-Western RDTF — West Cavan, Donegal, Sligo and Leitrim.Southern RDTF — Cork County and KerrySouth-Eastern RDTF — Wexford, Carlow, Kilkenny, Tipperary South and Waterford.Western RDTF — Mayo, Roscommon and Galway.

The total number of counties now covered is 23 counties with Kildare, Wexford and Dublin being the only counties not included in CLÁR.  At the time of the CLÁR extensions, Kildare was not selected for inclusion in the Programme, as it did not fit the criteria. Therefore, there is no provision to accept applications for funding under the CLÁR programme.  I have no plans at present for any further expansion of the areas covered by CLÁR.

The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing.  The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies.  In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances of different areas.  My Department liaises regularly with the Department of Environment Heritage and local Government on a range of issues of mutual interest.

We know that the challenges facing our rural communities differ from those in urban areas, and recognise also that strong, vibrant rural communities are essential to the well-being of the entire country.  Ireland is a member of a European Union that prioritises rural development and diversification, and indeed, as the only country with a dedicated Minister with responsibility for Rural Development as a portfolio separate from Agriculture, Ireland is in many respects leading the way in this field.  The Deputy will be aware that the mission of my Department is to promote and support the sustainable, inclusive development of vibrant urban and rural communities.In pursuit of this mission, my Department operates a wide range of schemes designed to tackle issues such as depopulation, deprivation and social isolation.  Details of all these schemes can be found on my Department's website www.pobail.ie.  If the Deputy has any specific questions about these schemes I will be happy to answer them.

This includes the RAPID Programme, which specifically has a regeneration focus for disadvantage areas in both provincial towns and larger urban settings.The RAPID Programme aims to ensure that priority attention is given to tackling the spatial concentration of poverty and social exclusion within 46 designated RAPID areas nationally.  Funding is provided under this programme specifically for the regeneration of these 46 RAPID areas, including funding for projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, community closed-circuit television, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds and multi-use games areas.  I should add that the programme is monitored by a National Monitoring Committee (NMC), which is chaired by myself, and an important element of each NMC meeting is the input received from the individuals and groups on the ground, via the Area Implementation Teams in each of the Rapid areas.In addition, the Deputy will be interested to note that my Department provides funding under the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme (LDSIP) to support Local Area-based Partnerships and Community Partnerships to develop and deliver a wide range of community projects in response to the needs of individual communities, some of which may be of a regenerative nature.  Details in relation to the RAPID and LDSIP Programmes and all the programmes and schemes operated by my Department, including guidelines and eligibility criteria, are available from the Department's website at www.pobail.ie.  It is open to individuals or groups, including those involved in urban regeneration, to make an application for funding under these schemes and programmes.

The second person named applied to be considered for an allocation of entitlements under Category A of the 2005 National Reserve which catered for farmers who inherited land or received land free of charge or for a nominal sum from a farmer who had retired or died by 16 May, 2005 and who had leased out his/her holding to a third party during the reference period 2000 to 2002.  The second person named did not apply under the New Entrant category of the 2005 National Reserve.The second person named was deemed unsuccessful under Category A as he did not submit documentary evidence to indicate that the land he acquired from his father was received free of charge or for a nominal amount.  The second person named subsequently submitted an appeal against this decision and provided additional documentation in support of his appeal.  In all such cases, the procedure is that all contentions put forward in support of an appeal are first of all reviewed within my Department to see whether there is sufficient evidence to warrant any change to the original decision.  In this case the documentation was examined by my Department but did not provide grounds for a change to the original decision.  This appeal was then considered by the Independent Single Payments Appeals Committee who disallowed the appeal.  A letter outlining the decision of the Committee has issued to the second person named.To date the 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 National Reserve has specifically included a New Entrant category for farmers.  The New Entrant category of the 2005, 2006 and 2007 National Reserve schemes catered for farmers who commenced farming after 31 December 2002 or who commenced farming in 2002 but who received no direct payments in respect of that scheme year.  The 2008 National Reserve caters for farmers who commenced farming for the first time after 31 December 2005.  In addition all applicants must also meet certain criteria in relation to farming income and farming qualifications.  As mentioned earlier the second person named has never applied under the New Entrant category of the National Reserve.  However my Department will now contact the second person named directly to determine his eligibility under the New Entrant category of the 2005 National Reserve.

We outlined a strong case for a package of EU-funded measures, as discussed previously with the FIF, to address the current difficulties experienced by fishermen across Europe but, particularly in Ireland.  I was pleased with the response of the EU Fisheries Commissioner Borg, who has undertaken to come back to the issues at the next Council meeting on the 15th July.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	450	Enrolment in individual schools is the responsibility of the managerial authority of those schools and my Department does not seek to intervene in decisions made by schools in such matters.  My Department's main responsibility is to ensure that schools in an area can, between them, cater for all pupils seeking places. This may result, however, in some pupils not obtaining a place in the school of their first choice.It is the responsibility of the managerial authorities of schools that are not in a position to admit all pupils seeking entry to implement an enrolment policy in accordance with the Education Act.  In this regard a board of management may find it necessary to restrict enrolment to children from a particular area or a particular age group or, occasionally, on the basis of some other criterion. In formulating an admissions policy a school must, however, ensure it is lawful.  In particular, it must act in accordance with section 7 of the Equal Status Act 2000.  Where a Board of Management refuses to enrol a student in a school, the parent of the student or, where the student has reached 18 years of age, the student himself or herself, following the conclusion of any appeal procedures at school level, has a statutory entitlement under section 29 of the Education Act to appeal that decision to the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Science.  A committee is established to hear the appeal with hearings conducted with a minimum of formality.  In most cases appeals must be dealt with within 30 days. Where appropriate, the Secretary General may give whatever directions to the Board of Management that are considered necessary to remedy the matter complained of.The Deputy may be aware that during 2007 the Department undertook an audit of school enrolment policies and compiled data on the number of Travellers, newcomers and children with special needs in individual schools.  The results of the audit do not point to a nationwide problem.  However, they highlight significant differences between schools in some geographical areas.  Local factors can have an influence and an element of self-selection can also come into play, as may happen when a newcomer community opts for a particular school.  Nonetheless, certain subtle practices by individual schools can have the effect of discouraging particular groups — such as children with special needs — from applying for places.  We have to ensure that all schools are open to students of all backgrounds.As a starting point there is a need to empower parents with a greater understanding of their rights in relation to the issue of school enrolment.  My Department is currently involved in a consultation with the education partners on this and a range of related issues including:The effectiveness of the current system of appealing against non-enrolment;The consequences that practices such as retaining pre-enrolment waiting lists of several years or favouring children of past-pupils can have for newcomer families;The potential for improved cooperation between schools in a given area with a view to meeting the full needs of their local community; andHow identified problems can best be addressed. The views of the education partners will form an important input to the development of policy responses to the findings of the enrolment audit.The National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) is the statutory agency which can assist parents who are experiencing difficulty in securing a school place for their child. The NEWB can be contacted at National Educational Welfare Board, National Headquarters, 16-22 Green Street, Dublin 7 or by telephone at 01-8738700.  The Deputy may be aware that my Department recently published a report of a major audit of school enrolment practice.  The purpose of the audit, conducted by my Department's Regional Office Service, was to examine the disparities that exist in schools in particular locations in relation to the numbers of pupils enrolled who are newcomers, have special educational needs or are from the Traveller community.  Over half the primary and second level schools in the country were surveyed under the audit.I should emphasise that the statistical information presented requires cautious interpretation, particularly in the context of local factors that could be identified in many instances at primary level (e.g. a concentration of newcomer or traveller children living in a particular area impacting on enrolment in the nearest school).  When interpreted in that context, the statistical information returned does not point to enrolment problems on a system wide scale.  It does, however, identify a number of school clusters where the evidence points to some schools assuming more responsibility for enrolling children of all backgrounds and needs within their local community, than others.In order to ensure that no schools are directly identified and to ensure that "league tables" for particular areas could not be formed, the published information excludes the names and addresses of schools, but groups them within geographical clusters for comparison purposes.  My predecessor has written to the main partners in education setting out some areas for consideration in order to facilitate an informed consultation with the education partners about possible policy measures available to ensure that all schools are welcoming and inclusive to all children of all needs in their own local community.Finally, the Deputy may wish to note that I will host a Conference on the Governance Challenge for Future School Needs tomorrow in the Royal Hospital Kilmainham to consider the implications of new societal diversity on the future organisation of primary schools.  It will be an opportunity for each of the main patron bodies to outline their vision of how the system needs to collectively evolve to respond to the changing circumstances.  The Conference will focus on the particular challenges of ethos and inclusion for patron bodies, under both the new and existing patronage models, in ensuring that the system is appropriately attuned to future demands.  The long term challenges of organising and developing our system of school governance to accommodate new parental demands and aspirations will be subject to consideration. The Conference will also deal with issues of capacity, choice, ensuring inclusion and the implications for enrolment policies.

(IILT) approached my Department earlier this year with a proposal to withdraw from direct tuition for adult refugees and with a request that this tuition be mainstreamed.  IILT envisaged continuing direct tuition for a group of up to 200 programme refugees.  My Department accepted that mainstreaming of service provision was appropriate as it accords with the overall approach to provision of services to migrants as set out in "Migration Nation" — a statement on integration strategy and diversity management which I recently launched. In doing so the Department decided that all provision should be mainstreamed and provided by VECs as it would make no sense to seek to continue with a small element of provision by IILT.The funding allocated to IILT will now be redirected to provide for the continuation of this service through the VEC network.  The Irish Vocational Education Association has confirmed that it is happy to cooperate and collaborate with my Department in delivery of necessary English language services.  The VEC sector has already developed best practice in ESOL (English for Speakers of Other Languages) provision.  The sector is already providing English language services for those whose first language is not English.  At present services are provided to over 12,000 people annually which clearly demonstrates the capacity of the VECs in this area. A further advantage of mainstreaming such provision through the VEC sector is the fact that the VECs have a nationwide network across all counties and cities that can readily provide classes where needed in the country using their facilities in schools and centres.  The information regarding the funding paid to IILT in each year since 2002 is being compiled and will be forwarded to the Deputy when available.

The main emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in these developing areas, as well as delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  In this context, the status of all schools in Swords are being assessed. The school referred to by the Deputy is being included in this assessment.  As is the case with all large capital projects currently on hand within the Unit, their progression will be considered in the context of the multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.

This would be available in the Oireachtas Library or on the Department of Finance web-site.  The Grants-in Aid appear as individual sub-heads of the Department's vote.  The Department of Education and Science vote, in both 2008 and 2007, contained the same ten Grant-in-aid subheads, mainly for Youth services and on the third level side.  Any unexpended balance of the grant-in-aid sums issued from the Vote are not liable to be surrendered to the Exchequer at year end, whereas other unexpended voted grants are normally liable to be surrendered.  My officials would be happy to provide additional information to the Deputy if required.

Emergency works grants are made available to schools most in need of resources as a result of unforeseen emergencies of a capital nature that may arise during the school year.Following assessment of the application from this school and in light of the large number of projects seeking funding from my Department for works of this nature from the budget allocated, it was not possible to provide funding under the Emergency Works Scheme on this occasion for the works sought.  The school authorities should prioritise expenditure from the school's minor capital works grant in order to ascertain if this can be used to address the works in question.

It is incumbent on the school to provide as much detail as possible to the Department on the nature of the emergency and the need for an emergency works grant to be paid to address the emergency.  All applications are assessed by my Department.  In light of the number of projects seeking funding from my Department for works from the budget allocated, it is not possible to provide funding under the Scheme for all applications.  It is open to unsuccessful applicants to write to the Planning and Building Unit in my Department outlining the reasons why they wish their application to be reconsidered.

Since 2000 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from €81.26 per pupil to its current rate of €178.58.  This represents an increase of almost 120% in the standard rate of capitation grant since 2000.  I would like to assure the Deputy that it is a key priority for the Government to improve funding for the day-to-day running costs of schools. For that reason specific commitments in relation to improving school funding form a central part of the education provisions in the Programme for Government.  These commitments are a direct follow on from the clear thrust of Government policy over recent years to improve the position of primary schools in particular.In 2008 alone my Department will be paying around €167m to primary schools to meet their day to day running costs.  The improvements announced in the last budget mean that the combined day-to-day funding for primary schools will increase by €21 to €330 per pupil.  As a result, a primary school with 300 pupils will receive almost €100,000 to meet their running costs.  Furthermore enhanced rates of capitation funding are paid in respect of children with special educational needs who attend special schools or special classes attached to mainstream schools.  The current rates range from €457.00 to €880 per pupil — an increase of 42% from the rate in 2006.The Deputy will be aware that as well as general increases in capitation funding, extra financial supports are being provided to schools under the DEIS action plan for educational inclusion.  In the current school year, DEIS related grants totalling almost €19 million were paid to schools to meet the needs of pupils from disadvantaged backgrounds.  This year, despite the overall difficult economic environment my Department delivered an increase of €15 per pupil on capitation levels in 2008.  I want to assure the Deputy that this Government has a track record of significantly increasing funding for schools and we will continue to build on this as resources permit.

With so many smaller projects having been completed over the past few years, the particular emphasis in 2008 is on providing sufficient school places in developing areas, while also showing the Government's commitment to delivering improvements in the quality of existing primary and post-primary school accommodation throughout the country.  Accordingly my Department is focusing on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and there is no Summer Works Scheme this year.  However, it is intended to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.Primary school authorities may use their annual minor works grant to deal with small scale projects.  In 2006 funding for the minor works grant increased by 44% on the previous year. Around €27m was paid out to primary schools throughout the country last year to enable thousands of small scale works to be completed without the need to interact with my Department.

The number of vacancies in primary schools varies throughout the school year and are managed at local level by individual school Boards of Management. Under the terms of the Education Act, 1998, the Board of Management of a primary school is responsible for the recruitment, selection and appointment of all teachers to a school. Appointments are notified to my Department by the Board of Management.  My Department has no role in the selection and appointment process.There were 615 unqualified teachers out of a cohort of 30,609 teachers at primary level on my Department's payroll in May, 2008.  The corresponding figures for the previous four years were:403 — 2007291 — 2006332 — 2005589 — 2004.Boards of Management are obliged to recruit and employ fully qualified primary teachers for any vacancy in a school, regardless of the duration of the vacancy.

These revised arrangements, which will result in a difference in pension benefit and contribution level for part-time staff, form part of Public Service Pension Reform generally.The revised arrangements will improve access for part-time staff to the superannuation scheme. In addition, where eligible part-time staff, whose pensions are integrated with social welfare benefits, retire from part-time service their occupational pensions will be calculated on the basis of notional full time salary and pro-rata service, where actual service worked is expressed as a proportion of full-time attendance. The revised arrangements also include a change in the method by which integrated occupational pensions are computed. The overall effect of these changes will be to improve occupational pensions for many part-time staff.The revised arrangements are effective in the main from 1 September 2001 for staff in service on that date; however the change in the method by which integrated pensions are computed is effective from 1 January 2004.  My Department will continue to provide information and guidance to Vocational Education Committees as they administer the revised arrangements.

Meath referred to by the Deputy opened in temporary accommodation on the grounds of a GAA club in September 2007. The funding given by the Department to the school authorities for the rental of this temporary accommodation was per normal Department conditions and the Department was not aware of any need for the school authorities to enter into a loan arrangement to allow the school fund this temporary accommodation project.  The Department funded the school authorities for this temporary accommodation upon submission of invoices by the school authorities.This school in question will subsequently be relocating to new temporary accommodation on a new site from September 2008. The funding for this project has been agreed with the school authorities and the owner of the site. The site works cost incurred are being funded by the Department in 2009 with the rental costs for the temporary accommodation being funded as per normal conditions.  In relation to the school in Co. Limerick also referred to by the Deputy, I can confirm that the school recently submitted a proposal to my Department in relation to how its project might proceed this year without incurring Departmental expenditure. This proposal will by examined by the School Planning and Building Unit in my Department and a response will issue directly to the school authority. The examination will be strictly governed by the capital allocation available in 2009 and the priority attaching to the project in this regard. Any other approach would be unfair to schools in a similar situation which cannot provide start up funding for their projects.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	463	As the Deputy will be aware, major improvements have been made in staffing at primary level in recent years. There are now in the region of 6,000 more primary teachers than there were in 2002. By the 2006/07 school year, we had reduced the average class size in our primary schools to 24, while the pupil teacher ratio was 16.4:1, including resource teachers etc. In that year, schools were staffed on the basis of a general rule of at least one classroom teacher for every 28 children. Given that the national average was 24, many schools benefited from much more favourable staffing ratios than this.The Programme for Government sets out the overarching policy position in relation to the provision of additional teachers and on reductions in class size over the life of the Government.  The Programme contains a commitment to increase the number of primary teachers by at least 4000 and on that basis to make further progress on reducing the pupil teacher ratio.  Budget 2008 provided my Department with €4.6 billion or €380 million extra for teacher pay and pensions. This was a very substantial level of additional investment in the terms of the economic environment on which the budget was based. That allocation provides for paying for over 2000 extra primary teachers more than the number in schools when the Government took office last summer. It covers the additional teachers that went into schools last September for the previously announced reduction to a 27 to 1 based staffing schedule along with additional teachers this school year and in the coming school year to meet increasing enrolments and to provide for special needs and the language requirements of newcomer children.This means that in terms of the overall commitment to provide at least 4000 additional teachers the Government in its first two years in office will be well ahead of target.  All Programme for Government commitments to improve public services including those relating to the pupil teacher ratio are contingent on the economic and budgetary environment and the need for prudent expenditure and fiscal management. Even since the presentation of Budget 2008 last December there have been significant alterations in the external and domestic environment. In that context any reasonable observer would regard the fact that the Government has already taken measures that will see the allocation of over 2000 additional teachers to primary schools as a considerable investment, all things considered.

These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) Courses. The Higher Education Grant Scheme is administered by the Local Authorities on behalf of my Department; the other three maintenance grant schemes are administered on a similar basis by the VECs.Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.  The PLC Scheme prescribes the terms and conditions of funding in respect of students attending courses in approved PLC Centres.  Eligibility for grant assistance, in the case referred to by the Deputy, is a matter for the relevant VEC to establish. The candidate referred to by the Deputy should apply, if they have not already done so, to their local VEC to establish eligibility for the course they are applying to do.

One of the main principles of Ireland's immigration system is that persons coming to Ireland should not be an undue burden on the resources of the State.In line with this general principle, the established policy in relation to the attendance of overseas students in Irish primary and second level schools is that visas should only be granted to those who are attending fee paying schools on the basis that to do otherwise would give rise to additional demands on the State.   For students coming from countries that are not visa required, the position must be consistent with that for visa applicants in that students should only be granted residence permits where they are attending fee paying schools.The child of an adult student attending an Irish education establishment would be present in the State as a dependant of that parent.  That parent would be expected to have sufficient resources to provide for him/herself and any family members while they are in the State.  If the child were to be permitted to attend State schools it would be in conflict with the condition of self-sufficiency.  The fact that a parent is attending university and paying the costs of that course of study should not in itself permit their child to access State education services.In terms of legislation, the underlying tenet that a foreign national and any accompanying dependants should not be an undue burden on the State is reflected in section 4 of the Immigration Act 2004 where it is included as one of the reasons why an immigration officer might refuse a person permission to land or be in the State.  There is no provision in our Immigration legislation which allows for the payment of a financial contribution in return for a service provided by a public school.  A review of general policy in this area is now underway.

Part 16 of the Planning and Development Regulations 2001 provides for the licensing of outdoor events.  Article 183 of the Regulations provides that a prescribed event for the purposes of Section 230 is an event at which the audience comprises 5,000 or more people.  The 2001 Regulations received the approval of both Houses of the Oireachtas prior to being made.  I will review the position should the holding of unlicensed outdoor events became generally problematic.Under section 107 of the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992, local authorities are empowered to require measures to be taken to prevent or limit noise from any premises, including any land, and it is understood that these powers have been applied in respect of outdoor activities which did not require a licence under the 2000 Act.

The Report on Seanad Reform sets out comprehensive recommendations for further consideration and action concerning the composition, functions and future role of Seanad Éireann. The Report recommends significant reform of the Seanad electoral system, including the introduction of a 6 seat, directly elected higher education constituency to include all graduates of institutions of higher education in the State holding a primary degree or an equivalent award at level 7 in the National Framework of Qualifications.Currently, 3 of the Seanad University seats are elected by NUI graduates, the remaining 3 are elected by Trinity graduates. The 1979 Seventh Amendment to the Constitution provides the constitutional basis for the expansion of the higher education constituency, however this expansion has not occurred to date.  I consider that Seanad reform should be advanced on the basis of an All-Party, consensus approach, insofar as possible. A first meeting of the All-Party Group on Seanad Reform was held on 18 June 2008. The aim of the Group is to establish, in a small number of meetings, the extent of cross-party agreement on the recommendations of the 2004 Report; I intend that reform efforts should include an initial focus on widening the third level franchise.

Of these, 60 were deemed to be invalid.  My Department's National Parks and Wildlife Service (NPWS) is currently in the process of assessing the 744 valid objections. Approximately three-quarters of these relate to requests to have land removed from the SPA, with the remainder requesting land to be included.  The number of objections per site is as follows:SiteNumber of ObjectionsSlieve Bloom Mountains SPA24Stack’s To Mullaghareirk Mountains, West Limerick Hills and Mount Eagle SPA340Mullaghanish to Musheramore Mountains SPA28Slievefelim to Silvermines Mountains SPA48Slieve Beagh SPA21Slieve Aughty Mountains SPA283There is a two-stage process for assessing objections. The first stage is an internal scientific review of the area under objection.  Following completion of this stage, objectors dissatisfied with the outcome may have their case referred to an independent Appeals Advisory Board.  I envisage that the internal review stage of all objections will be completed by end September 2008.  The timeframe for the second stage review will depend on the number of cases that are referred to the Appeals Advisory Board.

This followed a series of meetings held by Rentokil with South Dublin County Council, the Defence Forces, the Fire Services and An Garda Síochána to develop a solution for the disposal of the cylinders.  South Dublin County Council has taken the lead agency responsibility in relation to this matter.Rentokil, as holder of the cylinders of hydrogen cyanide, has the statutory responsibility to resolve this matter, under the Waste Management Act 1996, the Safety Health and Welfare at Work Acts 1989 and 2005; the Dangerous Substances Act 1972; and Protection of the Environment Act 2003 and accompanying regulations and licensing regimes.  My Department has kept in touch with South Dublin County Council in the matter and has recently written to the local authority requesting that it consider the steps it can take to ensure an appropriate resolution to this issue is taken by Rentokil, including the need to deal conclusively with this matter within the relevant regulatory requirements for waste management and disposal having regard to the hazard involved.Operational matters, including the question of relevant local consultations in connection with this, are the responsibility of the authorities directly concerned.  However, I understand that on 10 June 2008 South Dublin County Council issued a press statement detailing the steps to be taken by the Council as the lead agency in relation to the disposal of the cylinders and that the Council has published a detailed list of ‘Frequently Asked Questions' on its website in relation to the matter.  I understand also that South Dublin County Council continues to work closely with all of the relevant agencies in relation to this matter.

It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the level of funding to be provided for each of the Schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department and to manage the operation of the schemes from within this allocation.  I have already received separate representations requesting a meeting with Clare County Council in relation to these grant schemes and this will take place shortly.

This year alone my Department has provided capital grants towards the development of 22 specific civic amenity sites and has paid €8.274 million in grant assistance to Local Authorities under the Waste Management Infrastructure Capital Grants Scheme.  This scheme, which was launched in 2002, provides supports towards the development of Ireland's waste recycling and recovery infrastructure by providing assistance towards projects such as bring banks, composting facilities, civic amenity sites and materials recovery facilities.The current Scheme is drawing to a close but my Department is in the process of finalising a new Grants Scheme, to be launched later this year, which will ensure that grant assistance continues to be available to encourage Local Authorities to open additional recycling facilities such as civic amenity sites.

Under these new procedures authorities are required to submit an annual programme of works to be funded by internal capital receipts, primarily for the planned maintenance and improvement of their existing housing stock, for approval by the Department.  In December 2007, a further circular letter issued, which provided for an expansion of the categories of allowable expenditure from internal capital receipts under the annual improvement works programme.  My Department has not issued any restrictions on the categories of activity or levels of activity for 2008.

The consultants were appointed following a tender process launched on 29 February on the Government's eTenders website.  The study was commissioned in response to publicly expressed concerns in respect of current transmission line projects being developed by EirGrid, the national independent transmission systems operator.  The purpose of the study is to provide a balanced and unbiased evaluation of all existing technologies, both overhead and underground, for high voltage electricity transmission.The study was conducted on a national basis and is not project specific.  It aims to provide the best available professional advice on the relative merits of constructing and operating overhead transmission lines compared to underground cables, having regard to technical characteristics, reliability, operation and maintenance factors, environmental impact, possible health issues and cost, thereby informing policy decisions on all current and future transmission line projects.  In order to take account of stakeholders' views, written submissions were invited and furnished to the consultants.The report will be published shortly and presented to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Communications, Energy and National Resources.  Ecofys have confirmed their availability to present their report to the Joint Oireachtas Committee when required.  The question of attendance by any group, at meetings of the Joint Oireachtas Committee is a matter for the Committee itself.  I am fully supportive of the Joint Committee's commitment to full and objective debate of all the complex issues and to hear the views of all sides.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie.  The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  In that regard my Department has undertaken initiatives to address the gaps in broadband coverage.  These included providing grant-aid under the Group Broadband Scheme (GBS) and ongoing investment in Metropolitan Area Networks (MANs).Although broadband is now widely available in Ireland there are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  These areas are being addressed by the National Broadband Scheme (NBS), which will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved including any unserved areas in North Tipperary and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband are met.  The first phase of the NBS procurement process (Pre-Qualification Questionnaire (PQQ)) is now complete.  The remaining candidates have been engaged in "Competitive Dialogue" with my Department and are developing their proposed solutions to meet my Department's requirements.Judicial Review proceedings regarding certain elements of the NBS mapping process took place on 10 and 11 June 2008 in the High Court and a judgement is awaited.  While the outcome of the Judicial Review cannot be anticipated, it is currently expected that a preferred bidder for the NBS will be selected in September 2008, with roll out to commence as soon as possible thereafter.  Statistics on broadband penetration in Ireland are gathered centrally by ComReg and published in their quarterly reports which are available at www.comreg.ie.  There is no breakdown available for individual towns.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-06-26 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The regulation of ESB electricity tariffs and BGÉ gas tariffs is the statutory responsibility of the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) under the Electricity Regulation Act. I have no function in setting these tariffs.  The CER has publicly indicated that it expects the increases in international fuel prices to have a consequential impact on electricity and gas tariffs in the autumn.  Rising energy costs are a major concern for all sectors of the economy and for consumers.  It is a major concern for the European Union and globally.  There are limits to what Ireland can do in relation to global wholesale gas, oil and coal prices.  The Government's Energy Policy White Paper and the Programme for Government set out the actions being taken to deliver security, sustainability and competitiveness of energy supply.To reduce our dependence on imported fossil fuels and so lessen the impact of high prices, we must use energy far more efficiently and increase the energy generated from renewable resources.  We have set ourselves ambitious targets of generating 15% of our electricity needs from renewable sources by 2010 and 33% by 2020.  Estimates suggest that we achieved 10% in 2007 and are on course to reach or surpass our 2010 target.Householders can individually reduce their dependence on oil or gas for their heating needs by investing in renewable heating technology such as solar panels, wood pellet boilers and heat pumps.  The Greener Homes Scheme provides grants to householders to assist with this investment. In addition, the Power of One Street initiative has clearly demonstrated that householders can save in excess of 20% of their energy costs by becoming more energy efficient.Those living in older homes tend to have higher heating costs because of the poor insulation standards of their homes.  With rising energy costs, this can have a significant effect on the health and quality of life for low-income households.  Sustainable Energy Ireland's (SEI) Low Income Housing Programme was established to systematically address the problem of fuel poverty.  Its core strategy is to improve the energy performance of low-income homes through its Warmer Homes Scheme.  I have already increased the budget for the Low Income Housing Programme to €4 million in 2008 and this will enable SEI to fund insulation upgrades for 4,000 vulnerable households this year.I also launched the pilot Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is incentivising householders in the pilot areas to improve the energy efficiency of their homes through insulation upgrades and other measures.  SEI estimates that those who avail of the scheme can expect to save in the region of €500 on their energy bills every year.The CER also plays a role in protecting vulnerable customers in the energy markets. Under the European Communities (Internal Market in Electricity) Regulations 2005 the CER was tasked with ensuring that there are adequate safeguards to protect vulnerable customers, including measures to help customers avoid disconnection.  The CER has set out guidelines for the protection of household electricity and natural gas customers, particularly the elderly, customers relying on life support equipment and those with disabilities.Energy efficiency has a significant role to play in reducing energy costs for the enterprise sector.  Large companies as well as small and medium size enterprises can very rapidly reduce their energy bills by 10%, while significantly greater savings are possible through economically rational investments and participation in the various energy efficiency programmes run by SEI.  These programmes are tailored to the specific needs of businesses, large and small.  Through these schemes SEI assists companies in identifying and implementing actions to mitigate the impacts of rising energy costs.  In that context, funding of €4 million for SEI's industry energy efficiency programme has been provided this year, allowing SEI to significantly increase the coverage of their programmes.  To further assist the business sector, the Minister for Finance also introduced new tax incentives this year to support companies to purchase the most energy efficient equipment for use within their business.

Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated, where appropriate, by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation, ComReg.  Details of broadband suppliers, prices and locations throughout the country are available on www.broadband.gov.ie.  Broadband can be provided to towns and premises over various platforms including telephone line (known as DSL), wireless, mobile, cable, satellite and fibre.  The most appropriate methods of using these platforms to connect to premises are matters for the relevant service provider providing the service to the premises.Whilst providing broadband connectivity to towns and areas is therefore primarily a matter for the private sector, the widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.

In 2006, CER directed Bord Gáis Éireann (BGÉ) to implement a new Gas Connections Policy, which determines the economic viability of connecting towns to the gas network.  The new policy allows for the appraisal of a town either on its own or as part of a regional group of towns.BGÉ is carrying out a comprehensive review of towns being considered for connection to the national gas network.  The review is being carried out in three phases, with Phase 3 of the study having commenced late last year.  This Phase includes Boyle, Roscommon, Ballaghaderreen and Strokestown in County Roscommon and Carrick-on-Shannon in County Leitrim.  The final report is due to be published in late 2008 and it will outline what towns or groups of towns are economically viable for connection, within the revised connection policy criteria.
