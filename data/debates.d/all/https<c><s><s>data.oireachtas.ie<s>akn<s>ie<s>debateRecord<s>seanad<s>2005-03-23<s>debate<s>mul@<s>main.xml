          <p eId="para_1">I have received notice from Senator O'Toole that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_2">The need for the Minister for Education and Science to give full recognition to further education, including post-leaving certificate courses, as a specific sector of the education system, and to indicate her vision for the development of further education and her timescale for the implementation of the McIver report.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">I have also received notice from Senator Mooney of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_4">The need for the Minister for Foreign Affairs to outline his views on the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress to pass anti-secession laws which, if implemented, would threaten the stability of the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">I have also received notice from Senator Coghlan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_6">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to resolve the difficulties regarding the Firies Scartaglen southern section B water scheme pipe project as it affects Rathmore, where demand exceeds supply by approximately 25,000 gallons per day, thereby leaving people with little or no water for domestic use.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">I have also received notice from Senator Bannon of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_8">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to explain the prohibition on a Nigerian woman, a qualified nurse, from engaging in full-time employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">I have also received notice from Senator John Paul Phelan of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_10">The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to ensure that the commitment entered into by his predecessor with the Comerama workforce on 12 December 2002 regarding their entitlements under new redundancy payment legislation is fully and promptly honoured.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">I have also received notice from Senator Leyden of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_12">The need for the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children to outline the arrangements proposed regarding the regional health fora and advisory panels provided for in Part 8 of the Health Act 2004, with particular reference to size and composition, date of appointment and the rules and procedures that will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_13">I have also received notice from Senator Kitt of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_14">The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the commencement of the Milltown sewerage scheme, in Tuam, County Galway.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">I have also received notice from Senator Tuffy of the following matter:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_16">The need for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to give an update on the case of a student, details supplied, and the urgent need for compassionate consideration of his situation to permit him to return to Ireland to complete his leaving certificate studies; and the steps to be taken to ensure his welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment. I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Toole, Mooney and Coghlan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. Senators Bannon, John Paul Phelan, Leyden, Kitt and Tuffy may give notice on another day of the matters they wish to raise.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_20">Some years ago, after a strong campaign in this House launched by Senator Quinn, the Government accepted the principle of penalty points as a means to reduce road fatalities and change driver behaviour. However, we now have an admission from Garda members that they are being directed to go to certain areas of the country to push up detection rates, thereby increasing penalties for drivers who were slightly over the limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">We are all familiar with the situation described some years ago by the former Senator, Willie Farrell, as a garda with a hairdryer stood at a junction, wishing to take out a number of motorists. However, there is a major difference between proper enforcement of the penalty points system and merely frustrating motorists in the manner that was eloquently described by gardaí at their recent conference. Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Transport or the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this matter in the coming months, particularly as Garda time is being wasted in trying to frustrate motorists in the way I have described?</p>
          <p eId="para_22">The Government should fully support Commissioner Charlie McCreevy's attempt to introduce the services directive through the European Commission. I accept that there are difficulties in France at present because of the impending referendum but logic demands that if there is a single economic zone, there should also a single services market to match it. Senator Ross and others indicated yesterday that a cartel has operated in the banking sector in this country for many years. Competition is the best way to take that cartel out of operation. It is only right that European consumers should be able to obtain the benefits offered by service providers throughout the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Commissioner McCreevy is correct to push this agenda. I accept that it was initiated by his predecessor but Mr. McCreevy has inherited responsibility for steering through the directive. Due to the current difficulties in France, it is crucial that the Commission and the Council support Commissioner McCreevy in his attempts to introduce greater competition and greater protection for consumers as a means of taking on cartels and other protected interests in the European Union.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_24">I completely reject the criticism of the Garda. This is the kind of argument constantly used by politicians. Both sides of the House passed the legislation in question. The legislation was introduced by one side and was implemented by the other side following the change of Government in 1996. Attitudes changed on both sides immediately.</p>

          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_8">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_27">As I understand it, Senator Brian Hayes said that gardaí are being directed by certain members of the force to increase the number of penalty points given. When the legislation was introduced, the only objections to the speed limits came from these benches. Senator Ross and I proposed that there should also be a capacity to have a minimum speed limit and that this power should be given to local authorities. There was no support for our proposal. People are now shedding crocodile tears and criticising gardaí for implementing the stupid laws that we passed. Some of the speed limits are far too low and some of them are far too high. It is up to us to change those limits and not to blame the Garda for implementing legislation passed by the Houses, however well or officiously they do it. It is too easy to blame those at the end of the line. As Senator Brian Hayes stated, individual gardaí operating speed monitoring equipment will be held to blame. That is understandable. However, whether it is on his or her volition or on the authority or at the direction of senior gardaí, he or she is merely implementing a law that was passed with acclamation from both sides of the House. The idea that more discretion should be given to local authorities should not even be entertained.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Another issue of relevance this week is the circulation of frightening statistics on class sizes and teacher numbers by the Irish National Teachers Organisation. I support the point that Senator Browne made yesterday that the Minister for Education and Science should provide an indication of her thinking on class sizes, special educational needs, rural schools, etc. The Leader will be sympathetic about these issues because she tried to address them when there were far fewer resources available. There will be 1,700 teachers available for employment in primary schools in 2006. If a situation arises where there are untrained personnel in schools, 1,000 or more teachers unemployed and excessively large classes, there will be absolute outrage on the part of parents.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_14">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_33">I do not wish to incur Senator O'Toole's wrath by criticising the Garda but it would be useful if the Leader could obtain information from the Minister for Transport about the intensity of road traffic enforcement on those roads identified as giving rise to the greatest number of fatalities. Anecdotal evidence indicates that there is fairly intensive speed limit patrolling on dual carriageways and motorways. Is there a Garda policy which states that speed limits should be most rigorously enforced, as ought to be the case, on those stretches of national primary routes that have been identified as having the highest fatality rates? This is not a criticism, it is merely a valid question that deserves an answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">Although it took two efforts on the part of the Department of Transport to confirm this, I understand that all heavy goods vehicles are meant to be fitted with regulators which prevent them from exceeding 55 mph. When I first inquired about this with the Department, I was informed that there is no such regulation. The Road Haulage Association indicated that the regulation does exist. When I checked again with the Department, I was informed that the regulation does exist and I was kindly supplied with a copy of it. Everybody's experience is that HGVs travel at 60 mph on main roads and at 70 mph on motorways. I regularly drive from Cork to Dublin and I am in a position to state that 90% of these vehicles drive in excess of the maximum speed of which they are supposed to be capable. Who has the responsibility of enforcing speed limits for heavy goods vehicles?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_15">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_35">One of the irritations that arises in respect of road traffic and policing is the lack of consistency in terms of enforcing the law. People get away with offences in certain areas which they cannot get away with in others. Reference was made previously to the position vis-a-vis the Naas dual carriageway and, in particular, the stretch thereof from Naas to Clondalkin. There is a 60 km/h speed limit operating on that route. With the exception of tractors, every other vehicle travels faster on that road than they did when the 60 mph speed limit applied. People know they can exceed the speed limit with impunity. They are also aware that if they slowed down to 36 mph, there would be utter chaos. We must ask whether local authorities are living in the real world when it comes to the speed limits being introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">With regard to penalty points, it was originally stated this morning that the Garda sergeant in question was asking for a change in legislation. However, he indicated at the end of the programme that he was not seeking this but rather a change in practice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianHayes" eId="spk_16">
          <from>Mr. B. Hayes</from>
          <p eId="para_37">That is correct. He was seeking a change in practice.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnDardis" eId="spk_17">
          <from>Mr. Dardis</from>
          <p eId="para_38">On the issue of trucks, people who travel regularly on the stretch of road to which I refer will be aware that a large number of trucks do not have rear number plates. How can gardaí detect anything in respect of these vehicles if they do not have any identification marks on them? We could possibly debate this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">The single market in services could perhaps form part of a debate on the Stability and Growth Pact and general European issues. The Single Market has been in place for many years. We are meant to have an open market in terms of capital goods, services and labour but it appears that such a market does not apply in respect of services. The need for such a market is obvious. Commissioner Wallström came before the Joint Committee on European Affairs last week and I questioned her about inconsistencies in the EU. I referred to the case of Intel in north Kildare which could have received assistance and which seemed to qualify therefor, particularly on the basis that it is a high-tech operation. Large countries such as France and Germany disregard the provisions of the Stability and Growth Pact with impunity but Ireland was rapped on the knuckles when it breached the pact. The effect of what is happening will be to drive up interest rates and inflation in the European Union, which will have a direct effect on Ireland. If the Union is serious about having the EU constitution adopted, it should consider some of these matters.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_18">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_40">I support Senator Brian Hayes, who was responding to statements made at the conference of the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors. I am glad this was spoken about because, at the end of the day, the association desires a sense of tolerance towards the restrictions imposed. Gardaí have favourite locations. As the Cathaoirleach knows, their favourite target in our county is the new dual carriageway outside Limerick, where they actually stop people before 8 a.m. on Sundays to penalise them. Perhaps the gardaí are being directed from on high but there must be a sense of tolerance.</p>
          <p eId="para_41">Some of the changes in the area of speed limits have been silly. There is an 80 km/h limit on most regional roads but a plethora of these signs were erected on narrow culs-de-sac, which possibly did not have speed limits in the past. People were complaining about speeding in these areas and now 80 km/h signs have been erected.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelFinucane" eId="spk_20">
          <from>Mr. Finucane</from>
          <p eId="para_43">The signs have remained in these areas despite the issue being brought to the attention of local authorities. I criticise the stupidity and folly of this. We understand the necessity for the penalty points system but there must also be a sense of tolerance and fair play. This is what the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors was seeking.</p>
          <p eId="para_44">I raised the issue of the weighted type of assistance that has been introduced for special needs on a recent Adjournment at the Cathaoirleach's courtesy, which began as a serious matter and will become even more so. Whether a report is from speech and language therapists or occupational psychologists, if it mentions the words "mild mental handicap", the people involved will be automatically categorised as ineligible for special one-to-one tuition. Dyslexics who previously received two and a half hours every week spread over five days will no longer be entitled to this and will be placed in a group environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">The Minister for Education and Science stated she was carrying out further research on the issue. As a result, what will be implemented at local level from September 2005 onwards is in accordance with the directing guidelines. As soon as the Minister finished her research there was a positive statement on the matter. We have all encountered frustrated parents. There is much talk about special needs and now is our opportunity to put it into positive practice. The changes that have taken place will have negative consequences for the education system and will lead to problems in the future.</p>

        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_21">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_46">Will the Leader arrange a debate with the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment on the commercial ethics and social responsibility of public limited companies, particularly those in receipt of State aid and tax incentives? Further to the Bank of Ireland "slash and burn" practice witnessed in recent days, Kerry Group, a public limited company, has decided to terminate the contracts of 12 small milk hauliers in the Clare region. This type of behaviour is reprehensible and must not be allowed to continue. A debate in this House would be useful. I promote the withdrawal of State aid and tax incentives from companies that dominate their positions and flout the law in this way.</p>

If we have reached a point where the enforcers of the law ask for a change in practice, it behoves us to listen to them.

We should discuss the system if the gardaí are concerned about the imposition of penalty points.

          <p eId="para_54">However, there is much seemingly uninterpretable and conflicting evidence that these points do not save lives and some of this evidence comes from the Department of Transport. It would be useful if the Minister told this House what are the latest statistics or conclusions of the Government on the practice of penalty points. I believe they save lives.</p>

On another topic, the Senators who spoke about the serious developments with regard to the breach in the Stability and Growth Pact in Europe deserve to be heard. There must be a hearing because, as Senator Dardis said, Ireland received a serious ticking off for breaching the rules. Why should we put up with the bullying tactics of France and Germany? Why are there different rules for the French and the Germans? There is no point in being an equal member of a community dominated by the French and the Germans. The rules are breached every time their economies experience trouble or they have electoral and referendum reasons for doing something. It is time to send the message that we are not prepared to put up with this and will vote against the European constitution if we have to. We do not wish to do so but we are opposed to such behaviour.</p>

The date was 14 September 1607 and the place of departure was Rathmullan, County Donegal. This was of major importance to Ireland as it drew a symbolic line between the Gaelic way of life, with its richness of tradition and the new modern Ireland, with its centralised control and imported customs. I am asking the Government, through the Leader, to put in place adequate resources to allow the group in Rathmullan to organise a celebration of the 400th anniversary of the flight of the earls. This is not just a once off event; it is a symbolic occasion involving people North and South. This event will encourage and facilitate co-operation between people on both sides of the Border. The only way we will move forward, in terms of peace and reconciliation in Northern Ireland, is if we have co-operation. This symbolic celebration could contribute towards relieving the political stalemate and there are two and a half years in which to organise it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_81">Senator Scanlon has asked for a debate on sustainable development. In that context, the ESRI report published this morning shows that County Leitrim has the highest level of second homes in the country. The excellent Government initiative to repopulate the county through tax incentives has now proven to be an opportunity for speculators and those with plenty of money. While these people are welcome, the initiative has not addressed the repopulation issue. In the light of that development, it is ironic that County Leitrim will be split politically because there is a lower population base than there should be, despite the fact that the Government initially set about repopulating the county through the tax incentive scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Perhaps tax incentives of this nature should have been more focused so that the population would have increased. As a result of the tax incentives, one in four houses is owned by wealthy people from outside the county, which means that those who are living in the county or wish to live there cannot afford to buy houses in Leitrim. In that context, I ask the Leader for an urgent debate on sustainable development in order that we can examine this aspect of the tax incentive scheme. It is a sad state of affairs that County Leitrim will be split politically at a time when we would have hoped that there would be more people living there.</p>

          <p eId="para_124">It was interesting that the focus this morning was on speed, and the emphasis on speed limits at particular points on the road, all arising from the recent comments of Garda sergeants and inspectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">Senator Brian Hayes pointed out that the problem is the operation of the law rather than the law itself. He added that there seems to be a compulsory aspect to producing tickets and fines and so on. It would be useful to debate this matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">It was heartening to hear Senator Brian Hayes supporting our EU Commissioner on the services directive. I agree that, true to form, he is quite rightly stirring the pot.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">Senator O'Toole said we cannot complain about the traffic legislation but that the complaint was about its implementation. He took up the Irish National Teachers Organisation's point about class sizes. We all received invitations to schools in our areas during the week and that process continues, which is helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_128">Senator Ryan spoke about the intensity with which the gardaí enforce speed limits<b>. </b>He also mentioned that HGVs are able to pass people proceeding at a reasonable speed. Indeed, when they pass, one inhales the fumes from their exhaust. Senator Dardis referred to the inconsistency in enforcing speed limits. I see the problem as the consistency with which certain places are perpetually patrolled but I have received neither a penalty point nor a summons.</p>

As it currently stands, the interpretation of that subsection suggests that the fitness to practise committee can require the applicant to give evidence against himself or herself.

The option has been given to the fitness to practise committee where it is considered appropriate to call for direct testimony from the complainant over and above the original complaint, which is usually a letter or whatever. I have been advised by the Attorney General that, in the context of the current legislative framework and the concerns that have been outlined, the normal procedures are being enshrined in this legislation. People who make a complaint can follow it through, but one is not complaining against oneself. One must give evidence, but one is not giving evidence against oneself. One gives evidence in the way in which one perceives things have been done. It is for the fitness to practise committee to make an adjudication on the rights and wrongs of the case. While I appreciate that the Senator comes from that ilk, and I do not come from that persuasion, I have been advised that the legislation is legally sound as it stands.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">I tabled this amendment in previous legislation. I was very intent on tabling the amendment in order to insert the words "or affirmation". As I explained previously, there are a whole host of reasons for tabling the amendment. For example, the oath might not have the same standing for someone who does not belong to a religion or believe in God as it would for others who have a faith or practise a religion. Given her advice from the Attorney General, the Minister's response will probably not favour the amendment. However, I must reiterate the case for differentiating between the two.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">Our information is that the matter is not fully covered by the Interpretation Act. This is solid legal advice available to me and my back-up parliamentary research team.

Second, oaths are sworn far too easily. The most amazing evidence is given under oath, after which contradictory evidence is brought forward both in the courts and in tribunals. As a practising member of the Christian church, I hate to see any denigration of the Bible. I would prefer to include the word "affirmation" rather than "oath".</p>

          <p eId="para_165">This issue was raised during the debate on the Civil Registration Bill. The advice is still that the Interpretation Act indicates that an oath in legislation can be construed as including an affirmation. I appreciate what the Senator is saying but, unfortunately, this is how things are currently. There is always someone who will find out the truth in the end, even though one may have to wait a while. I am advised that the Interpretation Act may have to be considered within this context. As it is in existence since 1937, perhaps the legislation should be reviewed. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is the person who will introduce reform of the legislation. While I appreciate there has been a change in recent years, as it stands, the advice from the Attorney General is that the oath is inclusive of an affirmation.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">Given that the Senator raised the issue on a number of occasions, he might introduce a Private Members' Bill on the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">Senator Henry raised an important point in regard to the lack of value people may place on taking an oath and the manner in which people can be disrespectful towards taking an oath. The majority of good thinking people are not like that, but there are people who will say anything to get them out of a situation. This has been borne out in recent years in evidence given in high profile cases by high profile people. There has been a direct contradiction in evidence given under oath and factual information, which comes out at some stage. This demonstrates the fact that the oath and the Interpretation Act need to be revisited. Our information is that the Interpretation Act does not cover this issue. We will table amendments until there is a review of the Interpretation Act or until the area is examined and affirmation is possibly inserted. The Parliamentary Counsel could perhaps use this standard insertion in future legislation. However, we will revisit the matter on Report Stage.</p>

The penalty provided for under this section relates to advising, warning or censuring a registered person following fitness to practise proceedings. This sanction could be imposed either in conjunction with or in substitution for any other penalties. Even when imposed on its own, however, it represents a finding against a registered person and, as such, the person will be named in the council's annual report. On this basis, the person should have the same appeal provisions available as for other potential sanctions and the amendment is designed to achieve this end. A consequential amendment arises in respect of section 81(1) to allow, in the interests of fairness, people to appeal sanctions as well as penalties.</p>

          <p eId="para_176">As it stands, section 84 is flawed because there is no test, criteria or requirement by which the council can judge a person should be struck off the register by reason of having been convicted of an offence. Our amendment uses the wording set out in section 48(2)(<i>d</i>), which makes it clear that merely being convicted of an offence is not sufficient and that the offence must be one which, in the opinion of the council, renders it inappropriate for the person to practise veterinary medicine or nursing, whichever the case may be.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">This amendment might go too far in that it would require the council to demonstrate how the ability of a person to practise has been affected by a decision on a matter by the courts which might be totally unrelated to and outside the person's veterinary practice. However, it must be noted that we are referring to a conviction for a serious matter which, if the person was to continue to be registered, could bring the profession into disrepute. It should also be noted that the person affected has the full appeals procedure available to them and, in the final analysis, the courts would determine whether the decision of the council is reasonable.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">I have some concerns regarding this issue in that it may be taking matters too far. An offence may or may not be serious and may not really interfere with a person's ability to practise as a veterinarian. It could be restrictive. The council must consider situations where serious issues that would have an impact on a person's ability to carry out their work professionally arise. However, the courts will determine what will be the consequences. There are issues of a personal nature which would not prevent a person from working as a veterinary practitioner. One might tie people up and that would be somewhat unfair.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">The wording addresses the situation from the viewpoint of the offence, in that the offence itself would render whether the person was fit to practise. The wording addresses the offence and not personal issues. There is currently nothing to allow the council to make such a judgment. We are referencing section 48(2)(<i>d</i>), which uses general wording to make it clear that merely being convicted of an offence is not sufficient and that the offence renders whether the person convicted of that offence would be unfit to practise as a veterinary surgeon, practitioner or nurse. The offence itself renders whether the person will be allowed to continue in their profession.</p>

There are offences of a criminal nature, such as drink driving, which result in prosecution but which may not interfere with a person's ability to practise as a vet. The council may make the decision and it would be obliged to do so if the offence was serious. No one wants the practice brought into disrepute. In light of the fact that there are so many vets on the council, that would be in the back of their minds and they would not want it to happen. I have given the council flexibility but I would rather not be too prescriptive because there are always individual cases and we must show recourse. People have the opportunity to go court if they do not agree with the sanctions.</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_181">This amendment involves a considerable amount of work. I am providing for the first time for the recognition of veterinary nurses. This has been broadly welcomed and recognises the fact that nurses increasingly play a role in the treatment of animals. The demand for veterinary nurses is further evidenced by the fact that a course is now available in UCD for those wishing to qualify as veterinary nurses and the first tranche of students will graduate this summer. I am anxious that the Bill will provide a basis for the profession of veterinary nursing to develop to its maximum potential, consistent with the requirements of public health and animal health and welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Some concern was expressed by Senators during Second Stage about an aspect of the definition of the practice of veterinary nursing. This concerns a number of procedures which could be carried out as the Bill put it, "other than in the presence of a veterinary practitioner". Since the Second Stage debate I and my Department have had further consultations with the Veterinary Council, representatives of the profession and the veterinary nurses. Arising from this I am glad I am in a position to accept the substance of Senator Henry's amendment and that of Senator McCarthy which will replace the term "other than in the presence of" with "under the direction of a veterinary practitioner". In the circumstances it is not necessary to specify supervision, as proposed by the amendment. Accordingly, the Bill will provide for two categories of procedure which may be carried out by a veterinary nurse, namely, those that may be carried out in the presence of a veterinary practitioner and those that may be carried out under the direction of the veterinary practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">A range of technical amendments are being introduced to improve the definition of "veterinary nursing practice" by further qualifying some of the terms, by restricting some activities to be done in the presence of a vet and by deleting others that do not fall within the definition of nursing practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The second dimension of amendment No. 99 proposes a number of technical amendments to section 92 to better define the practice of veterinary nursing. These amendments take account of some useful contributions received from the veterinary faculty in UCD, consultations with the profession and veterinary advice within my Department. In making these amendments I am glad to be able to take on board the substance of amendment No. 102 to section 92(<i>b</i>)(iv), tabled by Senators Henry and McCarthy, in regard to X-rays. In framing the specific wording for this amendment I have taken particular account of the advice of the veterinary faculty.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">As regards the other amendments I propose to make to section 92(2), reflected in many cases of advice from the veterinary college, I wish to clarify and qualify certain technical terms. I also propose that certain procedures in the area of administration of medicines which require veterinary supervision or where a vet would need to be on hand to deal with any adverse consequence could be administered by nurses only in the presence of the veterinary practitioner. On the other hand, I propose to delete reference to certain forms of administration, for example, those administered orally which need not be reserved for veterinary nurses. In regard to animal medicines generally, there is specific legislation governing the distribution, sale and administration and this, in any event, will apply.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">I believe the various technical changes I propose to make to section 92(2) will improve the definition of "veterinary nursing practice". I express my gratitude to those who made useful contributions in the process. A consequential cross-referencing amendment, namely, amendment No. 105 to section 92(3) arises as a consequence of the above amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">I am advised there is a textual error in amendment No. 105. It relates to line 25 where <i>“section (2)(b)</i>” should read “<i>subsection (2)(b)”.</i>
                    </p>
          <p eId="para_188">I wish to refer to amendments Nos. 103 and 105. Senators Coonan and Phelan have tabled amendments Nos. 103 and 105 to the provisions governing the carrying out by veterinary nurses of minor medical or surgical procedures. The effect of these amendments would be that ministerial regulations would be required before nurses could become active in this area. I draw the attention of Senators to the amendment under which nurses will carry out functions of this type under the direction of a veterinary practitioner. The published version of the Bill also provides for a definition of "minor" in the context of medical or surgical procedures. In view of this and given that we are not adopting a similar approach in respect of the other tasks which a nurse may carry out under direction of a veterinary practitioner, I do not see why it is necessary to provide for ministerial regulation making powers in this instance.</p>

          <p eId="para_189">I will not ask the Minister to repeat any of her reply. On the issue of veterinary nursing there is a general school of thought that the profession has been recognised in that people, out of a love for animals, study to become veterinary nurses. A diploma course is available in Ballsbridge.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_191">Up to then there was a diploma course in only one of the institutes of technology, perhaps Athlone. In general, this profession which is associated with veterinary practice is being recognised. There are courses that offer the facility to those who wish to become veterinary nurses and there is a good chance of obtaining a third-level qualification in that area. The veterinary nurse is an integral part of any veterinary practice as is the general nurse in the surgery of a general practitioner. It is an important role.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">Our amendment No. 101 seeks after the word "practitioner" to insert "but under the direction and supervision of such a practitioner,". This goes back to the point made last evening in regard to supervision, of not allowing a person to carry out procedures and to conduct elements of the practice if the need arises. There is also an element of supervision which ensures that the person is able to operate to a high professional standard and the advantage that one is supervised by a member of the profession who has sufficient experience. It also provides that people will operate within safe parameters and outlines what is regarded as allowable.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">The second amendment in that grouping, amendment No. 99, deals with the taking of images by X-ray. Section 92 (iv) provides for the taking of images by X-ray. Senator Henry's amendment seeks its deletion and the insertion of a reference to radiology equipment. That is a broader and more applicable reference. I am not sure if that is the advice the Minister has received from the veterinary faculty.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryHenry" eId="spk_128">
          <from>Dr. Henry</from>
          <p eId="para_194">The amount of work that has gone into this amendment is incredible and I congratulate all those who put it together because it covers everything extremely well. It is important to remember veterinary nursing is a profession in its own right. It was always interesting to note there were far greater penalties for pretending to be a vet than pretending to be a medical doctor. I would not like if veterinary nurses were more supervised by members of the veterinary profession than medical nurses are by members of the medical profession. The balance has been well struck here.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">It is worth considering Senator McCarthy's point about radiology equipment. The important point in regard to the taking of images by X-ray is that it would cover CAT scans. However, does it cover MRI scans which are not pictures by X-ray? I do not see why they should have someone supervising them. This will become more important because it gives soft tissue information. With animals, soft tissue information can be very important, especially in very valuable animals. I suggest the Minister look at this issue unless she is informed that everything within that department is all right.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">X-ray departments and MRI departments are usually separated and I would hate to think we had to revisit this excellent Bill on such a small issue. I ask the Minister to look at that issue between now and Report Stage. I cannot get over the provision for administering medication intraosseously, enterically, by inhalation or by intravenous injection. The whole issue has been gone into with such care. I did not realise they would give intraosseous medication. If one has osteomyelitis, perhaps it is best thing to do. Perhaps it should be done with humans also. I congratulate whoever drew up that amendment as it is very thorough.</p>

The important words in amendment No. 99 are "while assisting and in the presence of a veterinary practitioner" and, second, "under the direction of a veterinary practitioner". There is another set of operations or procedures that a veterinary nurse may carry out.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">With reference to a previous section which was dealt with last night, will the Minister clarify the regulation that a person employed by the farming community can carry out certain procedures by way of emergency treatment? Does this mean that a farmer could employ a veterinary nurse, for example, in the calving or lambing season and that said nurse will be allowed carry out these procedures?</p>

I acknowledge the work done by Senators Henry, McCarthy and Coonan. As far as I can see, with the exception of the query from Senator McCarthy, the Minister and her officials seem to have drafted the challenge and come up with answers that seem to have solved it.

        <speech by="#MaryCoughlan" eId="spk_132" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food">
          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_201">We must allow a balance between both nursing and veterinary practice. It was on this basis that we changed the terms "under the direction of" and "in the presence of". The phrase "in the presence of a veterinary practitioner" refers to when particular procedures are carried out. The term "under the direction of" could refer to an administrative matter or to stitching or some minor procedure. If the Bill was to say "under the direction of" and "under the supervision of", then the vet would always have to be present with the nurse.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">As almost all of those involved in the profession of veterinary nurse are women, the nurse would never have the freedom to do certain things which she is more than capable of doing without the supervision of a veterinary practitioner. We have aimed to achieve the balance. There is a lot to be said for giving some freedom to nursing practitioners, particularly as they have particular skills. It is similar to the situation that obtains in respect of doctors who possess all the skills but who sometimes do not wish to perform certain procedures. A doctor is hardly ever asked to stitch a wound and often prefers a nurse to do it. There must be a balance between the two professions. This is the first time recognition is being given to veterinary nurses.</p>
          <p eId="para_203">Many people are interested in pursuing this profession, which complements the work of the veterinary practitioner. In reply to Senator McCarthy, this is the reason I did not wish to include supervision because this would tie them down completely and they would require to be constantly supervised. In my view, the phrase "with the direction of" the veterinary practitioner is preferable. The vet will be familiar with what people can and cannot do, both legislatively and practically. They should be allowed to have the freedom afforded under the direction of a veterinary practitioner.</p>
          <p eId="para_204">There is a little confusion about the other issue. There is nothing to stop a farmer employing a veterinary nurse but the nurse is only allowed carry out certain procedures because, under this legislation, other procedures would be outside the ambit because the vet would be required to supervise or give direction. Veterinary nurses carry out procedures in the small animal practice but it would be rare for them to carry out procedures on farm animals. I wonder whether it would be a useful employment for a veterinary nurse to work in the farming sector. There is nothing to say, however, that it cannot be done, as long as it is within the ambit of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">There has been some confusion about what a person can do in an emergency as opposed to a routine situation. Normal animal husbandry is not being tied up in this legislation because this would be impractical. We are trying to strike a balance between normal, day-to-day farm work and what needs to be done on a professional basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">The issue of X-rays also caused me some angst. The Department received further advice from the university faculty. MRI scans are usually done in a hospital. There are occasions when scans are provided by farm relief services, for example, and they would need to be excluded as a consequence if this was included in radiological equipment. It was in order to provide that flexibility that this has been introduced and as a result of advice from the dean of the faculty.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_207">The Minister has clarified most of the issues in respect of veterinary nurses and this is to be welcomed. She referred to animal husbandry. A farmer who looks after his animals regards them as his first concern. Must he or she engage a vet or could he engage a veterinary nurse in certain situations? Could a farmer engage a nurse when a vet is not available if it is a case of animal welfare?</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_208">It would have to be done under the direction of a veterinary practitioner if it is outside the criteria set down because the question of insurance would arise if a person who is not entitled to do so decides to make a diagnostic decision. It is a different matter if procedures are carried out following directions from a vet. The vet must make the diagnosis. This is the reason I wish to keep the balance because there are professional and insurance issues to be considered. If a person does something they believe they are professionally competent to do, problems will arise if they are not professionally qualified. This situation may change in the future. Nursing has changed in the past 25 years. It may be that the profession of veterinary nursing will move to postgraduate level or that a different type of management situation will come into play. At present, however, nurses must operate under the direction of or in the presence of veterinary practitioners. If a farmer was to lose a large animal because an unqualified person made a mistake, that would be a retrograde step.</p>

Section 97 provides a basis for provisionally registering as veterinary nurses, persons who are practising as such, on the date of publication of the Bill. Such persons will be enabled to continue working as veterinary nurses for up to five years while they obtain a requisite qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_220">Concerns were raised with my Department by the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland about the potential involvement of provisionally registered nurses in taking of X-rays without having the necessary training. Accordingly, this amendment will address this concern by making it clear that in carrying out any function they are subject to any relevant legislation, in this case the Radiological Protection Act 2000, which requires completion of a formal course of training in veterinary radiological techniques and radiological protection measures before operating X-ray equipment.</p>

          <p eId="para_228">The Veterinary Practice Bill for the first time provides for a legally-based veterinary premises accreditation regime. As a result of more recent consultations and further reflection in my Department, this amendment will improve the definition of a veterinary premises, both in removing a potential loophole and avoiding the inadvertent inclusion of some activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">The Bill provides that farms where animals are being treated in the normal course would be excluded. It is not desirable that the exclusion should cover a situation for a vet who has his or her practice on a farm. Accordingly, I propose to refine the definition of "farm" to close this potential loophole. This amendment will meet the essence of the concerns and underline the amendment tabled by Senator Henry. However, it is not possible to accept her amendment as drafted because it would have the effect of making every farm where a vet treats an animal subject to veterinary premises accreditation standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">The amendment will address the issues at the heart of amendment No. 117 from Senator McCarthy by referring to premises owned or occupied by the owner of an animal being attended to by the registered person.</p>
          <p eId="para_231">The amendment contains two further technical changes to the definition of a veterinary premises for the purpose of the veterinary premises accreditation regime. As drafted, the definition could include slaughter plants and export inspection points where vets from my Department carry out official functions which fall within the definition of veterinary practice. Another issue was identified where veterinary practitioners could be called on to examine or treat animals at a variety of sporting events such as race meetings, showjumping events and other commercial sales. The locations referred to are not veterinary premises in the ordinary meaning of the word. It is, therefore, not sensible to subject them to the same conditions as veterinary premises.</p>
          <p eId="para_232">Having consulted the Attorney General's office, I propose to provide for a regulation-making power in this new section to enable Ministers for Agriculture and Food to deal with situations which may arise. This is preferable than attempting to list exhaustively, with sufficient precision, the various situations that may arise. I hope this amendment addresses the concerns underlying amendments Nos. 115 and 119, where it is proposed to qualify the word "practise" with the word "regularly".</p>
          <p eId="para_233">This amendment will make the provisions governing the premises accreditation regime more effective and workable.</p>

          <p eId="para_243">At the outset the legislation did not make provision for corporate practices. I understand this was contemplated at an earlier stage but was left aside so that the overall issue of corporate practice by professions generally could be dealt with in a single piece of legislation. I understand the matter of partnership law, as it relates to the professions, is likely to be examined by the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment as part of a forthcoming review by the company law review group. In these circumstances, and having consulted with the Attorney General's office, it will not be possible to make provision for the joint application suggested in the draft amendment. Nonetheless, it will be possible for veterinary practices to make private contractual arrangements among themselves enabling a single applicant to make an application in effect on behalf of that practice.</p>

The value of original documents is incredible and in some situations only an original document is accepted, but I do not believe an original should be displayed publically where it could quite easily be stolen.

          <p eId="para_252">This is not about the display of the veterinary practitioner's degree. This is about the certificate of suitability for a veterinary practice, which would come from the council. There might be some confusion there. This is not about an original of a qualification, but the suitability of the premises as certified by the council. Such a document could be changed, and a copy could be bogus. In my view an original would be preferential. This document states that the premises is suitable, not that the vet is a vet.</p>

          <from>Mr. McCarthy</from>
          <p eId="para_255">I said at the beginning of my contribution that it was about the certificate of suitability. I understand that and I welcome the Minister's clarity, but this goes back to the point made by Senator Quinn. Original documents are always very important and it is important to retain them, not least when one is dealing with bodies operated by human beings subject to human error. For example, a housing application to a local authority used to be simple but is now a very detailed intricate document, which looks for certificates of income, copies of identification and birth certificates. As a matter of practice, if someone comes to me for help with filling out a form, I will not give original certification to a local authority, as in my experience it can get lost. This incurs a replacement fee on the person submitting the form. I accept what the Minister says, but for the purposes of expediency and to make matters more manageable this amendment should be considered. There is an issue with regard to original documentation, which should be guarded.</p>
          <p eId="para_256">The vehicle registration certificate for a car is a document many people lose and it is a cumbersome process to replace it. One must write off, give a fee and wait and give various commitments that one has not passed it on or that nothing untoward has happened to it. This amendment would eliminate such bureaucratic and unnecessary tasks. I accept the Minister's clarity but this amendment would allow a premises to display a copy of the certificate. The original certificate of suitability should be kept in a safe place with the original university degrees.</p>

Everything Senator McCarthy has said about the loss of original documents is correct. It is a nightmare to replace lost documentation.</p>

However, the Minister could work with her counterpart in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to ensure that county councils issue two original certificates, one for display in the owner's practice and the other to be retained for safe keeping. This would solve the problem.</p>

I will not lose too much sleep over this but I ask the Minister to continue the pragmatism she has displayed throughout the course of this debate. I wish to reiterate a point made by Senator Quinn. The original document could always be available for inspection afterwards.</p>

          <from>Mr. Moylan</from>
          <p eId="para_262">The provision should state that only the original can be displayed. It is important that those who present an animal at a veterinary practice should be able to see the original certification and be confident that the premises is suitably registered and the practitioners properly qualified. I understand Members' points regarding the danger of an original being taken or lost, for example. However, it is important that the original should be displayed.</p>

          <p eId="para_263">I am surprised Members are perplexed about this issue. Senator Quinn has always been a man who is upfront with the consumer and concerned with consumer choice and information. The display of the original certification gives credence to the premises. However, I appreciate it can be troublesome to replace lost documentation. The best approach is to keep a copy for oneself which will facilitate replacement if the original is misplaced. The legislation requires that fire safety and other certificates must be displayed and this gives credence to the premises and confidence to the consumer. I hope Senator McCarthy will sleep well tonight even though I am not in a position to accept this amendment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_277">I am concerned at the powers the State has given to so many inspectors in the past ten years. The first instance related to drugs and the ability to perpetrate a forced entry in searching for illegal substances. Everyone was in agreement with this development. Findings of the first tribunal led to new developments in regard to tax inspectors. Over the decade, authorities in many areas of life have been given increasing rights, including the right to invade or perpetrate a forced entry in one's own home.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">I refer, in particular, to the Competition Authority. I argued strongly against the right of the Competition Authority to raid my home, by forced entry, without my notice and without my being able to stop it. I held the view that the State might be going too far in that instance. The Veterinary Practice Bill 2004 provides a similar example. Veterinary Ireland pointed out that an authorised officer can use forced entry to visit one if one is a veterinarian. If one is not a veterinarian, a court order must be obtained. This seems to discriminate against veterinarians.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">I listened to what Senator Henry stated and she is actually making the opposite case. Veterinary Ireland told me that the powers to inspect premises, which are set down in section 127 and which are aimed particularly at registered persons, are quite extensive and include the right to make forced entries. Section 128, which is apparently aimed at non-registered persons, provides for the use of District Court warrants in certain circumstances. In the interests of equity, this requirement for a warrant should also be included in respect of inspections under section 127.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">I am dealing with the same topic as Senator Henry but I take the exact opposite view to her in respect of it. She asked whether the officers should not have the authority to enter premises. I am concerned that the State is giving too much authority to too many inspectors to visit premises, including people's homes in many cases. In the instance under discussion, people's homes may well be visited. Why can the home of a veterinarian be raided by way of forced entry, while the raiding of the home of a non-veterinarian requires a court order?</p>

          <p eId="para_282">Senator Quinn's comments make a great deal of sense. The most law-abiding people will be in the most invidious position. They are the ones whose homes can be raided without a warrant, as the Senator stated, whereas court warrants will be required to inspect the premises of those who have set up fly-by-night establishments, for example, and who are not veterinarians at all. Perhaps the Minister will consider addressing this matter.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coonan</from>
          <p eId="para_283">I am concerned about use of the phrase "enter any premises, if necessary by the use of reasonable force". An officer should only have that power on obtaining a District Court order. Only one body in this State can administer that kind of justice, namely, the Garda Síochána, and it is the only body that should have that type of power. This is a serious matter. If the Minister is to pursue this further in the legislation, the provision should stipulate that the powers to enter premises should be exercised only on foot of District Court warrants. I have experience of officials, the vast majority of whom are fine. I do not want officers entering premises by using reasonable force. It is not acceptable.</p>

          <p eId="para_284">I have considered this issue. As the legislation stands, the officers of the Veterinary Council can enter one's practice without a warrant if one is registered but cannot enter one's home. A search warrant would be required in the case of those who are not registered. I will reconsider the position. Perhaps we are going a little too far and perhaps search warrants should be required in all cases. Will the House allow me to re-evaluate this and obtain further advice from the Attorney General on how I can address this? To be fair, everybody has put forward views. The council may not be particularly enamoured of my thoughts but veterinary practitioners are concerned and it is on that basis that I would like to reconsider the matter and seek advice from the Attorney General.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn</from>
          <p eId="para_287">I am satisfied with the Minister's statement that she will re-evaluate this aspect of the Bill. There is an old saying that an Englishman's home is his castle. I do not know what one calls an Irishman's home but it seems that in the past ten years we have passed much legislation affording rights to people to invade one's home. I have argued against it each time. In this case, the Minister states that we are referring to the practice rather than the home but I know some veterinarians whose homes and practices are within the one building.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">I am happy with what the Minister said. If the matter is considered between now and Report Stage, we might be able to arrive at a solution. It seems unfair, however, that if one happens to be a veterinarian, one's home can be invaded without a court order, while a court order is required if one is not a veterinarian. This seems to give a bias to the legislation in the wrong way. However, I can understand the point——</p>

          <from>Mary Coughlan</from>
          <p eId="para_289">As the Bill stands, one would not be allowed to enter a veterinarian's home without a search warrant. If his practice was in the home, one could only get into the practice and not the home. This stipulation could be superfluous, however, particularly if the point of entry for both is the same.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">In light of the fact that many vets have stated that this provision is a little over the top, I will reconsider the matter. There are reasons, other than those that fall within the scope of this legislation, that a veterinarian would be investigated. A different type of legislative issue would have to be dealt with if issues arose concerning drugs or if the Department of Agriculture and Food had to conduct an investigation. However, the issue in question is one for the council. Having reflected upon it, I would like the opportunity to re-evaluate the position and perhaps consider the need for search warrants where they are necessary to enter the premises of non-registered persons. This would be fairer on those who are registered.</p>

          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_294">(<i>a</i>) the authorised officer shall take reasonable steps to notify the owner of the animal of such seizure or removal, within a reasonable time after taking possession of or removing the animal, save where it is not possible to identify the owner notwithstanding reasonable diligence,</p>

          <p eId="para_297">This amendment is quite similar to amendment No. 126. It concerns the property rights of the owners of animals on the premises raided by authorised officers. It is clear that an authorised officer can seize the property of a veterinarian. However, there must be protection for the third party rights of owners of animals. I will not labour the point because I believe the Minister has enshrined it her own response. One knows how precious some animals are to their owners.</p>

I am excluding State premises and the Department itself so that the council will not be in a position to raid the Department.

          <p eId="para_320">This idea is new to me. I cannot accept the amendment as it is somewhat gratuitous. The implication is that if I, or any Minister, decide to remove a nominee, as opposed to an individual who was elected or recommended, I would be obliged to inform the Oireachtas as to the reason for the removal. There could be personal or other reasons a political nominee might be removed from a board. It should be a matter between the Minister and his or her nominee. No one would accept a nomination to a board if his or her private business was being aired in the Oireachtas. The Senator could ask me for the reason instead.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_338">In page 11, before section 2, but in Chapter 2, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_339">"2.—The Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 is amended by the insertion of the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_340">‘5A. (<i>a</i>) In this section “relief” shall include any relief other than an amount however described which is excluded in the calculation of tax by a body corporate, partnership or individual in calculating tax.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_341">(<i>b</i>) Every relief shall automatically lapse, despite any provision to the contrary in any section, after 5 years unless specifically renewed.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_342">(<i>c</i>) Before any relief can be renewed the Minister shall cause to be presented to the Oireachtas a report detailing the numbers who availed of the relief, the total cost of the relief to the exchequer on a geographical breakdown by tax districts.’.”</p>
          <p eId="para_343">This recommendation relates to tax reliefs, which virtually every Senator spoke about yesterday. Most tax reliefs have served a very useful purpose up to a point, particularly in the area of property where many of them are concentrated. However, tax reliefs may now be part of the problem rather than part of the solution. This recommendation would ensure that every tax relief would become redundant after five years and would have to be reintroduced by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">The second part of the recommendation stipulates that the Department of Finance would have to produce a report outlining the cost of a particular tax relief, the number of people who availed of it and whether it has served its purpose before it could be reintroduced. Tax relief is a controversial issue and opinions on it differ.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The stallion fees relief issue is extremely controversial. I do not have a problem with this particular tax relief but I can understand how some people do. It would serve a useful purpose if this recommendation was adopted as there would be regular Oireachtas discussions on the usefulness of tax reliefs and changes that need to be made to them. I await the Minister of State's response to this recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_350">A Procrustean bed means a very inflexible arrangement. People need to be able to plan into the future regarding tax. Some tax reliefs are introduced for a specified period of time, for example, two, three or four years. Sometimes, these reliefs are extended for a further period. Other reliefs are clearly intended to be permanent or semi-permanent features of the tax system. It may not be in the public interest to have serious question marks hanging over the longevity of every tax relief. I am not in favour of this recommendation although I do favour the part of it that stipulates that there should be maximum transparency regarding reliefs. However, I think this can be achieved through other means.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_237">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_351">I am very grateful to Senator Mansergh for advancing my education as I had never heard the term "Procrustean bed" before. I appreciate Senator Mansergh's willingness to explain the term and not leave those of us on this side of the House wallowing in ignorance.</p>
          <p eId="para_352">A fascinating aspect of tax reliefs, which are a very useful instrument of public policy, is the emerging information that suggests that no serious cost-benefit analysis of every tax relief is carried out on an ongoing basis. There are tax reliefs regarding which a large number of economists argue that the cost-benefit ratio is completely wrong, as is the case with mortgage interest relief. However, these tax reliefs are politically indispensable, regardless of the economic wisdom of continuing with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_353">The idea that we do not know how much certain tax exemption schemes would cost, either in estimate terms or real terms, defies logic. For example, it is a fiction to suggest that if all multinationals paid tax at 40% instead of 12%, we would have three times as much corporation tax and one third or one quarter of the number of multinationals in the country that we have now. This is a separate issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_354">It is fascinating that in the most high-powered Department, no cost-benefit analysis of every tax exemption scheme is carried out. These cost-benefit analyses should be regularly carried out and their results made public so that we can find out who is benefiting from the schemes, why they are benefiting from them and what the outcome is. It is a matter for debate as to whether this recommendation is the best way to go about it and I take note of Senator Mansergh's point. I would have no serious qualms about supporting this recommendation. I do not understand why we do not have a clear and explicit public policy that states that every tax relief should be based on or accompanied by a cost-benefit analysis.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Finance (Mr. Parlon)</from>
          <p eId="para_355">This recommendation proposes to insert a new section into the Bill. The purpose of the new section is to provide that tax reliefs will lapse automatically five years after being enacted unless they are renewed. The recommendation also provides that before renewing any relief, the Minister for Finance would produce a report to both Houses that contains the numbers of people who have availed of every tax relief and the total cost of each relief to the Exchequer on a geographical breakdown by tax districts.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">As the Minister for Finance announced in his Budget Statement, the Department and the Revenue Commissioners are to conduct a review of tax schemes. It is accepted that these reliefs, no matter how desirable, narrow the tax base and will have the effect of reducing the tax paid by high earners. However, until this review of tax incentives and exemptions is complete and the Government has considered the matter, it would be premature to make any comment on what steps may be taken to ensure the correct balance is struck between the benefit of tax incentives and the extent to which such incentives and exemptions are used by high earners to reduce their tax bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">Likewise, it would be premature to consider whether or not mechanisms such as sunset clauses or automatic reviews would be appropriate. For this reason, I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation. The Revenue Commissioners publish an annual statistical report that includes in table IT 6 information on the cost of tax reliefs, copies of which are sent to the Oireachtas Library. The 2003 report for the first time gives a breakdown of the numbers availing of particular tax reliefs to the extent that such information is available to the Revenue Commissioners. This information is provided in respect of the 2001 short tax year. The breakdown will be extended to future years as additional information on the numbers involved becomes available to the Revenue Commissioners.</p>
          <p eId="para_358">It would not be a good use of resources to create a statutory compulsion to have a case-by-case procurement of statistics on the numbers availing of reliefs and exemptions broken down by geographical area. The costs and resources expended in assembling this information would be disproportionate to the value of the information obtained. We must consider the appropriateness of the information to be gathered in various cases. As I outlined on 22 March, there are various reports under way to examine practically all of the exemptions and reliefs. These reports will be made available to the Department of Finance and the Minister in advance of the next budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_361">Exactly, but it also shows the power of the Seanad, which is more important. I will not get hung up on the phrasing of the review and urge the choosing of a policy somewhat similar to this. However, Senator Ryan is correct in that we must have continuous assessment of whether these schemes are working and whether it would be better to move them into other areas. On 22 March I made a suggestion in respect of the area of transport. Many reliefs focussed on the construction industry until now and the emphasis should be changed to a real problem area, namely, transport. I urge the members of the review committee to examine this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_362">It is scandalous that a large number of very high earners pay no tax in this country. This must not be allowed to continue and a part of the review should include the requirement of a minimum amount that people must contribute. We should not allow a situation in which people do not pay any income tax in this day and age and I urge that these issues be considered.</p>

          <p eId="para_366">Is it true that there are Irish tax exemptions for which the Department of Finance has never carried out a cost benefit analysis? My other hat is that of an engineer and I expect the undergraduate engineers I teach to carry out some form of sensitivity analysis on their chemical process designs. It is astonishing that the whole of the apparatus of the Department would not perform a sensitivity analysis on every tax exemption in 2005 as a matter of routine. The decisions regarding what should be done are political and based on the Government's detachment. However, it is possible to make some analysis.</p>
          <p eId="para_367">If a tax exemption is provided for something, whether it is income tax or a housing development, but the impact on the local environment is not examined in terms of sewage, water and so on, then we are living in a society of a series of Chinese walls. We do not know enough about these matters. What we want to happen will, but what we must do our sums and determine whether the social gain is worth the social generosity of eliminating tax exemptions.</p>

There are many activities that would not take place if this were the case, particularly multinational investment.

          <p eId="para_371">That is reviewed by the Department of Finance and the Government in advance of each budget. Steps have been taken to strengthen the system of costing tax reliefs and to improve the information available, having regard to the need to maintain as much simplicity as is practical in the tax return system. These changes involved legislation in the Finance Acts 2003 and 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">As the Senator is aware, the Finance Act 2003 requires returns of income and losses in respect of exempt activities, such as bloodstock relief for stallions and greyhounds and for commercially managed woodlands. Changes underpinned by the legislative provisions of the Finance Act 2004 have been made to tax forms to enable information to be gathered on property-based schemes. Recently introduced reliefs such as the research and development tax credit have been accompanied by specific provisions, which will enable their costs to be maintained.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">This extra information is required for the collection of statistical data which will be given to the Government by the Revenue Commissioners. The data is now being made available and will give new information with regard to particular stallion schemes. I read a report published by the industry that shows a different complexion on the stallion scheme to those held by the Senator's party. Senator John Paul Phelan stated he has no problems with this independent report. When the Department and the Minister evaluate the scheme it will be on a factual basis and a balanced decision can be taken at that time with regard to the value of that relief and others.</p>

At present, the level of rent qualifying for relief is dependent on one's marital status and age, either under or over 55 years. The Bill proposes to increase the limits on which rent relief can be claimed as follows — from €1,270 to €1,500 for single persons under 55; from €2,500 to €3,000 for married or widowed persons under 55; from €2,450 to €3,000 for single persons over 55; and from €5,080 to €6,000 for married and widows persons over 55. Relief granted is at the standard rate of income tax of 20%. The cost of Senator Phelan's recommendation is estimated to be €21.6 million in a full year, in addition to the full year costs of €5.2 million for the changes already provided for in the Bill.

          <p eId="para_388">That is in addition to the €5.2 million for the changes already in the Bill. An identical amendment was discussed in the Dáil. In the course of the debate, Deputy Bruton indicated that the purpose of his amendment was to introduce equity of relief between mortgage interest relief and tax relief on rents. I assume that Senator Phelan's recommendation has the same motivation. Mortgage interest relief is not differentiated on age grounds, but between new mortgages up to seven years and old mortgages. The rates for new mortgages are €8,000 for married persons and €4,000 for single persons. The rates for old mortgages are €5,080 for married persons and €2,500 for single persons.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Rather than bringing equity into the reliefs, the recommendation is biased towards those aged over 50 who are renting as against first time buyers. While the amounts of the reliefs are different, the principle behind both is to concentrate on those who need the relief most, namely first time buyers and elderly tenants. The limits for rent relief have been increased this year, while mortgage interest relief remains unchanged. However, as is normal practice with all tax reliefs, the specified limits will be kept under review over the coming years, particularly in the context of the annual budget. In view of these issues, the Government is not prepared to accept the recommendation.</p>

At present, the value of the benefit in kind is determined as being 5% of the land's market value.

          <p eId="para_394">This section intrigues me. The Minister of State at the Department of Finance, Deputy Parlon, said yesterday that section 10 provides an exemption from benefit in kind for security provided to a director or employee by the employer, where there is a credible and serious threat to the personal security to the director or employee. What is at issue here? I have no objection to this, but it seems extraordinary that something as explicit as this is needed in the Finance Bill. Was it the position up to now that if a security company provided its employees with protective clothing, this was regarded as a benefit in kind? I would like to know where this amendment came from. It intrigues me that such explicit detail is provided, particularly for directors.</p>

          <p eId="para_395">There is an enormous amount of detail in the Bill, which is why there are so many officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners in the House today.</p>
          <p eId="para_396">The conditions for exemption are very tightly drawn. Obviously, there is a need for expenditure on security for employees. This was exemplified recently in one of the biggest heists in Dublin, where the employees of a security company and their families were targeted.</p>
          <p eId="para_397">The conditions are very tightly drawn and the exemption is only intended for those people whose work exposes them to a threat to their physical safety from terrorists, criminals or others who may resort to violence. It follows that a deduction cannot be granted for security measures against a general criminal threat, which all citizens must face. The amendment does not cover expenditure incurred to protect against a threat to property from burglary or larceny or for security measures against threats not connected with an individual's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The position up to now was unclear. This legislation specifies that exemptions only apply where there is a threat related to employment and that, in those circumstances, the provision of security would not be charged as a benefit in kind. It addresses a real need in society, as security provisions can be very expensive.</p>

          <p eId="para_414">This recommendation concerns child care, an issue raised by most Senators who spoke yesterday on Second Stage. It proposes a system of tax relief for child care expenses. In recent days there have been rumblings from Government about possible proposals on child care and support for young families with major child care expenses. It is a significant expense which, for many young families, is equivalent to a second mortgage.</p>
          <p eId="para_415">The Government's previous policy focused primarily on children's allowances and child benefit as a mechanism to cover the cost of child care. Although children's allowance has increased substantially in recent years, the monthly sum would not pay for a week's child care.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">This recommendation provides the first step towards creating a system of tax relief for these expenses. The most suitable system is the French voucher system to which Senator Henry referred yesterday. The Australian system is similar. All families, regardless of income, receive vouchers to spend on child care, special tuition and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">My proposal would set us on the road to acknowledging the crisis in this area to which Government policy has not responded. I hope the Minister of State can take on board at least parts of this recommendation to provide relief for people faced with these large bills.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_418">This recommendation deals with an issue which is next in line to be addressed. It was correct to build up child benefit to a reasonable level in comparison with that in other countries because it was quite low until approximately ten years ago. It is widely accepted now that the child benefit approach will not deal with child care. The Government will not be in a position to accept the recommendation because the budget has already been introduced and implementing it would prove costly.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The question arises as to how it could be approached. The Senator mentioned a voucher system. That would not be part of the tax system, as it would involve expenditure. The British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Gordon Brown, has introduced a working parents' tax credit which, unlike this recommendation, carries an income limit. Following this week's UK budget, it will be of the order of £58,000 sterling. If one adopts the tax credit method, one must decide whether to do so with or without an income limit.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has indicated that this matter will be given careful consideration. An interdepartmental group studied it some years ago and that process will be resumed. The new social reality among most young couples with children aged between one and four or five years of age is that both partners work. Only at the extremes of the income scale does one parent stay at home while the other goes out to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_421">The tendency was already strong in the late 1990s and will have been reinforced in the past five years. That was one of the reasons behind the individualisation scheme which Fine Gael challenged.</p>

          <p eId="para_423">It was modified to take account of the interests of others but, nonetheless, the basic principle stands. That type of reinforced social trend must be taken into account. Addressing this issue should probably take precedence over general tax relief in the next budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">My party made proposals on this matter in its 1997 general election manifesto. We went into coalition and it was not part of the programme for Government. Nevertheless, even seven or eight years ago the Opposition adopted a position that this was an issue to be addressed. We cannot wait much longer. The demand from the people to address this has become insistent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrendanRyan" eId="spk_271">
          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_425">I agree with everything Senator Mansergh said. <i>Fortune</i> magazine carried out a survey of people working in New York, in which large number of highly-paid professionals were asked about their daytime concerns. The magazine was seeking business information but was astonished to find that the major concern of young professionals in New York is who is minding the children. Even for extremely well paid young professionals, the whole area of child care, the pressures of work, leaving home at 6.30 a.m. or 7 a.m., getting home at 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m., seeing children asleep when one is leaving home and seeing them going to bed when one is coming home, create pressures in addition to financial ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">We have failed to deal with the issue. I am fascinated that apparently we are now to use the resources of the State to deal with the matter. I support publicly funded child care facilities, as does my party. Given that employers do not employ people unless they are making money, which is a perfectly reasonable expectation, I am intrigued that employers who benefit from the fact that young couples work do not have some obligation to participate in the provision of the necessary supports for the families of their employees and that we have walked away from the whole idea of employer responsibility. I have no problem with the recommendation but the whole issue of families and children requires so many different adjustments in our society. It requires funding for child care and a fundamental change in the law to allow much greater flexibility for parenting, including parental leave both in terms of financial support and duration for both parents.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">This is a significant issue which will cost a lot of money. There is no cheap way of providing child care; there are only options of how to pay for it. I would be unhappy if the bulk of the payment were to come from the existing revenue of the State by way of a reduction in income tax. There are other ways to deal with the matter.

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_429">I agree with the speakers on the significance of the problem. The recommendation is essentially a system of tax allowances at the standard rate of income tax for those paying for child care services. The allowance proposed is limited to the amount actually paid in the year, or to €7,000, whichever is less. If the taxpayer has insufficient income to use up all the allowance, the excess is lost. This issue was discussed at great length on Committee and Report Stages of the Bill in the other House. I welcome the opportunity to outline to the House the Government's current policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The difficulty with using a tax as a support in this area is that parents who are already below the tax paying threshold can gain nothing from it. These are the people who can least afford to pay for child care services and whom we should be most interested in helping, whether by way of work, extra skills or further education. Over the past number of years, the Government has considered carefully the whole area of child care. It decided as a matter of policy that child benefit is the main instrument through which support will be provided for parents with children. One of the main benefits of this approach is that whereas tax relief would be of little or no benefit to people on low incomes, the provision of support for parents through the child benefit route means equality of treatment for all recipients. Overall expenditure on child benefit this year is estimated to be in the region of €1.9 billion. Child care benefit is certainly expensive and a substantial amount of money has been provided for this area. The actual amount of money provided has increased by 279% since 1997.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">In order to address the availability of services, the supply of formal child care places has also been stimulated through a programme of investment under the national development plan equal opportunities child care programme. The programme funds capital development projects to increase places, support staffing costs for facilities, target disadvantage and improve child care quality. From 2005-09, the capital budget for the planned programme will be €313 million, which is expected ultimately to create approximately 17,000 places. As we all know, facilities create competition, which brings down prices.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">The Government has also undertaken through a series of tax measures to favour the supply of child care facilities by the use of capital allowances for the provision of child care facilities and relief from benefit-in-kind taxation for free or subsidised child care where this is provided by employers. Senator Ryan raised this issue. The Finance Act 1999 introduced capital allowances for expenditure on the construction, refurbishment or extension of child care premises which meet the required standards set out in the Children Act 1991. Under the decentralisation programme, my Department will examine child care facilities in the new Departments throughout the country.</p>

There will be a continuous roll-out after that to which the Senator can look forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">Taken together, these represent substantial measures to assist with the cost of child care. I accept that we are not close to a solution to this complex issue. We have a lot of ground to make up compared to some of our European neighbours. The buoyancy of our economy in recent years has brought with it a welcome increase in the demand for labour. The problem of finding satisfactory and affordable child care facilities is something parents increasingly face, particularly where both parents work outside the home. The Government will continue to focus its energy on this very real problem. Increasing the supply of child care places is the best way forward. The impact of 17,000 places under the EOCP programme should not be underestimated. I do not pretend to have all the answers, but I believe the approach the Government has taken is the appropriate one. The approach set out in Senator Phelan's recommendation would not have any real impact on increasing the number of places available.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">As has been said, the Government is examining this whole issue. The Minister for Social and Family Affairs has made some suggestions. The issue is actively under review by the Government. I am not in a position to accept the recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_439">I compliment Senator Mansergh on his comments, which are correct. We could all list off child care facilities. There are two or three major problems in this regard because one arm of Government does not appear to know what the other is doing. I recently heard about the case of a group in County Kerry which received a grant for €1.5 million to build a child care facility even though it does not have planning permission or a site on which to build. There are at least two or three groups in my county that have sites and planning permission but cannot get the money to build much needed child care facilities. These are often co-operative community groups that come together to try to do something on the ground. I do not think anything substantive is being done.</p>
          <p eId="para_440">I dispute the Minister of State's response in the area of child benefit. I do not think this has done anything substantial to alleviate the difficulties in this area. I realise it has risen to the top of the agenda. Senator Mansergh was correct. I am pleased he nailed his colours to the mast so clearly and said the matter should be dealt with first and foremost. It is probably the most important and urgent issue at present after seven or eights years of inaction. The Senator outlined how it was part of the Fianna Fáil manifesto in 1997, but it has done nothing in the seven or eights years since. Even if there is a belated response, I hope it will be made. There are different bleatings in recent days about paying grandmothers to mind children. My mother, who minds four children, is absolutely delighted. She has been asking when will I start to have children if she will get paid to mind them. Such imaginative thinking is required and I am glad there seems to be a sense of urgency with regard to this matter. I am disappointed that the recommendation will not be accepted. I understand what the Minister of State is saying in that this amendment would not benefit people who do not pay tax. However, I am disappointed the Government did not use the opportunity presented by this Finance Bill to make a substantive proposal with regard to the area of child care. The issue is again being put on the long finger.</p>

          <p eId="para_444">The Minister of State's answer will not be sufficient this time next year. We must take a fundamental look at the issue. His point is perfectly valid in that if one does not have a taxable income one cannot benefit from tax credits. Across the water, Gordon Brown's budget has a two-tier system. One tier deals with the problems of people effectively below the threshold — those assisted by family income supplements. The other deals with working parents on middle incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">Many reports have been written about the issue and one can listen to the experts or the people. We must address that issue. Who is best able to come up with an answer? This will be a big issue going into the next general election. I am not referring to this particular Minister for Finance, but to the office of Minister as a body corporate. The Minister has a somewhat cautious approach to this area, but that will not achieve more in the future. We must look at some of the other systems.</p>
          <p eId="para_446">Our system of child tax credits was abolished in the mid-1980s, which was a bad decision because it meant the tax system no longer recognised extra costs and responsibilities. It was part of a stream of so-called tax reforms back then, when many reliefs and allowances were discontinued. Of all the reliefs, allowances and schemes to get rid of, why pick on children first? I am not quite sure. To be fair, at the time it was abolished the credit was down to an absolutely nominal figure of approximately £100 per child.</p>
          <p eId="para_447">The tax system must once again recognise people who have children and child care costs, and this nettle must be grasped. Yes, it will be expensive and for that reason it may not be possible to do something at the same time as the more general and usual income tax relief. However, I would strongly advocate, as would my colleagues on both sides of the House, that the issue must be addressed and I recommend this to the Minister and interdepartmental committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">The Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Brennan, has given clear signs of wanting to tackle the issue, and I wish him all the best. However, the present approach, even if refined and extended, will not in itself provide the complete answer. Child benefit certainly does not provide the answer.</p>

          <p eId="para_449">As Senator Mansergh said, €1.9 billion is a very substantial contribution to child care costs. A combination of issues puts extra pressure on the area. There is practically full employment in this country and people spend a large section of their time commuting.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">Senator Phelan raised the issue, which I suspect is an urban myth, about the group in Kerry which made an application for the grant. Criteria is laid down under the equal opportunities child care programme. They must be community-based, not-for-profit organisations. Therefore they are mainly run by parents, and I have recently met a number of such groups.</p>
          <p eId="para_451">Another criteria for qualifying for the grant is that one must be ready to go. Some €313 million is available from now until next year. The Government will not get much benefit from giving a grant to a group in Kerry if the facility is not going to be built. If the Senator has some information, then I would like to hear it. I have supported a number of groups and having the site, the planning permission and the plans drawn up is crucial.</p>

          <p eId="para_455">The Senator should name the group because there is no point throwing a comment. The criteria are very strict. It is the responsibility of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and he wants to ensure value for money on behalf of himself, his own Department and the Government. The reason that will happen is that groups will be ready to go. A group was recently approved in my own constituency in Portarlington. Previously they were not deemed ready and were very aggrieved. They came into my office and made a fuss asking why they were not ready to go. It was because they had not completed their figures and had to shave off some of their costs. They were approved last time. If the Senator knows of a group——</p>

          <p eId="para_460">The Minister made a number of assertions which must be challenged. We can all see the benefits of high levels of child benefit, and those of us in Opposition saw them on the doorsteps during the general election. Child benefit is paid for all children until they are 18 years old, and 21 years old if they go to college. Paying child benefit for my two college-going under-21s is not much of a solution to the problem of young couples with two, three or four year old children who must pay out €300, €400 or €500 per week to have somebody look after them while they go to work. One can work out, on the back of a stamp, that it will cost approximately €1.5 billion to provide full-time child care for the 200,000 or 300,000 children under the age of four in this country. I will happily accept a correction of the figure, it might be 200,000 or 500,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">We are paying as much again in child benefit and this money must be found through deductions from income tax, which I do not greatly like. I agree with Senator Mansergh that it would exclude those who most need support. To provide child care for children from the age of 6 months until they go to primary school will cost in the region of €1 billion and €2 billion every year.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">There is no cheap route and if we continue attacking it at the margins we will not solve the problem. I want to be political about this issue. Ultimately, we will get the equivalent of the 200,000 medical cards in 2002 and a promise before the election which, six months later, we will discover we cannot afford. People will not be fooled a second time.</p>

Many people are unaware of the existence of the home caring spouse credit. I assume the amount of money is relatively small.

If that is the case, what the Senator is proposing is an extension of the tax relief at source principle which is in place in respect of medical insurance premiums and mortgage interest payments. While tax relief at source is operating successfully in both these areas, it is not a system suitable for all reliefs. Ideally, the system needs a small number of payment recipients relative to a large and regular number of payers. There are not that many reliefs which meet such criteria. The system would not be cost-effective either for the Revenue or for the payee in regard to once-off or irregular payments to a wide variety of payees.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">There is also an Exchequer cost in that to work smoothly, the tax relief at source must apply to all payers regardless of whether they are liable for tax. While I cannot accept the Senator's recommendation, I assure him the Minister is continually reviewing the various reliefs in the context of tax relief at source and how it may apply to them.</p>

The section indicates that they "shall make known" any terms and conditions but they could decide to place a notice in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> and state that, as far as they are concerned, this complies with the provision as outlined.

          <p eId="para_485">This recommendation seeks to amend the provision of a new section being inserted in the Taxes Consolidation Act which imposes a statutory obligation on an individual wishing to claim a tax relief for a particular year to keep all such records as are necessary to prove the claim. The particular provision which the Senator seeks to amend requires taxpayers to keep those records for six years after the end of the year to which the claim relates and he is proposing to increase the retention period to ten years.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">In placing an obligation on taxpayers to keep documentation, there is a need to strike a balance between Revenue's right to investigate a claim and the placing of too heavy a compliance burden on the taxpayer. Ten years is considerably longer than the period in which the taxpayer may make the claim or the period in which Revenue may normally investigate a claim. Four years from the end of the year in question in both instances is the case. It would also contrast sharply with the retention period, for tax purposes, of six years in respect of business records. The fine of €1,520 to which Senator Ryan referred does not apply if the taxpayer produces other evidence to confirm that the information which the records, if retained, would show. In the circumstances the recommendation is opposed.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_490">In page 50, before section 27, but in Chapter 4, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_491">"27.—Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister shall lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas a Report outlining proposals which could be introduced to encourage a greater use of bio fuels.".</p>
          <p eId="para_492">This recommendation relates to an issue I raised on Second Stage in the area of biofuels, with which the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, is familiar in his other capacity. Coming from a farming background, I am also familiar with it. The development of biofuels is an area where I suspect there will be much progress in the next few years which should be encouraged. I am aware the Government has applied to the European Union for a derogation in respect of biofuels. I would like to know what is contained in that application.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Of particular concern to me is the area of sugar beet, which is familiar also to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon and to my colleague, Senator Bradford. It is a potential biofuel which is not usually listed as a primary biofuel source such as oilseed rape and other similar products. This recommendation proposes that the Minister, within three months of the passing of this Act, lays before the Houses of the Oireachtas a report outlining proposals to encourage a greater use of biofuels. In light of significant increases in the cost of oil, the biofuel sector should be developed and this country has great potential for doing so. The agriculture sector is under pressure and biofuels could provide a very useful new source for the farming community. It is a resource that has not been fully utilised and which could be of great benefit to the country if it was fully utilised in the future. I await information on the Department's policy on this matter.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_494">I support Senator John Paul Phelan's recommendation. This is a proposal which must be driven forward, excuse the pun. It is both an alternative energy and income source for the farming community.</p>
          <p eId="para_495">There has been much talk on the subject of alternative fuels and biofuels are at the core of that debate. However, very little action has been taken and few incentive measures introduced. From both an agricultural and the broader environmental perspective, we must be proactive at both national and European level in seeking out new sources of energy, especially with the reduction in the amount of so-called conventional fuels now available.</p>
          <p eId="para_496">I ask the Minister of State to note this recommendation. This country must make it clear that it is proactive in the search for alternative and renewable sources of energy. It will be all the better if two problems can be solved together. The Minister of State is aware from his previous incarnation of the prospects which agriculture can offer in that respect.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_310" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_497">I am quite familiar with the biofuel business and with a particular project in the south east, which is the Senator's area.</p>
          <p eId="para_498">The responsibility for the promotion of biofuels falls within the remit of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. However, it is accepted that excise relief is an option in encouraging the promotion of biofuels as an alternative fuel. It may not be widely known but the biofuel made from rapeseed oil is as expensive as diesel upon which excise duty has been levied. Biofuels are an expensive option but I appreciate their importance from the point of view of the Kyoto Protocol and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_499">From a fiscal perspective the main instrument in promoting biofuels is section 50 of the Finance Act 2004 which provides for the introduction of a scheme for excise tax relief for biofuels. The purpose of the scheme is to allow qualified and conditional relief from excise of biofuel used in approved pilot projects for either the production of biofuel or the testing of the technical viability of biofuel for use as a motor oil. A scheme which includes pure plant oil, biodiesel and bio-ethanol has been drawn up in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. The European Commission confirmed last year that the scheme represented a State aid and Ireland formally submitted the scheme for approval in January. State aid approval was formally granted by the Commission earlier this month. The Minister for Finance subsequently signed the necessary order.</p>
          <p eId="para_500">The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources will set in train the formal process of inviting proposals for the approved scheme. In this regard an advertisement from the Department will issue shortly, providing all necessary details for those wishing to apply for excise relief.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">The Senator's request for a report on proposals for the promotion of biofuels would be more appropriately directed to the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. I am aware of the time elapsed but a formal application to the European Union was required. This has now been granted with regard to the State aid and it is all systems go. The recommendation is not accepted in this case but it is an issue which the Senator could raise with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>

          <p eId="para_502">Is the Minister of State in a position to know how many of our European colleagues are currently availing of this? Is Ireland the last country to achieve this derogation? Is derogation used much in other countries? Perhaps the departmental officials may have that information. If not, I will put down a motion to the relevant Minister.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_503">I am aware Ireland is not unique in this regard. Every other country which has adopted the biofuels scheme and which is foregoing excise duty has been required to obtain approval from the EU Commission regarding State aid. The Senator referred to sugar beet as a possible biofuel. Sugar beet was designed for the production of sugar. Oilseed rape is the subject of the proposed project in this country. This product qualifies for EU aid under the area aid scheme and this is the reason it required to be approved. Sugar beet does not qualify for a State aid at present but under the new regime it will. The most economical use of sugar beet at present would be in the manufacture of sugar. Even though one of the sugar beet factories has closed, the intention is to process the national crop in Mallow. Sugar beet farmers currently earn well in excess of €50 per tonne but I suspect they would earn substantially less if the crop were being used for biofuel production. The Government will keep this matter under review.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_505">In page 50, before section 27, but in Chapter 4, to insert the following new section:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_506">"27.—Section 268(A) of the Principal Act in the definition of ‘qualifying hospital' is amended in paragraph (<i>f</i>) by inserting the words ‘provides psychiatric services or’ before ‘contains facilities’.”.</p>
          <p eId="para_507">This recommendation relates to a provision in the Finance Bill whereby privately built medical centres and hospitals qualify for relief but not psychiatric hospitals. A number of Senators referred to this issue on Second Stage of the Bill. Senator Henry referred extensively to this issue in her remarks. This apparent oversight happened when the Bill was drafted.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">It has been brought to my attention by Deputy Jim O'Keeffe, the Fine Gael spokesperson for Justice, Equality and Law Reform in the other House, that the State incurs significant annual costs through the provision of facilities for problem youngsters. It was suggested that this relief scheme which is in place could be extended to cover the private provision of facilities in this area. Why are psychiatric facilities not included? Will the Minister of State explain why these facilities are treated differently from other medical facilities?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_314">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_509">I support my colleague's comments on this issue. It is difficult to see what response the Minister of State can offer for the exclusion of tax relief on psychiatric units. The tax relief scheme afforded for the provision of broader medical facilities has worked well. While my information derives mainly from media reports, examples such as the hospital project in Galway are progressive in the construction of top class facilities. If the Minister of State would be reasonable to make a concession on this, it would be of assistance in providing required facilities in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Irrespective of whether the tax relief is for car parks, student accommodation, hotels or hospitals, construction will only occur if such projects are required. If additional units to help in the assessment and treatment of psychiatric illness are required and the State is not willing to invest sufficient moneys in such projects, private investment should be encouraged. The philosophical debate about whether State or private money should be invested in the health service is irrelevant. Investment from either the taxpayer or private funding is required. If people can be encouraged to invest in any aspect of health care and provision by way of tax relief, that direction should be taken. I hope the Minister of State will respond favourably to the recommendation.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_511">The recommendation proposes a change to the definition of "qualifying hospital" in the tax Acts so as to introduce a new scheme of capital allowances for psychiatric hospitals based on the existing scheme that exists for private hospitals. When the scheme for capital allowances for the construction of private hospitals was introduced in 2001, the question of including psychiatric services within the scheme's ambit did not arise. Several representations were made on the issue and it was raised on Committee Stage in the Dáil. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, stated that he was not without sympathy to the proposition. However, given the announcement in the budget of a review of tax reliefs and exemptions, it may not be an opportune time to introduce a significant new relief. I hope the Senators will agree to allowing consideration of the proposal for capital allowances for psychiatric hospitals between now and the next budget.</p>

It has also been provided that conditions for access must not act as a disincentive to the public to visit the property.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_528">Recently I met a farmer who will lose ten acres of land to the Dublin-Waterford motorway. He is a man who never sold a site and has no intention of ever selling one. The only intention he has is to build up his enterprise and he is losing ten acres of ground. In effect, the Government is stealing two of those acres from him because he will have to pay capital gains tax on land he had no intention of selling and in no way wanted to sell but found himself being forced to sell. Two acres of his farm are being taken for free from him and that is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_529">Provision should be made to allow farmers who want to reinvest the money received from compulsory acquisition back into the enterprise to do so without paying tax. That is a very fair thing to do as they are not willing sellers or trying to liquidate their assets to make a quick buck. In most cases these people have no intention of selling land. In my area I know a number of people who are not just losing plots of land but they are losing houses. They will be out of pocket because their land or house will be knocked or changed into a motorway. It is not acceptable that something for the public benefit would cause these people to be in any way out of pocket. It is a public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">I attended a number of meetings and emotions run high on this issue, particularly if someone will lose a house to a new road. Understandably, people get very emotional. I know the Minister of State's heart is in the right place but I would have preferred him to use his influence in his new position to ensure that unwilling sellers would not find themselves out of pocket for providing land for much needed public transport initiatives. The Minister of State should accept this recommendation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulBradford" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_531">I agree with Senator John Paul Phelan. We all must accept that from time to time the compulsory purchase of land is a necessary part of building the infrastructure of the country, and it is very disappointing for the landowner to lose his or her property against his or her will. It sometimes has to happen for the common good. It is blatantly unfair that the landowner is then treated in the same way as a property speculator. The value of whatever land is taken is dealt with as though he or she was speculating on land.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Where a farmer, part-time farmer or any property owner has his or her property acquired by compulsory purchase order the application of capital gains tax to the moneys received cannot be justified. That property or land holder should be facilitated and allowed to reinvest the entire sum received in compensation in a similar property or a similar amount of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The Minister of State is very much aware of the situation outlined by my colleague. In previous times he was involved in negotiations leading to certain agreements. Sometimes the agreements held up and sometimes, as can be seen in the Fermoy and Mitchelstown area, it appears they did not hold up. We must try to bring some degree of justice to the landowners concerned. It is entirely unjust that capital gains tax is applicable. This was debated already and the Minister of State made counter-arguments. The Bill has passed through the other House, but it is not possible for him or his officials to make any justifiable case for retaining the <i>status quo</i>. Even if the Minister of State cannot give a satisfactory response today will he signal that he is willing to seriously review this issue and allow the introduction of fairness? The present system is grossly unjust and unfair.</p>

          <from>Dr. Mansergh</from>
          <p eId="para_536">I wanted to pick up a small point. On the substance of the issue, it is not as simple as has been put forward. I am very conscious of this as out of the three proposed road routes for the N24 improvements, one would have crossed my land in Tipperary. I know the disruption and the pain that is caused. This is quite a general recommendation. It applies to the city as well as to the country without distinction.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">In days gone by, the State was a good deal more ruthless. If one thinks back to Land Commission and land bond days, one got a fraction of the realisable nominal value of the bond under the Constitution even where there was compulsory acquisition by the State, such as when a council acquired rural cottages. Land values have escalated enormously.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">If I understand this recommendation correctly, it is not even referring to roll-over relief. It refers to anybody whose land is compulsorily acquired, even if the value of that land has gone up a great deal in recent times. The level of land compensation for public transport or road schemes in city areas is shocking. On the Luas green line compensation of €2 million to €3 million was given for stretches of a few hundred metres. Is one saying that despite those windfall gains, the State is not entitled to apply capital gains tax? This carries worship of private property a bit too far.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">Under the Constitution, and perhaps this was more adhered to in spirit than in letter in earlier decades, private property is subject to the common good. In a context where land values have gone up so much, there might be a case to be made where someone loses ten acres and goes immediately to acquire another ten acres, perhaps with very tight conditions. I can understand and sympathise with that argument. If one loses ten acres and intends to pocket the compensation, I do not see that as an injustice. Neither is it an injustice if the two acres have been taken off one, particularly if land values have escalated.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">This is why public infrastructure schemes that are for the public good such as roads, railways and Luas, cost so much. If one analyses them, an horrendous percentage of the cost comprises compensation, not construction. Part of the reason the cost of compensation is so high is that land values have escalated. We must be sensible about this and realise there is more than one side to the argument.</p>

          <p eId="para_546">Taxation is not equivalent to stealing money from people. Tax is what one pays for the services provided by society. I do not refer to anything Senator John Phelan said but I am entirely sick of those, particularly affluent people, who claim they have never received anything from the State. This usually means they did not receive third level grants.</p>

          <p eId="para_548">These people should consider the amount of child benefit they receive, in some cases until their children are 21 years old. Without this benefit, they would require a much greater salary in order to have the same amount in their pockets. They should also consider the roads they use and the generous mortgage interest relief on their homes. All these benefits must be added up. People like me get more from the State than the alleged malingerers who live on social welfare and are the subject of so much abuse. This is the way the system works and it is a nonsense to suggest that the taxation which provides all this is theft.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">However, there is a valid issue here. I pointed out to the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, on a previous occasion that after his great intervention with the IFA on this issue there was never again a squeak from that organisation about compensation. All the Minister of State did was smile.</p>

          <p eId="para_551">This seemed to confirm he was quite satisfied with the deal that had been negotiated. If the IFA was satisfied with the level of compensation its members would receive, it seems probable that level was well above what farmers had expected or hoped to receive either through compensation or the sale of agricultural land.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">I cannot accept the recommendation in its present form as it is far too wide. We know little about the levels of compensation awarded. However, Senator Mansergh has pointed to the cost of land acquisition as a proportion of the cost of major road projects. It is clear people have done quite well out of these projects and, as such, should make some contribution to the State. We have the lowest level of capital gains tax in Europe. A person who earns €50,000 pays income tax at 42% but a capital gain of the same amount is subject to a taxation level of only 20%. This is unfair and I will not support a recommendation that proposes to introduce further unfairness.</p>

          <p eId="para_563">However, I refer to the situation of a farmer who has no intention of selling land but must surrender several acres to facilitate the development of road infrastructure. It is inappropriate that such a person must pay a considerable amount of tax on an asset he or she had never intended to realise. If such persons reinvest the compensation in their business, they should be exempt from paying tax because they are providing an important public service.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I understand the fears of other Senators in regard to the significant costs of such developments in urban areas, particularly in the case of the Luas. However, such significant figures are not in question in other areas. In certain parts of rural Ireland, farmers are receiving less compensation for their land than they might expect to get on the open market. There must be an element of realism in this matter and a recognition that development does not only take place in major urban areas. More rural people will be affected and they will often be more severely affected than their urban counterparts.</p>

          <from>Mr. Bradford</from>
          <p eId="para_565">Senator John Paul Phelan is correct in conceding that his recommendation may be slightly too broad. However, we must focus on the typical situation in rural areas in regard to compulsory purchases of land. Senator Ryan raised the question of the amount of money which landowners receive in such instances. It is only through the discussions I have had in the past year with farmers whose land is being taken to construct the Fermoy and Watergrasshill bypasses that I realised how modest are the sums involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">I am sure many of them have brought to the attention of the Minister of State that they are receiving little more than 50% of the rate received by farmers in the Youghal area three or four years ago. The sums have been adjusted downwards in a significant fashion and the compensation is insufficient to replace the land if it is purchased locally. In these circumstances, many of the farmers to whom I have spoken wish to purchase alternative land in order to maintain their scale of farming from an economic perspective. That they will lose 20% of the price they receive for the land is a serious blow.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">We have had this debate before and the Minister of State has already given his response. However, he should indicate that he will consider the issue of agricultural land in a far more sympathetic fashion. I take on board Senator Mansergh's remarks regarding those located in or close to cities who are losing small quantities of land and receiving significant compensation. However, they constitute an entirely different case from those to whom Senator John Paul Phelan and I have referred.</p>
          <p eId="para_568">The Minister of State must concentrate on farming families in rural areas who had no intention of ever selling their land but must do so in order to facilitate the development of social and economic projects. Nobody can object to such development. However, it is appropriate to examine the issue of capital gains taxation in regard to the moneys received by such landowners. I assure Senator Ryan that the moneys received are nowhere near as significant as I had expected. The net sum, minus the 20% capital gains tax reduction, will not allow these farming families to replace their land.</p>

I cannot accept a looser formulation to the effect that the amount payable in tax could be put into one's business. However, there is a case in principle which I can support but it must be narrowly focussed and defined. There is no case for capital gains tax relief for farmers who might be leasing their land and going out of business and who have no intention of buying a substitute five or ten acres.</p>

          <p eId="para_584">I happen to be familiar with the deal agreed between landowners and the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government because I was party to it. The deal involves the valuation of the land. Senator Bradford referred to lower prices being offered for land than was hitherto the case. The main discussion on this subject related to the size of a parcel of land. A farmer who loses three acres because of a road building project could not compare this parcel to a 100-acre farm being sold in his area. That is a matter of form. Account is taken of the disturbance the road will cause and the fact that part of the land might be severed from the main body. The deal is such that a farmer can receive a bonus for signing up to the scheme early rather than going through all the legal procedures associated with compulsory purchase orders. This is aimed at expediting the work in question. I understand the deal still offers fair compensation to farmers affected by road widening.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Hardball is being played. There has certainly been criticism of the NRA and other agencies over the cost of motorways. They are playing hardball in that they hire consultants to value the land in question. Likewise, the landowners hire consultants to value their land. There is always an argument over the value, which is probably only right.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The Senators referred to cases in Youghal and Bennett's Bridge, for example, but I understand landowners are quite happy about the deals that have been made. In advance of signing up to the deals, much hardball is played. The farmers may not receive as much as they desire but they are as good at negotiating as anybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I note Senator John Paul Phelan accepts that his recommendation might have been too broad. He seeks to restore roll-over relief for capital gains tax purposes where a disposal arises as a result of a compulsory purchase order. There was a thorough debate on this issue on Committee Stage in the Dáil in light of Deputy Bruton's similar proposal in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_588">If a gain arises on a disposal of land, whether it be as a result of a compulsory purchase order or otherwise, capital gains tax is due on that gain. There is no valid reason land that has been purchased compulsorily should be treated differently from land that has been offered for sale.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">The Senator referred to the compulsory purchase of private houses. If such a house is the principal private residence of the taxpayer, it would not be charged to capital gains tax. This is in line with the general exemption on such gains. Individual landowners and houseowners are being affected but they will not be charged capital gains tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">The current rate of capital gains tax is only 20%, compared to 40% prior to the 1998 budget. Roll-over relief was more important to the taxpayer when capital gains tax rates were as high as 60% in the 1980s. Reinstating the relief would result in gains being rolled over time and again, with the effect that the gain would not be realised in many cases. It is appropriate to tax gains where they are realised. Abolishing roll-over relief allows this to happen and brings capital gains tax in line with other taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">As already stated, the decision to abolish roll-over relief is consistent with the Government's taxation policy of having a wide tax base and low tax rates. The abolition of roll-over relief and other reliefs is the price that must be paid to achieve this wide tax base. The upsurge in capital gains tax receipts during the past eight years, since the rate was lowered to 20%, is just one indicator of the success of the Government's taxation policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">I appreciate the point Senator John Paul Phelan made about consolidation. In the most recent budget, acceptance was shown by the Minister for Finance for consolidation. The system was quite narrow in scope in that it allowed an exemption of stamp duty where farmers exchanged land. I would have sympathy for a person whose sole occupation is farming if he lost a few acres — even as few as ten — that he needed. I hope the understanding regarding consolidation demonstrated by the Minister in the most recent budget will be reciprocated and perhaps widened.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_638">Section 97 deals with hybrid vehicles. I am surprised this is still a temporary provision, rather than a permanent one. The Government can change that in the future if it wishes. I would have thought the environmental benefits of hybrid vehicles were so obvious that we could make this provision a permanent one. Automobile manufacturers would not have a degree of security for future investment decisions if governments worldwide did not give them a reasonable period of time to persuade consumers to buy cars that are much more environmentally friendly. I do not understand why the exemption under section 97 is only being extended to the end of 2006. This is not the way to encourage an environmentally beneficial change in car technology. I urge the Minister to clarify the issue as soon as possible and let us let people know that this exemption for hybrid vehicles will operate indefinitely.</p>

          <p eId="para_639">It is a recognition of the significantly lower levels of pollutants emitted by hybrid vehicles that this exemption is being extended. The exemption relates to continuously changing technology and is being extended on a two-year basis. We may have hydrogen cars or even more environmentally friendly cars in the future. The Minister will review the exemption at the end of 2006 and will extend it further if he thinks it reasonable.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ryan</from>
          <p eId="para_640">I am speaking as an engineer. Businesses need a climate of certainty within which to plan. If governments in other countries and the EU were to establish a vehicle registration tax cut of 20% but refused to extend the measure beyond one year, that would not encourage investment decisions about car manufacturing that encouraged innovation. It would be better to remove the termination date from the exemption and if hydrogen cars or biodiesel cars are developed in the future, the law can be changed. The exemption at the moment breeds uncertainty which is the one thing that businesses cannot handle. If the VRT reduction is removed, hybrid cars will become uneconomical in terms of people's willingness to buy them and will cease to sell. This is not the way to encourage investment in environmentally innovative technology.</p>

          <p eId="para_643">Businesses have supported Government policies over the past few years because it has reduced taxes and taken a pro-business line. It is as easy for the Minister for Finance to extend the relief after two years rather than enshrine it in law and change it after two years. The measure will be reviewed but I believe that it is not the main attraction of hybrid cars. Car technology will change substantially over the next few years and, as an engineer, Senator Ryan probably knows much more about this.</p>

          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_648">Senator John Paul Phelan's recommendation would provide that the VAT registration threshold for traders in services would increase from €25,500 to €75,000. The Senator will appreciate that EU VAT law, with which Irish law must comply, determines the rules in respect of any change in VAT registration thresholds. This means that it is possible to increase the thresholds but only in line with maintaining their real value.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">In the area of services, this would increase the current threshold to €34,502. The existing thresholds have been in operation since 1994. Increasing the service threshold to €75,000 would be under the real value increases permitted under the EU sixth VAT directive and would require consultation with the European Commission.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">The cost of increasing the services threshold as proposed would be approximately €160 million in a full year. Therefore, it is more appropriate to treat the question of raising VAT thresholds as a budgetary issue. Higher registration thresholds would cause competitive distortion between registered and unregistered businesses. Registered businesses which are obliged to charge VAT on services would be competing unfairly with unregistered businesses of a slightly smaller size. It should also be remembered that Ireland has the third highest registration threshold in the EU. Some member states have no registration thresholds and require all firms to register, irrespective of their turnover. In these circumstances, I cannot accept the recommendation.</p>

          <p eId="para_651">I move recommendation No. 11:<entity refersTo="#bill.2005.1.seanad.3_sub.rec_11" name="amendment"/>
                    </p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_652">In page 132, lines 18 to 31, to delete paragraph (<i>a</i>).</p>
          <p eId="para_653">I did not believe we would reach this recommendation. I wish to declare an interest. The reason for my doing so can be explained by the explanatory memorandum, which states that the first amendment ensures that the sale of food and drink which has been heated and is above the ambient air temperature when provided to the customer, remains liable to VAT at the reduced rate of 13.5% when purchased at a take-away outlet, supermarket, garage or other outlet.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">The Minister of State referred to Ireland's low income tax regime on Second Stage. Senator John Paul Phelan made the point that we continue to increase our spending taxes. A recent headline in a Sunday newspaper stated that the Government has some intention — it may not be true — of applying VAT to food. VAT is currently applied to luxury foods but not to basic foods. VAT has never been applied in respect of the latter.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">I wish to cite the example of two female executives I know, both of whom are in their 30s and married with one child, who work hard in pressurised environments. These women are the type of people, as was stated on Second Stage, to whom child care is important. They told me recently that, 20 years ago, when their fathers came home at 6 p.m. or 7 p.m., they would ask their mothers what was for dinner. People no longer do this because both parents work.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The women to whom I refer regard themselves as CTT customers, namely, those who cannot cook, who have not time to cook and who are too tired to cook. These are the people about whom the Minister of State is concerned. They informed me that they do not shop in my supermarkets for more than 25% of their goods and that they do not shop in any other supermarkets either. They are under such pressure that they make their purchases at whatever shop happens to be on their way home. The goods they buy are often those that are prepared and ready to eat at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">These are the products the Minister of State has singled out. I do not believe section 113 was noticed in the Dáil or by the media. It will impose a stealth tax. There were reasons for the numerous stealth taxes that were discussed in previous years. For example, the tax on plastic bags is sensible and understandable and there is a tax on water and bins in the form of water and bin charges. There was an ulterior motive, aimed at the good of the community, behind each of these. However, there is no such excuse for this tax. The Minister has singled out one particular range of goods to add to the list of foods that are already taxed. This tax affects those who are under time and financial pressures, such as parents who both work.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">If ever there were a stealth tax, this is it. This provision is being slipped in without explanation. Inflation and the price of foods will increase. These increases will not be huge but this tax is another "little extra". Will the Minister tell us if this is the first step in terms of trying to add VAT to all foodstuffs? This tax is slipping in without being identified or noticed. The Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business discussed the groceries order earlier and examined the price of food in Ireland to determine why it has been increasing. One of the reasons is that we have not carried out a regulatory impact analysis on legislation that is passed. Each item of legislation and regulation adds to the cost of business and food. I urge the Minister to re-examine this issue.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Phelan</from>
          <p eId="para_659">I agree with Senator Quinn's recommendation and also profess a personal interest because I frequently buy hot food from garages, Superquinn and other outlets. The Senator is correct in that this is the epitome of a stealth tax. To use a south Kilkenny colloquialism, it was "snuck in" between the budget and the publication of the Finance Bill 2005. It impacts on a particular segment of the community, the people who do not have as much time as they once did to prepare meals in their homes and who now frequently choose the convenience option. This may be portrayed as an attempt by the Government to tackle the obesity issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I and other politicians are regularly on the road and do not have the time to sit down and eat as we should. We end up grabbing this type of food. The Minister should accept Senator Quinn's recommendation on this petty matter as there is no need for the introduction of the new charge. Something must be done to reverse this decision.</p>

        <speech by="#TomParlonPD" eId="spk_380" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Finance">
          <from>Mr. Parlon</from>
          <p eId="para_661">This recommendation is opposed. It refers to section 113, which deals with the Sixth Schedule of the Value-Added Tax Act 1972. This schedule lists goods and services that are liable at the reduced rate of VAT of 13.5%. The paragraph in question deals with hot food and drink purchased for consumption, whether at a take away outlet, a garage, a supermarket or elsewhere.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The purpose of the provision is to ensure that the sale of heated food and drink that is above the ambient air temperature when provided to the customer remains liable to VAT at the reduced rate when purchased at one of the outlets to which I referred. The provision arises as there was a recent challenge to the interpretation of the existing legislation. The provision does not change the position in regard to the charging of VAT on food and there is no issue of it being "snuck in". It does not change the situation but merely ensures that the rate applied since 1986 continues in the normal way.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">The effect of the Senator's recommendation would be to zero rate hot foods sold for take away while leaving foods sold in a restaurants at the reduced rate. This would place restaurants at a competitive disadvantage. Revenue has estimated that a loss of €30 million would be incurred in the supermarket sector alone if the Government accepts the recommendation. In addition, the reference to "time of supply" in the current legislation has been amended to "time it is provided to the customer" to remove any ambiguity about the appropriate rate of VAT. If the food is hot when provided to the customer, VAT is charged at 13.5% irrespective of when the food is paid for. If the food is cold when provided to the customer, it does not fall within the provision.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">There are no changes. This deals with an issue that was raised with the Appeals Commissioner and reappraises the situation since 1986.</p>

If there is a question of stealth, perhaps it is a stealth removal of tax rather than a stealth introduction of tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I do not believe there is the slightest intention to introduce VAT on the foodstuffs mentioned by Senator Quinn. People sometimes make the general point that indirect taxation is less progressive than income tax but they do not account for the mitigating effects of the zero rate placed on certain basic food necessities.</p>

          <p eId="para_669">——there has been no VAT on hot food until now. It is clear from the Minister of State's comments that there will be VAT in the future. Why has he singled out this change? He has indicated that this is probably occurring at the behest of restaurant businesses. Those involved in that sector have said it is not fair to compete with garages, petrol stations and shops which sell food, and pleaded with the Minister of State to do something about it. He, in turn, decided to make customers pay €30 million extra for the privilege of buying hot food to take home to eat rather than to be consumed in restaurants.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">If ever there was a stealth tax or a tax that, as Senator John Paul Phelan stated, was being "snuck in", this is it. I do not understand the Minister of State's comment to the effect that there was always a tax on hot food. I was of the opinion that there was no tax on it. However, the legislation ensures that there will be a tax in the future and that the public will pay €30 million more than it would otherwise have paid. I am surprised by the size of that figure. I wish to ensure that the public is aware of this €30 million tax increase. It was not introduced in the Budget and was not contained in the Finance Bill as originally published; it was brought in by way of an amendment. If ever there was anything that was "snuck in", this is it.</p>

          <from>Mr. Ross</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_674">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_675">That Seanad Éireann calls on the Government to take urgent measures to open the West Link Toll Bridge on Dublin's M50 motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">We are here to discuss the issue of the West Link toll bridge. This motion calls on the Government to take urgent measures to ensure that the West Link toll bridge is opened as soon as possible to alleviate the traffic problems on that stretch of the M50. It is a deliberately broad motion, designed to give an opening to the Government to come forward with any proposals it sees fit to alleviate the appalling problem that faces commuters on the M50 at the West Link.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">The lack of logic regarding the toll bridge plaza is staggering. If one goes out there at peak hours from Monday to Friday and stands on the southern side, when the majority of the traffic is going north, one can see miles of vehicles on one side of the gates and empty space on the other. A simple solution would be to open those gates to the traffic. National Toll Roads, NTR, and the Government have decided that this is not the optimum solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">When a deal was struck between NTR and the authorities in 1987, the projections for traffic estimated that in the region of 11,000 cars per day would use the motorway. Those 11,000 cars represent only one third of the vehicles that actually use the M50. Approximately 95,000 vehicles pass through the West Link toll bridge plaza each day. Such levels of traffic were not even dreamt of at the time the deal was struck. Some people would say that NTR deserves its good luck because it took a risk and is reaping the benefits. That is a fair point. However, what is happening at present is not in the public interest. It is damaging to the public good, to the people involved and to the economy. All that time wasted by vibrant, energetic and often young people is indefensible in economic terms. However, this particular wrong continues to obtain.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">The campaign to open the toll gates was provoked by an extraordinary 20% price rise, imposed on 3 January 2005, from €1.50 to €1.80. That was an opportunist price increase and an extraordinary piece of profiteering. NTR is well aware that current traffic levels were not even conceived of at the time of the agreement. It knows that the agreement is water tight and it is also aware that the problem of the M50 and the toll bridge will worsen in the coming years. The worse the problem gets, the better it is for NTR. The situation is going to get a great deal worse because the number of vehicles passing through the toll plaza will increase and NTR will make even more money.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">What are we to do about this? There is an obligation on the Government to do something to alleviate the situation because NTR is not going to do anything. Building another lane on the M50 will make the situation worse in the short term. We know that the proposed repairs to the M50 will take approximately five years to complete. Lanes will be closed during this time. As a result, when the traffic increases, the capacity for carrying it will decrease. This is an acute situation. The M50 is not yet completed but I suspect it will be by August of this year. What will be the result of that? When the last leg is completed, there will be even more traffic on the road and the situation at the toll bridge will continue to worsen. As the average motorist is obliged to endure these difficulties, NTR will make even greater profits. That is immoral, wrong and unethical.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">I do not dispute that a deal was struck by NTR in 1987 — a further deal was reached at a later date — which was brilliant in its conception and in terms of its enterprise. However, no Government can allow a business to develop in a way that is so constantly and obviously against the public interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">What is NTR's reaction to all of this? Apart from increasing the toll from €1.50 to €1.80, which it is perfectly entitled to do under the agreement, the company has conducted a particularly lively lobby in recent weeks. When this campaign began, we arranged to send a large number of e-mails to NTR, the Government and the Department of Transport. Over 5,000 were sent before the campaign was halted. I apologise to the Minister for blocking his in-box for so long but these things must be done. I am aware that the message got through. Irate drivers from Meath and Kildare, in particular, informed the Minister that the position was unacceptable. NTR received the same number of e-mails and proceeded to reply to them meticulously and on an individual basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Every Member of the House was lobbied prior to this debate and received a significant amount of literature that contains misinformation. This is the way lobbying works in the House. Lobbyists have enormous clout and power. It appears that in recent months these people have had free access to Members of the House. The average motorist does not enjoy this privilege. If NTR's lobbyists are effective, they will copperfasten the deal with the Government and motorists will continue to suffer. That is neither fair nor right.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">We should give greater consideration to the attitude of the Government — which has done nothing in terms of lessening the misery experienced by commuters — than to that of NTR. Formal and informal contacts with the Government draw the response that a watertight contract was agreed and nothing can be done. The Government says it is tied into the contract so everybody must continue to suffer. Fortunately, the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, broke ranks by objecting to the price rise and asking that something be done about it. God bless him for that. We may see him later this evening, if we are lucky. The Minister rapped him over the knuckles in an effective way and Deputy Callely has been silent since. If Deputy Callely comes before the House, I will offer him some of my summing-up time to tell us whether his position has changed. It would be interesting to know that. The Government's initial position of doing nothing is unfortunate.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">The original deal, over which the Government stands, and which it uses as its protection, was unprecedented in its generosity to a company. No such deal with any toll company today would be tolerated now. NTR was given preferential monopolistic treatment over which no Government could stand now.</p>

The price the Government paid is continued unpopularity and, more seriously, the recent loss of a by-election. It is no coincidence that Deputy Catherine Murphy, the Independent candidate, won the by-election in County Kildare. Deputy Catherine Murphy, according to her by-election literature, backed the campaign to open the toll bridge plaza. She attended the meetings and she has said it since her election.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">Senator Kate Walsh also backed that campaign. I will welcome her vote with us on this motion because she specifically stated that she was 100% behind it. We will also welcome Senators Morrissey and Bohan, if they are consistent with what they have said on this issue. There is a great deal of support from the Government side for this but let us see what happens when it comes to a vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">I have two questions for the Minister, in reply to which he may depart from his script. I have just come from a meeting of the Joint Committee on Transport at which the chief executive of the NRA said that it is in discussions with the Department and that a buy-out of the toll bridge plaza is not off the agenda. Will the Minister respond to that and say whether any dialogue is under way with NTR at present? Does he agree with the NRA that open tolling — his apparent solution to this problem — will take until 2008 and 2009 to introduce? In other words, is this misery going to continue for a minimum of another three or four years?</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_692">I welcome the opportunity to second the motion. I compliment my colleague, Senator Ross — after 20 years of trying — on finding an issue on which we are in absolute agreement. I am appalled by the Government amendment. I do not see the sense in it. It is utterly unpolitical and has the hallmark of people who have been too long in office. They are in a comfort zone. It does not reflect the views of anybody I know.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">While I wholeheartedly support the motion, I do not support my colleague's final point. I do not know what it would cost to buy out the toll bridges but, on a very rough calculation, if NTR is earning €25 million or €30 million a year — this would probably rise to €40 million with the extra lanes — and that is capitalised at 5%, the sum involved is significant. If buying back the toll bridges was to cost as much as Luas, there would be a public outcry. We should take them back and do whatever appropriate deal can be done in that context. According to the Government amendment, the extra lanes are intended to increase the capacity of the M50. That could be amended to read "increase the income to NTR and the Government". NTR's point that €1 of every €1.80 goes to the Government is significant.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">This causes extraordinary and unquantifiable angst to people during the day. It increases costs relating to child minding and productivity and increases the stress experiences by those who are delayed on the M50 each day. This is not all the fault of NTR. On each occasion a plan has been drawn up, it has been wrong. There are good reasons for this. In some cases, for example, nobody could have anticipated the significant increase in traffic. Extra lanes are about to be opened on the toll plaza.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">Senator Morrissey has frequently raised the issue of placing large park and ride facilities at every junction on the M50. The absence of these is a problem. Making such facilities available would also require the provision of bus services to carry passengers along the radial routes, not the M50, into the city.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Does the Minister know that there is no free public park and ride facility on the north side of Dublin? Many people park their cars in the car parks of pubs on the N1, N2 and N3 before catching buses to work at 6 a.m. As part of any increase in lanes, NTR should be required to pay for the new lanes that will generate extra money. There should be a significant park and ride facility at each junction on the motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">In addition to extra lanes, a rail line should be laid alongside the M50. I do not understand why that is not done with every new road. It would provide a contact point for the length of the M50 and open a new range of possibilities to ease traffic in Dublin. Motorists would then get something back for funding the motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">There may be cities in Europe where one must pay to travel on main ring roads. However, even though I have driven through all of western Europe, I do not know of one city where this is the case. Even in cities comparable in the size to Dublin — I refer here to Lyons — when one enters the urban zone, one leaves the toll area. This is the normal practice. Anyone travelling long distances on continental or French roads, in particular, will find this. I cannot understand why we are stuck with this problem and cannot find a solution.</p>
          <p eId="para_699">I have referred on many occasions to toll bridges. What bothers me most about the deal done 30 years ago are not just the issues raised by Senator Ross. I accept the argument that much of what happened could not be anticipated. I resented at the time that taxpayers were funding the building of a 20 km or 30 km road while another crowd was building a bridge across it and gaining from it. I am on record at the time as saying it was a bad deal. As we move forward, we must examine the broader issues. I am certain that the points raised by Senator Ross about the public view on this issue are correct. There is public anxiety and public opposition to this project. There is no support for the 20% increase which happened and more money being put into the coffers of NTR and the Government at the expense of people who are responsible for productivity in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_700">We heard this morning that a 6% increase in economic growth is expected over the next number of years. This is being delivered by the people who are being charged to get to work to deliver this economic growth. This is neither correct nor necessary. It does not fit in with the plan to share wealth.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">We need to find a legal means to extricate ourselves from this situation. I do not believe we can afford to pay a capitalised amount based on the current significant and extraordinary income. The more we increase the income, the more difficult this will become. We should attempt to reduce toll charges before there are any negotiations on a buy-out. Agreeing to increased toll charges, while talking about a buy-out, is simply spending money to line the coffers of National Toll Roads which already has plenty money. We need to pull back from this. I do not blame the company. It exists to make a profit; that is its God. The bottom line is that the company's job is to make a profit. It is up to us to put restraints on it and give it back to the people. We should introduce Bertie's socialism to modern Ireland. This is an amenable step forward towards that particular philosophy.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">The motion tabled by Senator Ross will strike a chord and get support from ordinary people. The Government's amendment fails to address and engage with the issue; it is a diversion.</p>

          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_703">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_704">To delete all words after "Seanad Éireann" and substitute the following:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_705">"welcomes the priority being accorded to the M50 Upgrade project and notes that the upgrade works will substantially increase the capacity of the M50, improve traffic flow, reduce congestion on the radial routes and incorporate a move to barrier free tolling".</p>
          <p eId="para_706">I welcome the Minister to the House for this important debate. There has been much talk for some time in this House and outside about this issue. There have been many soundbites and much talk about gridlock. This is something which concerns all of us and needs to be addressed. I contend that the Government is doing its best in a difficult situation. Obviously it is trying to overcome this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_707">Much of the talk has centred around supposed solutions. I am not sure that what I have heard this evening puts forward a feasible solution. There are a number of basic facts which the Government and all of us must take into account. National Toll Roads' initial contract was for the construction and thereafter the operation of the two bridges, making up the West Link. The initial contract dates back to August 1987 and the contract for the second bridge dates back to 2001. The State entered into these contracts in good faith. While the contract was based on the best available traffic projections and estimates at the time, it was also based on the state of the economy. It would be worthwhile recalling the economic environment in 1987 when these projections were made.</p>
          <p eId="para_708">Senator Ross outlined that the projections were for approximately 20,000 vehicles per day. This number has now reached in excess of 90,000 vehicles on an average day, and at certain times of the year it peaks at approximately 100,000 vehicles a day. There is no doubt this is a significant increase on what was projected and has created great strain.</p>
          <p eId="para_709">It is well documented that the country was on the verge of bankruptcy in 1987. We should also remember who changed this around, but I do not want to get into a lecture on economics.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyBurke" eId="spk_394">
          <from>Mr. P. Burke</from>
          <p eId="para_710">Alan Dukes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_395">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_711">Is that correct? The Senator has a better memory than the rest of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">In 1987, the incoming Government faced some very difficult political and social challenges which had to be undertaken. There were hospital closures, bed closures and ward closures. Various taxes were introduced to try to meet current spending and deal with the capital requirements. I was talking to someone today and we were trying to figure out the real bad points in 1987. Some local authorities considered turning off street lights because they could not afford to pay the bills. If one tries to recognise the difficulties the Government faced at the time, it might help to shed some light on why this deal was put together, why it was acceptable and why it was considered a good deal. At the time, there was rising inflation, company closures, job losses and a return of the scourge of emigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">There is no doubt the deal was reached against this backdrop. As Senator Burke pointed out, substantial work on this contract was done by the former Minister for the Public Service in the 1982-87 coalition Government, John Boland. In light of the poor state of the country's finances, and the grim outlook for the economy, it was a good deal at the time. It would be unfair to apportion blame to anyone. Senator Ross made a couple of snide comments about a former Minister, Mr. Flynn. I understand he was just the signatory to the deal. A substantial part of the negotiations was carried out by the previous Government, but the Senator made a snide insinuation that some sort of a cosy deal was done. He named another council official to create this broad implication. This remark needs to be rubbished and put to one side.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">There has been tremendous growth in the economy as a result of the actions taken by that Government and successive Governments since 1987. The success of these policies has led to this overcrowding. We will move on from that by recognising that we are where we are. We are in a difficult situation with which people must grapple on a daily basis. I met many of these people when I was canvassing in Kildare during the by-election campaign. There is no doubt that these people are facing some very difficult times, which Senator O'Toole highlighted.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">The solutions being suggested by the Opposition, a number of Independents and others are ludicrous. Opening up the barriers will ultimately lead to the payment of compensation to NTR. There is a contract in place but if the Government finds some methodology to take back the bridges into State control, which Senator O'Toole advocated, what will that say to companies the Government is trying to bring to this country to become involved in PPP projects? It would effectively say to them that we are running some sort of despot operation as an excuse for a Government. It would imply that if we do not like what happens after signing up to a contract, we are prepared to rubbish it, throw it in the bin, take back the contract and tell companies to take a hike. That would be a dreadful precedent to set. It would mitigate against any PPP projects that the Government might in the future want to undertake and is something we should not enter into.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">The other suggestion was to buy back the bridge. The cost of that would be phenomenal. The money available to the Department of Transport in its Estimate could be spent much better in other parts of the country. While recognising the difficulties associated with the M50, there is life outside the M50. There is life in the BMW region, which I am sure Senator Wilson will discuss, and in the mid-west where I come from. Many infrastructural projects need investment.</p>

          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_717">There are toll roads also.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TimDooley" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Mr. Dooley</from>
          <p eId="para_718">We would be happy to have them if they overcame some of our problems. However, we should not use funds that are badly needed for road, hospital or school building projects in other parts of the country to buy back that infrastructure. There is a daily cry from the Opposition about the fact that sufficient funds are not being invested in other sectors. From where would that money come? I would certainly not make suggestions in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">Tolls are required at present. The real solution lies in the upgrading of the M50, as outlined by the Government. Is there a way this can be expedited? There are issues surrounding planning, associated appeals and compulsory purchase orders. We cannot address these overnight but we must deal with them as quickly as possible. The plan is set out in two phases and involves a huge amount of money. I would not, therefore, advocate the opening of the tolls because the money that will be generated in the coming years will be needed to pay for the upgrading. People must accept reality. The costs, which are in the region of €1 billion, are phenomenal.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Negative comments were made about NTR. Like a number of other spokespersons, I have met NTR representatives in order to be briefed on their background issues. It seems clear that they are doing a relatively good job in line with the conditions set out in their contract. When benchmarked against UK and European operators — I refer, in particular, to Dartford Toll — the throughput, in terms of tolling, on the West Link is approximately 22% greater than on the busiest thoroughfare in Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I am not telling the Minister anything he has not known for a long period when I state that the solution is to ensure, notwithstanding the constraints that exist, that the upgrading takes place as quickly as possible. We must also ensure that funding is provided by the continued imposition of tolling on the relevant roads.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SheilaTerry" eId="spk_398">
          <from>Ms Terry</from>
          <p eId="para_722">I welcome the Minister. I do not intend to rubbish NTR and I agree with Senator Dooley that it was a good provider of infrastructure at a time when the country could not afford it. It is doing a good job in so far as is possible. However, we must consider the environment in which it works. It is not NTR's fault that the current situation exists. Problems relating to planning and the delivery of infrastructure have led to this situation and to the need for Senator Ross to table this motion, which I support.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Problems with gridlock are of the Government's making. The Government parties have been in power long enough to improve the relevant infrastructure. I live within a stone's throw of the M50, so I know what happens on it on a daily basis and am aware of its impact on local communities. The M50 was very aspirational for its time in that it was to be a European route and not a local road. Now, however, it is a local road serving local needs. It was never built for that purpose. We have known for many years that this is the case and that an outer ring road is needed. In the absence of that ring road, there is traffic congestion — and not just at peak times — each day on the M50. The barriers must be lifted to keep traffic flowing, even if it is only moving at 10 mph or 20 mph. There is no need for speed limits because one can never reach the maximum limit in the vicinity of the toll bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">This situation will not improve until we get proper infrastructure in the area. This is where the Government is at fault. In the absence of the infrastructure to which I refer, the Minister must do whatever is necessary to keep traffic flowing — even if it is at 15 or 20 mph. There is no doubt that the toll bridge is delaying traffic. While one can travel from the airport to Finglas at 50 mph, the traffic is queued up from Finglas onwards trying to get through the toll bridge. Once one is through the toll bridge, one can travel at a reasonable speed once again. It would help clear the clogging if the toll bridge was open to traffic. Conor Faughnan of the AA has spoken about this issue for years and supports the idea of opening the gates to traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">If the Government parties' amendment had included the provision of the outer ring road, I would have seen some credibility in what is proposed tonight. However, what is proposed does nothing to further the cause of trying to build a proper infrastructure in the area. When the M50 was first built, rat-running occurred on all local roads. Motorists did not want to pay the charge and tried to avoid doing so by using other roads. Senator Morrissey will be aware of this. Motorists still use the local roads, not to avoid paying the toll but to avoid congestion on the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">It is time we took the planning and delivery of our infrastructure seriously. The number of cars currently on our roads is unsustainable. The widening of the M50 will result in an increased number of cars into the area and impose intolerable pain on motorists and the local community. Will the Minister indicate when he will provide for the new outer ring road to relieve congestion? If we fail to address the problems of the M50 and the general infrastructure in the area, we will not be able to continue the economic growth of recent years and the economy will suffer. People will not want to locate in Ireland, particularly as they will be constantly stuck in traffic.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">We are not dealing with the issue of removing motorists from our roads. I agree with Senator Ross that we need park and ride facilities. We have requested these for many years but one such facility has yet to be delivered. People should be able to park their car, pay for the privilege and be transported into the city by bus. That should not just be for those coming from the outer suburbs but also those on the orbital route. We should have more buses on that route. I also support the concept of putting in place a rail line.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">I fully support what Senator Ross is saying. Senator Morrissey, local people and I have been saying it for many years. However, our words have fallen on deaf ears. It is time the Government woke up to the fact that it can no longer continue in this mode.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">While I accept that it was a different time, NTR has done very well out of the deal and it recognises that fact. I call on NTR, in accepting that it has had a good deal, to hand responsibility for the tolls back to the State. I am not suggesting the company should hand it back free of charge. However, the money that would be saved in getting our traffic moving would be worth it for the economy. It would be a small price to pay. A figure of €400 million has been mentioned. Will the Minister indicate how much he estimates it would cost to buy back the tolls? It would be money well spent if it helped to keep the economy moving. Senator Dooley disagrees. He does not feel the pain motorists have to endure on that road every day.</p>

It would be a good day's work if the toll could be done away with and the traffic allowed to flow, even at 20 mph. The toll bridge is nothing but a money-making machine at this stage. That is not good enough. We are not delivering a service to our people or to the country. It is time to ensure that this comes to an end.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinCullen" as="#Minister_for_Transport" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Minister for Transport (Mr. Cullen)</from>
          <p eId="para_734">I thank Senators for their contributions. I thank Senator Ross for tabling the motion and Senator O'Toole for seconding it. They have given me the opportunity to come before the House to debate the important issue of the upgrade of the M50, including a move to barrier-free tolling.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">The growth of traffic on the M50 mirrors the growth of Ireland's population, its economy, employment and vehicle fleet during the past ten years. The scale of this growth has imposed major strains on our physical infrastructure, particularly that which relates to transport. The Government has responded to this challenge by a sustained commitment to high levels of capital investment. In the case of national roads, for example, Exchequer investment in 2005 alone will amount to over €1.4 billion. The beneficial impact of this high level of investment is evident throughout the country in the completion of major projects and the elimination of major bottlenecks such as those at Monasterevin, Kildare, Ballincollig, Cashel, etc. Good progress is being made in implementing the national roads improvement programme and we are beginning to see the benefits in reduced inter-urban journey times on key routes.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">A major project in this programme is the upgrade of the M50, including the West Link toll facility, which is being prioritised by the National Roads Authority. Before outlining the main elements of this project, it would be useful to set out the background to the West Link toll facility and the position regarding toll revenues, the impact of the toll plaza on congestion and the application of West Link experience in recent PPP contracts. I shall also address the issue of a buy-out of the toll rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">The original West Link toll agreement was approved in principle by the Government in October 1984 on foot of proposals by the then Minister for the Environment, Mr. Liam Kavanagh, and concluded in October 1987 between Dublin County Council and NTR. The agreement provided for the construction, maintenance and operation of 3.2 km of motorway on the M50 between the N3, Navan Road, and the N4, Galway Road, interchanges as well as the West Link bridge spanning 385 m over the Liffey valley. The project, which was one of the first sections of the M50 Dublin C-ring to be completed, opened to traffic in 1990.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">The 1984 agreement provides that the toll company, NTR plc., has, until the expiry of the agreement in 2020, the exclusive right to toll traffic travelling on the M50 between the N4, Galway Road interchange, and the N3, Navan Road interchange. It also provides that the tolls can be increased in line with inflation. The maximum toll that can be charged at West Link is updated each year by reference to the consumer price index.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The bridge was opened to traffic in 1990. Prior to the conclusion of the agreement in 1987, average annual daily traffic for 1990 was projected at 18,400 vehicles. Average daily traffic levels grew from 11,500 vehicles in 1991, to more than 15,000 in 1993, to 45,500 in 1997, 67,000 in 2000 and to more than 78,000 in 2003. It should be noted that the level of traffic projected for 1990 was not reached until 1995. I was in the House at the time and remember the debate on the cost involved, particularly in light of the fact that the traffic projections were nowhere near to being achieved. That is set against the background of a big change today.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">In November 1999 the National Roads Authority reached agreement with NTR relating to the construction of the second West Link bridge. The agreement provided for the construction of the second bridge and a car toll increase of approximately 20 cent. The draft agreement was concluded on the then legal basis that VAT was not applicable to tolls. In July 2000, however, the European Court of Justice ruled that VAT must be applied to tolls. The effect of the application of VAT on the draft agreement would have been for the private car toll charge to rise from approximately €1 — 80p in old money — as was the toll charge for the period 1 January 2001 to end of August 2001, to a car toll charge of €1.60 on 1 January 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The National Roads Authority was concerned at a rise in the toll charge of effectively 60% in the space of four months, September 2001 to January 2002, particularly as there would be no improvement in the level of service at West Link until September 2003, when the second bridge was due to be opened.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">The National Roads Authority, therefore, with the approval of the then Department of the Environment and Local Government, agreed with NTR in June 2001, as part of the supplemental agreement relating to the second West Link bridge, a revised toll structure for the period September 2001 to 31 December 2004, to take account of the imposition of VAT and the construction of the second bridge. This agreement provided for a car toll charge of €1.27 between September and December 2001, €1.30 in 2002, €1.30 in 2003 and €1.50 in 2004. The maximum allowable toll permissible under the agreement for each of the years 2002, 2003 and 2004 would have been €1.60, €1.70 and €1.70, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">This lower car toll structure was made possible by the then Minister for the Environment and Local Government agreeing to moderating the increase in the car toll by means of a reduction in the State's share of the gross toll revenue in 2002 and 2003. This reduction amounted to €2.9 million and €3.5 million for 2002 and 2003, respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">The West Link car toll was maintained below the maximum allowable toll charge for a number of years through the Government foregoing part of the revenue share payable under the West Link toll agreement, that is, the actual car toll was not allowed to increase in accordance with the applicable by-laws<b>.</b> The rises in 2004, 20 cent, and 2005, 30 cent, represent, in effect, a catch up of the indexation provisions and the car toll increase required by NTR to provide for the construction of the second bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">The position in regard to total toll revenues since 1990 is that gross toll revenue from 1990 to end 2004 amounted to €308.987 million, exclusive of VAT. Of this, a total of €64.397 million in licence fees, also referred to as the State's share of the gross toll revenue, has been paid to the State. During the period 1998-2004, commercial rates of €10.4 million, a not insignificant amount, were paid to Fingal County Council, while South Dublin County Council received €2.5 million during the same period. In addition, gross VAT receipts since 1 September 2001 amount to approximately €28 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">It is clear that the concession has worked out well for NTR but it should be acknowledged that from the toll revenue it receives, it has to meet liabilities arising in respect of the repayment of capital and interest and the operation and maintenance of the toll facility and 3.2 km of motorway, corporation tax rates payable to Fingal and South Dublin county councils, the Exchequer share of toll receipts payable to the Department of Transport and investment in the toll road to ensure a high-quality road pavement. Some have proposed that the State buy out NTR on the basis that the toll plaza is causing congestion and that NTR is earning super profits. Where tolls are abolished altogether the agreement provides that the NRA must make a monthly payment to NTR, calculated on the basis of the preceding 12 months average, to the value of the lost revenues with such amount indexed each year by reference to CPl, in respect of the remaining years of the toll concession agreement, which, as already indicated, will run until 2020. The House can imagine the scale and cost to the taxpayer and the money that will be lost instead of being invested in other road infrastructure which is badly needed.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">It should also be noted that the €650 million estimated cost of phase two of the M50 upgrade works is proposed to be funded through the annual Exchequer share of the West Link toll revenue as well as toll revenues from West Link for a period post the expiry of the current concession in 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">It is important that this is understood. The massive expansion phase of the M50 has been possible because of those revenues. If this were not available, other inter-urban routes, other roads and investment in public transport would not be possible. It is a question of trade-offs with the Exchequer trying to maximise its investment and resolving some of the issues pertaining to the M50.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">Any consideration of the buy-out of NTR's rights would have to take account of the cost involved and the implications for the national roads programme if the cost had to be funded from the funding provision available for the national roads programme and the implications for the funding of the M50 upgrade.</p>
          <p eId="para_750">It is acknowledged that the toll plaza is sub-optimal, having regard to the current daily traffic throughput and that the approaches and departure sections are inadequate for the high traffic levels.</p>

          <p eId="para_754">There are also infrastructure deficiencies along other sections of the M50 particularly at key interchanges. It is the combination of these factors that gives rise to the delays experienced by motorists using the M50 as well as the radial routes traversing the M50. Removing the toll plaza would not in itself, and pending the upgrade of the M50, make a major difference at peak hour when the interchanges are congested. The NRA's plans for the M50 upgrade comprehensively address these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">The following may be of interest to Senator Ross and others. In a recent presentation on the M50, figures seemed to demonstrate that the toll plaza is far and away a lesser problem. The real and substantive problems on the M50 are caused by the access and exit routes. I have seen all the graphs which demonstrate this problem. I am neither an engineer nor an expert so I can only take at face value the information I am given. It strikes me that if the barriers were taken away at peak hours tomorrow morning, for argument's sake, it would not make one whit of difference to the congestion.</p>

          <p eId="para_757">I want to do it in conjunction with the other developments I have referred to in the House. It will make a difference in conjunction with the expansion of the M50. It will be necessary to consider demand management as a feature in traffic control around Dublin in the longer term. This will need to be considered in the context of the completion of many of the developments in Dublin. The M50 was designed to be used by bypass traffic but less than 14% of the traffic using the M50 is bypass traffic. Local traffic accounts for 84% of the traffic even though the motorway was never designed to be so used.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">In case of misunderstanding, the route to which I referred recently in the context of the ten-year investment strategy in public transport was not an alternative M50 or a second M50; it is a completely different route with a different purpose. Its impact on the M50 will not be very significant, bearing in mind that the traffic on the M50 is largely local traffic. The route to which I referred has the potential to take traffic trying to bypass Dublin away from Dublin. The route has not been selected. I have asked the NRA to consider the plan and maps have been published in the newspapers which show notional routes from Drogheda cutting across to Navan and Naas. By naming those towns I do not mean that will be the route. This will take true Dublin bypass traffic away from the city. I am not presenting it as a second M50 and it would be wrong to suggest that.</p>

          <p eId="para_762">I agree. We have all been up and down on those issues but we are where we are. The greatest opponents of the Luas are now its greatest supporters. Some in both Houses and those in the media did nothing but criticise it on a daily basis. Once it was opened it was loved and is a marvellous addition, proving beyond doubt that such transport has a significant capacity to make a contribution to the future solution in Dublin. I will not speak much further on that subject because I will be regarded as trading off different projects against others. What is needed is a total and holistic solution to Dublin's problems and that is what the Government and I intend to deliver in the ten-year transport investment programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">With the benefit of hindsight, it is clear that the original agreement, approved in principle in October 1984 and concluded in October 1987, has proven to be very profitable for NTR. I wish to make it clear, however, that the experience gained from the West Link agreement has informed the development and negotiation of recent PPP contracts. In the past 24 months the NRA has entered into three PPP contracts. The contractual obligations within these PPP contracts are extremely elaborate and onerous when compared to those in the West Link toll bridge agreement. Some of the key differences from the 1987 deal concluded on the West Link are a competitive tendering process in accordance with national and EU tendering procedures; specialist traffic and financial advice in assessment of tenders; more optimal revenue sharing arrangements; contract variation provisions to facilitate changes in tolling technologies; and exacting toll plaza performance standards aimed at ensuring efficient throughput of vehicles. I ask Senator Ross to note that I do not accept it will take four or five years to put open tolling in place.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cullen</from>
          <p eId="para_765">I have informed the NRA I do not accept that timeframe and I wish to put that on the record of the House. I cannot understand why it would take that long. This is not new technology that must be invented; it already exists. I know it is not as simple as putting in the new technology but with a direct approach and a little effort in this regard, it would take a lot less time in my view. I have not been persuaded by NTR as to that timeframe.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The financial terms of the PPP contracts have been scrutinised by the NRA's financial advisers. This included sensitivity analyses and an assessment of potential profit returns to the PPP company at traffic volumes in excess of both the PPP company's forecasts and NRA forecasts. The NRA's advisers have concluded that the contracts entered into represent value for money for the public sector and that the revenue-sharing arrangement included in the contracts is such that the PPP company will not earn excessive profits from these schemes arising from unanticipated growth in traffic volumes.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">These new PPP contracts, among other things, specify exacting performance standards that the PPP company must meet in respect of the toll facility operations. They are aimed at ensuring high customer service standards and minimum delay at toll plazas. Failure to observe these requirements will entail penalties on the PPP companies.</p>
          <p eId="para_768">The NRA is mandating in the contracts that electronic toll collection must be provided across all toll lanes as well as providing one dedicated ETC lane on all plazas in each direction for cars and light vehicles, increasing to two lanes in each direction should traffic volumes require it. In the future all tolling will be of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">I hope the foregoing has clarified the key aspects of the West Link agreement. It will be clear from what I have said that the solution to the peak hour congestion on the M50 requires the implementation of the M50 upgrade project and a move to open road tolling at West Link. The M50 upgrade motorway scheme and EIS were published in September 2004 and were the subject of an An Bord Pleanála oral hearing in February 2005. The upgrade involves the widening of approximately 32 km of the motorway from two to three lanes in each direction, from the M50 M1 interchange near Dublin Airport through to the Sandyford interchange, which is under construction, and the upgrade of ten junctions along this length.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">Subject to favourable decisions from An Bord Pleanála on the proposal, the NRA envisages that the design and build contract will be awarded by October 2005 for phase one, the N4 to the N7 section, and that the PPP contract for the remainder of the upgrade project will follow next year. The NRA's required solution for the West Link toll facility is to move on a phased basis to open road tolling. The environmental impact statement for the M50 upgrade project provides for a move on a phased basis to open road electronic tolling. The transition from the current toll collection arrangements to a non-stop electronic toll collection facility will be implemented over a number of stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">In summary, the solution to the problems on the M50 and at West Link is the upgrade of the M50 and a move to barrier-free open road tolling. This will provide increased capacity to improve traffic flow on the M50 and on radial routes connecting to the M50, and the removal of the manual payments arrangements.</p>

          <p eId="para_772">I live almost as far away as is possible from the M50 and my experiences of that particular toll bridge are those I would associate with the worst kind of monopoly. The last time I was there, the signage was indifferent to the customer. A little sign read "Toll Ahead" and by the time one got close enough to know what lane one should be in, one was already in a lane. By the time one found out how to pay, one was almost at the plaza. Not having proper signs far enough away to tell people where they were going, how they could pay and how much to pay shows extraordinary indifference to customers and is classic behaviour of a body that believes it has a cosy monopoly and does not need to think for a second about its customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">I am intrigued by the fact that over the past ten years we have gone to elaborate lengths to break down public sector monopolies and to create semi-artificial markets, as with the ESB, to try to have competition, while at the same time we are effectively protecting private sector monopolies. Comreg is now threatening to reimpose price controls on Eircom because of rip-offs. What is Government about if it is not to able to do something about a manifestly appalling contract? I do not accept that it is impossible to look at that contract again. Currently, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, is endeavouring to renegotiate the contracts of thousands of hospital consultants because she does not like them. One solution an economist has suggested, if the contract will not be renegotiated, is to build another bridge that people can use for free and NTR can live with the consequences. I despair sometimes when I read ministerial scripts. According to the Minister, the key differences from the 1987 deal are competitive tendering processes, specialist traffic and financial advice. Did we really make major capital investments in this country without specialist advice?</p>

          <p eId="para_780">The reality is that NTR, owned by people who were good friends of Fianna Fáil, was given a sweetheart deal. Let us remember what happened. NTR took fright with the East Link and so were guaranteed against loss. After experimenting and discovering that one could make a great deal of money out of bridges, NTR said it wanted to build the West Link, and in that case a guarantee against loss was not sought because it knew what it was facing. The truth is that in spite of all of the other problems, that bridge and those toll booths are a major nuisance for commuters. It is impossible to get away from that. The question for someone living away from Dublin is how to relieve the misery of almost 1 million people in the 100,000 vehicles per day that go through there.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">When the second bridge was built how did somebody agree that there would be a smaller number of pay booths than there is proposed for the Portlaoise to Castletown motorway or the Fermoy bypass? In those cases, the forecast traffic in 20 years time will be less than 30,000 vehicles per day. Each of those will have six or seven booths in each direction. On a motorway that has 100,000 vehicles per day there are five booths in each direction and nobody thought about doing something about that at the time of the reconstruction of the second bridge. The second bridge was not in the original contract so how is it tied into it? Why is that copper-fastened? Somebody agreed to that deal with NTR which meant it was alright to do the same thing twice. The logic is not there. An indefensible position is being created. The little hint at the end of it that will delight commuters in Dublin is that tolling on the West Link will continue long after 2020 to finance the M50 widening. I have no problems with tolling. My party takes a different position but I am well able to argue with my party and my colleagues and have done for years.</p>

          <p eId="para_785">The Minister in his script mentions penalties if the criteria are not met. It would be lovely to know what the criteria will be for future tolls. Will it be a five minute, ten minute or 20 minute delay? What we do know is that in the famous all-Ireland final in which there were two Ulster counties, there was a queue of traffic endeavouring to come on to the new motorway at the Drogheda bypass so long that the gardaí had to instruct NTR, who were doing the job at the time, to raise the barriers to let the traffic through in the interests of public safety.</p>
          <p eId="para_786">If there are performance criteria, what are they and are they substantial in nature? The very least that should come out of this debacle is a certainty in the future that tolls will be operated efficiently, fairly and at levels which do not function as a disincentive for the use of modern motorways. I will be satisfied if the funds are then used to build more good roads.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">I agree with the Minister of State in his throwaway remarks about public transport. Again, however, there is action that can be taken now, not so much in Dublin but in Cork, Galway, Limerick, Waterford and other areas. Such action would require that all development plans for the next ten years incorporate at least land allocation for off-road public transport, even if it is not to be built for 20 years. If we must retrofit to every one of our other cities a Luas system or other type of off-road public transport, with the enormous associated cost of property acquisition and land and construction costs, we will have a Dublin-type situation in every major city within 20 years. We should instead make proper provision and plan for the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_790">The problem is that the M50 has been successful. We will never know the type of debate that would have taken place today had the forecasts upon which this entire venture was based materialised. Senator Dooley referred to some aspects of the economic environment. The economic stagnation of the early 1980s was followed by an improvement in the second half of that decade, with average growth increasing to 4.4%. The early 1990s was another period of slow growth, with an average growth rate of 2.8% from 1990 to 1993 before the emergence of the Celtic tiger in 1994. Unemployment stood at 17% in 1986 and at 16% in 1993. Now, however, the figure is4.3%. At the time the M50 was planned, our airports and ports were filled with people flocking to leave the country. By contrast, the airports and ports now receive those who are flocking to come to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_791">I was a member of Fingal County Council, as was Senator Terry, from 1991 to 1995, during which time the M50 was opened. Fingal County Council and the former Dublin County Council, of which Senator Ormonde was a member, did not have in their estimates during those critical years the money to provide lighting along the motorway. Media reports at that time observed it was a dangerous road on which to travel at night. It was a crazy situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_792">It is in this context that I object to the comments of Opposition Members. It is a pity that Senator Terry, in particular, is not here. As far back as the mid-1960s and early 1970s, every Dublin county development plan included the famous outer ring road. When Dublin County Council was divided into three separate entities in 1994, Fingal County Council, supported by 23 of 24 councillors, voted to remove the outer ring road from the development plan. I was the only councillor who argued that it should be retained.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">Congestion on the M50 takes place primarily at the interchanges. Residents of County Meath are aware there is congestion six miles out at Dunshaughlin at 7 a.m. However, this has noting to do with the M50. It is a consequence of the problems with the interchange at Blanchardstown. More than 25,000 vehicles travel from the N3 in the Castleknock-Blanchardstown area across the M50 and on to the N4. These motorists have no alternative to this route because councillors in Fingal County Council took the development plan asunder. Coincidentally, South Dublin County Council is continuing with the old development plan. Those who travel to Galway may wonder about the location of the Woodies interchange. This was part of the outer ring road, sliced off by Fingal County Council because it did not want another bridge over the River Liffey.</p>
          <p eId="para_794">People make choices every day. Any motorist travelling on the M50 can take an easy option by availing of electronic tolling through the Eazy Pass system. I use this facility and I defy any Member to claim it has not reduced congestion on the M50. On average, between two and a half and four cars will pass through the Eazy Pass lane while only one will clear the manual lane. However, the Eazy Pass lane is virtually idle at most times. One can approach the Eazy Pass booth across the new bridge without any delay and at the highest permissible speed.</p>

          <from>Mr. Morrissey</from>
          <p eId="para_796">It is up to motorists to make the choice. Up to 800 cars per hour can go through the Eazy Pass booth, while only some 400 can move through the manual system and 600 under the pay system.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">There are actions that can be taken, therefore, to alleviate the current difficulties. The Minister of State has indicated the significant cost of upgrading the M50, involving money that will be forgone forever. It is a simple matter of supply and demand. Removing the toll will advertise to every motorist that there is a free gig at the West Link bridge and this will cause further congestion. The toll plaza can accommodate more cars per hour than the road can deliver.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I acknowledge that difficulties exist but there are ways to overcome them. I have said repeatedly that we are suffering from 2016 levels of traffic, with 2005 levels of expenditure. In regard to the ten-year programme, I am not sure we can wait that long. By improving our rail system, we will give motorists who use the N7 and N3 a choice. New proposals for an outer ring road beg the question as to what is the objective of such a facility. The Minister of State has said it is not an alternative to the M50. Will it be tolled, thus leading to the existence of two tolls on the west side of Dublin?</p>
          <p eId="para_799">We must consider the short-term solutions. A link can be expedited from the N3 at Clonee across to Lucan. Only last week, Fingal County Council informed councillor Mags Murray that it had no plans to do so. This project was removed from the agenda in 1999 with the support of Senator Terry. Five years later, Fine Gael and the Labour Party were in control of the council. Not one motion was tabled at a meeting of the council to offer an alternative to the people to whom those parties refer. National Toll Roads Ireland is not only a monopoly but it is a monopoly compliments of politicians' actions, for which they should be brought to account.</p>

          <p eId="para_800">I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this topic. I was in Dundalk yesterday and it was a joy to travel there. The Minister spoke about the roads that have been completed. The road to Dundalk is marvellous. As we crossed the bridge over the River Boyne we did not have to slow down. The tolling system seemed to work very well and I thought of the horror I have to endure every time I go through the toll station at the West Link bridge.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">I am very concerned about this issue. I will not touch upon every issue I want to raise because other Senators have done so. A problem exists and I am not particularly keen on the idea that the State should buy out NTR's contract for the M50 toll bridge. The State does not seem to do a very good job negotiating such deals. Much as I admire the ingenuity of the idea that a second bridge should be built, I believe the State would be taken to court immediately by NTR if it built it.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">What annoys me most about the present set of circumstances is not the profiteering at the toll station but that the toll bridge is a hindrance to the flow of traffic. I have great difficulty accepting some of the points made by the Minister and Senator Morrissey to the effect that the toll plaza does not cause the delay. I use the M50 frequently, avail of the Eazy Pass system and sometimes pass as many as 50 or 60 cars queuing up to pay by cash.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">The whole point of a motorway is to get people from A to B as fast as possible. It defies belief that anybody could create a traffic bottleneck half way between those two points. Bearing in mind Senator O'Toole's remarks on tolling on the Continent, I know a deplorable problem arises if traffic jams occur at the exits to a motorway where the fast traffic feeds onto the normal road system. However, this is not the major problem. It defies all sense to have traffic jams day in, day out, half way along the motorway, where traffic flow should be totally unrestricted. The worst aspect of this situation is that such traffic jams are unnecessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_804">Senators have made some of these points already. I missed some of Senator Ross's comments but I know my point was raised when we talked about tolling roads without forcing the traffic to stop. Delays are caused quite simply by the business of collecting cash at the toll stations. Most of the motorists at the M50 toll bridge pay cash. That is part of the problem. I do not know the exact figures but I have certainly noticed 50 or 60 cars, if not hundreds, queuing in two lanes to pay cash at the toll bridge while I passed them in the lane for Eazy Pass users.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">I know of no other country in which toll bridges still depend on cash collection. I first encountered a non-cash-based tolling system some ten or 12 years ago as I passed through Sitges. I could not get over the fact that the taxi driver picked me up at the airport and drove me right through the toll plaza without having to stop. I was so impressed that I wrote to Mr. Roche of NTR to tell him about it. He obviously knew about it already. However, the system has still not been introduced in Ireland. The technology to toll roads electronically exists and it is fully tried and proven. Senator Ross referred to it. I am not referring to the Eazy Pass approach, which is already in operation. It still requires each motorist to slow down to a virtual stop at the barrier as his or her pass is verified. One still has to wait for the barrier to lift before one can pass through. That technology is completely out of date. Those of us who have had a chance to visit Australia or Singapore will have seen the new technology and noted that it does work.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The operation of the state-of-the-art technology used for collecting tolls is far from rocket science. It simply involves scanning cars as they pass under a gantry at full speed. Any car without a valid pass automatically has its number plate photographed and a hefty fine is issued to its owner. The system is simple and I have seen it working in other countries. The toll is collected without the traffic having to encounter any delay whatsoever.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">A system such as this, if put in place on the M50, would allow cars to pass over the bridge at full speed. There would be no delay and the constant traffic jams at the approach to the bridge would become a thing of the past. If one talks to the toll company about this, it will state it has not introduced the new technology because it has no way of pursuing those who do not pay. There is no provision in our law that allows for this. If this is the problem, it is very easily solved. I was delighted to hear the Minister say legislation is to be introduced. As we know only too well in this House, the Department of Transport can produce a new road traffic Bill at the drop of a hat.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">I was stunned to hear Senator Ross state he learned today that it would be another four years before the introduction of open tolling. I was delighted to hear the Minister say that he, like Senator Ross, did not find this acceptable. It should certainly not be beyond the wit of man to write a simple Bill that would provide for the issuing of fines to anybody who passes through a toll plaza without paying and impose on the State the role of pursuing and punishing offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">The international experience is such that once the proper system of fining is in place, the vast majority of road users obey the law. The job of pursuing the few evaders is a relatively modest one. I suggest that, instead of urging the Government to break or buy its way out of the agreement with the toll company — both approaches are horrific and will not be adopted — we should urge it to take seriously the congestion that exists at the toll bridge. If this congestion could be prevented, the issue of paying tolls would not be so contentious.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">The Government should say to NTR that the present circumstances cannot be allowed to continue and that they should sort it out together. This would be a far better approach than the present one whereby each side washes its hands of the problem and blames the other for the refusal to move forward. If the approach I advocate were adopted it would not take years to introduce new tolling technology. It could be done very quickly, but this would require action on the part of the Minister and the introduction of a new road traffic Bill. The other problems that exist in respect of the M50 are comparatively minor compared with the one the new technology would overcome.</p>

          <p eId="para_811">I welcome the Minister of State and officials back to the House, just as I welcomed the Minister, who was present earlier. The Taoiseach is on record as having said that the solution to our congestion on the M50, according to traffic engineers, is the implementation of the M50 upgrade together with barrier-free tolling. I confess I am not very familiar with the toll bridge and use it only ten or 12 times per year on my way to Kilkenny. On the basis of research I have conducted and having spoken to various experts, including my colleague, Senator Dooley, I agree with the statement of the Taoiseach. There is an onus on the Government, the National Roads Authority and NTR to work together to increase the speed of access to the M50 bridges.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">In 2003 the capacity of the bridge was increased by 50% as two extra lanes and an extra bridge were provided. As the Minister and a number of colleagues have stated, modern technology is such that there is no reason we cannot have barrier-free tolling. We must all put our heads together to achieve it as quickly as possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Most modern countries charge tolls for the use of major highways. Most of us have been to the United States where motorists are tolled on almost every road. The same is the case on the Continent and, as I can testify, in communist China.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wilson</from>
          <p eId="para_815">Some Senators who are on the left of the political spectrum will be amazed to hear that. The tolls charged in China are substantially higher than those charged on the M1 and the M50. There is no reason Ireland should be any different. The toll charges on the M1 do not attract serious criticism. Initially, lorry drivers objected because they were obliged to pay a toll. However, when they discovered that the magnificent roadway to which Senator Quinn has alluded enabled them to save up to an hour on journeys, they quickly changed their tune and were delighted to pay the toll.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">As Senator Dooley stated, this country was in a serious economic state when construction of the M50 began. We are all aware of this and many of the speakers have mentioned the fact. To get the road constructed, we had no option but to enter into the agreement in question. I was interested to hear Senator Morrissey outlining the history of the situation. It would make sense to many people, myself included, who use the Blanchardstown roundabout on the way to Dublin. If organisations such as National Toll Roads did not exist, we would not be in a position to provide the infrastructural developments that are under way. For example, we could not construct the badly needed M3 motorway.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">I canvassed for over three weeks in County Meath and found that 99.9% of the people I met were in full agreement with the M3 motorway. The word "toll" was never mentioned, although I understand that there will be two tolls on that particular road. It will cost €1 billion to construct, which would not be feasible if we did not have a public private partnership agreement in place. There are 1.3 million taxpayers and their taxes are used to run the entire Government, not just the Department of Transport. Without public private partnerships, we could not afford to maintain our current or proposed levels of road construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">The people of counties Meath and Cavan want to see this kind of development in the future and tolls are not a difficulty. I know that some Members will be surprised to hear a Cavan man say that. However, if the journey time from Cavan to Dublin could be shortened by 40 or 45 minutes, we would even be willing to pay the toll twice.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">As Senator Dooley indicated, the people from my region want bypasses of Virginia and Belturbet put in place and the railway extended from Clonee to Navan and on to Kingscourt. Eventually, they want a railway to run from Navan to Cavan and on to Donegal. These projects cannot reach fruition without the type of investment we discussed.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">Although people get annoyed about delays and hassle, the problem lies not with toll charges but with gridlock. When the M50 was designed 20 or 25 years ago, future usage was seriously underestimated. Several factors, including the growth in our economy, increased vehicle ownership, an increased number of vehicles on the road and an increase in population have contributed to peak hour gridlock on the M50. We are not alone with this problem, which is faced by all major urban centres in the western world. Our difficulty lies in how to deal with the increase in traffic. Under the national development plan, the Government continues to invest billions of euros in transport infrastructure. The improvements can be seen throughout the country in our national routes and in the wonderful Luas project. We must remember that the fallout associated with our ever-growing and unprecedented economic success cannot be solved overnight. The Government is investing more money and has been more successful in improving our infrastructure than any of its predecessors.</p>
          <p eId="para_821">Senator Ross stated that my good friend and colleague, Senator Kate Walsh, is against tolls. It should be put on the record that she is not against tolls. Rather, she is opposed to queues and favours barrier-free tolls.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">I also wish to take issue with Senator O'Toole who suggested that we should consider buying back the M50 toll bridges.</p>

To put this in context, most people who live near the M50 have barely managed to obtain mortgages. What he is paying represents a substantial amount of after-tax income every year. The issue must be addressed, although I do not think that buying back the bridge is feasible. The idea that one can simply nationalise something that has been provided by private capital is not going to work.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">If one pays a toll, one should at least get the benefit of the toll itself. I regularly travel to Dunleer on the fantastic new Belfast to Dublin roadway. I am willing to pay the toll at Dunleer when I travel on the Belfast-Dublin road, which is an excellent new road and a credit to those who had the engineering and planning sense to put it in place, because I know I will skip the congestion at Drogheda and save 15 or 20 minutes. I do not shave any time of my journey when I use the M50. When the Dunleer bypass was being negotiated with National Toll Roads, a specific clause was inserted in the agreement that stated that in the event of a build-up of cars on that section of the route, the bridges will be automatically released and the cars can pass through. The same arrangement should apply to the toll plaza on the West Link. It should be possible to renegotiate the agreement with NTR in order to lift the toll barrier in the morning and between the peak hours of 4 p.m. and 6.30 p.m. or 7 p.m. to alleviate the existing difficulties for motorists on the West Link. If this arrangement is good enough in Dunleer, it is good enough for the West Link. This option is a feasible one, as opposed to the idea of simply buying out the toll. The lack of this provision was a major fault of the negotiations, not only those going back to 1987 but those that surrounded the last phase in 2000 to 2001.</p>
          <p eId="para_850">Those of us who live on the M50 and local authority members who regularly point out these difficulties in South Dublin County Council and Fingal County Council witness the National Road Authority's illogical position on crash barriers. Although we see crashes on the M50 on a regular basis, we were told by the NRA that we could not have crash barriers. The councillors and the Minister for Transport both demanded crash barriers and now the NRA has suddenly done a U-turn and decided to introduce barriers. Politicians were calling for crash barriers ten years ago and were ignored by the NRA, which is another State quango with no democratic accountability. I ask the Government to renegotiate the agreement with NTR regarding peak times on the West Link toll plaza to enable frustrated motorists to get through the bottleneck on the M50.</p>

He says he is not happy with what the NRA has told him about the implementation of travelling through the tolls with the barriers up. He believes that easing the congestion on the M50 requires the implementation of the M50 upgrade project and, as part of that move, the opening of road tolling at the West Link. This entails 32 km of laneway on either side of the motorway and upgrading access on to the M50. The NRA informed us today that these measures cannot be accomplished separately. The Minister said this evening that he is not happy with the four-year period and believes that it can be done within a shorter timeframe. I can see from the prioritising of this that the people of Meath and Cavan will have to wait a further period because their counties will not be in phase one. Phase 1 of the project is between the N7 and the N4. There is a huge problem with three roundabouts on that access road on to the M50.</p>

          <p eId="para_857">I was a member of the former Dublin County Council and was present in 1987 when that agreement was made. I knew that negotiations over the agreement had been ongoing since the 1970s through the late John Boland and subsequently Liam Kavanagh. I remember canvassing in 1987 when one would not see a car outside the door because unemployment was so high. We never thought that the country's economy would improve as dramatically as it did. There is no point in saying otherwise. In 1990, it was calculated that there were slightly over 18,000 cars on the roads, while in 2003, there were over 78,000 cars on the roads. That figure indicates how much catching up had to be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">I travelled recently from Naas to Ashbourne and encountered no problems until I reached the Red Cow roundabout. Thirty minutes elapsed before I could even get off the slip road to get on to the M50 at that point. The same thing would have happened at the other exchange at the Navan road. We should start by addressing these problems, which have nothing to do with tolling. I would ask the NRA what work it has done with local authorities to try to alleviate traffic congestion at that point. I support public private partnerships and I would ask NTR and the NRA to work together to see how they can move forward and fast track the situation. I agree that upgrading the toll is a priority. However, the interim measures must also be addressed. We are locked into this agreement and reading the Minister for State's speech, I do not see any way out of it. Both NTR and the NRA have a responsibility to heed the congestion on the toll bridge and negotiate and I would like to find whether they are doing so. The Minister has referred to having public responsibility with regard to electronic voting and how he can fast track that system.</p>

If we solved the problems at the couple of miles at both ends, we might stop the rat-running through residential areas, which I fought to get rid of when I was a county councillor. Everybody must be aware that this rat-running through residential areas is happening again. We all have a responsibility with regard to this issue, which I hope will be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">An extensive programme of road and rail infrastructural improvement is taking place. We are still waiting for the completion of the M50 and the situation may be worse during periods of congestion, but this is not true of off-peak times when the situation is much better.</p>
          <p eId="para_864">Urban tolls in the sense of physical barriers are not desirable in general. It was not for nothing that people rid themselves of tolls in the 18th century as an obstruction to the spirit of free trade and movement. On the other hand, if one could do this electronically, then much of the objections would vanish.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">It has been well explained that the West Link toll bridge was built at a time when Ireland was not well off and did not have many resources. I am uncertain as to whether Senator Brian Hayes's comparison between Dún Laoghaire and the West Link is valid. Once one passes through the toll bridge near the River Boyne there should be no further blockages. However, if one were to raise the barriers there would be a blockage just a short way up the road. This is why there is no good case for buying it out as congestion would only be shifted slightly.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">The members of the Government agree that public transport is the main solution as it provides choice and more capacity for rail park and ride. In his contribution the Minister cited the Luas as a brilliant success. <i>RAIL</i> magazine carried out a study of seven light rail schemes in the UK. This study found that these schemes meet their objectives for usage, urban regeneration and switching passengers from road to rail, that light rail is a more effective alternative to buses when passenger numbers are high, and has become an important contributor to regeneration. Transport economists who hate rail should take note of this study.</p>

          <p eId="para_869">For 14 years when I worked on the East Wall Road I used the East Link Bridge as many as four times per day and found it to be tremendously efficient. I used the M50 five or six times per week for my business in Dublin Airport and I welcome this discussion as a supporter of the motorway. The M50 is value for money and I am happy to pay the increased price because I cannot stand traffic congestion.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">The Government receives one euro out of every €1.80 raised. It is a cash cow for the Government. However, as I have stated before, the main problem is congestion at the exits. I live at the Dundrum end of the M50 and have no problems exiting but people who must exit for Blanchardstown, Lucan or elsewhere experience horrific congestion. I suggest that NTR encourages the sale and use of Eazy Pass whereby one can zip through when one uses the pass. I am happy to pay the toll as I cannot stand being stuck in traffic. The Eazy Pass system is very efficient.</p>

          <p eId="para_875">It is odd that any roads around a city or town are tolled. If one examines the international situation, the main reason to have roads around a city or town is to avoid people travelling through them. If there is a toll in place it discourages those people from going around the town.</p>
          <p eId="para_876">I am glad that Senator White has had suchpleasant experiences with the West Link toll bridge as I have found it to be incredibly slow. A friend of mine who is good with logistics and must frequently travel to the airport has said it is much quicker to avoid the M50 and to stay on the west side of the city through Phibsborough, Glasnevin and Ballymun until he reaches his destination.</p>

          <p eId="para_881">Senator Brian Hayes's suggestion concerning lifting the barriers when there is congestion is a good one. I am certain this could help in improving the situation until the construction work has been completed if NTR was to examine it. The East Link bridge has been a great success. I use it frequently and do not quibble about its price, but the confusion and congestion on the West Link toll bridge is a problem.</p>

          <p eId="para_887">I thank the Senators for their helpful and provocative contributions to this excellent debate. They have given everyone much food for thought through this valuable exercise.</p>
          <p eId="para_888">My view is simple. We face what Mr. Ted Heath called the "unacceptable face of capitalism". This is not a willing buyer and a willing seller negotiating a deal in any sense of the word. This is an imposition on ordinary people that they cannot do anything about due to the monopolistic nature of the contract. It is unacceptable. This particular charge and its nature is not affecting just the ordinary people, but the good people of the Irish Road Haulage Association. These are people who are charged enormous sums of money for going about their business and boosting the Celtic economy. I acknowledge the financial and moral support given to the campaign to open the toll bridges by the group I formed. Its members are the vanguard of the Celtic tiger but are being penalised.</p>
          <p eId="para_889">Let us call this what it is. It is not enterprise and it is unacceptable. It is not the Celtic tiger but a monopoly that damages the economy and the people. It must be stopped. Senator Brian Hayes has imagination. I grew tired of listening to the Government saying, "God help us, we cannot do anything about it" or "Awful pity this, but they have us over a barrel and we must accept it". This is complete nonsense. There are all sorts of imaginative proposals that can be tabled and examined such as that proposed by Senator Brian Hayes.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">Why will we not examine the possibility of penalising NTR in another sphere? There are many fiscal measures that can be taken. For instance, we could examine the buy-out proposal. Everyone claims it is too expensive to do but they never quote a price. We could offer NTR something else as it is a very fine company in many respects. It does not deal with tolls alone and changed its name from National Toll Roads to NTR to disguise its origins, as its tolling element is unpopular. It deals with waste very well and also deals with broadband and Airtricity. Do not tell me the State can only offer NTR cash. Why can someone in the Department not show some imagination and tell NTR that the State cannot give it €400 million or €500 million but an option on Aer Lingus, Coillte or other semi-State bodies?</p>

        <speech by="#JoeOToole" eId="spk_515">
          <from>Mr. O’Toole</from>
          <p eId="para_1009">I thank the Cathaoirleach and the House for giving me an opportunity to put this matter on the record. The Minister of State has always shown an interest in education. In his previous role, he showed a particular interest in the development of the IT sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">I want to talk tonight about further education which in many instances is the forgotten sector in Irish education. The reason it is forgotten is because this is the only country in Europe that does not have a deliberate and separate further education sector within the education system. We are talking about people who in some instances have lost the chance of education. We are talking about people who failed to get the benefit of the education system. We are talking about mature students and people who are interested in courses and qualifications which are not provided in any other place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">There are more mature students enrolled in post-leaving certificate education, or further education, than there are in third level colleges, which is crucially important. I am proposing that the State recognise this sector. It should recognise the recommendations in the McIver report and the Minister and the Minister of State should take on board the issues contained therein and provide a time line for their implementation. The Minister of State and I had this discussion many times in other places. This is the heart and soul of education because it is where people can find and develop their potential in ways that have not been available to them in the other sectors. This is why we need to take a serious interest in the issue. If we do not do so, we may not be legally in breach of the European directive on lifelong education, but we will certainly be in breach of the spirit of the directive. We are certainly in breach of the global agreements on the need for lifelong education. We have not brought to a conclusion the commitment given to the trade union movement and the social partners during the discussions on the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness. At that stage lifelong education was recognised as an important sector. There was a determination that it should progress and there was a decision to establish the McIver group in order to advise the Government on how it should move on. This has been done. There are a series of recommendations which should be put in place.</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">An amazing range of post-leaving certificate courses is currently available. These include music and art, in different forms, sound engineering, media studies, journalism, animation, pre-nursing, social care, alternative medicine, outdoor pursuits, computers and business. These are crucial areas which are an amazing success story. There are almost 30,000 pupils enrolled in these courses throughout the country, some in extremely large colleges. The profile of people interested in these courses are people who have not been able by reason of their physical means or social milieu to continue education at a particular point. This is one of the areas to which they can return. People can also take up these courses directly after doing their leaving certificate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">A whole range of people take up these courses. It is an opportunity for people to take up what is referred to as second chance education. However, I would say to the Minister of State that this is not second chance education. In some instances people go from no chance education to new chance education, which is what it is for some of these people. One of the recommendations in the McIver report — this is crucial evidence in terms of reflecting what we need to do — is that there should be a comprehensive arrangement for child care because single parents will be attending these courses.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">I am asking for a distinct and separate sector. I am asking for computer access, with computer back-up and technical support for all students and groups involved in the sector. As well as IT and computerisation, there should be access to libraries, books and librarian support. There should be a management structure which would ensure that the further education sector could move forward. There should be huge diversity, a clear definition and public recognition of the sector. These are some of the issues I am asking the Minister of State to take on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">I was speaking to some people who are involved in the sector and I asked them for examples of how people move on. They gave me the names of well known people in RTE, TV3 and people working in various organisations who are huge success stories. This is an area in which the Minister of State could make a name for himself and where Bertie's new socialism could find articulation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1018">Gabhaim buíochas don Seanadóir O'Toole as ucht an ábhair seo a ardú sa Teach. The Minister of State at the Department of Education and Science, Deputy de Valera, regrets that she cannot take this Adjournment matter as she is accompanying the President on a State visit to Korea, but she has asked me to outline the following for the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">Further education is already fully recognised by the Department of Education and Science as a specific sector of our education system. This recognition is underpinned in the national development plan and in the national anti-poverty strategy and is validated in a range of reports relating to social inclusion and economic prosperity and competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">The increased financial provision in the annual Estimates of the Department of Education and Science to support development and expansion in this area is clear evidence of our commitment to further and adult education.</p>

          <p eId="para_1022">I have just been handed it myself, but was told that copies were available for distribution ahead of my arrival. I will make the script immediately available to Senator O'Toole and anybody else who wishes to receive a copy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Expenditure in the area of further and adult education will rise in 2005 to approximately €138 million. Overall, this provision represents an increase of €10 million, or nearly 8%, as compared with the position in 2004 and will provide for an expansion on existing services in the sector during the coming year. The sum does not include a figure in the region of €50 million to meet the pay cost of teachers in PLC colleges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">An extra €2 million will be provided in 2005 for trainees with special needs in both Youthreach and senior Traveller training programmes. There will be an increase of €1 million, or 7.2% extra, for the back to education initiative in 2005. The number of back to education initiatives training places will increase by approximately 1,000to 7,000, catering for in excess of 10,000 participants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">An extra €800,000 is being provided for the roll out of phase 4 of the national adult guidance initiative. Expenditure on child care services in Youthreach, Traveller and VTOS programmes will increase by some €350,000, or 7.3%. This will provide child care assistance for approximately 150 extra children across the entire system. Overall, it is estimated that some 2,250 children of participants in these programmes will be catered for in 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">The principal objectives of the further and adult education measures funded by the Department of Education and Science will meet the needs of young early school leavers and provide second-chance education for adults, vocational and educational training for labour market entrants and re-entrants and alternative pathways to higher education. These objectives are pursued through programmes such as the following: Youthreach, which caters primarily for young early school leavers in the 15 to 20 year age group; the senior Traveller training programme, which incorporates a Youthreach-type programme for young Travellers in the 15 to 20 year age group as well as adult Travellers; the vocational training opportunities scheme for people over the age of 21 who have been unemployed for more than six months; post-leaving certificate courses to meet the skills needs of school leavers and adults who may wish to return to the labour market; back to education initiative part-time options, which provide flexible learning options for people in the workforce, the unemployed and those wishing to return to employment; and the adult literacy and community education scheme which meets the needs of adults who require literacy skills and adult basic education programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">The McIver report, to which Senator O'Toole refers, arose from a commitment to the Programme for Prosperity and Fairness and the White Paper on Adult Education — Learning for Life. Senator O'Toole had a major input into that programme during those discussions. Its purpose was to examine and make recommendations on the structures and resources required in schools and colleges with large-scale PLC provision, having regard to good practice in related areas across the system and in other countries. Recommendations were prepared following an extensive research and consultation process. The report contains 21 over-arching recommendations, incorporating over 90 sub-recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">I will return to the overall position with regard to the advancement of key recommendations, but first I will address the question of the report's recommendation that the Department should formally establish further education as a distinct sector. This recommendation was qualified by a statement to the effect that a key element of that sector would be post-second level provision in a number of settings comprising colleges providing further education only, further education centres within schools which would mix further education and second level provision and other centres providing post-second level education which could include core VTOS training centres, among others. The rationale for this recommendation is outlined in the report focused on the institutional needs of colleges catering for post-second level provision, primarily post-leaving certificate courses. This focus is understandable, having regard to the terms of reference for the review that this narrow definition of further education does not take account of some of the key target groups requiring further education, particularly the large cohort of adults requiring second chance education and especially those who left school early without any qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">While we respect the underlying intent of the recommendations and recognise the need to address the issues confronting colleges, as articulated in the report's terms of reference, they must be considered within the broader sphere of further and adult education provision in the context of lifelong learning. Our approach to this matter is supported by the Irish Vocational Education Association, IVEA, and the need to consider all of the recommendations of the McIver report in this broader context is a key concern in the IVEA submission to us with regard to its view of the way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I mention the IVEA in particular because further and adult education services and programmes funded by the Department of Education and Science are primarily delivered by vocational education committees in schools, further education colleges, adult education centres, Youthreach centres, senior Traveller training programme centres and in community settings on an outreach basis. The IVEA is the representative body for VEC management and in this role it is pivotal to the development of a robust, coherent and integrated further and adult education service. As each of the 33 VECs is an autonomous statutory entity, comprising locally elected representation from a wide range of backgrounds and interests, the collective voice of the VECs, as representative of the IVEA, is vital in the development of national policies to meet the needs of further and adult education. The Vocational Education (Amendment) Act 2001 and the duties placed on VECs to develop educational and service plans to embrace the totality of VEC provision in the education sector, including further and adult education, will further clarify the overall requirements for provision in this area of education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I am fully aware that certain secondary, community and comprehensive schools provide essential adult and further education programmes in areas where the VEC may not have a local presence. However, as the leading provider of programmes of further and adult education, it is incumbent on the State to address the policy and structural issues confronting the principal strategy provider while facilitating the provision of further and adult education programmes in other settings through local partnerships that ensure the availability of programmes at local level to meet the needs of the community. This can be achieved by ensuring the structures that have been put in place to develop local linkages, such as community education facilitators, are actively enabling communities to access local education services, whether directly or an outreach basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Further education cannot be classified as a single sector in the traditional sense. The concept of a sector, as referenced in Senator O'Toole's proposition, is embedded in the framework of first, second and third level education delivered in traditional settings of schools and colleges, with further education as something in between but with an institution as a centre of provision. I hope my remarks will promulgate a wider vision that will recognise that learning takes place in a variety of settings and that all of these settings must be validated in terms of further and adult education provision within the context of lifelong learning policies. The needs of people who want to participate in further education, or indeed those whom the State wishes to encourage to actively participate for social and-or economic reasons, will not necessarily be met within the defined confines of a school, college or other establishment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The recommendations of the McIver report on PLC provision are wide ranging and encompass proposals that extend beyond PLC provision. The report poses considerable challenges with regard to the shaping of structures for the delivery of adult and further education into the future. There are also significant cost implications in the report's recommendations which must be measured against needs across the education system, as well as substantial industrial relations issues. The primary purposes of PLCs is to enhance the prospects of students gaining employment. They also provide an alternative route of entry to higher education in the institutes of technology though the National Council for Vocational Awards FETAC links scheme. The Department of Education and Science is working with the IVEA as the principal management body in the area of further education to move towards a more structured and integrated provision for further and adult education across all levels from adult basic education through to PLC level.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Going forward, the Department of Education and Science will engage in further discussions with all relevant stakeholders in terms of the structural changes envisaged in the area of adult and further education and having regard to the White Paper on adult learning, the report of the taskforce on lifelong education, the McIver report and requirements arising in the context of the implementation of awards and quality assurance processes under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act 1999.</p>

          <from>Mr. Mooney</from>
          <p eId="para_1042">I thank the Cathaoirleach for including this matter on the Adjournment. I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy Treacy. As this matter is more relevant to his brief than that raised by Senator O'Toole, I am pleased he is present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">In recent weeks, China, through the 10th PRC National People's Congress, passed what is known as the anti-separation law. This law presents unification as the only valid option in cross-straits relations between the Republic of China and the People's Republic of China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The law would also enforce legal responsibility and possible punishment for actions perceived as promoting independence, as well as guidelines for the treatment of "separatists" before, during and after the potential use of force against Taiwan. These regulations would apply to citizens, enterprises, organisations and Government officials in China and Taiwan. The law can be seen as an enabling act of legalising war, authorising the People's Liberation Army, armed police and militia to resolve the "Taiwan problem" through non-peaceful measures. At the same time, the law will again declare the "Taiwan problem" as an internal affair and state that no external force should interfere in the Taiwan Strait. The passage of this law will have a severe impact not only on cross-straits relations but also on the stability of the entire region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">I fully support the Government's position on the One China policy. I have no doubt the Minister of State will refer to the latter. This is not about impacting or infringing on that policy in any way. However, it is somewhat ironic, in the month the National People's Congress passed the law legalising war, that Ireland is publicly identifying itself with a growing consensus among the EU partners towards ending the embargo on arms sales to China. This is in a country that has a proud record on human rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">I understand that, in terms of politics involving larger powers and at international level, Ireland is a small player and punches way above its weight. I am also acutely aware that Ireland has an open trading economy and that China, because of its vast size and huge population, will be the real power in the 21st century and beyond. It is right and proper that Ireland should position itself to pursue bilateral relations with China. That is not what this matter is about. It is about highlighting a situation that has existed because of an historical anomaly.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">Despite its international isolation and lack of recognition among practically all the developed countries of the world, we should acknowledge the existence of Taiwan. There are 23 million people on the island of Taiwan. It is the tenth largest trading nation in the world and, in the political sense, it is treated like an international pariah. That is a result of the historical reality and I emphasise that is not what this matter is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">I would like Ireland to be seen to have a position on this law. I would like the Taoiseach and his ministerial colleagues, including the Minister of State, Deputy Treacy, in bilateral negotiations, dialogue and discussions with the Republic of China, here at home through its ambassador, or in Beijing. This issue should join the others in respect of which we engage in dialogue. Those other issues primarily relate to human rights violations in China. I wish to see the Taiwan issue, in the context of the passage of the law to which I refer, put on that agendawhenever discussions take place at bilaterallevel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The US, which would be the defence guarantor of Taiwan in the event of an attack by mainland China, has come out strongly against this law. I understand that Ministers were buttonholed and door-stepped by senior American politicians during their visits to the US for the annual St. Patrick's celebrations. It was conveyed to them that America is against this law. I can understand the reason for this. China is a growing military power. We are already aware of its economic might, from which we are benefiting to a large degree. However, cross-straits relations were beginning to get on to a proper footing and there had been a lessening of tension. In recent months, mainland China had allowed charter flights to operate across the strait and there was increasing optimism among the Taiwanese and the international community.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The Chinese authorities have tended to downplay this law and say it is nothing more than a reiteration of their legal right and that Taiwan is part of China. I plead with the Minister of State not to allow this issue slip off the agenda. If the Taiwanese have nobody to speak for them internationally, we, as parliamentarians, in defending a democratic Taiwan, as against a totalitarian China, have some responsibility to ensure its views are put forward whenever the occasion arises.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_527">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_1051">I wish to make a statement to the House on the Government's views regarding the decision of the Chinese National People's Congress to pass an anti-secession law.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Since 1971, when Ireland voted in favour of the United Nations General Assembly Resolution 2758, we have recognised the Government of the People's Republic of China, as the sole legitimate Government of China. Ireland, together with its EU partners, adheres to the One China policy and, therefore, accepts that Taiwan is a part of China.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The anti-secession law, which was debated an approved by the National People's Congress on Monday, 14 March 2005, is formulated, according to Article 1 of the law, "for the purpose of opposing and checking Taiwan's secession from China, by secessionists in the name of "Taiwan independence", promoting peaceful national reunification, maintaining peace and stability in the Taiwan Straits, preserving China's sovereignty and territorial integrity, and safeguarding the fundamental interests of the Chinese nation".</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The law reiterates the position of the Government of the People's Republic of China that there is only one China, that Taiwan is part of China, and that China will never allow Taiwan, to"secede" from China by any means. The law further states that the resolution of the Taiwan question and achieving national reunification is China's internal affair and that it will not accept interference from outside forces.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">It is important to note that Article 5 of the law recognises that the peaceful reunification of China best serves the fundamental interests of people on both sides of the Taiwan Straits and goes on to say that China will do its utmost, to achieve a peaceful reunification of the country. Article 5 also states that once the country is reunified, Taiwan may practice systems different from those on the mainland and enjoy a high degree of autonomy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">The law also sets out the means by which links might be improved between China and Taiwan, including personal visits, developing economic and trade links, cultural exchanges, air and sea connections, exchanges in the fields of education, science, technology, health and sports, and co-operation in combating crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">The law also states that any negotiations with Taiwan will be on an "equal footing between the two sides" and sets out the steps by which the such negotiations might take place, including officially ending the state of hostility between the two sides, mapping out the development of cross-straits relations, steps and arrangements for peaceful national reunification and the political status of the Taiwan authorities. Despite the many positive elements contained in the law, Article 8 also provides that in the event of Taiwan's secession from China or the prospects for peaceful unification having been exhausted, non-peaceful means shall be used to protect China's sovereignty and territorial integrity. While the threat of the use of force by the Beijing authorities to prevent Taiwanese independence is not new, its restatement in this manner gives rise to concern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">On 14 March 2005, the EU issued a declaration on the law, in which it expressed its continued adherence to the One China policy, to the resolution of differences between China and Taiwan, by peaceful means, and its opposition to the use of force. The declaration also called on all parties to avoid any unilateral action, which might aggravate tensions across the Taiwan Straits, and expressed the concern that the legislation might impact negatively on the recent improvement in links, between China and Taiwan including the inauguration of flights, between China and Taiwan, at the time of the Chinese New Year. These concerns were also conveyed to the Chinese authorities by a Troika of EU Heads of Mission at Beijing on 12 and 14 March last, just over ten days ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The Government fully supports the position adopted by the EU on this matter as expressed in this declaration. The Government continues to examine these issues with our EU partners in the context of our overall relationship with China, our ongoing commitment to human rights and the broader regional and international context. This position has also been conveyed to the Chinese ambassador in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Ireland and our EU partners believe it is important that both China and Taiwan avoid actions which could serve to exacerbate existing tensions. We continue to emphasise the importance of dialogue between the two sides so that a peaceful solution may be found. We will continue to convey this position in all our contacts with the Chinese authorities.</p>

I am also pleased that Ireland is aware of the concerns that have been expressed within Europe and internationally. If the Republic of Ireland were to introduce a law in this House along similar lines to that which was introduced in the Beijing People's Congress, which on the one hand called for a peaceful reunification of the North and South of this island but on the other had within it a threat of military action in the event of all else failing, I am sure the Minister of State will agree that the reaction, not only within this island but internationally, would be one of total opposition. It is in that context that the concern the Minister of State has expressed is correct. I am glad he has reiterated the One China policy. I reiterate that I too support that policy but that this wider issue should not in any way interfere with the stability of the area.</p>

          <from>Mr. Coghlan</from>
          <p eId="para_1064">I too am grateful to the Cathaoirleach for including this matter on the Adjournment. It is a matter of vital interest to the people of Rathmore which is a key gateway to the kingdom of Kerry. Last week I attended a meeting of the community council. People are very agitated regarding the Firies-Scartaglen southern section B new water project.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Before proceeding, I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Batt O'Keeffe, to the House. He is very familiar with this gateway as he hails from a little further east in Cork. I hesitate to mention gateways because of the spatial strategy and other places that have been nominated as gateways. Rathmore is a very important gateway to the kingdom of Kerry from the eastern side. The Minister of State will be very familiar with the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">In the matter of the Rathmore domestic water supply, the Minister of State will be aware that demand exceeds supply by approximately 25,000 gallons per day. As a result of this problem the water in the reservoir drops and Rathmore users have little or no water pressure for domestic use. The county council solution has been to cut off the water at night to allow the reservoir to fill up overnight. Unfortunately for some people who have to go to work early, they must leave without having water to boil a kettle for breakfast or taking a shower. Electric showers have been damaged and houses have been flooded due to people forgetting to turn off taps, having turned them on in the hope of having water. The on-off frequency can vary from no cut-off for months to a pattern of every night for weeks. The county council solution has been in place for many years and is not acceptable in this day and age. The people of the area have listened to the Department blaming Kerry County Council and <i>vice versa</i> in respect of the submission of documents about the water scheme. This has been the situation for over 12 months. They are very interested in the Minister of State providing a solution which I hope to hear from him now in theHouse.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. B. O’Keeffe)</from>
          <p eId="para_1068">I thank the Senator for raising this issue which I know is of great importance to the people of Rathmore and of south-east Kerry generally. I am aware of their concerns andhave been taking a personal interest in this scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">A major focus of Government spending over the past number of years has been the provision of modern environmental services to support social and economic objectives. This has led to unprecedented investment in new water and sewerage infrastructure throughout the country under the national development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The Firies-Scartaglen water supply scheme is one of more than 800 such projects being funded as part of my Department's water services investment programme 2004-06. The Firies-Scartaglen scheme will improve the water supply for Gneeveguilla and surrounding area, replace the existing stream source serving Barraduff village and augment the water supply to Rathmore village. All the works have been approved for construction under the water services investment programme. I understand that a number of advance sections have already been completed in conjunction with the Rathmore sewerage scheme and road realignment between Rathmore and Barraduff. The remaining works include the construction of two reservoirs, one at Gallum and the other at the existing reservoir site at Knocknageeha. There will also be approximately 18 km of new distribution and rising mains to deliver the improved water supply to consumers in the supplyzone.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">My Department authorised Kerry County Council to invite tenders for these main elements of the scheme in April 2004. Earlier this month the council submitted a proposal to my Department to appoint a contractor for the civil works contract. The recommendation is under examination in the Department and I can assure the Senator that there will be absolutely no avoidable delay in dealing with it. A recommendation from the council for the appointment of a mechanical and electrical contractor is, however, still awaited. I understand that this recommendation is also expected to be with the Department shortly. When it comes to hand it will be promptly considered. Following approval the council will then be in a position to place both contracts. Funding of over €4.3 million has been set aside for the scheme in the water services investment programme 2004-06. My Department's commitment to ensuring that improvements to the Rathmore, Barraduff and Gneeveguilla water supplies are brought about as speedily as possible is clearly demonstrated by the advance works that were previously approved and have now been completed. I can assure the Senator that the Government will be particularly pleased to see the schemes as a whole move forward to construction. My Department is aware that the three villages are being adversely affected by inadequate water supplies and that there have been overnight supply disruptions in Rathmore. The new scheme will solve all these shortcomings and ensure that all three locations will in future be guaranteed a continuous, reliable supply of top quality drinking water. As a near neighbour I wish to assure Senator Coghlan that this phase of the project will be completed with all speed.</p>
