Táim an-bhuíoch díobh as a bheith tofa anseo inniu.  Is onóir mhór dom é mar is coiste an-thábhachtach é seo.  Tá an-deis againn obair a dhéanamh chun an t-Oireachtas a dhéanamh níos freagraí agus ba mhaith liom go mbeidh an-chuid obair le déanamh againn.  Tá dúthlán ann ach má oibrímid le chéile, beidh seans againn an obair sin a shárú.I thank everybody for giving me this position of Cathaoirleach of this committee.  It is a major honour for me to be here in what is a new committee of the Oireachtas, which will develop into an important part of the procedures and activities of Oireachtas Members.The opportunity we have is incredible in that we have been given several areas for which to develop a remit and of which we are still the author.  We will get an opportunity to develop the size, scope and power of each of those areas.It is also a major opportunity to make the Oireachtas more accountable to the people.  It is an opportunity for us to allow people who, I suppose, up until now have been on the periphery of the Oireachtas to gain access to the very heart of the Oireachtas administration.No doubt we should try to develop a practical, hands-on vehicle that makes a real and serious difference to people's lives over the next while.  I have every confidence, from the quality of the TDs and Seanadóirí who are here today, that if we work together in a bipartisan fashion over the coming years, we will be able to achieve that.  Go raibh míle maith agaibh go léir mar gheall ar sin.

I invite nominations for the position of Leas-Chathaoirleach of this committee.
#JimmyHarte	unknown-#JimmyHarte-party	unknown-#JimmyHarte-dob	unknown-#JimmyHarte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I nominate Deputy Michael McCarthy.

As there are no other nominations, I deem Deputy Michael McCarthy to be elected as Leas-Chathaoirleach of the committee.  Bá mhaith liom comhgairdeas a ghabháil leis an Teachta McCarthy mar tá sé tofa anois mar Leas-Chathaoirleach.  I wish him every success in the future working with the committee.  No doubt with his skills as well, we will be able to guide the committee through its work.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	Thank you, Chairman.  I thank the members of the committee for the unanimous support for my election to the position of Vice Chairman.  This is an important committee and if we get the necessary resources and the Government holds the referendum in October to give us the powers we need, it will also be a reforming committee and will do justice to the Oireachtas and how it does its business.  A committee on investigations, petitions and oversight is important.  During the last Seanad we changed Standing Orders to include provision for petitions but we did not get beyond that.  I look forward to working with the Chairman and members of the committee to ensure it is successful and productive.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I congratulate Deputies Tóibín and McCarthy on their election as Chairman and Vice Chairman.  As Deputy McCarthy said, this could become a very important committee within the Houses of the Oireachtas subject to a decision of the electorate in the referendum later this year.  I look forward to working with long-standing and new Members of the Oireachtas in what I hope will be an important committee.  The work of the committee will be done on a cross-party basis and I look forward to our continuing with our work.

They bring a wealth of experience to their roles and I look forward to working with them and all other members of the committee.

I congratulate the Chairman and Deputy McCarthy.  This committee is a blank sheet and it is up to us to put our stamp on it for future committees to follow.  We will probably discuss the various terms later in the committee but I assure the Chairman, the Vice Chairman and the staff of the committee of our full support.

Tá ról mór le himirt againn agus tá súil agam go mbeimid in ann é sin a dhéanamh agus an coiste á chur ar bun againn.  Beidh a lán déileáil leis an tacaíocht a fuair muid ón phobal agus ónár bpáirtithe chun é seo a dhéanamh.  We have an important role ahead of us.  We have the faith of our parties placed in us that we will be able to put together a petitions, oversight and investigation procedure that has not existed until now.  That is a major challenge and it will be difficult at times but the electorate has spoken of the need for openness, transparency and accountability and this is one of the mechanisms that will deliver that for the public in future.
#SusanOKeeffe	unknown-#SusanOKeeffe-party	unknown-#SusanOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#SusanOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-07-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I also congratulate the Chairman and Vice Chairman.  Ironically, as I was coming into the meeting, I was talking to a man outside Leinster House who quickly raised the culture of secrecy that exists in Ireland.  This was a surprising comment from this man.  He said he looks forward to the new Government being able to lift the veil of secrecy and bring things into the open.  I see this committee playing an important role in that, particularly with the proposed amendment to the Constitution in the autumn, which will allow us to bring accountability and transparency to the heart of Government.  I would like to play a part in that.
