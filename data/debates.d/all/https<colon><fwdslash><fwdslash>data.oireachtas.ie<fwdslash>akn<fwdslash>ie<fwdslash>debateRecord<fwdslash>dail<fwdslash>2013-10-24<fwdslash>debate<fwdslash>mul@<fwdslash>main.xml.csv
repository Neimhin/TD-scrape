#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	The reports on how and why the Garda removed two children from their families in Tallaght and Athlone are disturbing on a number of levels. The fact that the children have been returned to their families has to be welcomed but we must also acknowledge the extreme distress the families experienced over the past several days. While the gardaí involved acted in good faith under section 12(1) of the Child Care Act 1991, which states "where a member of the Garda Síochána has reasonable grounds for believing that - (a) there is an immediate and serious risk to the health or welfare of a child", following press coverage of a child in Greece, there was obviously an increase in the number of anonymous calls to the Garda concentrating on Roma families. Questions need to be answered regarding why actions were taken against this minority group in particular. Would these extreme actions be acceptable if the families concerned were Irish nationals? Children should only be removed in extreme circumstances and normally applications are made and private hearings take place beforehand. We need to know why these did not happen in this case. More than 9,000 applications were made last year alone but, as hearings are held in private, there was little media coverage. The Minister for Justice and Equality has requested an internal report from the Garda Commissioner so that lessons can be learned and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs is commissioning an independent report on the cases. If there were genuine and legitimate concerns on the part of the Garda, serious questions need to be answered. Why were the remaining children left in the families and why was it that one of the parents was not allowed to remain with the children while the DNA tests were being conducted? Why was the HSE not asked to make an assessment on the families prior to the removal of the children from their homes?
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I agree with Deputy Troy that the reports we have heard on the removal of the two children from their families are disturbing on a number of levels and join him in welcoming the fact that the children have been returned to their families. I acknowledge the distress this has caused to the children and families concerned. Deputy Troy accepts that the gardaí acted in good faith on the matter. The first lesson that needs to be learned is that nobody should jump to conclusions. We need to establish the facts and, indeed, the answers to the questions raised by Deputy Troy. This is why the Minister for Justice and Equality has asked the Garda Commissioner to prepare a report on the two cases and why the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has asked the HSE to prepare a report. Both of those reports will go to the Ombudsman for Children, Emily Logan. We should see that played through. I would like to know the nature of the complaints or information brought to the Garda that gave rise in the first place to the visit to the families' homes and how that was interrogated. The question then arises of the seriousness and immediacy of the risk to the health and welfare of the children, which form the circumstances in which a child may be removed from a family setting. I would like to know what immediate and serious threat to the children's health and safety was considered to justify their removal from their families. I would like to know how the decision was made, and by whom, and whether there were alternative ways of dealing with whatever issue had confronted the Garda short of removing the children from their homes and family settings. These are questions that the investigations and reports commissioned by the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, will have to address. I do not think any of us should prejudge the answers but we need to get the answers, the information and the reports placed in the hands of the Ombudsman for Children.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	I thank the Tánaiste for his reply. We cannot go back to the days of see no evil, hear no evil and speak no evil. All of us have a responsibility and we do not want to see these cases being used as a deterrent to protecting children. At the same time, however, we have to prevent over intrusion into family lives. The right balance has to be achieved. One lesson that can be learned is that the Government needs to publish the legislation to provide for proper processes and procedures in dealing with child protection issues. This legislation was promised more than two years ago. Professionals working in the health services and child protection, as well as gardaí, are operating in a legislative vacuum and the Children First guidelines need to be put on a legislative basis and backed up in law. This legislation is overdue and it is an essential part of ensuring robust child protection structures. Can the Tánaiste give us a clear timeframe as to when the legislation will come before the House? In regard to the reports that are to be prepared, can he explain why the Garda report is internal rather than independent and indicate whether they will be given to the families concerned in addition to the Ombudsman once they have been completed?

As Deputy Troy will be aware, the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, has been bringing forward the guidelines and legislation. It is important to recognise this is not an issue of legislation; it is an issue of practice. The issue to be addressed is what happens in practice. We can have all the legislation and guidelines in the world.

The question that arises is what happened in this case. We must establish the facts. The intention is that those reports will be prepared over the next two to three weeks and will be given to the children's Ombudsman, who will liaise on them with the families. The dimension raised by Deputy Troy, namely, whether a group of people in our country are of a particular ethnic background or so on, clearly should not be given extra or special attention in child safety matters. I would be concerned if there was any element of that in these cases, but that is something that the report to be prepared must address.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	8	No more than the Tánaiste, I do not wish to jump to conclusions about this case. We should not, as it would not be helpful. Perhaps we can imagine the scene - a knock at the families' doors and their children taken away, from what we can ascertain on the simple basis that their colouring did not fit the racial profile of the families concerned. A number of core and deeply troubling issues arise from these cases and what is already in the public domain. The first is the possibility of racial profiling and targeting of Roma families out of prejudice, fear or suspicion. We need clear statements from the House and the Tánaiste on behalf of the Government to the effect that no family or child will be discriminated against or targeted in any way on the basis of race, ethnicity, skin colour, eye colour or hair colour.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	10	The second issue relates to the State's capacity to protect the rights of children. Many people following this story see the marked contrast between, on the one hand, last week's revelation by the children's Ombudsman of the HSE's failure to intervene over several years after a child made multiple allegations of rape or another report of 4,100 children who had been assessed by the HSE as needing intervention but having to wait more than three months for that intervention and, on the other, the heavy arm of the State in these cases. This is troubling. I do not wish these cases to undermine the State's capacity to protect our children, which is a fundamental role. However, there is a great amount of public disquiet about whether the State can move in willy-nilly and in an arbitrary fashion to take people's children from them. Will the Tánaiste categorically state that this is not the case? The third issue relates to the nature of the proposed investigations. It is not satisfactory that the Garda would investigate the Garda or that the HSE would investigate the HSE.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	13	Deputy McDonald has raised three issues. First, she asked me for a categoric statement in respect of discrimination against any family or child on the basis of ethnic or other background. Let us be clear - all children and families in this country, irrespective of ethnic, religious and other backgrounds, enjoy the same rights. There can be no discrimination, targeting or special treatment. Irrespective of backgrounds, people have the right to be treated equally. This is clearly the position of the Government as well as every Member who sits in this House. The second issue is that of reporting. Deputy McDonald is right in that this country has had a culture of not reporting the abuse of children. In some cases, people who were aware of child abuse did not report it for a long time. Happily, we are seeing an end to that culture. We need and have a child protection regime that puts children and their safety first, but we must also ensure the way in which this regime is delivered, managed and operated is proportionate and sensitive. Allegations or information given to the Garda or authorities should be examined. Only in cases of a serious and immediate threat or risk to the safety or health of a child should that child be removed from a family. Other options must be explored. As to the reports requested by the Ministers, Deputies Shatter and Fitzgerald, the Garda Commissioner's will be on the handling of the situation by the Garda and the HSE's will be on how it and its child protection workers handled the situation. The intention is that these two reports will go to the children's Ombudsman. We should then wait for her recommendations on what further steps might need to be taken. First, however, we need to establish what happened and get the initial reports. We will then hear the recommendations of the children's Ombudsman, who is independent and in whom I and Deputies have considerable confidence.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	14	Although it is true to say that there was a culture in this State and beyond of not reporting child abuse, which occurred most commonly in the family home, the State has a much deeper legacy of institutional abuse and of failing to protect children. It also has a history of confiscating children. This is a part of the psychological landscape of how many people view the State and its incapacity to protect our children. We must acknowledge this, not play up to it. Many people judge this turn of events against that backdrop.

It is not appropriate and will not build public confidence for the Garda to investigate itself or for the HSE to investigate itself. Why not give the investigative process to the Ombudsman for Children in the first instance and allow her independent office, which is charged with the rights and welfare of children, to take the inquiry from start to finish?

We all agree that the practices and neglect that formed part of our history in dealing with children must be put behind us. That is being done. The safety and welfare of children are being put at the heart of the entire child protection system.As regards how that is operated, however, it has to be done in an accountable way. Many people have basic questions to ask about what happened. How did the gardaí arrive at a home and remove a child in circumstances where, as we now know, there does not appear to have been any basis for doing so? How did that happen? What was the report or information the gardaí had that led them to go to the house in the first place?

However it is a bit hard to take when tomorrow the Government will vote through a piece of legislation that discriminates on no grounds other than age. Perhaps that is something to reflect upon. I wish to ask the Tánaiste about the European Stability Mechanism. EU leaders are meeting today and tomorrow in Brussels. It is clear that one of the issues to be discussed is the retrospective recapitalisation of banks using the European Stability Mechanism. This is critical for Ireland. As everyone in this House knows, we have poured about €64 billion into the failed banking system in Ireland. The latest information from the budgetary documents suggests that next year we will pay about €2.7 billion in interest on the money we all poured into the banks. Let us put that in perspective. The entire gain to the Exchequer of all the measures from the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill - including cuts to those under 26 - will be about €100 million. Let us think about this for a second. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill will return to the Exchequer about 1/27th of the money that we will pay in interest - not on the national debt, but just the bit of the national debt that is there because of the banking crisis. The youth who will be discriminated against in tomorrow's legislation will pay that €2.7 billion in their taxes for the rest of their lives, unless Ireland can get a substantial deal on recapitalisation of the Irish banks. I welcome the fact that the Taoiseach has written to his EU counterparts to keep this imperative at centre stage. Labour and Fine Gael made a lot of noise before the election about senior bondholders sharing the burden.

We have had to work to get out of that situation. Over that period, we have managed our affairs in such a way that we will exit the bailout at the end of this year. In addition, we succeeded in negotiating the terms of the deal that was made by the previous government. In the first instance, it was to secure a reduction in the interest rate. I remember people in this House saying that we would not get a 1% reduction and we got over 2%.

Third, we succeeded in persuading our European partners to make a significant policy decision in June 2012 on the separation of bank and sovereign debt. Ireland's situation was specifically referenced in that decision because Ireland had done its recapitalisation before the new European mechanisms were put in place, including the ideas around banking union and the ESM.  Following that, we pressed ahead with implementing the banking union and quite an amount of work was done on that in the course of our EU Presidency. The issue will be discussed at the European Council again tomorrow. In order to make Ireland's position absolutely clear, the Taoiseach has written to President Van Rompuy and the other 27 EU Heads of State and Government. He has made it clear that we want delivery on the June 2012 agreement.  All the previous negotiations, which we successfully concluded to the benefit of the Irish taxpayer, were conducted on the basis that we would not state our negotiating position publicly. It would be unwise and we will not do so in this situation either, other than to say that we are determined to get the best outcome for the Irish taxpayer. We have some form on this because on all the previous occasions when we had major negotiations to conduct, we succeeded in getting a satisfactory outcome for the Irish taxpayer. It was an outcome which went beyond the most pessimistic expectations that were often expressed in this House.

To set the record straight, the interest rate was achieved by Portugal and then applied to Ireland. When the Government sought an interest rate reduction it did not get one. The Tánaiste made an extraordinary comment which was that the Government had ended the promissory note payment. Unless I am mistaken, we are going to pay €210 million next year on interest on the promissory note and we still owe €28 billion in promissory note bonds. Just so that everybody understands, the promissory note payment has not changed. It has moved from a promissory note to a bond. We still owe the money and will still pay it all. The Tánaiste is correct in saying that the Government achieved a great success in June 2012 with that statement. I applaud him for it. My question goes to the heart of that statement. Being nice and paying everybody else's bills is not a strategy. That is what has happened on the promissory notes.

We will do so. Very often these are matters of timing. We will do so when we are in the best position to secure the best option for the Irish taxpayer. This is what the taxpayer expects us to do. We have set out our position to the European Council meeting. This was set out in a letter from the Taoiseach. The issue of recapitalisation does not arise until the banking union and ESM structures have been put in place, which will be some time next year. Clearly, it would not be wise for us to wait until next year to set out our position and to ensure it is clearly understood. We will continue to do so until we get a satisfactory outcome, as we have done on each of the previous occasions.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	70	No. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 is lengthy and complex legislation. It was published only 36 hours ago. Since its publication, the Bills Office has been in contact with my office in regard to proposed amendments because the Bill will progress to Committee and Remaining Stages immediately on conclusion of Second Stage. The Tánaiste will be aware that more than 1 million people in this country are directly or indirectly dependent on social welfare. This complex legislation will have serious consequences for many of those people. For example, the Bill proposes to slash jobseeker's benefit for the under 25s.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	71	The Deputy cannot go into the detail of the Bill now. He may only deal now with the arrangements.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	72	It also abolishes the bereavement grant and free telephone allowance. These measures will have the most profound consequences for some of the most vulnerable people in this country. Why the rush? In the lead up to the last general election, when the Labour Party was in opposition, it proposed, as part of Dáil reform, that there be an interval between the different Stages of legislation so that people would have an opportunity to reflect on what was said on Second Stage. Why the rush to get this Bill through all Stages by 4 p.m. tomorrow? It is still only October. These measures do not take effect until January. What is the rush? Is this the democratic revolution we were promised prior to the election?

Consequential on this they are now bringing forward a disgraceful Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, which at the end of the day is yet another open invitation to young Irish people to leave these shores in their tens of thousands. The Government promised there would be no interference with core social welfare payments but it has broken that promise, as evidenced by the facts contained in this proposed legislation. On promised Dáil reform, how does the proposal to guillotine the Second Stage debate on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013 at 10 p.m. tonight and to guillotine all of the Remaining Stages tomorrow sit with the commitment of the Government to Dáil reform? It is the direct opposite. It represents the worst practices of the past. I appeal to members to revisit this. The guillotine should be lifted and proper debate should be allowed.

Its content has been known since the budget was announced. A total of 13 hours has been provided for debate on the Bill, seven and a half for the Second Stage debate and five and a half hours for Committee and Remaining Stages. I understand that, following the Order of Business, the Whip will meet to discuss with the Opposition spokespersons a timetable in regard to the taking of the different sections, which is a sensible way of allocating the time. The amount of time allocated for debate on the Bill is adequate to deal with a Bill of 15 sections.

We have already outlined why we believe Committee Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill should be delayed until after next week so that there is sufficient reflection on the Second Stage debate. The question to be put to the Dáil tomorrow requires that only amendments prepared and put by the Minister can be voted upon. In a very stark way that illustrates the paucity of genuine engagement that will occur on the Bill. The Tánaiste was on this side of the House and the general public were promised a lot in terms of Dáil reform. We were promised a pre-legislative phase for Bills, which will not happen with this Bill.

The Tánaiste spoke earlier about the number of hours. It is not anyone's role or reserve to make a judgment as to what hours are required. It should be open to the House to deal with any legislation in a proper, calm and measured way. Let us consider the Tánaiste's record of opposition to guillotines in this House over many years. There is no consistency between the position he adopted as an Opposition party leader and that which he is now supporting and advocating in government. The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is before us much earlier than has been the case heretofore. There is no requirement for the guillotine to apply and, of course, the Government already knows it is wholly inappropriate. We will be opposing it.

We are about to exit the bailout programme and stand on our own two feet again as a country. The Department of Social Protection is making a significant contribution to that recovery. We have reformed the way the Department engages with jobseekers to help them back to work and firmly maintained the welfare safety net for those most in need. All of this has been done while reducing overall welfare expenditure to assist with the necessary task of repairing the public finances. I have said many times before that the most effective way of reducing welfare expenditure is to get people back to work. The proof of this is now being witnessed. When negotiations on the budget began, the Department was initially requested to make new expenditure reductions of €440 million. However, we were able to limit expenditure reductions to €226 million, as part of an overall €290 million adjustment, largely because of the performance of the live register. At the height of the crisis there was a real risk that the live register would exceed 500,000. Instead, thanks to the recovery initiated by the Government, the live register is, thankfully, falling. More than 20,000 people have left the live register over the past year. Further, given the trend in the figures over recent months I can state with confidence that the live register at the end of October will fall below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009. Naturally, that is still far too high but we are making progress, slowly but surely. For every 10,000 people we help off the live register we save approximately €95 million in yearly welfare expenditure. That is why since coming to office I have focused on transforming the Department from the passive benefits provider of old to an active, engaged and focused organisation that provides employment services for jobseekers and employers alike. This is why I place such emphasis on our Intreo one-stop-shop offices, where jobseekers can get their income and employment supports in the same place for the first time. The first day of signing on for jobseekers is also the first day that we help them back to education, training and employment. I have secured additional capital funding next year which will allow us to complete the full roll-out of Intreo offices to all of the Department's offices nationwide. The process will be managed by the Office of Public Works.The numbers in work increased by 33,800 in the past year and the private sector is creating 3,000 new jobs every month. While not wishing to overstate it, as the recovery picks up some pace, there will be a steady flow of additional jobs created in the economy next year. It is chiefly as a result of this progress that I have been able to lower the expenditure reductions required of my Department in 2014. I am keenly aware that reductions of €226 million will have an impact on and cause difficulties for people who rely on social welfare for their principal income. None the less, the lower adjustment means I have protected the State pension, carer’s allowance, disability allowance and all other core weekly payments upon which people depend. I also have protected crucial supplementary supports for pensioners, carers and people with disabilities such as the fuel allowance, the electricity and gas allowances, free travel, the half-rate carer’s allowance, the respite care grant and the television licence payment. Child benefit also has been protected in this budget and will remain a vital universal support for all families and all children. Despite the overall budgetary pressures, the Government is finding the room to invest further in crucial initiatives such as the roll-out of many more breakfast clubs to ensure schoolchildren in disadvantaged areas get the right start in the morning and the right start in life. This shows the Government has protected the welfare safety net despite inheriting a state of economic emergency that required urgent and drastic action to address. The Department has maintained the safety net and reformed services for jobseekers while at the same time playing its full part in the deficit reduction programme necessary to exit the bailout. Overall welfare expenditure will fall below €20 billion in 2014 despite demographic pressures in the shape of the increasing number of pensioners. This year the Department is spending approximately €190 million in additional funding on pensioners while next year it will spend at least an additional €100 million because of the increase in the number of pensioners in the population. Despite these pressures, the Government has abided by its commitment to protect core weekly social welfare rates, including the State pension. As I stated, next year my Department will provide more than €190 million extra in funding for State contributory pensioners and widow and widower contributory pensioners. The fact that this is being done in the context of a reduced overall spend demonstrates the degree to which the Department is prudently managing its budget and protecting against poverty in what are exceptionally difficult times. In a wider sense, as I have stated many times, strong and responsive welfare provision for those who need it does more than simply provide a key safety net for the individuals, families and communities concerned. Welfare is spent at local level in shops and businesses in every community and continues to represent a vital demand stabiliser even as economic activity and employment grows. There is a difference between falling back on welfare when it is needed and becoming dependent on it in the long term or across the generations. Long-term welfare dependency is something we must prevent as the recovery picks up pace and more opportunities become available. In particular, signing on for jobseeker’s allowance on a person’s 18th birthday is not the start to adult life any parent would want for his or her child. We must be more ambitious for our young people. I am making the changes relating to jobseeker’s allowance for young people to place a greater emphasis on work, training and education supports rather than on income supports. This will ensure young people always are better off in education, employment or training than claiming. To facilitate this, the Department will enhance the range of opportunities currently on offer in the form of internships, participation on employment schemes, subsidised private sector recruitment and supports for self-employment. The full range of youth employment initiatives will be set out in the Government's plan for the implementation of the EU youth guarantee, which will be finalised and submitted to the EU by the end of the year. Such submissions will be made by Ireland and all the other member states. As part of this, the Government will seek to maximise the share of EU funding allocated to Ireland. Even before any EU funding is agreed, the Department is committed to spending €1.08 billion next year on work, training and education places and related supports for jobseekers generally. This is an increase of almost €85 million on the projected spend for this year. In addition to the need to ensure more opportunities for young people, I am conscious of the need to protect and support those who have worked and paid their taxes and PRSI contributions over a long period. Many workers continue to face compulsory retirement in their early 60s, while other workers of the same age have lost their jobs in recent years, that is, well before they reach State pension age and can claim their State pension. A balance must be struck between the pressures of population and demographic changes and the needs of those who have made a substantial contribution to society over the years. In recent Social Welfare Acts, I introduced provisions compelling unemployed people to engage with activation processes. It is only right and proper that in return for the Department doing its best for jobseekers in respect of assistance and support, jobseekers must do their best to engage with the Department. In recognition of the difficult position facing some older workers, as well as their long-standing contribution to the State, I have instructed my departmental staff that from 1 January 2014, such compulsory conditions no longer will be applied to older people who seek the support of the jobseeker schemes in advance of pension age. In addition, arrangements will be made in order that such older people will be obliged to register with their local office only once a year and will have their jobseeker payments paid directly into their bank accounts if they so wish. This instruction means that people who are on the jobseeker schemes aged 62 or over will not be subjected to the activation related sanctions that are provided for in legislation such as payment rate reductions and temporary withdrawal of benefit. Where a person aged over 62 wants support to reskill, retrain or take up any options offered by the Department, he or she may voluntarily seek to avail of an array of such supports. I am trying to balance the desire of some people to work for a lot longer with the fact that for others, it is not something in which they particularly wish to be involved. In this way, we will continue to support longer working while acknowledging the contribution of those who are in transition to retirement. This initiative should be viewed in tandem with other arrangements in place for jobseekers aged between 65 and 66 and set out in law. These arrangements provide that jobseeker’s benefit re-qualification provisions do not apply in the case of a person aged between 65 and 66 years, meaning that if a person qualifies for benefit at age 65 or their benefit is due to expire at age 65, benefits will be paid until that person's 66th birthday. In the case of a jobseeker’s benefit recipient under 65 whose claim spans from one benefit year into another, a new relevant tax year requirement is not applied in the case of entitlement relating to the second benefit year. Separate to the provisions above, I am coming to the end of my deliberations on the current issues on defined benefit pensions and I expect to bring provisions on these matters to the House soon. I will outline the main provisions of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title, construction and collective citations, as well as for the commencement of sections by way of commencement order. Section 2 provides for the definition of certain common terms used throughout the Bill. Section 3 provides for the second element of the budget 2013 decision to broaden the base on which PRSI contributions are charged so as to provide that the exemption from PRSI that applies to employed contributors and occupational pensioners aged under 66 years whose only additional income is unearned income will be abolished with effect from 1 January 2014. The additional unearned income will now become liable to PRSI at 4% provided the person is a chargeable person for Revenue purposes. Essentially, a chargeable person means a person with unearned income in excess of €3,174. This will not apply to PAYE taxpayers with no other income, or additional income less than €3,174. In addition, people who have reached State pension age of 66 are not liable to pay PRSI and therefore will not be affected.  Sections 4 and 7 increase the number of waiting days for entitlement to illness benefit and injury benefit respectively from three days to six days. This change takes effect from 6 January 2014. Section 5 provides for the alignment of the minimum and maximum rates of maternity benefit to a standard rate of €230 per week. This change only applies to new claimants and comes into effect for new claimants from 6 January 2014. Section 6 provides for the alignment of the minimum and maximum rates of adoptive benefit to a standard rate of €230 per week. This change again only applies to new claimants and comes into effect from 6 January 2014. Section 8 provides for the discontinuation of the payment of a bereavement grant in the case of deaths occurring on or after 1 January 2014 but the very wide range of supports in regard to spouses and dependent children who have suffered a bereavement continue and they are far more extensive and valuable than the actual bereavement grant. Section 9 provides for the amendment of the rates of jobseeker’s allowance payable to certain claimants aged under 26 years. A reduced weekly rate of €100 currently applies to 18 to 21-year-olds and a reduced rate of €144 applies to 22 to 24-year-olds in both cases where the claimant does not have children. This section provides that the reduced weekly rate of €100 will continue to apply to existing claimants aged between 18 and 21 years until they reach 25 years, and will also apply to new claimants aged between 22 and 24 years.  Section 9 also provides that the reduced weekly rate of €144 will continue to apply to existing claimants aged between 22 and 24 years when they reach 25 years and will apply to new claimants who are aged 25 years. In addition, these lower rates of jobseeker’s allowance will apply to claimants aged 25 and under who have exhausted their entitlement to jobseeker’s benefit. Claimants who have children will be unaffected by these measures. These changes will apply from 15 January 2014. Section 10 provides for amendment of the rates of supplementary welfare allowance payable to persons under 26 years on the same basis as the changes to the jobseeker's allowance that I have set out.  Section 11 provides for the discontinuation of the mortgage interest supplement scheme for new applicants with effect from 1 January 2014 and allows for a winding-down of the scheme for existing claimants over a four-year period, that is, by 1 January 2018, as people enter the mortgage arrears resolution process and, if appropriate for them, the insolvency services, following the passage of that legislation. Section 12 provides for the discontinuation of the higher personal weekly rate of invalidity pension of €230.30 payable where the pensioner attains 65 years of age on or after 2 January 2014, and the higher weekly rate of increase for a qualified adult of €206.30 payable where the qualified adult attains 66 years of age on or after 2 January 2014. That is in line with the State retirement pension. Section 13 provides that where a specified illness or disability payment is paid by the Department of Social Protection to a person who is unable to work as a result of an accident, injury or disease, and that social welfare recipient has been compensated for that accident, injury or disease, whether by way of court settlement or otherwise, the amount of such illness-related social welfare payments that have also been paid as a consequence of that personal injury is to be repaid to the Minister by the person liable to pay compensation, which in most cases will be insurance companies. Depending on the circumstances, this amount can be partially or fully offset by the compensator against any compensation for loss of earnings or profits. Part 3 and section 14 provide for amendment to section 38 of the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Act 2003 consequential to section 13. We are seeking to recover compensation payments, the Department's share, as happens, I understand, in pretty much every other country. Section 15 provides for the definition of the "Principal Act" to mean the "Pensions Act 1990". Section 16 provides for the inclusion of a reference to the "Surviving Civil Partner (Contributory) Pension" in section 59B of the Pensions Act. Section 17 provides for the inclusion of a reference to the "Surviving Civil Partner (Contributory) Pension" in section 59C of the Pensions Act. Section 18 inserts a new section 59H into the Pensions Act and provides the trustees of a pension scheme with the power to amend the scheme rules to ensure that the correct occupational pension is paid at age 65. This amendment arises from the change in the qualifying age for State pension from 65 to 66 from January 2014. It provides for the cessation of a bridging pension which may be payable in the period before the State pension becomes payable and for determining the correct rate of occupational pension payable in the case of an integrated pension. That completes the main provisions of the Bill. Balancing the needs of people who are dependent on social welfare against the money which is available is extremely difficult but I assure the House that the Government has done and is doing its utmost to protect the most vulnerable people in our society. I welcome the fact that the level of the adjustment to the social welfare budget is less than that originally requested, and that we have protected core weekly rates and the crucial secondary schemes and supports mentioned earlier. That is the reason the State pension and the other benefits which go to older people will continue to ensure that older people in Ireland enjoy a significantly less degree of being at-risk of poverty than almost every other European country. Those provisions in many ways are a reflection of the value of older people to Irish society. That has been reflected in our social welfare legislation down the years and despite an unprecedented period of fiscal austerity arising from the collapse of the banks and the construction industry.  In 2014, my Department will continue to help more people back to work, reduce the overall welfare spend as part of the sustained effort to repair the public finances, and ensure the safety net remains absolutely firmly in place for those who need it most. I commend the Bill to the House.  Debate adjourned.

Not only am I opposed to the unseemly haste with which it is being rammed through this House by the use of the guillotine, I am also fundamentally opposed to its provisions because they form the centrepiece of this Government's third regressive budget in a row. In the budgetary context, when an adjustment is needed and money is taken out of the economy, a progressive budget would be one which takes more from the rich than from the poor. The three budgets introduced by this Government do precisely the opposite; they have taken more from the poor than from the rich. In this budget there is no pretence whatsoever of progressivity. The comfortable are left comfortable and the afflicted are further afflicted. In other words, the burden falls mainly on those who can least afford it. We had a well-rehearsed script which was played out in some of the papers last Sunday. The script is familiar to us all now at this stage. I refer particularly to last Sunday's The Sunday Times in which we were told by unnamed Labour sources that it could have been much worse. We learned from The Sunday Times, wherever it got the information, that apparently Fine Gael had proposed a list of cuts to social welfare which, in the words of one Labour source, "would have been awful". Another source with perhaps a better command of the language described the Fine Gael proposals as a nightmare list. That was scene 1. Fine Gael was coming along, as usual, to crush the poor in this country. The scene ended, the curtain came down or whatever and everybody was extremely worried but in scene 2, St. Joan of Arc rode in on her white steed and rescued the poor at the last possible moment. It is a script we are fairly used to but it loses nothing in the retelling. It is running now as long as the "Forsyte Saga". We will be forced to conclude very soon that all those broken promises which got the Labour Party so many votes were almost worth it because they put the Labour Party into power as part of the Government and prevented the wicked, dastardly Blueshirts having their wicked way with the poor in this country. If the Minister for Social Protection thinks that this Social Welfare and Pensions Bill represents some sort of vindication of her efforts or that she deserves praise for her efforts as a result of producing this Bill, she is sadly deluded. The changes to social welfare payments for those under the age of 26 means that the casual debasement of young people by this Government continues apace. The entire process is being presented as some sort of character-building measure in that if these people's social welfare is cut sufficiently and they are squeezed sufficiently they will be forced out into training, education or employment. It is not a question of lack of jobs or lack of education or training places; it is a lack of ambition. The snide inference is that the young people of Ireland are too lazy or too shiftless to seek out opportunities. They have to be forced out. In fact, it is no longer an inference. Some of the Minister's backbenchers have painted a picture of people lolling on couches watching flat screen television seven nights a week. The clear implication is that those people have to be forced out. Let us look at the situation in reality in respect of places for training and education. All the experts tell us that 21,000 people under the age of 26 will be affected by these budgetary measures. The number of extra places being provided for those people is just over 3,000. I put a simple question to the Minister. If, for the best reason in the world, someone cannot get a place in training or education, how will more employment be created here by slashing their social welfare? It seems to have entirely escaped the Government's attention that many people who are languishing on social welfare have more than adequate training and education. Some of them are honours graduates with an MA or a PhD, and others are people with professional qualifications. What they lack is opportunities to get employment; they do not need training places. I ask the Minister again, in respect of those people, what is to be gained for the economy of the country or how will it create more employment if the already meagre social welfare payment for those in that category is slashed? As regards employment opportunities, again, it seems to have escaped the Government's attention that there are 32 applicants for every vacancy. In fact, from my experience in my city I believe that is somewhat understated. As the demographics show, the unemployment problem in this country, particularly among young people, has been outsourced to the four corners of the world. The thinking behind these provisions in this budget is not that it will help people into education or into a non-existent employment but that it will encourage people to emigrate. It is a fact that emigration is now a fundamental tool of this Government's policy to bring down unemployment figures. The youth cohort as a percentage of the Irish population has decreased from 16% to 12% over recent years. Where are they? They are in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, the four corners of the globe, and every measure taken by this Government regarding young people has only one objective, that is, to speed them on their way to the nearest airport. The Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed states that the way to prevent young people drifting into long-term unemployment is not to cut their income supports but to have imaginative activation measures that work. We are a very long way from that.  We are not just talking about welfare cuts here. It beggars belief that the Government is now proposing that FÁS apprentices will be asked, for the first time, to pay a pro rata student contribution for the time they spend in institutes of technology. I thought the philosophy behind the Government's proposal was to give people more to encourage them to come out of unemployment. We are talking here about people who have done that, yet the Government is saying it will force them to pay up for the first time. How does one explain, in the context of the Government's philosophy, the decision to remove the €20 per week bonus from long-term unemployed people who decide to get out from in front of the flat screen TV and participate in FÁS, VTOS or Youthreach programmes? Surely this is a disincentive. The Minister is making them worse off for coming out even though her philosophy is to encourage them to come out by making them better off. The princely sum of €14 million has been ring-fenced for the youth guarantee scheme. All the experts tell me that to have a proper youth guarantee scheme, which will cost approximately €6,500 to €7,000 per head for the unemployed youth, would cost approximately €300 million. I estimate that €14 million would cover about 2,000 places, which I suppose is to be welcomed, but if we look at it in the larger context, with 1,600 people per week emigrating, it will handle emigration for nine or ten days. To add injury to the insult already heaped on this demographic cohort, there is a cut of €1 million for youth work services which are stretched to the limit. We had a debate on the elderly in this House during the week and I said then much of what I wanted to say on that. Suffice to say that the relentless, continuous, pitiless assault by this Government on the elderly for the past two and a half years is something to behold. I outlined in that debate 17 measures aimed directly at reducing the living standards of the elderly, and that list was not exhaustive. It has now culminated in the slashing of the fuel allowance by a Government that committed in its programme for Government to ending fuel poverty. We have had the removal of the free telephone rental allowance, with all the associated problems of security and isolation that will cause, the slashing of the respite care grant, the continuing slashing of the budget for supplementary welfare allowance and - the final insult - the removal of the bereavement grant. The Minister for Education and Skills thinks there is not enough competition among funeral undertakers. I presume he envisages a situation now whereby somebody who becomes a widow or a widower will engage in some sort of tendering process and invite undertakers to make competitive bids. It is simply a cut, another blow, and source of worry to the elderly in this country. Maternity benefit has been cut again. The House will recall that last year the Minister for Finance decided that for the first time in the history of the State maternity benefit was to be taxed at the marginal rate.This year, in addition to that imposition, the basic rate of maternity benefit for 92% of people who receive it is to be reduced by a further €32 per week. That means that in less than 12 months, this Government has taken a total of €3,500 from expectant mothers. The supreme irony is that less than a week before the budget, the expert advisory group on an early years strategy recommended that the period for maternity benefit be extended from six to 12 months. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, said she accepted that and would fight for its implementation. Excuse me if I am not brimming with confidence and optimism about the possibility of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, succeeding in doubling the period of time for maternity benefit seeing as she has presided over such devastating cuts for the period of time for which expectant mothers are paid already. Did pregnant woman cause the crisis in our economy? If not, why does the Government persist in demeaning and devaluing them? There are many so-called "minor" measures, or at least the Government must consider them minor because one finds them in the footnotes and the accompanying documentation rather than in the main budget announcements. The Minister elaborated a little in her speech on the provision for recovery of illness or injury benefit paid to people who are compensated through the courts or through a settlement for injury suffered. She mentioned the fact this is happening in every other country but in most other countries to which one can point, one has a civil law jurisdiction and a completely different scenario in assessing damages for injury. I warn the Minister that this could have the most profound consequences for people who had to have recourse to social welfare and who are subsequently awarded a sum by way of damages. From what I can gather and from the attitude of the Tánaiste this morning, we will not have time tomorrow to debate it properly.

The employer is supposed to handle that. That has been extended to six days. There are two possibilities here. If the employer has a sick pay scheme, he or she will have to pony up. This will result on an extra cost on employers at a time when there are 32 applicants for every available job and when the Government is forcing young people to take non-existent jobs. This will do nothing to boost employment - in fact, it will do the reverse. If the employer does not have a sick pay scheme and if he or she is not prepared to pay up, the employee will be left for three further days without social welfare. What is the Labour Party's justification for that? The Minister will surely say the person can go to the community welfare officer if he or she is stuck. Unless he or she goes very early in the year to the community welfare officer, he or she will be referred to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul or some other such society on the basis that the budget has been exhausted. I refer to a person aged 65 on invalidity pension. Somebody who has reached the age of 65 is not young, and somebody who is getting invalidity pension certainly deserves it. One has to be pretty ill to be awarded invalidity pension. From here on in, a person who reaches the age of 65, who would have been on invalidity pension and would have expected to get €230 per week, will now get €193 per week. What is the justification for that for somebody who is elderly and ill? I will not dwell on the single parent allowance because it is more a matter for the finance Bill but suffice it to say that it is socially desirable that couples, post separation, should both participate in the welfare and upbringing of their children. This measure will be a disincentive to that. We have already got hundreds of e-mails which demonstrate that. The changes to lone parent allowance continue apace. The earnings threshold is being reduced again. The age under which the child must be has been changed back to ten years since July. All these changes in regard to lone parents are based on the extraordinary proposition that the less a lone parent has to gain by going to work, the more likely they are to do so. At the end of the Government's three regressive budgets, one has the following situation. One in six, or 16% of people, are at risk of poverty. This is despite the fact the measurement of risk of poverty - the income from which risk of poverty is determined - has dropped 10% since 2009. Almost one quarter of the population, or 24.5%, experience two or more enforced types of deprivation. The consistent poverty rate is almost 7%. Some 19.5% of children up to the age of 17 are in the risk of poverty category - almost double the OECD average. The basic social welfare payment for a single person is more than €25 per week below the poverty line. If that single person happens to be under 25, one can imagine how far below the poverty line they are. What really grates is the basic dishonesty which surrounds the whole exercise. As I said before, the budget and the accompanying provisions are a masterpiece of spin. One can see that quite easily if one looks at the accompanying tables which show what one comes out with pre-budget and what one comes out with post-budget, whether young, old, rich, poor, employed, self-employed or whatever. The difference between the two is nil. One is not affected at all. The €2.5 billion adjustment must have come from outer space.  The fact of the matter is that if somebody is under the age of 26 and is now coming into the social welfare system, he or she will be 30% worse off than he or she would otherwise have been. If somebody is claiming maternity benefit after 1 January next year, she will be worse off than she might otherwise have been. Mortgage income supplement, which has virtually been eradicated and on which 13,000 people rely, will be phased out. If one is one of those 13,000 who will experience the first part of the phasing out next year, as night follows day, one will be worse off. If one has three or more children and is getting less child benefit next year, certainly one will be worse off, if mathematics mean anything. If one was relying on the measly allowance of €9.50 per month for the telephone rental, which is suddenly being snatched away, one will be worse off. If one is a working lone parent, one will certainly be worse off. This is not counting people who are paying medical insurance. The older and sicker they are, the more likely it is they will be paying above what the Minister for Finance described as the gold plated level. They will be worse off.  People who will pay property tax at double the rate previously paid will be worse off. People who will pay more for their children at third level will certainly be worse off. People, whether under or over 70, who will lose the medical card will, according to the Government's own figures, be at least €1,000 worse off, or perhaps as much as €1,300. The budget was not neutral despite what the tables suggest. I am fascinated by the language. Some 92% of people who will receive maternity benefit will get €32 per week less than they would have heretofore. Not unnaturally, they are of the opinion that this is a cut but the Government has said this is not a cut of any kind but a standardisation. People coming into to the social welfare system who are under the age of 26 and who currently would get a certain amount, will get less but that is not a cut. It is simply moving people into a different category. The whole thing is redolent of the line in Lewis Carroll's Alice in Wonderland - "When I use a word," Humpty Dumpty said in rather a scornful tone, "it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less". George Orwell invented the term "doublespeak" which is a variant of "newspeak". The essential definition of "newspeak" was that the words one was speaking meant the precise opposite of what they were supposed to mean. The three slogans, which headed up Big Brother's constitution, were: "war is peace", "freedom is slavery" and "ignorance is strength".In the Orwellian world of Ireland in 2013, a reduction in maternity benefit is a "standardisation" and a reduction in jobseeker's allowance is simply "movement" to a different category. In 2008, the current Taoiseach described the previous Government's attempt to take medical cards from couples over the age of 70 who were earning more than €1,400 a week as a "Judas" betrayal. He now seems to think it is okay to take medical cards from couples earning just €900 a week. To adopt another Orwellian phrase, it is a case of "€1,400 bad, €900 good". In the real world we all occupy every day, one becomes an adult at the age of 18. In the parallel universe of the social welfare world, one does not become an adult until the age of 26. George Orwell said that "political language... is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind". Would that he were here today. The whole exercise - the Budget Statement, the Minister's speech this morning and the comments that were made in the lead-up to this exercise - was couched in the language of sacrifice. We heard numerous references to 1916 during the softening-up process that took place in advance of budget day. On the day the social welfare and public expenditure cuts were announced, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform referred to the Famine and the Minister for Finance quoted from one of the more morbid outpourings of WB Yeats. I remind the Minister, Deputy Noonan, that Yeats also wrote - I think it was in the same work - that this "is no country for old men". If he was here today, he could include old women in that phrase. He could add that this is not much of a country for the young either. As a former teacher of English, the Minister for Finance will be familiar not only with the work of Yeats, but also with the work of another well-known Irish bard, Oliver Goldsmith. In view of the budget's total regressivity and its total failure to make the more comfortable sections of society carry any of the burden - it places the bulk of the burden on the poor - perhaps the Minister, Deputy Noonan, might reflect on Goldsmith's words in "The Deserted Village":Ill fares the land, to hastening ills a prey,Where wealth accumulates, and men decay.In 1822, the death by his own hand of the infamously unpopular Lord Castlereagh triggered a series of epithets - many of them very bawdy, some of them downright vulgar and most of them in verse - rubbishing his career. As I have said, he was noted for his unpopularity. I was tempted to quote, with suitable adaptation, some of those epithets with reference to the Bill before the House, but I will confine myself to the more sober verdicts of various organisations that are involved in this area. In its response to last week's budget, Social Justice Ireland said: "Budget 2014 provides no guiding vision, no real sense of direction for Ireland’s future, and no sustainable solutions to the major challenges Ireland faces." In the most important part of its response, the organisation suggested: "The choices Government is making are undermining Irish society and dismantling the social model that has underpinned Ireland’s development for more than half a century." In its verdict, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul said that the budget "provides little by way of hope" for the poor, the old, people in poor health or the vulnerable. The secretary general of the Mandate union, Mr. Gerry Light, whom I previously understood to be a supporter of the Labour Party, has commented that 100 years after the 1913 Lock-out, we have been presented with "a Lockout Budget for the young the old and the vulnerable". These epithets, along with many more that are equally or more damning, will hang like a millstone around the neck of the Minister for Social Protection and that of the Irish Labour Party for many years to come.

It is normal for the social welfare Bill that is introduced following a budget to cover many areas. I am mindful of the context in which this legislation is being introduced. Last week, the Government Chief Whip promised to provide adequate time in future for discussions on legislation. The Taoiseach made a similar promise during the Seanad referendum campaign. We were told that all future Bills would have a pre-legislative stage. The Joint Committee on Social Protection is meeting today to consider the general scheme of the proposed gender recognition legislation. It is good that this positive legislation will benefit from a pre-legislative stage. By contrast, the legislation we are dealing with today was published at the last minute - yesterday morning - and we are expected to have read it, understood it and be able to debate every aspect of it in time for this debate. After the Second Stage debate concludes tonight, we will meet tomorrow for a Committee Stage discussion on all the amendments we can muster and those the Minister will propose. Additional amendments are always brought before us when legislation is being rushed in this way. That is not the way to do business. During the summer, when the Taoiseach was trying to find reasons to abolish the Seanad, he told the public he was genuine about Dáil reform. We were promised that we would be able to deal with legislation in a proper fashion. This is not the way for us to approach a social welfare Bill that affects the public. When it was decided to bring budget day forward to October, we were promised that we would have adequate time to discuss the social welfare and finance Bills prior to their passage and their coming into effect in January. This is another example of a promise that has been broken. We were promised that new legislative stages would be provided for and we were promised that we would be given adequate time. When the budget used to be presented in December, it was traditional for the social welfare legislation to be rushed through before Christmas so that certain social welfare changes could come into being in January. We would deal with other measures that had been announced at a later stage. Even though budget day has been moved back to October, we are rushing this legislation once again. I am keen to make my opposition to this process clear once again. Our feelings on the matter were made known earlier today. Many low-income groups are being targeted in this legislation. Each of them will feel the impact of these budgetary measures very acutely. The measures in question are being introduced following five austerity budgets, each of which involved the Government putting its hands into the pockets of social welfare recipients and low-paid workers. The little money those people used to have has been removed bit by bit. This budget provides for more of the same. It is appropriate for me to start at the beginning by speaking about the maternity benefit cut. I will work my way from the cradle to the grave before concluding by discussing the substantial changes that are proposed with regard to the bereavement grant. Indeed, the grant is being abolished. There cannot be a more substantial change than that. For many new mothers, maternity benefit is their only income during their maternity leave. This latest cut to maternity benefit follows the reduction in maternity benefits that came into effect in July of this year, following last year's announcement that the benefit was to be subjected to a Labour Party-imposed tax.The majority of maternity benefit recipients will see their weekly payments cut by €32. That is a cut of €832 over the course of their six months' leave. For those mothers who are fortunate enough to have the maternity benefit supplemented by their employers, the cumulative impact of this Government's cut and tax measures could shrink their benefits by up to €126, to a payment as low as €135.70, a potential loss, between the tax and the Minister's cuts, of €3,276. That is a substantial reduction for people who are in many cases suffering a loss of income in the first place and who have all the additional expenses that come with a newborn child. Barnardos described the cut to maternity benefit as anti-parenting, callous and unsupportive. It pointed out that Ireland lags behind many EU countries in offering only six months' maternity leave and no paid paternity or parental leave. This fresh round of cuts will exacerbate the financial pressure on women and force them back to work early. We live in a world that is in many ways enlightened, yet we seem to be going back to the dark ages because we are trying to put cuts in place that will force women to go back to work early, despite the changes made over recent decades. Remarking on the cut to maternity benefit, one person who e-mailed me asked whether the coalition deliberately chose 6 January 2014 for the commencement of the reduction in the rate of maternity benefit since this is the feast of the Epiphany when the Three Wise Men came to visit the new born Jesus, bringing gifts, and not tearing away at the straw in his manger. As Gaeilge that date is Nollaig na mBan. What type of present is the Minister giving pregnant women when she seeks to diminish their protection, their maternity benefit? Although the Minister did not announce a cut in child benefit this year, the cuts in benefit to the fourth and subsequent children were formally announced last year and will take effect in January. Any parent could tell the Minister that the anguish around this cut is still ripe. In the wake of last week's budget announcement I received much feedback from the public, some of which I will use in my contribution here. One constituent wrote that while the cuts did not directly affect her, she is always concerned for those who are less well off. The Government promised everybody that it was concerned because it said in the programme for Government that it would protect the vulnerable. So much for that promise. My constituent went on to say that "it is despicable that it was announced there were no cuts to child benefit this year when they knew this was coming down the line". Denial and deception have become the Minister's PR modus operandi. She says it is not a cut, that she is discontinuing one rate and introducing a lower one, that existing recipients are not affected, and that they will simply not get their anticipated increase. It is not a core payment because it is not paid weekly. That was another promise, that the Minister would protect core payments. It is not a cut, the Minister says, it is standardisation. If the Minister is so mortified about making this cut, the answer should not be superficial spin. Instead, she should not make the cuts. There are alternatives. I will return to these. My constituent pointed to a simple truth that should have informed the Government budgetary approach but clearly did not: "Larger families are being targeted when, by their very nature, they are likely to either have less income because one parent is at home with the children, or higher childcare costs if both parents work". Nothing has been done in this budget or in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill to address that truth. I turn to the issue of young unemployed people and those who will be employed soon. Section 9 provides for a cut in young people's jobseeker's allowance rates and section 10 provides for a cut in supplementary welfare allowance for those under 26. In another dimension I would welcome the consensus reached in this House over the matter of payment rates for young jobseekers, but regrettably that consensus no longer exists. In budget 2010 Fianna Fáil cut dole payments for those under 25. Fine Gael and the Labour Party voted against the proposal, arguing vociferously, together with Sinn Féin, that it did nothing to address the shortage of jobs, that there were not nearly enough places in education and training and that it would simply drive more people to emigrate. Fast forward to budget 2014 and Fine Gael and the Labour Party are cutting the bill for young jobseekers even further than the Fianna Fáil Party ever contemplated. With Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil argues against the measure it once favoured, finally realising it inflicts extreme hardship. I welcome its conversion on the road to Damascus. It is a pity the Minister and her Government have jumped off that road and are now implementing Fianna Fáil policy. My party has been the one constant throughout all this betrayal and opportunism. At one time or another, all parties were on the side of Sinn Féin in this argument. I urge the Minister to bow to our shared logic on this point because the cut to young people's jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance does nothing to address the shortage of jobs. There are still not nearly enough places in education and training, and this will accelerate the emigration of young people. These cuts are wrong and discriminatory. The Minister believed this once and maybe in her heart of hearts she still believes it but her actions do not reflect what is in her heart. Her spin does not stack up. This is no balancing act, as the Minister would have us believe, because between the service support and income support, the cut to jobseeker's allowance and to supplementary welfare allowance is in the order of €32 million. The Minister is adding only another €14 million to activation. That leaves a black hole of €18 million. Perhaps the Minister can clarify exactly where that €18 million is going because her own backbenchers and the Fine Gael backbenchers are peddling a lie that €42 or €46 million is available to be invested in activation or in additional activation measures. The Department has confirmed that the €32 million saved from social welfare payments makes up part of its overall budget reduction, part of the overall €229 million that the Government is taking out of the pockets of the least well-off in our society. The only additional activation provision for young people is a small youth guarantee. How adequate is the funding for this? The National Youth Council of Ireland reckons it represents just 5% of the estimated annual cost of what is needed for a genuine youth guarantee scheme. The council estimates that the cuts will affect 20,853 young jobseekers next year alone. The numbers will grow year on year as people emerge from schools and universities and no jobs are available. This budget guarantees only an extra 3,250 places in education, training and work experience. There are 32 jobseekers for every job vacancy advertised. They are the latest figures. There are 32 people looking for each job that is vacant.Young people cannot be incentivised into places, paid or otherwise, if those jobs do not exist. There are 18,000 fewer young people in paid employment compared with when this Government took office. There have been around 20,000 unpaid internships under the JobBridge scheme in that time. A sum of €100 in jobseeker's allowance plus €50 as part of JobBridge on a 40 hour week equals €3.75 per hour. Is that the new minimum wage the Labour Party is creating? This Government is making the implicit assumption that young people's parents will cover their costs, but this is not possible for many either as a consequence of household financial realities or family breakdown. The cut will inflict severe hardship and, in some cases, destitution on young people. A parent's means are taken into account when determining eligibility for jobseeker's allowance for a young person living at home. The payment goes to a young person who is living in a low-income household. The cut will affect the entire household. Research from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice demonstrates that the cost of a minimum essential standard of living for a young adult living in the parental home is forecast to rise to €183.99 per week in 2014. The cut in rates of jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance leave the payments far short of this. The Society of St. Vincent de Paul draws the obvious conclusion and states that "this will result in further stress, struggling and hardship for low income individuals and families". For others, the cut will cause homelessness. Since the young person's rate was first cut by Fianna Fáil in budget 2010, every homeless service has reported an increase in the number of homeless young people. Focus Ireland estimates that a couple of hundred young people will be pushed into homelessness by the measure this year and makes the point that even short periods of homelessness can have devastating and lifelong consequences for young people. Most homeless hostels charge between €50 and €75 per week. How can a young person or any person for that matter afford this out of a payment of just €100 or even €144? Focus Ireland also argues that the emergency accommodation provided to these young people is expensive to run and costs the taxpayer considerably more than is saved by the reduced rate of the payment. I understand the Department has invited Focus Ireland to work with it to develop a pilot community employment scheme to meet some of the needs of these young people, and while Focus Ireland welcomes that opportunity, as do I, it has also stated that this project-based response is time-consuming to construct and will only be able to respond to a small number of affected individuals and only in Dublin. There is a need to accelerate the funding for these types of schemes. It should not be a pilot scheme at this stage given what has happened. I will turn to the other measures in the legislation, in particular those targeting workers. Illness benefit and injury benefit are cut in sections 4 and 7. The number of days without payment is being doubled from three to six. That is a cut of €112.80 and someone will suffer the consequence of it. There is no statutory entitlement to sick pay, which means in some cases the sick person will suffer the loss. The fact that one is sick does not mean one's mortgage and other household outgoings are reduced. If anything, the opposite is the case as utility bills may rise due to the fact that one is housebound in that period. One might need to increase the heating in the house during that period or visit a doctor to get a certificate, which can cost up to €70 in some parts of this city. That is before one pays for medicine. Many employers offer their staff sick pay and this is to be encouraged. In those instances, this cut adds to the costs of employers, many of whom are struggling to retain jobs as it is. Mortgage interest supplement is being abolished in the absence of effective action to tackle the mortgage arrears crisis. Last year's budget announcement in respect of mortgage interest supplement was extremely disingenuous. Last year, the Minister introduced a rule which prevented people accessing mortgage interest supplement for 12 months. For many struggling families, this was undoubtedly a glimmer of light because they knew that after a year of engaging with the bank, they could possibly rely on the mortgage interest supplement but now, ten months later, the Minister has extinguished that light altogether. The scheme is being abolished in the absence of any other income support for home owners who lose their jobs or in the absence of a substantial increase in social housing. The paltry amount announced in the budget will not address the huge number of people on the housing lists throughout this city and country. It is paltry in the extreme and will not affect all those who face eviction because of repossession due to the ineffective approach of this Government and previous Governments to the mortgage crisis. The policy rationale put forward for abolishing the scheme is that it was always intended to be a short-term support. The rent allowance and rent supplement scheme were supposed to be short-term supports. Will the Minister target them next? The cut to the invalidity pension for those aged 65 means 65 year old disabled pensioners are looking at a cut of €36.80 per week or €1,914 over the year. Invalidity pension is paid to people with the requisite contributions record who cannot work due to long-term illness or disability. Most will have been receiving illness benefit for the previous year. The rate of invalidity pension for those aged under 65 is €193.50 and currently for those aged 65 it is €230. Recipients would have anticipated that they would move to the higher rate when they reach the age of 65. The higher rate is discontinued, as it is termed, from January for people who turn 65 after that date, so they will have to wait until they are 66 when their State pension kicks in to achieve the higher rate. This cut is like the abolition of the State pension transition already provided for by this Government in a previous budget which kicks in from January. We also opposed that measure as it will force many 65 year olds onto a pointless year of jobseeker's benefit while they wait for their State pension to kick in at 66. I heard what the Minister announced earlier but what she announced is that there will be a reduced jobseeker's payment because a person will not be forced to look for work once they are aged 62 and upwards.

Section 18 announces pension trustee discretionary powers. This gives board discretionary powers to pension scheme trustees which would facilitate the shrinking of occupational pension payments made to those who turn 65 after 1 January 2014. This measure is being introduced in the absence of safeguards or even a decent lead-in time to allow people to make other arrangements.This power to reduce pension benefits is being given to all trustees, including those who preside over schemes that are not currently in deficit or which are making their way out of deficit. It is a pity this issue was not properly discussed. We probably will not have a proper discussion on the effects of this measure because of the tight timeframe for passing the Bill. The bereavement grant offered a small assistance towards the cost of funerals for workers with a solid contributions record. It provided a mere €850 towards the crippling costs of burials. The Association of Funeral Directors has stated that the average cost of a funeral is €4,000. I know from personal experience that the figure is significantly higher in this city, even for those who are frugal in their arrangements. The director of Massey Brothers undertakers has said more than 70% of people using its services are currently supported by the grant and suggested the cost of a funeral in Dublin is as high as €10,000. The issue of the telephone allowance is glaringly absent from this Bill. The abolition of that allowance will increase fear and isolation among older people, the mobility of whom is often limited. A large proportion of them live in rural areas and have families who emigrated. Furthermore, personal alarm pendants depend on landlines. While the telephone allowance is worth only €9.50 per month this year, it was €22.60 last year. Under this Government, two budgets in a row have taken €271 from the annual budgets of those over the age of 70 and certain people with disabilities. Given the isolation these people experience, not only in rural areas but also in the cities, and coupled with the cuts to home help services, people will be living in greater fear and isolation. Many of them cannot get out of their homes due to mobility problems. In regard to those whose children have emigrated, some use Skype to keep in contact but the Minister is taking that away from them by removing the telephone allowance.  Also absent from the Bill is a reversal of the changes to the one parent family payment despite the absence of the credible, Scandanavian-style child care that the Minister promised would be put in place. She should keep her promise that the minimum age would not be reduced until that system of child care is in place. The minimum age is due to be reduced to 10 years in 2014 and to seven years in 2015.

She promised to protect the core payments but she has not done so. The programme for Government promised to protect the vulnerable but this budget is, once again, going after the vulnerable. We outlined our alternatives but the Minister rejected them. Many others have made proposals. The youth organisation, SpunOut, has made several imaginative suggestions, although I do not fully agree with them. It suggested that the bank levy could be substantially increased to avoid social welfare cuts. The Minister rejected that, just as she rejected proposals from TASC and the trade union movement. She has made the decision to cut €219 million from the social welfare budget. That cut hits local economies up and down the country. She has acknowledged that social transfers pay dividends to local economies and help people out of poverty but she is increasing the likelihood that people will fall into poverty or that small shops will close. I reject this Bill in its entirety. I might welcome one or two small changes, which I will address on Committee Stage, but as it stands it will have devastating consequences for young and old in this State, and anybody who depends on social welfare.

This Social Welfare and Pensions Bill, like the budget, makes swingeing economic attacks on the elderly with its callous snatch back of tens of thousands of medical cards, on the young with the savage cuts to their jobseekers' allowances and on pregnant women with the callous cut to maternity benefits, among many other attacks. As we discuss social protection today, the Irish State stands ashamed in front of the world for a situation in which a bigoted busybody sent an ignorant and bigoted Facebook message to a journalist to the effect that a child in a Roma family has blonde hair and blue eyes and, I quote, "It's a big problem with missing kids, the Roma robbing them to get child benefit in Europe". On foot of this, journalists and two powerful State agencies, the Garda and the HSE, swallowed an assumption based on the most abysmal ignorance and racial stereotyping to the effect that it is impossible for a Roma person to be blonde and blue eyed and peremptorily removed children from their homes in Tallaght and Athlone. It is pathetic for the Taoiseach to say that he believes this was done in good faith. So-called good faith arising from ignorant and bigoted assumptions is not a basis for child protection policy.

The scandal of the Roma children removed from their homes occurred because of the stereotyping that is done by the establishment in this society. This Fine Gael-Labour Party coalition, and the Minister, Deputy Burton, have consistently reinforced another bigoted, ignorant and cynical stereotype in regard to social welfare recipients, unemployed people and, especially, the youth to the effect that they are lazy and feckless shysters. The reality is that in August 2013, 32 people were unemployed for each notified vacancy. The outrageous slander against the young unemployed is used to justify savage cuts to the jobseekers' benefit, continue the disastrous austerity agenda and save the financial market system of Europe by saving the banks and bondholders from the fruits of their reckless speculation in the Irish property bubble. In the 1979-83 Tory Government in Britain, a certain employment Minister called Norman Tebbit - now Baron Tebbit - advised the growing army of unemployed victims of Thatcherism to do as his father allegedly did in the 1930s, and get on their bikes and stay on their bikes until they found a job. In this Government's disgraceful attacks on the young unemployed, the Minister for Social Protection is rapidly emerging as the Baroness Tebbit of the Fine Gael-Labour Party Government.

The Government is intent on making the working class pay for the crisis of its system. There was and is an alternative - wealth taxes, other taxes and significant investment in job creation. This is the socialist alternative that we fight for and for which people should mobilise and organise in order to change the policy of this odious Government.

The Minister did so again today, claiming that the basic rates of core payments would not be changed. This is a narrow interpretation and does not stand up to scrutiny. I presume that, for a Labour Minister, the core welfare payments are the jobseeker's benefit and allowance, the old age pension, disability and illness benefits, the lone parents benefit and carer's allowance. I will leave child benefit aside for now. The failure to increase rates in line with inflation represents a real cut. Substantial increases in energy costs impact more severely on those on low incomes. Yesterday's announcement of a sharp increase in public transport prices will also most affect people on low incomes. There has been a direct cut in the basic rates of jobseeker's allowance for 22 to 25 year olds. Is this not a direct cut in core payments? One cannot differentiate between those aged over and under 25 years. There has been a reduction to nine months in the length of time over which one can claim this allowance. This is a cut to benefit entitlements. Part-time workers' entitlements have been changed from six days to five days. The change in the entitlement to the old age pension is also a cut. The Minister has increased the pension age as well as the number of stamps required for contributory pensions. The Minister's claim is empty. It is a pretence. In reality, her budgets have targeted the most vulnerable. Under this Administration, not a single welfare payment has not been cut and not a single entitlement has not been restricted or reduced. The Government and the Minister in particular like to dress up benefit cuts in job activation measures. Cuts in the benefits for young people are a blatant attempt to force them into low-paid, precarious employment, but even those jobs do not exist. The decision to continue the reduction in the earnings disregard for lone parents is a cut, as are the removal of the one-parent family tax credit and the discontinuation of training allowances for lone parents. How are these cuts meant to encourage lone parents into work? Labour will undoubtedly claim it was successful in limiting welfare cuts to €290 million. In reality, these cuts could have been avoided. Deputy Burton is the Labour Minister of the Department of Social Protection. A 0.5% wealth tax would raise €250 million. She had that choice, but she failed to make it. The Nevin Economic Research Institute, NERI, and TASC support this figure conclusively. I cannot conclude without addressing the cuts in the telephone allowance and maternity benefit. I am opposed to both cuts and have tabled amendments to the Bill. I congratulate our pensioners who came out in their thousands on Tuesday.

Many elderly people who live alone in isolated communities use their landlines for their emergency alarm systems. The telephone is crucial to reduce their isolation. The cut is a mean, cruel and unnecessary attack on our elderly. I cannot understand how a Minister from the so-called Labour Party could cut maternity benefit on top of last year's cut. It affects the most vulnerable people, who cannot organise a challenge to her decision. I call on the Minister to reverse the cuts and to consider the 0.5% wealth tax. Taking the €250 million is a choice, but she has already made hers.

I cannot refer to the Bill without mentioning the guillotine. In the Government parties' election manifestoes, they committed to changing the guillotine. Under the programme for Government, they were to tackle the significant overuse of guillotines to ram through legislation. Instead, 64% of Bills have been rammed through the Dáil in this way. So much for curtailing the use of the guillotine except in emergency situations, as promised. The Minister has no mandate to use the guillotine in this situation, but neither has she a mandate to implement the Bill's measures. Remember the 2011 general election and the cries about burning bondholders, not another cent for the banks, Labour's way, not Frankfurt's way, and how Labour would protect the vulnerable? Remember the infamous Tesco advertisement guaranteeing that child benefit would not be touched? All of those promises have been broken in this Bill or in previous budgets. Dishonesty is destroying our political system, its reputation and politicians. It erodes confidence in the integrity of democracy. The responsibility for changing this situation lies with us all, but particularly with Ministers, the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach. Surely, the Minister should make a start by withdrawing this scurrilous legislation, which is an attack on social welfare recipients. It will affect people from the cradle to the grave. I referred to the Tesco advertisement. Child benefit was slashed last year and has been slashed again this year. On 1 January, child benefit payments in respect of the fourth and subsequent children will be cut. This is another broken promise. Core welfare rates for people under 26 years of age are being attacked. John B. Keane wrote a play called "Many Young Men of Twenty Said Goodbye", but he did not know the half of it. Thousands of young men and women have been forced by the deliberate actions of this Government to seek work and lives outside this country. The Bill imposes a significant cut to maternity benefit of up to €32 per week. This is a serious and vicious attack on young mothers. Illness benefit will be cut, in that none will be paid for the first six days. This represents a cut of more than €100 per individual. When one reaches 65 years of age, the invalidity pension that one receives will remain at €193.50 instead of increasing to €230.30. The rent allowance and mortgage interest supplement will either be cut or, in the case of new supplement applications, stopped completely. Older applications will be wiped out over four years.The most despicable and saddest cut of all in this budget is to the bereavement grant. The most dishonest statement from the Minister and her colleagues is that one can go to a community welfare officer at the Department of Social Protection and get it there. The Minister knows she has also cut the exceptional needs payments this year, so there is no hope of getting the grant from community welfare officers. I am absolutely opposed to this Bill.

Working mothers, the elderly, sick people and young people were targeted by measures that have, yet again, not been equality-proofed. We have certainly not been provided with any impact analysis of the cuts that will penalise certain members of our society. To place the burden of austerity on the shoulders of those who were too young to have anything to do with the economic crisis, but who might actually get the country out of the mess it finds itself in, is unjust, short-sighted and foolish. The effective export of our young people is aptly described by a young unemployed woman from Wexford named Lisa. Here are her own words, which I found on a website called "We're Not Leaving":I want to work. Let's get that out of the way first. I desperately want a job. You see, I graduated from college in May and moved home to Wexford — a county as synonymous with suicide and unemployment as potatoes and strawberries. I moved home and I sent out my CV, but nothing... I'm a graduate of TV and media production, which means I have a select group of skills that aren't all that useful to many. A Mickey Mouse degree you might call it, but I have a very good CV. I've won national competitions, a scholarship, and have three highly useful internships kicking about.  About two months ago I made the decision to move to Dublin to seek work in the media industry, with only my jobseeker's allowance to get by, which was then €143 a week. Let me break that down for you: €87.50 for rent, €18 for the Luas, €20 put aside for bills, and that leaves me with €18 for food and recreation. For two months I've been unemployed and seeking work in Dublin. To describe the experience as moving on two timelines is appropriate. On the one hand, nothing's happened, but on the other I've had half a dozen near-misses and near-jobs but I'm still exactly where I started, though arguably poorer and far more lonely in a city of a million people who don't know my name. The harsh realities of job seeking is a slap in the face. It's draining and horrible and makes you feel utterly insignificant. How long can you answer questions about what makes you special before you start to doubt your words or ponder the truth of it? What makes me special? Nothing. I have all the same skills of those thousands of graduates. And I go into these job interviews and I really do try, but now the Government turns around and they issue the biggest "F--- you" to under 25s. I've come to realise that the JobBridge scheme is probably where my future lies, and I thought it was manageable: €194 a week would give me a little breathing space and I could continue to live frugally and put aside €20 a week to pay my bills and it would be okay, but no. The Government has cut JobBridge to €150 for me now. This is a full-time job we're talking about here - 40 hours a week, 9 to 5, at €3.80 an hour. If this wasn't a government scheme, one has to wonder about the legality of it. The minimum wage is just under €9 an hour; JobBridge is less than half that. Realistically, I can't afford to live on €150 for nine months. My money, simply, will run out and I don't have rich relatives or anything of the sort I can rely on. Scambridge, you might call it, because that's what it is. It's cheap labour. The rate for under 25s who sign on from January is €100 a week and the thing that baffles me is that we don't differentiate between those who live at home and those who don't. There was nothing for me in Wexford, so I had to leave. I couldn't live on €100 a week. Add in the cheaper tax on flights, and you have to wonder if maybe there is no disconnect and that the Government sees the situation for what it is. Thousands of us fight for the same jobs. Are we a lost generation? I can't get a job because I don't have the experience, but the leeway in, JobBridge - a scheme that arguably takes up space of positions that would have previously been full-paid actual jobs - is too meagre a wage, so where does that leave me? I don't want to leave but I live in an Ireland that no longer values people like me. Do I have any choice but to go? Lisa from Wexford.

It is a sad day for this country and a sadder day for its citizens when one looks at the measures included in this legislation. Before going into the details of the Bill, it is a bad day for the country when one hears that over 100 children with Down's syndrome were turned down for medical cards in recent weeks. This is a national scandal. It is a disgrace that a child with a recognised disability should be denied a medical card. What the hell is going on in this country? Is this the Minister's new politics? Is this her new Ireland? What about the vulnerable and weak people in this society? Where are the Minister's moral and ethical values? Where is the just society influence in this legislation, given the way in which sick, elderly and disabled people are being treated? These are the fundamental questions which need to be answered. The equality agenda is being ripped up and hammered. Only yesterday, we saw the dormant racism and prejudice that exists in Ireland concerning families and children living here. Would the Garda and the HSE go charging into a white, middle-income family from Dún Laoghaire or Castleknock looking for birth certificates? Would members of the Government do so? They should ask themselves that question. As regards the Bill before us, what about the words "social" and "welfare"? What about the welfare of these children? We need to wake up and not just have wishy-washy statements to the effect that we are not a prejudiced country. Racism is out there and it must be dealt with. Similarly, sectarianism in the North must be dealt with. We must be vigilant and should cop on. I urge the Government and the Minister to wake up to these issues because we are talking about the welfare of citizens.  One in four families with children are one-parent families. Over 500,000 people live in one-parent families. Almost one in five, or 18.3%, live in a one-parent family. There are 215,000 one-parent families, which is 25.8% of all families. Some 87,586 of these are currently in receipt of the one-parent family payment. Those living in one-parent households continually experience the highest rates of deprivation. Almost 56% of individuals from such households have experienced some form of deprivation. We have a lot of discrimination and poverty in this country. As my colleague Deputy Joan Collins mentioned earlier, the Government ran away from a wealth tax. It was given an opportunity to impose a 0.5% wealth tax which would have brought in €250 million. However, it is not trendy in the media or in the Cabinet to tax the wealthy because they are well protected themselves. That is the real agenda which we must speak out about in this regard to this Bill.  The decision to cut the jobseeker's allowance payment for young unemployed people without children aged 22 to 24 to €100 per week - and to €144 per week for those aged 25 - will inevitably cause hardship. In particular, it will cause hardship for young unemployed people in vulnerable families and communities. The Government must ensure that every young unemployed person receives a comprehensive employment and entitlement service. The decision to cut the rate for those aged 25 is particularly harsh as measures designed under the proposed youth guarantee scheme will not apply to them as they fall outside its scope. The Government has attacked elderly, young and disabled people, which is disgraceful. Sadly, the telephone allowance has also been cut. We have a major problem in this society.We have a major problem with this Government. This Bill should be about the social protection of our people and the welfare of our citizens. Sadly, it is not. It is an attack on the young, senior citizens and people with disabilities. Shame, shame, shame. I urge rejection of this Bill.

That is a fact. What we have had from this Government is a lot of talk about jobs with precious little being delivered. One could say this budget, like many of the statements from the Government side, is conjury and trickery in terms of on the one hand giving something and on the other taking something back. This Government is robbing elderly people and vulnerable citizens of their medical card entitlements while throwing them the sop of free GP care for under fives. Nowhere is this conjury more clearly demonstrated than in the context of jobs. The Government tells us that jobs are being created while at the same time glossing over the fact that hundreds of thousands of people have been driven from these shores. It glosses over and manufactures the figures by hiding tens of thousands of people in schemes. It ignores the fact that there is still more than 400,000 people unemployed and presents a budget which provides for the creation of a miserly 34,000 new jobs. Even if that number of jobs were created - the Government claims that number of jobs were created last year - it masks certain trends. During the second quarter of this year youth unemployment and unemployment among women increased, the very groups of people which this Government is targeting in this Bill. This has now become a bit of an ideology. Slashing social welfare benefits does not create jobs. As stated by other Deputies the problem with youth unemployment is not that young people cannot be bothered to work or need to be driven out of the country but that there are no jobs. I would like the Minister, Deputy Burton, to respond to those from her own ranks, the economists in the Nevin Institute, who have said that rather than assist in the creation of jobs budget 2014 will result in the loss of up to 30,000 jobs. It makes sense. Everybody can see it. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, introduced the budget and spoke about economic growth while hiding the fact that the domestic economy has been decimated and has shrunk over the past number of years. Taking from people's pockets by way of necessary social welfare payments will not positively alter that situation. The Minister has been challenged by the trade union movement to produce the research which states that lowering social welfare benefits for young people creates jobs. I have not seen it. I would like the Minister to produce it but I know she cannot because it is a fallacy. It does not exist. This is not about getting people back to work. It is an ideological counter-revolution against the social wage and the welfare state, not this new-found jargon of welfare dependency, which I think the Minister has previously referred to as "lifestyle choices" but a crusade against the welfare state, which was when trade unionists and ordinary people fought a battle for an equal and fair society, wherein the state would act as a distributor so that people could have a basic right to health, education, a roof over their heads, a pension when they retire, food on their tables and affordable sanitary services. The reality is that budget 2014 is the State acting as a distributor of wealth but this time out of the pockets of the lower and middle-income earners and social welfare recipients and into the pockets of the wealthy. We now have one of the most unequal societies in the world. Budget 2014 makes it even more so. That is the view of every organisation which has scrutinised the budget. The reality is that there is no difference between the Tory Party and the Labour Party in Ireland. The Labour Party's targeting of the young people is very much driving their earning, learning and emigration from this country. As stated by my colleague, Deputy Collins, the title "Minister for Social Protection" should be changed to "Minister for Wealth Protection". The Minister has cut more than was demanded by the troika. There have been no cuts to wealth and corporations are not even to be forced to pay the effective rate of taxation. This Government has pauperised the young, targeted the old, sick and vulnerable and stood on its head the ideology of Connolly and Larkin, the party of whom the Minister is a member.

Budget 2014 has brought with it a certain amount of scaremongering and embellishment of the facts by those opposed to it simply because it does not stand up to forensic criticism of the type they would like.

It is important to put on the record of the House the fact that this year's budget has resulted in the protection of all core social welfare payments, ensuring that those who are most vulnerable are protected. I salute the Minister, Deputy Burton, on that achievement. I welcome that, among other measures, there are no new changes to child benefit, the fuel allowance, free travel, free TV licence, electricity and gas allowances and the over 80s allowance. I welcome also that the State pension, carer's allowance and half-rate carer's allowance are all protected. In the context of the bailout, sorting out our national finances and taking our country from bankruptcy to progress, this is an enormous achievement. Savings are made in the Department by getting people back to work rather than cutting rates of payment. One of the failures of the previous Administration was that there was never any real control over the social welfare system. There were no genuine reforms and no effort was made to reduce the number of people on the live register. At that time an unemployed person was treated as unemployed rather than a jobseeker. Since taking office in 2011, the Minister, Deputy Burton, has radically overhauled the system. Live register figures are at their lowest since May 2009 and every day we see real progress being made in this area, to the extent that 3,000 jobs per month are being created in the private sector. Today, we learned that Dairygold is to provide 100 additional jobs in Cork. Recently, Wellman International, which is in my constituency, announced a €5 million investment plan at its plant in Mullagh, County Cavan, ensuring a protected future for the 260 local people employed there. Unemployment can no longer be seen as a long term reality for people in this country. In this context, I welcome the outstanding success of JobBridge from which up to 65% of participants have obtained job placements. I also welcome JobsPlus which offers €300 to an employer who takes on a young person who has been unemployed for six months and €400 per month in respect of a young person who has been unemployed for two years. It is a very exciting programme, as are many of the other initiatives in this area. The correct supports need to be in place to assist people to get back to work, whether this is through additional training or further education. We need to make it as easy as possible for individuals to engage in the process. For this reason, I welcome the introduction of the new one-stop shop for employment services, Intreo.Instead of registering for welfare payments with one agency and then registering at another agency for help with getting employment or further training, everything will now be carried out by the same agency. Some activation measures will include one-to-one meetings and this will provide a complete picture and will enable the person to undertake the right training, which will focus on customised employment supports, client profiling and monitoring of the client's progress. An increased capital allocation of €15 million was provided in the budget for the roll-out of Intreo centres across the country in 2014. In total, €1.8 billion will be spent in 2014 on supports to help jobseekers become job-ready, which is almost €85 million more than the projected spend this year. That is an extraordinary success in the context of where we are at present. Much has been said about the new rate of the jobseeker's allowance for those aged 25 and under, and this is dealt with in sections 9 and 10 of the Bill. It is important to clarify that this new rate is applicable to new entrants only and will increase to the standard rate of €188 when the individual turns 26; our prayer will be that they will not remain unemployed at that time. This will be coupled with a back to education rate of €160 for young people in training, and it is important that the incentive to do that is there. Our young people are our future and that is why I join with the Minister when she said that we have to be more ambitious for our young people. We must not consign them to unemployment and to a life of dependency. We need to minimise the risk of young people, who sign on the live register at 18, becoming welfare dependent. The news that 1,000 places on the Department's Tús scheme are targeted at young people and the ring-fencing of 2,000 additional training places on Momentum for those under 25 are all welcome assurances. However, it is important to note that for many young people, further education and an academic life are not for them. I firmly believe that the youth guarantee scheme will play a central part in ensuring that those young people are supported and encouraged. The construction industry is not what it used to be and the potential for skill-based apprenticeships is minimal. However, we have a responsibility to every young person in this country and we cannot ignore those who are interested in taking up a skill or trade. As it is not possible to get a master for a craftsperson, we will have to provide simulated apprenticeships in training centres at college. Apprentices could work on extensions to schools and on other public works. A young person who cannot get an apprenticeship as a plasterer, block layer or carpenter due to the collapse of the construction industry must get the full apprenticeship training in simulated conditions and in conditions as near to reality as possible. That is crucial. Unlike Germany, we departed too much from the traditional vocational model of schooling in this country, and that gap needs to be bridged. We have the new home renovation scheme and school buildings programme, which I believe should be linked to the apprenticeship scheme as far as is possible in respect of health and safety, insurance issues and so on. I know that the Minister for Education and Skills announced a wide-ranging review of apprenticeships earlier this year in order to examine the future of apprenticeship training in Ireland, focus on work-based learning and ensure a closer alignment of the current needs of the Irish labour market. I echo this by calling for a liaison between local businesses and industries in every county, to establish their current and future personnel needs. If training is to be provided, it is critical that it is relevant to the young person and that the young person has the aptitude and will benefit from it. We should also carry out a survey of our industries in an area on what employment opportunities they currently have, the opportunities they expect to have in the future, and growth areas in which they are involved, and we should try to marry training to that. This is critical and I commend that liaison to the Minister. This Bill is extraordinarily friendly to our elderly, in spite of the cynical scare mongering and populist political nonsense coming from the Opposition. It is a very progressive move that people between the ages of 62 and 65 who are long-term unemployed will be excused from the training option should they so wish. At that stage of their lives, it is a humane and correct response, although if they wish to train then that is a different issue. They will also their directed to their bank account and then they will go into the pension system. That reform in the Bill is good. I welcome the Bill and the very attractive part of it, the job activation dimension. Empowering people in personal development, training and giving them the opportunity to get into the labour market is the critical thing. It was a smug elitist middle class response to leave them there, ignore them and patronise them with welfare payments. Thank God we are moving from that. This is the central plank of the Bill and that is why it merits our applause and welcome.

There are many things I welcome in the Bill. We all have a few concerns as well and I will refer to them later. As Deputy O'Reilly pointed out, the State pension, the carer's allowance, fuel allowance, electricity allowance, free travel and half carer's allowance have not been touched. There was also a lot of fear that child benefit might be reviewed again but I welcome the fact that it has also been protected. I am delighted that free travel has been protected because, as I have also said many times in this House, it is important it is preserved for the people who really deserve it, such as those for whom travel is a lifeline so that their isolation can be reduced. It is very important that it is not abused in any way. I congratulate the Minister on the fraud measures she has brought in over recent years and these measures need to be applied here as well so that we always have free travel for those who need it and it cannot be exploited by anyone who might abuse it. When this country was bankrupted five years ago, it was a daunting task to ensure that these core measures would be protected, and I welcome the fact that this has happened in the budget. The fact that there are 34,000 extra people employed means that there are 34,000 extra taxpayers rather than social welfare recipients. That has enabled the Minister to do a very difficult job in a fair way in this budget. When we look at countries like Greece, where people in similar circumstances have not been protected in any way like here, it shows the fairness and the upfront way that the Minister has met the challenges presented to her. There are a number of areas of concern that I would like to see examined again. There has been much talk in recent days about medical cards. We all met this in our constituencies, but I am reassured by guarantees that people who need medical cards will get them. Some genuine applications in recent weeks and months have been handled badly within the system and there is no point in trying to say anything else. It is important that this is addressed, but the fact remains that an additional 250,000 medical cards have been provided by this Government since coming into office, 74,000 of them discretionary medical cards, resulting in more than 1,868,000 people having full medical cards.Those are not figures of a Government taking medical cards from people. Discretionary medical cards are awarded to people who are unable without undue hardship to arrange GP services for themselves and their family, even though their means exceed the HSE's income limits. In these cases, social and medical issues are taken into account when considering whether undue hardship exists for the applicant. One issue on medical cards needs to be reconsidered. The income limit for a couple aged over 70 is €900 and €500 for a single person. I believe the limit should be €1,000 for a couple. If current employment trends continue as we all hope they will, there will be a natural decrease in the need for medical cards. If an extra 34,000 are working this year and they were not working last year, it is safe to assume that a proportion of them would be delighted that they no longer need a medical card and will be able to meet their medical needs from their own resources because of their new-found job and salary. There has been much comment about the ending of the bereavement grant which I understand was not claimed by some people who did not know it was available. Again the full facts did not emerge in this regard. It was important to preserve the payment of the State pension or other social welfare payments for six weeks following a person's death, as was done. If there are individual difficulties, families will have recourse to seek assistance with the cost of the funeral under an exceptional needs grant. Again the most vulnerable people are being protected by a grant, in this case of up to €2,000 for a funeral, if individual circumstances warrant it. There is also a once-off payment of €6,000 where there is a dependent child. It is important to give all of the facts. The removal of the telephone allowance for landline rental has caused upset and concern, particularly in rural areas. It is accepted that this was money that was going directly to telephone companies. The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, needs to work with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, on alert schemes and pendant alarms. It is important that people do not lose communication thereby feeling isolated and living in fear. We need to set up a system to protect those who may have been affected by this provision. I have noted that 34,000 extra people are working this year compared with last year. I welcome that 1,200 new teachers are to be appointed in the next year and that Garda recruitment will recommence. We have heard of the 3,000 people a month. It is obvious from the straws in the wind and those announcements that there will be an increase in employment. This will mean people will move away from social welfare dependency and become taxpayers and contributors, which will ease the decisions that need to be made in future budgets. It is important we keep on that pathway in coming weeks and months. The Government has had to take many difficult decisions on social protection in the past three years. Some 250,000 people lost their jobs between 2008 and 2011. The Government had to face that issue at a time when the cupboard was bare and the country was bankrupt. It has met that challenge in an upfront way as shown again in this budget. I hope it will take into account the concerns I have expressed. A few things need to be tweaked and some assurances need to be given. Overall a good job has been done. It is important for us to protect the vulnerable and elderly. Much has been talked about the youth guarantee and the importance of providing jobs, training and so on. It is important those are delivered on in coming months and years in order that we not only get out of the bailout but make life better for all, young and old. We need to have fewer people unemployed and more people in employment.

I have listened to the contributions from the Minister and other Members opposite. A number of things have been said about the protection of income and of basic rates in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. The income of the elderly has been cut substantially over the past two years and it has also happened this year. On the cut to the telephone line rental allowance, the line that has been given out is that the technology has moved on somewhat and the number of people depending on landlines has decreased considerably as they move on to mobile phones. That is fine for those living in urban areas with full mobile phone coverage, but people in isolated rural places have been screaming to get mobile phone coverage in recent years. Owing to the geography of parts of my constituency and elsewhere, on this day last year some people had difficulty getting access to Saorview to get television coverage. A huge amount of money was expended to ensure television signals were beamed into them. Many elderly people are living on their own, possibly because their families have moved into cities and towns. The local provincial newspapers constantly report on rural crime and recommend that we should be more vigilant and watch out for our elderly neighbours. One elderly gentleman came to my clinic on Monday morning with a bill for almost €500 for the particular phone-based security system he selected. A cut to the phone allowance is unacceptable. It would be better to state the facts, which are that this is a simple and straightforward cut in their income. We need to ensure the truth is being told. Another area of concern is the cut in the bereavement grant. As Deputies, we often deal with people who are bereaved, as there is considerable paperwork when a spouse or other family member dies. Throughout the country and particularly in rural areas people put aside some money to ensure their funerals are paid for.When they leave this world, they want to go out with dignity and without any debt left after them. Everyone would have factored in this. Many people say the social welfare system is too generous. One could argue that in some limited cases the system is too generous but in this case the person concerned would have paid PRSI all his life. It is a contribution scheme and the stamps and contributions are paid and then the relatives claim for the benefit at the time of death. This is a retrograde step. It is something that people would have factored in. People are concerned about it and they are coming to us as a result. Quite rightly, people would have factored this in. These people would have been lifelong savers with credit unions and would have factored in what is available at the end in addition to the State grant. Many people come to all Deputies to help them with their affairs immediately after a bereavement in the family. Now we have to explain that it has been cut although they may argue that they have contributed. In the overall context there is an attitude to the effect that the social welfare system is too broad and generous and people are spinning that attitude. There is a notion that people are on the system but that they should not be on the system. I maintain that 95% of the people on social welfare, especially on the jobseeker's allowance or benefit, want to get back to work. The last place they want to be is on the live register. If they were able to get a decent job they would. The notion or perception that they are better off on social welfare because of the benefits does not make sense. If we do the sums on the financial side, they simply do not add up. By and large, people on social welfare are on the lowest rung of the ladder and are simply trying to make ends meet. On the human or personal side, they are far better off working. This is where the Tús initiative and the rural social scheme, which helps people with farm assist payments, come in. These have been of great benefit especially in rural communities. The schemes have been administered by the Leader companies throughout the country and they have given remarkable benefits. I have seen a vast number of people who have benefited from these schemes but the people who have benefited most, particularly in rural Ireland, are farmers' wives or spouses, those who would have stayed at home to look after the families. Then, when the families were reared they were at a loose end and then they began to reintegrate into the workforce. They have a remarkable amount to contribute. They have run a household on a shoestring and probably a farm budget as well for many years and they have done very well for the family as a result. Now these people tend to go back into the workforce, especially under the rural social scheme, because it gives more years. The Tús scheme has great potential and was brought in by Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív, who was the Minister responsible at the time. I have seen people who have been out of the workforce for several years through no fault of their own and people who have been in difficult family circumstances and unable to get into the workforce for a raft of reasons, whether bereavement or illness and so on. These people go back on the schemes and integrate into the society and there is great potential there in respect of the Tús scheme and the rural social scheme. On the other side, let us consider the fact that the means test for farm and fish assist payments are being cut and what is allowable or otherwise on those schemes has been cut further. This makes it more difficult for farmers or their spouses with small holdings or a low-income to access these schemes. It is penny-pinching and it is a matter of the Minister cutting off her nose to spite her face because it will not deliver any long-term savings to the State. The position of people will be further eroded or they will be moved out of society rather than integrated into society through the rural social scheme or the Tús scheme. There has been a spin or a perception circulated during the week from the media and other circles to the effect that the elderly have been recession-proofed. They have not been recession-proofed because their cost of living has increased dramatically and their income is the same as in recent years. Furthermore, as they get older they encounter considerable expenses. There have been comments on local radio and elsewhere relating to prescription charges. If we tot up every 50 cent added, every €1 cut here or there or every €1 taken off the telephone allowance, it is directly and absolutely taking from their incomes. These people have worked remarkably hard all their lives. By and large, the elderly of the country are dependent on the State pension. No one had vast amounts of money during their lives such that they were able to save for retirement. They are dependent on the State pension and on the household package and the State benefits that follow. There is a view that by cutting one or chipping away at this or that we are not attacking their core income but no one is codded by that. The Government is taking these benefits from them and making it more difficult for them to live. I have a major issue with the changes to the entitlements of the elderly and death grants in the Bill. Recently, I spoke with the Minister. All the schemes should be expanded more to encourage more people into employment.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	198	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill. I realise the time for the debate is short and it will be concluded tomorrow. I will run through some of the headlines in the Bill. Then we will ask ourselves why we are doing this and perhaps discuss some of the specifics in more detail. What we are doing today is increasing the number of waiting days for which people will be eligible for illness benefit to save €22 million. We want to cut €30 million from women on maternity benefit and people getting adoptive benefit. We want to take €17 million from people by eliminating the bereavement grant. We want to take €32 million off young people by cutting the jobseeker's allowance. We want to take €42 million from people through abolishing the telephone allowance. We want to take €5 million from people through the reduction in the supplementary welfare allowances for persons between 22 and 25 years. We want to save the €12 million by abolishing the mortgage interest supplement for all new applicants and by winding down the scheme for those who are in receipt of it already. We want to cut €5 million from those in receipt of the invalidity pension at age 65 years. We want to claim €21 million from people in respect of compensation awards. All of this adds up to a great deal of money. The question we should be asking ourselves is why we are doing that. We all know there is a financial difficulty in the country although I hope we are successfully working our way out of it at this stage. However, there is a reason we have this level of cuts, including €290 million in the Department of Social Protection. I am disappointed the Minister is not in the House to hear me say this because, to some extent, I have sympathy personally for her. The Minister has been let down by her senior party colleagues in government. The Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, and the Minister's party leader have let down the Minister for Social Protection by forcing this level of cuts. They came in and threatened her with €400 million of cuts and then they settled on €290 million and the Minister thinks she has achieved something but, in truth, she knows in her heart the reality is otherwise. The Minister, Deputy Howlin, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Eamon Gilmore, forced her to cut €290 million from people in receipt of social welfare payments. These are probably the 20% of households in Ireland with the lowest level of income. The simple question that I imagine the Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, would be asking is how much are we taking from the 20% of households in the country with the highest income in this budget. The answer is: not a tosser. Those on the highest incomes in the country, the best off 20% who could pay a little more, are not being asked to contribute anything in this budget, while those among the 20% with the lowest income are being asked to contribute €290 million by way of cuts to their payments. When I consider the overall shape of the budget, this is where the situation has gone awry. Last week, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, announced his expenditure adjustments would be €1.6 billion but the taxation measures would only amount to €0.9 billion. Consequently, two thirds of the €2.5 billion adjustments being made in this budget are falling on those who rely on State services. Moreover, out of that €1.6 billion, cuts of €1 billion will be taken from health and social protection. In other words, the cuts are affecting the lowest-paid people, as well as those who rely on the health services, while simultaneously not increasing taxes. The majority of the additional €0.9 billion is a result of extra money coming from the property tax. However, everyone who will experience cuts in social welfare payments arising from today's measures, including the elderly and those in receipt of disability allowance or invalidity pension or the figures I have just mentioned, will also be obliged to pay double the amount of property tax next year, as they will be paying for the entire year. While this is also the case for the better off, this will affect those who are experiencing cuts on foot of the legislation under discussion today. Not only are they experiencing cuts but will be obliged to paying property tax for the full year, which constitutes a further cut on them. The Minister of State opposite will smile at this but it raises the basic question as to what the Labour Party is doing in government when year in, year out, its members come into this Chamber only to implement a Fine Gael agenda. More power to Fine Gael, as it has its mandate to be the largest party, but the Government is implementing a Fine Gael agenda. The Labour Party members of the Economic Management Council, namely, the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, concede year in, year out that two thirds of the adjustments should take place on the expenditure side, which fall proportionately-----

Fine Gael is doing what it does, that is its nature and it is in its DNA to look after the better off and to force the cuts on the lowest-paid people. Essentially, this is the reason Members are discussing these cuts today. As for the cut in jobseekers allowance for young people with a consequential saving of €32 million, my colleague highlighted that the Department of Social Protection is now advertising jobs in Canada, Australia and New Zealand, which is an extraordinary development. However, in the case of young people in Ireland whose allowances are being cut by €44 per week, from €188 to €144 or from €144 to €100, this represents a loss of €2,288 per annum from a young person. That is a phenomenal cut to ask anyone to accept. Not only is the Government doing that but it is doing it to people it is encouraging into the workplace through the JobBridge intern programme. At present, they get €50 as a top-up on their payment but any young person who is on that programme at present and is in his or her early 20s will suffer that cut of €44 per week. The Government had been encouraging them to go out to work by stating that depending on their age, they would receive €144 per week plus an additional €50 top-up but now it is taking €44 per week from them. It is no wonder the Government is advertising jobs in Canada, New Zealand and Australia when this is how it treats young people at home. The cutting of the bereavement grant has been covered well by my colleagues. All I have to say is it is a lousy thing to do to families at a time of loss. The savings will amount to €17 million and I expect that approximately 20,000 families will suffer a bereavement this year who will be unable to get this grant, to which they would have been accustomed in previous years. In respect of the maternity benefit cut, I like the wording that was used. This is a cut of €32 per week or €832 in total for a woman on maternity leave, which will affect approximately 45,000 women this year and which comes on top of the recently-introduced taxing of maternity benefit. However, the Government has used the new word "standardisation" to describe it even though it actually is a cut of €32 per week for those affected. On the abolition of mortgage interest supplement for a saving of €12 million, I will not rehearse the argument. I am aware the Minister does not like to pay out that payment at all. It is the only cash payment by the State to people in financial difficulties or who have trouble with their mortgages and the Government is abolishing it. What else are the banks to do except to follow the Government's lead? When banks see the Government cutting the only cash payment it makes to people in mortgage arrears, it is a cue for the banks to follow likewise and to try to put people out of their houses. The changes in respect of illness benefit represent an additional cost to many small employers, as they now will be obliged to pay it for an additional three days, even though the Government has claimed this was a pro-business budget. When I consider the position in respect of job activation, I agree with the philosophy that a person who loses his or her job should go to the relevant jobs office or whatever it is called to sign on for work and ascertain what is available, after which the payment will be processed, as opposed to the traditional method in which one went in to collect one's money and six months later, might get an offer of a job in Canada. That is the reverse way of doing it and no one can claim that a situation in which there is only one staff member for every 800 people in receipt of jobseeker's allowance is a real method of trying to encourage people into work. The telephone allowance has been highlighted by my colleagues. However, the Government is not simply taking this away from all pensioners and everyone over 66 years of age. I stress again that all these people will also be obliged to pay a full year's property tax next year, which will be double what they paid in 2013. The Government also is cutting the telephone allowance for people who are under 66 years of age who are in receipt of disability allowance. I could understand it if the Government thought there was a means test for elderly people, in a similar manner to what is being done in respect of the medical card, although I might not agree with the figures the Government picked. However, the Government has made a budget proposal seeking to cut the telephone allowance for people in receipt of disability allowance, for those in receipt of invalidity pension and from everyone in receipt of the blind pension, as well as those in receipt of disablement payments. That is an horrific thing to do and it comes back to the basic reason, which is that there is an excessive number of cuts in the budget and an insufficient demand of those who could afford to pay a little more to so do.

In a budget adjustment of greater than €2.5 billion, it is clear that for a spending Department such as the Department of Social Protection, which has an annual expenditure of approximately €20 billion, the idea it would remain untouched is ridiculous. It was always going to face a significant cut in the budget and while that was necessary, it was not and is not pleasant. There is no getting away from this and I have listened to Members opposite speaking ad nauseam about how we found ourselves in this position and who repeatedly have stated that default should have been the option. At a time when the State is borrowing almost €1 billion per month simply to pay the day-to-day bills, the reality would have been an overnight reduction in Government expenditure of between 40% and 50%. That would have condemned the most vulnerable in society to penury. Both social welfare clients and middle income earners would have been taking to the refuse bins simply to survive. However, this has not been mentioned at all. Members opposite also have spoken about figures and I listened to the previous speaker, Deputy Fleming, speaking about cuts to this figure and reductions in respect of this or that scheme and overall, he mentioned about eight or ten of them. I will provide two figures for Deputy Fleming's consideration concerning the personnel, payroll and related systems, PPARS, project in which €160 million was lost from the Exchequer and e-voting, in which a further €60 million was lost to the Exchequer. Taken together, these two items alone would have dealt with this budget adjustment for social protection. Moreover, this does not take into account the €7 billion the Members opposite squandered and wasted in Government mismanagement over a ten-year period. The present Government is dealing with that and while the Opposition can talk about how this is a crisis born out of the collapse in Lehman Brothers or a crisis born out of a world financial catastrophe, this was a crisis born out of complete incompetence in the State. Members opposite mention budget cuts in schemes that have been targeted. As I stated, they are unpleasant but they are necessary. I have concerns, chief among which is a trend I have noticed in respect of budget reductions and announcements in recent years, which is that they have taken place against those who have contributed under the benefits scheme. The jobseeker's benefit and the bereavement grant are schemes to which people would have contributed but in the case of the former, it has been reduced in duration from 15 months to nine months. Similarly, the bereavement grant is another benefit scheme.Even though reform is taking place there are still areas where further reform is not only desirable, but essential. While the social protection offices have combined with FÁS or the new service SOLAS and the community welfare service has combined with the Intreo service, the pace of reform is appallingly slow. In many cases progress is held up because many of these offices had questionable long-term contractual lease arrangements with developers dating back to the period between 1997 and 2007 or later from which they cannot move on. If we wanted to provide these services in a one-stop shop, particularly in rural areas where the services are dispersed, that could not be done. The ideal provision would be to have an arrangement whereby a person who has lost his or her job would go to an Intreo office and the first point of contact would be a Department of Social Protection official. The person would then be quickly moved on in the same office to the next booth and would meet an official who is knowledgeable about the services provided by FÁS or SOLAS and job activation initiatives In that way the person on his or her first contact with a departmental office would have a route back to a possible job that matches his or her skills. There is a major unemployment problem in rural Ireland and those engaged in the construction industry took a massive hit in my constituency of Cork South-West. Despite the hysterics we have heard, there are still people in rural areas who worked in the construction sector who are looking for work and some of the measures in the budget will greatly assist them. I know of people who, having lost their jobs in the construction sector, went to a departmental office to participate in job activation initiatives and who were matched with positions that defied logic. They were given opportunities in the hi-tech IT sector. Unfortunately, the officials concerned simply engaged in a box-ticking exercise. That mentality is changing but it is not changing fast enough. A debate on the efficient use of personal public service, PPS, numbers has been ongoing and I cannot understand the reason that issue has not been resolved by now. Why are PPS numbers not used more efficiently in all Departments? There is still a major lack of communication among Departments with regard to them. There was the case of the chid the HSE had concerns about in recent days where the child had to be handed back. That type of issue should not arise in this information age when every Department has an IT section but those sections only speak in-house, as it were, and do not communicate with each other. PPS numbers are not being used to counter fraud. Those numbers are not used by the franchise section of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government for voting purposes. We are all familiar with looking at a register of electors and picking out the people who have died in the past three or four years. That type of thing happens across Departments and we will see similar examples of that with regard to medical cards and GPs' offices. There should greater scope for accessing information through PPS numbers. I propose that further reforms should include a one-stop-shop for means assessments. I cannot figure out the reason that separate means testing assessments are carried out by the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health, the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments that award means tested payments or grants and by the local authorities. A significant portion of every Department's expenditure, budget and resources goes into a complex detailed wasteful exercise of means assessment when a one-stop-shop should be in place resourced with people who have an expertise in this area. Each Department has different criteria, thresholds, limits and vagaries with regard to means testing but all means assessments should be done through a one-stop-shop. Fundamental savings would be achieved if such a unit providing such shared services could be established as soon as possible. I spoke to a man this morning who comes from north County Dublin who told me that he works two days of the weekend in a bar. He is a casual claimant and claims for the remaining four days. He told me he has no intention of taking up work that has been offered to him on several occasions in that trade unless he is guaranteed a pay rate of €12 an hour. He is a bright guy and has done the sums. The only way it will pay him and allow him earn more than simply breaking even is if he gets €12 an hour. How is the Department going to deal with situations such as that? Five years ago one could possibly have walked into a job that paid more than €12 an hour but that day is gone. If one does not have a skill or a profession one will only get a job that pays the minimum wage rate or a little more and one will have to work up one's pay, but that message is being lost or is not being communicated. That point was not mentioned and people cannot see the wood for the trees. We see it happen in every town and constituency where people make decisions like that man and one cannot blame them. These are not statistics, these are people who have families who want to protect their incomes. They want to do the best for their children and they genuinely want to work but they are trapped. It is only human nature for them to make such decisions There are many issues that need to be further teased out. I broadly welcome the debate. It is unpleasant to take €226 million from this budget but I congratulate the Minister on achieving something that was difficult but had to be fair and had to be seen to be fair. Anybody who says anything different belies the fact that we have a very progressive social protection system and taxation system, which should not be forgotten.

Since the economic crisis more and more people have had to avail of this service. By the close of this year, the Government will have spent €20.3 billion on social welfare. This accounts for nearly 40% of total Government expenditure. Thus, we can ill afford inefficiencies and inequalities in the system. I therefore welcome the provisions of section 11 which seeks to further combat social welfare payment fraud. Social welfare fraud demands serious attention. The majority of the people availing of social welfare have been victims of the circumstances of our economy and would prefer to be engaged in the workforce. However, in some cases there are people who are less willing to engage and are even taking advantage of the system through fraudulent actions. This provision also takes measures to assure taxpayers, who are funding this system, that this service is fair and providing to those most in need. I also welcome the new arrangements for older jobseekers. It is only fair that people aged 62 and over, who have greatly contributed to society and are equipped with great life experience, would not be penalised for not engaging in training or other supports required of younger jobseekers.  I am a strong advocate of healthy eating and tackling childhood obesity. I welcome the provision of funding for 100 new school breakfast clubs. This is clear evidence that the Government is investing in the health and educational performance of future generations. I recognise that tough decisions have had to be made in budget 2014, cuts with which many are not satisfied, and I sympathise. However, the Bill attempts to strike a balance between reaching the savings necessary while not negatively impacting on the social welfare and pension recipient. This Bill plays an active role in encouraging people to explore various education, training and job opportunities, particularly young people. As a former principal, I know parents want to see their children sufficiently educated and equipped as best as possible with the relevant work skills.The Bill reduces an early reliance on jobseeker's welfare and instead encourages job and education initiatives. I therefore welcome the reduction of the JobsPlus eligibility threshold in terms of the duration of unemployment from 12 to six months. That will lead to 1,500 additional recruits under the scheme in 2014. The Department of Education and Skills has also committed to ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 additional training places for those under 25. Those training places will help facilitate young people's transition onto the work ladder. I recommend the Minister increases communication with the public on the outcomes of this Bill. I have been contacted by a number of constituents who are confused or unsure about the way the different provisions in the Bill will affect them and their families. Those fears can be alleviated by better and clearer communication. I am hopeful the Bill will ensure a more effective and efficient social welfare service that can protect those most in need.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	208	Earlier this week I was criticised on social media for tabling a parliamentary question on social welfare policy and spending. I was slightly puzzled as I found it difficult to understand why people felt it was inappropriate that I would table a question on how €20 billion, or 40%, of our State spending is allocated. I firmly believe that a Deputy who is disinterested in the way State money is being spent is failing in his or her duty to his or her constituents and also to taxpayers. In any debate on social protection it is important to ask the purpose of it and what we are trying to achieve. Social protection represents a helping hand. It is a support for a person in need experiencing a difficult time. It is a positive influence in our society and is the very definition of solidarity - a promise that the State will intervene in cases where people must overcome challenges and traumatic events. Those are not ideals shared in all countries throughout the world but they should be in any democracy. Social welfare, however, is not something that should support the minority of capable citizens who choose not to work. That is particularly true at a time of great stress and constraints on our State finances, when every euro counts more than ever before and there is an added obligation to ensure those most in need are supported. We must always be mindful of those who are unable to work due to illness or disability. Despite significant economic pressures the Government has been able to protect core social welfare rates in budget 2014 including the State pension, the invalidity pension, illness benefit and the disability allowance, the survivor's pension and carer's benefit and allowances. That is in addition to protecting pupil-teacher class ratios, student grant levels, the €1.3 billion budget for special needs and learning resource education, the weekly fuel allowance, and announcing the provision of free general practitioner, GP, care for every child under the age of six. Free travel has been protected as well. These are real and concrete measures that reflect the Government's commitment to tackling poverty and protecting the most vulnerable in our society, as agreed by the two parties in the programme for Government. The Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, is Minister for Social Protection at the most challenging time in the history of the State. No other Minister has faced such immense challenges, problems and issues. The Minister must be commended on effectively managing the Department and overseeing the continued payment and support of well over 1 million of our citizens. That is happening only a few short years after a time when it was not certain the State would have the finance and wherewithal to provide weekly payments. This is also the Minister who introduced the one-stop-shop for jobseekers, known as the Intreo service, something that was talked about for decades but which the Minister and this Government have been able to do. That allows one-to-one tailored assistance which will better meet the needs of the young and the not so young. The flip side of social welfare is getting people back to work. Increasing the number of jobs means a decrease in the number of people requiring social assistance. Job creation is the number one priority of Government. We have experienced 15 consecutive months of increased employment with an extra 34,000 jobs being created in the past 12 months, 4,200 of those in the west. The success of existing measures can be seen in the 7.5% fall in unemployment figures for Galway last month. Nationally, the live register has fallen below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009. There is quite a distance to go but budget 2014 builds on this success with a range of measures that are pro-jobs and pro-local business. I was particularly pleased, and it relates to this area although not confined to this Bill, about the decision on maintaining the 9% VAT rate for the tourism sector, which was particularly important, the abolition of the air travel tax, the welcome announcement in Shannon this morning of the additional flights, and the €8 million to be invested in the Wild Atlantic Way. These are all measures that will get people back to work. We must continue to work hard to ensure our efforts at assisting social welfare claimants as well as the efforts at reform are focused on assisting genuine, honest citizens. A job is central to a person's self-development and self-worth. It is vital we create the best conditions possible to ensure as many people as possible can find employment, and the social welfare system plays a huge part in that. Before the budget I met a number of groups, including, in my area, the Knocknacarra Community Active Retirement Group and the Moycullen Active Retirement Association in my village. At that pre-budget meeting in Moycullen, they raised four main issues about which they were concerned. One was that the State pension would be protected and maintained, another was the free travel scheme, the third was the household benefits package, and the fourth was medical cards. I was confident enough at that meeting to be clear in my view that the State pension and the free travel would be protected. I was not as clear, and that has come to be true, about the household benefits package. It is regrettable that cuts have had to be imposed but, as I explained, the choices are quite limited. On the medical cards, it is not an issue for this Bill but we must have much clearer communication from the Health Service Executive, particularly to the elderly, on what is allowed and the changes that have taken place to ensure they are not scared by letters that are somewhat threatening or difficult to follow. The language should be couched in a more caring way. I commend the Minister and support the Bill.

Is deas é an tAire a fheiceáil chomh maith. In last week's budget the Minister introduced a range of austerity cuts and tax measures that are a direct attack on low and middle income households and which will hurt the elderly, the sick and the very young. She is attacking citizens from the cradle to the grave as she demolishes the most basic social protections, and this Social Welfare and Pensions Bill is the cutting edge of that assault. The previous Teachta Dála who spoke said he needed a little clarity. I will give him some clarity. This legislation extends waiting time for illness benefit from three to six days, makes swingeing cuts to maternity benefit, cuts adoption benefit, scraps the bereavement grant, slashes young people's jobseeker's allowance, cuts young people's supplementary welfare allowance, phases out mortgage interest supplement, gives broad discretionary powers to pension trustees, and cuts the invalidity payment level for 65 year olds. I do not know what further clarity the Deputy is seeking, and we have been given only nine hours to debate this Bill. When the Labour Party went into Government with Fine Gael, it said it was doing so to blunt the worst excesses of that party. Not only has the Labour Party failed miserably to do that in respect of this Bill, it has not even secured a reasonable amount of time for a Dáil debate on the issue. That will probably not surprise the Deputy. Labour Deputies are not exactly queuing up to actively support his leadership's austerity policies. This budget is also a repeat of the previous two, and we are going down deeper as people's social protections are actively demolished and vandalised. Last year's Social Welfare and Pensions Bill saw a cut to child benefit which the Minister in opposition so eloquently defended two years earlier when Fianna Fáil was prepared to cut it. In the December 2009 budget she described child benefit as keeping bread on the table and keeping many families afloat. Clearly, she did not believe that or did not mean it. We have also had Labour's commitment to oppose water charges and its promise to burden share with bondholders - the famous "It's Labour's way or Frankfurt's way". On the property tax, in opposition Deputy Eamon Gilmore stated: "We have to remember that many people have already paid a family home tax on their residential home in the form of stamp duty". We got one version in opposition and a very different version in government. This year, households will bear the brunt of a full property tax bill. As for the Taoiseach, he says he is for political reform and greater transparency and accountability.Only last week he promised a pre-legislative stage and less use of the guillotine but this Bill will be rammed through. The Deputies from the Government benches, including those who want greater clarity, will be like voting fodder rolled out to vote on the Government's position. It is an insult to the intelligence of those citizens who will be affected by this Bill. It shows that this Government has no respect whatsoever for the Dáil or the citizens.  Millions of euro will be cut in income supports for young unemployed people. The Aire Stáit, Deputy McGinley, coming from Donegal, must know the number of people who are out of this State - people who have left this island because they cannot live here. He must understand how parents see the future. They will not see their grandchildren, other than on Skype. Their sons and daughters are playing Gaelic games in Brisbane, Birmingham or Boston. The cuts to the jobseeker's allowance for young people and to the supplementary welfare allowance are clearly intended as an incentive to emigrate. In the past four years, first under Fianna Fáil and now under Fine Gael and the Labour Party, 300,000, mainly young people, have emigrated. I still cannot get my head around that figure. Some 1,700 are leaving every week. Everywhere I travel, especially in rural Ireland, I hear distressing stories about families which have been sundered by the blight and scale of emigration, which is unparalleled in modern times and which is doing huge damage to society, communities, in particular rural communities, although not exclusively, and to families. It is a shameful indictment of this Government and of successive governments that citizens have no expectation that they can be born, grow up, live, work, prosper and grow old in the land of their birth. That is a scandal. There is complete indifference to the devastation this Bill and other taxation measures and cuts contained in the budget will have on the elderly, the young, the sick and the unemployed. The changes to the provision of medical cards are a disgrace. These are vindictive measures which will affect, in particular, older citizens who have contributed so much to the State during their working lives and who are worried. I attended the demonstration the other day. People are outraged at the reduction in the over 70s medical card and at the ending of the bereavement grant. The Minister of State is bound to have constituents who want the security of knowing somebody will not be burdened when they die but the Government has taken that from them. The axing of the telephone allowance will result in increased social isolation. The buttons used for security will not work unless there is a landline.  There has also been an increase in prescription charges. The Minister, Deputy Reilly, when in opposition, told us he would not increase prescription charges but would get rid of them. However, he has increased them twice. There is devastation and continuing low morale and the game of politics - the profession of politics - is continuously being brought into disrepute.  What do the Labour Party Ministers say to this? They say lots of things during an election campaign. What can I say about the Taoiseach? When Fianna Fáil introduced these measures, the Taoiseach attacked them. Five years ago in this Dáil and sitting on this side of the Chamber, the Taoiseach said: "To take away your rights to have a medical card beyond the age of 70 years – I reject it! The cheek of them. Shame on them". What has changed? If it is shameful for Fianna Fáil to attempt to do this, is it not shameful for this Government to do so? What is the difference?
Cad é an difear idir Fianna Fáil agus Fine Gael? Cad é an difear idir Páirtí an Lucht Oibre, Fine Gael agus Fianna Fáil. Níl difear ar bith eatarthu. Níl dabht ar bith nach bhfuil difear ar bith eatarthu. The programme for Government states that the Government is committed to completing and implementing the national positive ageing strategy so that older people are recognised, supported and enabled to live independent full lives. The programme for Government also states, "We will support older people in living in their own homes and communities for as long as they wish and will facilitate this by ensuring that the eligibility criteria for the home helps and the Home Care Package Scheme are applied consistently". How do these commitments stand up now that the Government has cut home help hours and services, cut nursing home provision, scrapped the telephone allowance and cut medical cards and invalidity payments? All of this very actively undermines the ability of older citizens to live independent lives. Fine Gael has a narrow ideological economic view which is to the right of the Tea Party in the USA but what is worse is that this is being done under a Labour Party Minister. James Connolly would turn in his grave. My colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh, and others will bring forward amendments. I have little hope that the Government will listen to, or take on board, the constructive suggestions we make. I appeal to Government Deputies to be men and women, to stand up for what they were elected to do, to recognise the great harm this Bill will do and to vote against it at every opportunity today and tomorrow.

My party colleagues will speak about the impact of it, which I did last week, but I would like us to think about the process used to prepare and present it, which was very clever. Myles McEntee, when covering the Fine Gael conference in Limerick for a Sunday newspaper, said the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, were like the Blackadder and Baldrick of Irish politics and that they had a clever plan. The clever plan was in the preparation and presentation of the budget. The preparation was statements and leaks to scare people witless in the weeks coming up to the budget. As we got a little closer to the budget and, in particular, at the conference in Limerick, the talk was that it would not be so bad and that people would like what they saw in it. We then had the presentation on budget day which highlighted the very few positives and masked the negatives in the detail. That probably would have worked for the last Government because the Opposition did not perform as it should have done. However, on budget day, when the Ministers highlighted the positives and masked the negatives, we had good people who drilled down into the detail which exposed the full horror of this budget and the impact it would have on the people. The positive body language of the Ministers when they walked into the Chamber changed within two or three hours because they knew the cat was out of the bag in regard to the budget and that the public would understand very quickly the impact it would have on their day-to-day lives and the lives of their families.  The response to our analysis is certainly not to debate it but generally consists of saying Sinn Féin wants the Government and the country to fail. How ludicrous can one get to say Sinn Féin wants the Government and the country to fail? Why would anyone want to perpetuate the suffering the good people of this country are going through? Talk about inability to debate and cheap political posturing. When that does not work, the Government looks at what is happening in the Six Counties. It is a pity successive governments did not have the same concern for people in the Six Counties this Government professes to have now when it fears engaging in proper debate.So much for intelligent debate. This regressive Bill, like the budget that preceded it, will lead to further plundering of poor people and middle income earners. It will hurt children, families, the elderly, the ill and people with disabilities. It offers no vision and no hope. It contains no decency. Why were the salaries of people like us not reduced? Why were we not hit? Why are we not hurting as much as fathers, mothers and young jobseekers out there? This budget will not have the same impact on us as it will on unemployed people. We should be taking a greater hit than the unemployed. This Government will not touch us. In particular, the Government will not attempt to take any more money from the wealthy people of this nation. The previous Government's policies of cutting, slashing and deporting are being continued. When I was at a public meeting in Carrick-on-Shannon a few months ago, I was asked a profound question by a person in the audience. Why and how have we come to a stage where the people of Ireland who elect the Government fear that Government rather than respect it? I think all of us should ask ourselves that question. The solution is in the answer. We need to get back to doing the decent thing and the right thing. In its pre-budget submission, Sinn Féin-----

Everybody is struggling today. That is no secret. This recession has hit everyone hard and deep. One legacy of good and bad times has been overcrowded classrooms. I have often lamented the day that we missed the opportunity to address this issue during the Celtic tiger era when governments dealt with budgetary surpluses of billions and billions of euro. I commend the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, the Ministers of State at the Department of Education and Skills, Deputies Cannon and Sherlock, and the Department for maintaining class sizes during this difficult time when we have been forced to borrow between €10 billion and €20 billion every year. I want to raise an issue about a school in west Cork, Castlehaven national school. In that school there are 39 students in the junior and senior infant classes. Several of those students have special learning needs and the teacher is also acting principal of a four-teacher school. That would be my idea of a horrendous, impossible job. To her credit, the teacher does it extremely well, as the parents of the pupils inform me. It has been suggested to the school that JobBridge might be an option. When I examined the JobBridge scheme I realised that the board of management has informed the parents that it is not an option because of the opposition of the INTO which has instructed its members not to allow JobBridge workers into the school. JobBridge would solve the problem in Castlehaven. The board of management could pay €50 a week and take on a fully-trained graduate teacher who could in turn gain some valuable teaching experience. That teacher would also be able to complete the training which requires doing 30 or 40 weeks of the teaching diploma in the primary school classroom in order to receive the full qualification. Unfortunately, many teachers who apply for jobs now are automatically thrown off the list because they do not have their teaching qualification for want of teaching experience. One school in my constituency recently received 138 applications for a maternity leave vacancy last month. Principals will of course eliminate anybody who is not qualified, or who does not have the teaching experience. I am aware of numerous principals and boards of management who would love to have people from JobBridge come into the school to assist where classrooms are overcrowded and so gain the experience that is deemed necessary. I have raised the issue informally and have written formally to the INTO asking it to review its opposition to this issue. As a former member of the INTO, I understand how unions work, and can appreciate its position. Combined strength, however, is not always in the best interests of everybody. This is an example of how that combined strength works against some people's best interests. To oppose the JobBridge proposal is not in the best interests of the students who are in classrooms of over 30, as the INTO highlighted in a recent survey, nor is it in the interests of the hundreds of teachers who have graduated from colleges in Ireland over the past decade and who cannot get teaching positions or complete their formal qualification because they cannot get into the classroom. JobBridge offers a straightforward way to deal with that issue. One could argue that the victims of this stance could portray opposition to the JobBridge scheme as an attitude of "I'm alright Jack, close the door after me". I do not think that is true in many cases but those who oppose it could stand accused of that attitude. I urge the Government to work pro-actively, to engage positively with the union and ask it, and particularly its executive, to show some leadership in dealing with this issue so that, at the very least, it would give a commitment to providing some derogation from doling out punishment to teachers who co-operate with the JobBridge scheme and who allow graduate teachers into their schools to gain experience. There are hundreds of teachers who are more than happy to do this. This scheme does not affect or give rise to displacement. There is no displacement whatsoever as a result of the JobBridge scheme.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	215	I acknowledge that the various budget measures that have taken place in recent years can limit the employment opportunities for newly qualified teachers. Although there are limits to the number of teaching posts that we can afford to fund as a country, I am pleased to say that in the recent budget, the Government laid a strong emphasis on protecting the education sector, as the Deputy has acknowledged. It is estimated that an additional 1,400 teachers will be recruited in primary and post-primary schools in 2014. This will include providing more teachers to meet rising pupil numbers as well as additional resource teachers for children with special educational needs. This will create significant additional employment opportunities for teachers and help address some of the issues raised. In addition, a number of measures have been taken in recent years to alleviate difficulties for new teachers, the cohort about which the Deputy spoke. My Department has directed managerial authorities of schools to recruit unemployed teachers ahead of retired ones. In addition, the Department of Social Protection's JobBridge national internship scheme provides newly qualified teachers with opportunities to gain experience and to undertake the necessary teaching duties to complete the process of probation.Circular 46/2011 issued by this Department makes the scheme available to schools and education and training boards and sets out necessary rules to be followed where an intern is employed by a school. These rules are designed to give schools access to extra resources as well as providing valuable experience to the interns that allows them to undergo the probation process. Figures from the Department of Social Protection indicate a total of 58 internships have been described as being "teaching positions" since its commencement in 2011. I agree wholeheartedly with Deputy Jim Daly when he stresses that allowing this to happen within the school environment is a win-win situation for everyone. It is a win for the young people in the school, the teaching staff who can have newly qualified teachers on campus working closely with them to develop their skills and the newly qualified teachers gaining access to that probation opportunity when it might not otherwise be available to them in these very difficult times.

We are very fortunate because he is in a class of fewer than 30 students. When I look at parents who see their children starting out in school in classes of 39 in junior and senior infants where a number of those students have learning difficulties, it is nothing short of wrong. We must be more proactive in assisting these schools. We know the ratio is one to 28 but it does not always work out that way with enrolments. This school is a case in point. I am appealing to the Minister of State in the Department to take on board cases like that of Castlehaven national school. I appreciate the Minister of State may not be able to produce a fully qualified teacher this year, and I believe the Minister will make efforts to do that next year. I would ask that, at the very least, help be given to a qualified teacher who would love to get the experience, is waiting in the wings and wants to go into the school but cannot do so because the board of management has said that the INTO is opposed to this. I appeal to the Minister to use his good offices and those of the Department to appeal to the INTO at the very least to give an undertaking not to punish any teacher who allows another teacher to come into the school to get the experience they need. I appreciate the decision was taken at the conference and it probably cannot row back on it for a few months until April 2014. In this case, a teaching principal is in the classroom but there many cases similar to Castlehaven around the country. It is not holding Castlehaven back very much. It was the county finalist in County Cork for two years running. Its achievements are massive. I will use this opportunity to congratulate the Castlehaven team on being the Cork county senior football champions again this year. I am glad to add that Deputy Martin's Nemo Rangers were the victims this time. On a serious note, this is a school and community that deserve the breaks as do many schools and communities throughout the land. I hope the Minister of State will pledge here that he and the Minister will make contact with the union to address this issue.

As Deputy Jim Daly pointed out, no displacement would occur in the context of having these JobBridge teachers in schools across the country. In the context of 1,400 new teachers being appointed next year, I think the INTO would and should draw the conclusion that we are very serious about enhancing opportunities for newly qualified teachers and indeed minimising the worst effects of the harsh winds of recession on the education sector as best we can. The Minister and I will ask the INTO to take a more lenient view of teachers who engage in the process and who would actively allow a JobBridge intern to be recruited to their schools between now and its next conference where it will, hopefully, have the opportunity to overturn this decision.

I think the Minister will agree with all of us that this is an unbelievably appalling scenario that has played out in front of our eyes in the past number of days. In the short amount of time allotted to me, I wish to make two main points. The first relates to the independence of the inquiry that needs to take place and what happens to the report when it is given to the Ombudsman for Children. Will it be published and will we be able to dig deep into the reasons this was allowed to happen? I am willing to accept the bona fides of the gardaí and the HSE to a certain extent. I hope the Minister will agree with me that what is really at the core of this episode and circus is a pure, raw, naked and poisonous racism that lies at the heart of Irish society. This goes across the political system and into journalism, the gardaí and the HSE. We are willing to believe the worst of some of the communities that live in this land, most notably the Roma and Traveller communities. There are journalists and politicians who will not be involved in these investigations and will probably not appear in whatever report is produced on this situation who have significant questions to answer about the climate of fear and the undermining and dehumanising of communities that is taking place day in, day out in daily newspapers and our television screens that makes people in this country believe the worst of the Roma and Traveller communities and many other communities in this State. I will read out a line from a journalist from the Irish Independent who wrote a scurrilous piece about the Roma community recently. I must apologise for my language. The journalist discussed an encounter with a member of the Roma community. The article included the line "cue the usual bullshit you get from the Roma any time you challenge them – lots of spitting and evil-eye finger pointing". The article went on to state that:But if we allow the Roma, or the indigenous junkies, to completely sap our native instinct to dip into our pocket when we see someone who is in a bad way then we won't just have lost one of the better aspects of our nature. We shall have given it away.

That said, the only conclusion that can be drawn from the evidence presented is that racial profiling occurred and these children were taken from their parents for one reason only - they were Roma and did not look like their parents. I sincerely believe that if they had been the adopted Vietnamese children of white parents, there is no way this would have happened. Both the Minister on the radio this morning and the Tánaiste have attempted to downplay the seriousness of what has happened here on the basis of the failure of the State to act in previous cases of concern regarding child welfare. It is clear that the State did fail previously and in other instances behaved in an over-the-top manner but the reality is that procedures have been put in place to deal with precisely these scenarios. In this case, the procedures were not followed. All the procedures say that the children should remain with their parents except in very exceptional circumstances but in this case, the last resort became the first option. This has been and will be deeply traumatic for the children and parents involved. An Irish pensioner who tearfully contacted my office this morning had been taken into care decades ago and still lives with that trauma. Will the Minister give an unreserved apology to the families at the heart of this debacle? Will he commit to an independent investigation into what happened? Can he comment on the coincidence that his Department has been criticised by the EU for its lack of progress on Roma and Traveller integration? Is it not in some way culpable?Is there a case to answer about the media frenzy and irresponsible journalism that took place? It has been clear for some time that elements in the Garda at senior level are feeding their pet poodles in the media. Will the Minister investigate this and take action in that regard? Finally and critically, is he aware that information on the records of Traveller children, some of whom are as young as 16 days old, are being input and updated on the PULSE system and what is he going to do about that type of racial profiling?

In particular, the incidents have had a terrible impact on two vulnerable children. However, we cannot forget the backdrop to this situation. In the past decade, more than 500 children have disappeared from HSE accommodation, some of whom were traced to brothels. Six out of seven of those children were never traced and are still missing. The trafficking of children for labour and sexual exploitation goes on around us. It is modern day slavery. The traffickers are now turning to Irish children. A recent report from the US State Department noted that Ireland is a destination, source and transit country for women, men and children subjected to sex trafficking and forced labour. It went on to point out that the number of identified Irish children subjected to sex trafficking within this country has increased. No words can adequately describe the horror of trafficking children for sexual exploitation or labour but it is happening around us in this country. I hope the controversy that has arisen will be thoroughly investigated and that the reports will be published but this should not divert us from the need to identify and prosecute traffickers, and to put them out of business.

It is especially disturbing to all in these Houses who have long campaigned for children's rights and protections, and who invested considerable time and effort in realising a child protection system that is fit for purpose and in which we can all have confidence. What happened in these cases is a far cry from what we expect from the State's child services. Against a backdrop of what can only be described as despicable newspaper coverage, children were taken from their homes in what appears to be a naked and blunt case of racial profiling. Under the Child Care Act 1991, gardaí must have reasonable grounds for believing there is an immediate and serious risk to the child. On the basis of the information we have at present, this does not appear to be the case. If such a risk did exist, surely all of the children would have been removed from these families not just those with blonde hair and blue eyes. The speed of the intervention in these cases stands in marked contrast to the response times in many others, as highlighted last week by the Ombudsman for Children. What were the reasonable grounds to believe that the children in these cases were at risk or in danger? Why were only the children whose physical appearance was difference from that of their parents removed from their family homes? Could the required tests not have been carried out without taking the children from their homes and parents? It is not appropriate for the HSE and the Garda to be investigating themselves on such an important matter. We should not be waiting for their reports before the Ombudsman for Children takes direct responsibility for investigating these incidents. An independent inquiry from the outset is the best way to get the answers and the Ombudsman, Emily Logan, should be engaged with immediate effect.

It is even more traumatic when there is no reasonable or sufficient grounds for doing so. These incidents have been accompanied by a frenzy. However, I am of the view that the authorities probably did act in good faith and we cannot go into a frenzy in the other direction by putting the boot into the authorities. The newspaper commentary that Deputy Ó Ríordáin mentioned is shameful and the journalist who wrote it and the editor who permitted it to be published should be ashamed of themselves. It is a matter that should be investigated by the Press Council. I ask the Minister why the Ombudsman for Children or the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission will not be conducting an investigation in the first instance. The area of children being taken into care is a dark one in that we have limited information about it. Can the Minister furnish us with statistics on the children taken into care under section 12 of the Child Care 1991? There is merit to holding these cases in camera but perhaps the Minister will consider the matter further because I am concerned that the in camera rule shields the authorities as opposed to protecting the identity of children. That was probably not the intention but the authorities are not open to examination. Where is the cross-over between the responsibilities of the Ministers for Justice and Equality, Children and Youth Affairs and Health in respect of implementing the Child Care Act?
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	This debacle was caused by a disproportionate and unreasonable reaction on the part of the Garda and the HSE, which clearly demonstrated a lack of professionalism and an overly simplistic response to a media frenzy, to which their officials should be immune as law enforcement and health professionals. The emergency power granted to the Garda under section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 should only be used in exceptional circumstances where a garda reasonably believes that an immediate and serious risk is posed to the health or welfare of a child. It does not appear that such an emergency applied in these cases. I am getting sick of gardaí relying on tabloid journalism for their intelligence and the manner in which information is supplied leaves much to be desired. In this instance, the Garda made decisions about child welfare based on tabloid journalism, ethnic categorisation and an unrelated case in Greece instead of rationally considering the independent evidence and the principles of reasonableness and proportionality. As law enforcement professionals they should be immune to media frenzy. The family in the Tallaght case had been living in that area for seven years and they had extensive contact with the Garda but it was only when the story about the Greece case appeared in the newspapers that an emergency operation was put in place to remove the child. As Dr. Carol Coulter pointed out last night, if the Garda was really motivated by the child's welfare rather than racial prejudice, why were the child's four siblings left behind? The Minister's response to Garda misconduct has again been weak, similar to the penalty points controversy. Is he scared of gardaí? Do they have something on him? He has again ordered an internal review and his friend, the Garda Commissioner, has appointed another commissioner to investigate internally the force's malpractice and misconduct rather than a human rights expert with experience in racial issues. This is contrary to the type of independent review called for by Pavee Point and the Irish Traveller Movement. An independent public inquiry is required instead of the HSE and the Garda reviewing themselves. An internal review by gardaí of the conduct of gardaí is not going to be impartial and will not meet constitutional standards of fairness. We need to accept the fact that the Garda is not outside the law and no law enforcement force anywhere in the world should be allowed to self-regulate. It is disappointing that the Minister does not intend to publish these reports. It is another example of the lack of transparency and accountability in the Garda. I do not understand why the Minister is so unwilling to hold the force to account.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	I thank the Deputies for raising a very important issue. There has, of course, been understandable public interest in two cases which have come to light in recent days involving children with Roma families. As I have stated already, we are all pleased and relieved that the concerns that arose on the part of the authorities in these two cases have proved to be unfounded and that the children have been reunited with their families, where they belong. I am, as we all are, particularly conscious of the regrettable distress that arose for the two families and their children. I want to state again, quite clearly, that no fault of any nature attaches to the two families concerned. It is important that we all remember the context in which these cases have arisen, where concerns have been expressed by members of the public in regard to the protection of individual children. Child protection is a most complex and sensitive issue and I am sure Deputies will appreciate that it would not be appropriate for me to comment on the detail of individual child protection cases and that I cannot depart from that practice simply because of the particular circumstances of the cases under discussion. That being said, I think it important that I make a number of points. An Garda Síochána and the HSE have to deal with very difficult situations and have to make very difficult decisions when dealing with issues of child protection. They can be open to criticism for either doing something or criticism for doing nothing. We are all aware of cases in the past where the authorities have been criticised for not intervening to protect children at risk. In each of these cases, the authorities responded in good faith to concerns expressed to them. The law provides clear powers for An Garda Síochána and the HSE where it is believed that a child may be in danger. The courts are also involved in making the appropriate decisions. Urgent procedures are available, and indeed necessary, to ensure that the safety of a child can be assured while appropriate inquiries are being made. Such actions by the authorities are inevitably distressing for parents. However, the Garda and the HSE are faced with the reality that not invoking the procedures could involve taking a risk with the safety of a child. This is the difficult and complex reality these front-line staff face when they have to make such decisions based on the information they have at that time. In each of these cases, the gardaí responded in good faith to concerns reported to them. I am conscious that the events under discussion took place against a backdrop of events which took place outside this State. In seeking to ensure that the welfare of children is fully and properly safeguarded and that every child in this State is afforded, where necessary, the protection of the State, it is of vital importance that no group or minority community is singled out for unwarranted attention or, indeed, suspicion in regard to child protection issues. Neither is it in any way acceptable that families or individuals are in any way treated differently because of their ethnic backgrounds or religious faiths. Neither can or should be a factor in determining when child care intervention is required. It is regrettable that, in the context of calling for an independent inquiry, a number of the contributors to this debate have already reached conclusions. The conclusions they have reached are that there was racism involved and that the Garda is involved in racial profiling. One cannot call for an independent inquiry and, at the same time, reach conclusions and give the reasons for why events have occurred. Let me be absolutely clear in this - I would regard racial profiling as utterly unacceptable. Indeed, I have spent a substantial period of time as Minister for Justice and Equality in dealing with the issue of racism across Europe. We made it a particular issue during the Irish Presidency. It is of substantial importance that gardaí only intervene pursuant to section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 where there are reasonable grounds for believing that there are immediate risks to the safely and welfare of a child. It is important to ascertain what lessons can be learned from these cases. That is why I have requested the Commissioner of An Garda Síochána to provide me with a full report on the background circumstances that led to each of these children being taken into care and the procedures that were followed. My colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, has similarly asked for a full report from the HSE. This is not about, as Deputy Wallace wishes to allege, the Garda or the HSE investigating itself. This is what is known as good practice. One asks the two bodies to provide, within a short period of time, a detailed report on what has occurred, and then one refers it to an independent individual to take what steps are required. The House will be aware that the Ombudsman for Children has the function of promoting the rights and welfare of children. The legislation specifies that this function includes monitoring and reviewing generally the operation of legislation concerning matters that relate to the rights and welfare of children. In addition, the Ombudsman may be requested to give advice to Ministers on any matter. Against this background, we propose to provide the Ombudsman with the reports prepared by the Health Service Executive and An Garda Síochána and ask her to examine what occurred. She will independently - I emphasise independently - carry out this function and be free to raise any question of relevance with regard to the events that occurred and also to engage with the parents of the children who were temporarily taken into care. I have already had preliminary discussions with the Ombudsman for Children and I understand she has been contacted by the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald's Department. I have been assured by the Garda authorities that they will, of course, co-operate fully with any inquiry she wishes to make and will respond fully to any inquiry that she may make. I have no doubt that this will be the case in relation to the HSE as well.

Deputy Timmins raised the issue of in camera proceedings. There are amendments made to the Courts Act that went through the House before the end of July that will ensure that we have greater transparency when there are child care cases before our courts. That transparency will provide protection still for the anonymity of individuals and the anonymity of children in the best interests of children. A further issue that I am concerned about that Deputies have raised-----

That is a matter that will be the subject of the inquiry that is being made. It will be a matter, I have no doubt, that the Ombudsman for Children will address. We must ensure that when intervention is taken in any child care matter in the best interests of children, the anonymity of the child and of the family is preserved in the best interests of children while also in the future having maximum transparency with regard to court proceedings so that there is a full public understanding of the manner in which our courts deal with this matter. I will perhaps come back to one or two questions I did not have time to deal with in my further response.

This is why it is so crucial that we get this investigation right. If we want the Roma community, the Traveller community or any disadvantaged or marginalised community to feel as if it belongs in this Republic, its members must see transparency and accountability. They must believe in the system and there must be a level of independence. If we get this wrong, I fear for the future of this country and the potential integration of the Roma community in this Republic. If it is happening to Roma today, it will happen to someone else tomorrow. I plead with the Minister. We could be at a crossroads in our relations with the Roma community and many other communities that live in this Republic. If they do not believe in the State's institutions and if those institutions let them down this time, we will regret it in the years to come and we will deserve all that we get.

He did the same when he stated as fact that the Garda had acted in good faith. We do not know that yet. The Minister has again attempted to minimise the situation. He will not get away with it. He is using people's legitimate concerns about child safety to undermine and mask the seriousness of what has happened, which can only be explained by racism. I say this because the clearly defined procedure for dealing with child welfare issues was not followed. The HSE was not invoked and a court hearing did not take place before the children were removed. The only evidence that we have heard is that the child did not look like the parents. The Minister recognises that the media has a role in this matter. I will ask him two simple questions. Gardaí leaking information to the media has become a staple diet. It is a criminal activity.

It is imperative that we get answers to those issues. I will echo the comments made by Deputy Timmins.The background to this is the trafficking of children. We know that our laws need to be modernised concerning the exploitation and trafficking of children. Some 13 years ago, Ireland signed the Protocol on the Sale of Children, Child Prostitution and Child Pornography, but when will we ratify it? This particular incident highlights the need for the proper training and resourcing of An Garda Síochána. Will such training be provided to gardaí to enable them to identify vulnerable children and trafficked children, thus ensuring we can secure prosecutions?

The Ombudsman for Children is an appropriate office whose expertise and focus could be directed on this matter with immediate effect. Let us not cod ourselves. The Garda Síochána and the HSE will carry out their own internal inquiries in any case. Why should we delay? It would inject a greater urgency into both the HSE and Garda Síochána's efforts to explore in full and internally what has happened in these cases. I appeal to the Minister to follow up on the contacts with the Office of the Ombudsman for Children to initiate her immediate inquiry into this matter. That is what is required given the seriousness of what has taken place. I hope that her remit will go beyond that of investigating the role of the Garda Síochána and the HSE, to include the serious matter of the media's disposition concerning such sections of our wider community in this country today. In this regard, some of what is currently presented as journalism is reprehensible. I hope the critical questions that we have put on the record will be answered. These concern the issues of reasonable grounds, why the other children were not taken into care, and whether the tests could not have been carried out without removing the children from their homes.

On many occasions with which we are familiar, various State authorities have acted unethically and unlawfully. It would be slightly hypocritical of us on this side of the House if we were to castigate the bad treatment of both families in this situation by equally castigating the authorities that dealt with them. I work on the premise that the authorities of this State operate in good faith until such time as I am shown otherwise. That does not mean, however, that they should not be open to scrutiny and examination. It is important we have confidence in this State's authorities which, by and large, operate in a correct manner. These two cases have come to light but have similar cases occurred in recent years? If that information is available, I would like the Minister to provide it. I would like to know if something similar has happened whereby other children have been taken into care without a basis for doing so.

The children's Ombudsman will only be reviewing a biased report, which is not primary evidence, and she cannot ask questions. This is entirely unsatisfactory. The Minister and his PR machine are attempting to impart a sheen of legitimacy to this flawed approach by asking for the children's Ombudsman's stamp of approval on another internal review. Likewise, the Minister is not publishing the terms of reference. It would appear again that the focus of the review is narrow. It is just wide enough to satisfy the public, but not enough to cause any real change within the culture of the Garda Síochána. I am sure the Minister is well aware that in February 2013, the report of the European Commission against Racism and Intolerance found that the Garda Síochána engages in racial profiling. The commission called on the Irish Government to introduce legislation to prohibit racial profiling. This is an opportunity for the State and the Garda Síochána to initiate a Stephen Lawrence type of inquiry and to assess the conduct, codes and protocols of the Garda Síochána. In his book on human rights and policing, Professor Dermot Walsh states that we cannot say whether Garda codes, practices and procedures are human rights compliant because these codes and protocols are not published. Professor Walsh said there is a need for cultural change, transparency, accountability to the public and human rights compliance in the Garda Síochána. Is the Minister brave enough, and does he have the courage, to bring this about?

The Deputies cannot make up their minds if they want to protect children or just attack An Garda Síochána. This is a serious area of children protection. Section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991 provides an important instrument to ensure that where children are at immediate risk, the Garda can intervene. On occasions when intervention takes place, not all the information is known. The reason we have a courts system is so that once there has been an intervention, matters can be addressed in the Children's Court and issues can be properly clarified. In the context of these two cases, I am making no prejudgments, as the Deputies are.

I am not going to ask the children's Ombudsman to exercise independent oversight, look into this matter independently, and jump to conclusions before she does so. It is a gross misrepresentation, but it suits the Deputy's narrative, to suggest that gardaí are being asked to investigate themselves and that, as Deputy Wallace put it, the children's Ombudsman is being asked to rubber-stamp that investigation. The Garda is being asked, as the HSE is being asked by my colleague, the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Fitzgerald, to provide a full and detailed report on the background of what occurred. These reports will be given to the Ombudsman for Children who will be free to ask any questions of any nature that are relevant to what has occurred and to report and make recommendations. That is the correct and appropriate way to go. Is anyone in this House suggesting the Ombudsman for Children will do anything other than act independently, appropriately and in a manner on which we can rely? I will deal with other issues quickly. I am conscious of Deputy Naughten's interest in these areas, but he has said twice in this House that the background to these matters is the trafficking of children. The trafficking of children is an issue about which I have had a great concern for a long time. As Minister I have been doing whatever I can to address that area. We cannot assume, however, that the background to these cases had anything to do with the trafficking of children. In fairness to the two families, no one has suggested that they are in any way trafficking children. I ask people to be careful of the language they are using. I presume that was not the Deputy's intent.

There are many cases in which the Garda, in consultation with the HSE, intervenes to protect children. Deputy Timmins asked for statistics. I can provide data on the use of section 12 of the Child Care Act 1991. In 2010, there were 728 instances of it being utilised to protect children at immediate risk. In 2011, the figure was 751, in 2012, it was 764, and to date in 2013, it has been 582. Deputy Ó Caoláin and the Tánaiste are right that in these two particular cases there are questions to be answered. This is why we are travelling this route. As Minister, I have questions that I want answered.

If there is a report of a child at risk and they do not intervene and something goes wrong the Garda are criticised. Equally, if there is a report of a child at risk and they do intervene and it proves to be the case that the report was inaccurate the Garda are criticised. It is important we deal with this in a considered and temperate way. I look forward to the Ombudsman for Children engaging on this matter, raising each and every question of relevance and, ultimately, publicly reporting.

#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for the opportunity of raising this important issue. I welcome that the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, is here to hear my concerns. EJ Cavanaghs in Birr was a well known employer for many decades. It was a family owned iron foundry business which manufactured manhole covers and drainage grates for the construction industry. In 2000, it was taken over by an American company called EJ and is now known as EJ Ireland Access Solutions Limited. It is also a family owned business and has taken an inclusive approach in ensuring that the company grew and developed. Sadly, when it began to lose money owing to the decline in the construction industry it took the difficult decision to enter into consultation with 32 of its workers with a view to downsizing the operation. The 32 people concerned are young skilled workers, many of whom have young families. Having met on Monday last with management I know how difficult this decision was for them and the owners. I sympathise with the road they have to go down over the next couple of weeks. I accept this decision cannot be reversed. We are all aware of the decline in the construction industry over the past number years and the knock-on effect this has had on other areas. I am anxious to ensure that every effort is made by the Government and its agencies to assist the company and, should the result of the consultation process be redundancy, the redundant workers. It now appears this may well be the case. These people should be provided with the advice and training required to help them re-enter the workforce. The people concerned are hard workers who know the benefits of work to them, their families, their communities and the local economy. Thirty-two jobs may not be a lot to people living in built up urban areas. However, 32 jobs in a small community is equivalent to 300 jobs in a larger area. The knock-on effect of these job losses will be significant. The midlands region has many small and medium enterprises skilled in manufacturing and engineering. While I welcome the positive benefits of the efforts of Government in terms of job creation during the past couple of years, the jobs secured have in the main been in built-up and satellite areas in the larger cities like Limerick, Cork and Dublin. There is a need for a regional enterprise strategy to provide the regional counties with the opportunities they deserve. The unemployment rate in Offaly is higher than average and it has the second lowest disposable income in the country. We have moved to decision-making based on evidence. There is evidence to suggest that action is urgently required in Offaly. Offaly is also home to the highest percentage of workers in the industrial sector. Again, this points to the fact that urgent action will be needed. I am anxious to hear what IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland are doing for Offaly. Tullamore is a gateway town and Birr, which is not too far from Tullamore, has good connectivity and accessibility to all of the major motorways. It is also located in the centre of the country. I would welcome concentrated and urgent attention being given to the preparation of a regional enterprise plan so that Offaly and other regional counties experiencing decline will get their fair crack of the whip and the jobs they so badly need as a result of the downturn.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14932	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	256	I thank Deputy Corcoran Kennedy for raising this issue. I share her concern in relation to the jobs being lost at EJ Ireland Access Solutions Limited, formerly EJ Cavanaghs. IDA Ireland notified the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation on 21 October that EJ Ireland Access Solutions Limited is currently engaged with workers regarding a restructuring proposal, which will result in the loss of 32 jobs. The company currently employs 51 people. The company has been impacted by the collapse of the constructionsector within Ireland, which was its primary market. The company will retain 18 staff at the Birr plant to deal primarily with sales, marketing, distribution and steel fabrication. It has had to review its business structures due to the collapse of construction activity in the Irish market. Ireland was its primary market when its sales peaked in 2008. Exports at that time accounted for less than 5%. However, at year end 2012, company exports accounted for 30% of its revenue. More and more companies are engaging in this type of restructuring, with companies looking strategically at opportunities in the global market and taking steps, unfortunately, such as making people redundant, in order to position themselves for future growth.  The proposed redundancies in Birr are part of adjustments the company is making to meet the evolving needs of the business and to remain competitive in a challenging global environment. IDA Ireland will remain in ongoing contact with the company. Owing to the downturn, all businesses face competitiveness issues, including the manufacturing and services sector. It is clear that, arising from greater globalisation, reduction of tariff barriers and the ease of transporting goods, the nature of industry and the location of specialisations will be changing. The Government's action plan for jobs
is a key part of the process. We are endeavouring to create the right environment for additional job creation. While employment levels in the manufacturing sector have fallen, in common with every other industrialised country in Europe, we still have 205,000 people directly employed in manufacturing and, when account is taken of indirect employment, this means about 400,000 people depend on manufacturing for a livelihood in Ireland. Last year, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, initiated two research projects, one by Forfás entitled
Making it Happen - Manufacturing 2020
and the other by the expert group on future skills entitled, The Future Skills Needs of the Manufacturing Sector to 2020. Both of these reports complement each other and will assist Government in reaching the target of creating an additional 20,000 jobs in manufacturing by 2016. The private sector has created 3,000 jobs per month over recent times and we hope to build on this positive trend. IDA Ireland is continuing its efforts to attract FDI to this area and the midlands region. There are currently 11 IDA supported companies operating in County Offaly. In 2012, there were nine IDA site visits to the midlands region and three visits to County Offaly. The Deputy will appreciate that while the IDA makes strenuous efforts to attract multinational companies to specific regions, the ultimate decisions on whether to visit and subsequently locate are matters for the companies concerned. In 2012, Enterprise Ireland had 79 client companies in County Offaly, employing over 2,600 people in full time jobs and 56 client companies in North Tipperary, employing over 2,100 people in full time jobs. Enterprise Ireland paid over €1 million to its client companies in County Offaly in 2012 and has paid over €750,000 to date in 2013. The corresponding figures for North Tipperary were over €2.7 million in 2012 and over €500,000 to date in 2013. In terms of new initiatives for job creation in counties Offaly and north Tipperary, Enterprise Ireland activity is focused on the creation of new jobs through continuing to work with established companies in its portfolio. Enterprise Ireland is part of a local inter-agency committee which is developing a new promotional and information portal for Tipperary, www.Tipperary.com.In addition, Offaly County Enterprise Board and Tipperary North County Enterprise Board have taken a proactive approach, together with a range of services and supports for people considering self-employment. These services are of course available to any EJ employee considering self-employment. I do not wish to provide political platitudes. I do not know the company or the people personally. Deputy Corcoran Kennedy knows these people; they are her own people. We sympathise with them on the loss of these jobs and we will do everything through our State agencies to try to replenish them with the supports that are available.

It is heartening to hear about the efforts being made by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland in Offaly and in the wider region. I am very interested in the pieces of research that are being conducted. I look forward to hearing what the manufacturing development forum identify as the skills that are needed for businesses in the future, because that will be critical in developing new training for people, and to encourage people into the type of courses at third level that will be required. I welcome this and I urge that the skills needs are identified as soon as possible. The good news in all of this is that staff are being retained at the company in Birr. They will be working in the sales, marketing, distribution and steel fabrication sectors of the company. I hope the agencies there to support will help them examine what aspect of the steel fabrication business could be developed further to help grow that side of the business and to create further jobs where they are so badly needed. I would also like to refer the Minister of State to the two other fantastic areas available for people to come and create employment, namely, the Birr Technology Centre and the Shannon Development sites, given that Shannon Development is now under the auspices of the Shannon Airport Authority. I am keen to find out what are the plans for that. Who will now be responsible for those sites, the fantastic facilities of which can be used to attract business or support local people to create businesses? It is a shame to see so much public money gone into development of these sites, particularly the Birr Technology Centre, if it is allowed to lie vacant when it could be used productively.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	14932	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	258	I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy. It is important to note that 18 jobs are still being retained and it is surviving as an entity. One hopes that it will grow over time and that the lost jobs could be clawed back. I also note the point that the Deputy makes on the other technology centres that are available. If the Deputy contacts the local agencies and Department officials about those sites, I am sure there will be a positive engagement on their potential in that region. I acknowledge fully that these are job losses. They are going from 51 employees down to 18, which is a significant number. I understand the Deputy's point on the impact in a more rural setting than in a larger urban conurbation. If we are to have any meaningful role on renewing the manufacturing industry in this country, then it must be on the basis of balanced regional development. However, when companies decide to go to a particular region, it is ultimately a company decision. We all acknowledge in this House that a corporate decision has been made and we can only set out what is available on the ground for these companies, but they are the ultimate deciders of where they locate. However, I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy.
#BarryCowen	unknown-#BarryCowen-party	unknown-#BarryCowen-dob	unknown-#BarryCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	Fianna Fáil has serious concerns about the proposed sale of two ESB plants in Lough Ree and west Offaly. I, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy and others in the region received an e-mail yesterday from the ESB asking that we meet with their representatives. The e-mail stated that we were to be briefed on an imminent announcement affecting our constituency. I was intrigued and expected that this would be a positive development; however, this was not the case. I was informed that as part of the Government's directive to State and semi-State bodies, the ESB was not only selling international assets in Spain and the United Kingdom, but was also proposing to sell ESB power plants in west Offaly and Lough Ree, namely, Shannonbridge in Offaly and Lanesboro in Longford. My initial reaction was one of shock because this House has never acquiesced to demands to debate the McCarthy report and its contents or recommendations. It was only by asking questions of the Government that the House received assurances on what was off the table or out of the portfolio of assets to be sold. My immediate concern was obviously Bord na Móna, the ESB and Coillte. My county of Offaly, my constituency and the midlands region are synonymous with power generation and energy production. The sector has been challenged over the years as peat stocks were depleted and new forms of energy and tapering of fossils continued at pace. However, such change, diversification and commercial realities were met head on by the workforce, management, the then Government and political representatives of all hues. Such innovation, initiative and leadership under Fianna Fáil led to the creation of Lough Ree Power, West Offaly Power and Edenderry Power, each with the support of Bord na Móna contracts and a PSO in conjunction with EU guidelines and directives, ensuring the future of power generation in the midlands for at least 25 years from inception. That inception, in the case of Lanesboro and Shannonbridge, began in 2005 and 2006, respectively. That 25 year guarantee began in 2005 and 2006. It is now 2013, just seven and eight years later. The Minister for Expenditure and Public Reform, Deputy Howlin, told the Dáil in May 2013 that "with regard to the ESB, there will be no sale of any power generating capacity in the Republic of Ireland, or the island of Ireland''. That commitment does not fall into the category of "Isn't that what you do in elections? or commitments made on the back of lorries in Roscommon, or outside this House to people aged over 70. That commitment was given here, and I would have thought there would have been more respect for the House. I can understand the disrespect for commitments made on lorries in Roscommon and outside the gates of Leinster House. Be that as it may, and despite the fact that the credibility of the Minister and his Government is left severely dented by this, I now wish to ask the Minister some severe and honest questions. Can he assure the workers in respect of their contracts of employment? What happens now to their ESB pensions? If the ownership of these power plants is to be transferred, how can their pensions be transferred? Will they be defined benefit pensions or defined contribution pensions? Please let our community know what the future of the most important industry in our area will be. What will be done to ensure that employment in our area is maintained? What will be done to secure the future of energy production in Offaly and beyond? Has the Government considered a scenario where Bord na Móna would take over these plants? Would that not be a shot in the arm that the company needs? Would that not add to the sort of diversification in the energy sector that is necessary, which the Minister mentioned today when he opened a wind farm in Laois? It will allow for a competitive market which will give the consumer cheaper access to electricity. That is the commitment our region requires. That is the commitment that will allow Bord na Móna develop further and allow our region continue to be the leader in power generation in this country.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	I am grateful to Deputy Cowen for allowing me to answer this question. The credibility of the Government is very high in his constituency. I have just returned from there having announced measures to bring additional employment to various parts of the midlands, including in the Deputy's constituency. When he talks about the commitments given to Lanesborough and Shannonbridge in 2005 and that it is now 2013, he forgets that 2008 intervened. The year 2008 will go down as a milestone in the country's economic history and to quote Yeats, "All changed, changed utterly". Arising from the commitment in the bailout agreement between the then Government and the troika in 2010 and following months of negotiation between the troika and the new Government, in February 2012 the Government announced its intention to consider a range of disposal options across the State sector to achieve a goal of realising proceeds of up to €3 billion. The Government indicated in July 2012 that a sale of the energy business of Bord Gáis Éireann and some of the ESB's non-strategic generation capacity would be part of the asset disposal programme. The Government subsequently formally requested the ESB in October 2012 to develop a programme for the sale of its non-strategic generation capacity, with the objective of delivering special dividends to the Government, targeted at up to €400 million by the end of 2014. Leaving the ESB power stations issue aside for the moment, it is important that the parameters for this issue be set out. If the original intention to raise €5 billion from the disposal of State assets had stood, it would inevitably have given rise to pressure to privatise the ESB. I am glad for a variety of reasons in the national interest that the ESB will be retained in State ownership as a vertically-integrated utility. The ESB as a State-owned energy company has made a major contribution to Irish economic and social development. Notwithstanding growing competition in the generation and supply business, which I welcome, the ESB has been a commercial success over the years and particularly in recent years. I am referring to the assets in Britain and Spain. The sale of these assets was not expected to achieve the full amount of the required special dividend of up to €400 million and will not do so. Accordingly the ESB has now announced its intention to sell its two peat stations, West Offaly Power and Lough Ree Power. In selling these two stations, the ESB will be proposing to prospective buyers an arrangement under which it continues to operate and maintain the peat stations with existing staff. If there is any change to this, the ESB will consult with staff and unions prior to sale.

He spoke about credibility and he wants to refer to previous commitments and statements by members of various political parties. I mentioned what the Minister, Deputy Howlin, said here as recently as May. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, made no reference to that comment by the Minister, Deputy Howlin and his commitment that the sale of any ESB asset would not include any generation station in the Republic or on the island of Ireland. If anybody has a credibility problem, it is the Minister in that regard. On the memorandums of understanding, I quote from a letter from the Minister, Deputy Noonan, after the first visit by the troika. He referred to the Government plan and stated, "It is important that we make effective use of our State assets and, where appropriate, dispose of them to help reduce our Government debt". That was the first occasion on which the sale of State assets was mentioned in the context of paying down debt. Therefore it is the actions of this Government which moved the State's commitment to consider possible privatisation to an ambitious programme which would help reduce Government debt. That is that issue out of the way. If the Minister wants to have an argument and rerun the last general election campaign to raise the Labour Party's poll rating out of the ashes of 6%, that is his business. However, I am interested in looking after my constituents who asked me to raise this issue today. What commitment can the Minister give my constituents in the workforce on their pension entitlements in the first instance? Has the Government given any consideration to the role Bord na Móna can play after 2019 and 2020? It appears that what is being offered for sale has the benefit of Bord na Móna contracts and PSO commitments up to 2020 and nothing thereafter. If the Minister can answer that question properly and effectively, maybe his credibility can be restored.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	288	The main cause is that rising international gas prices have resulted in knock-on increases in both gas and electricity prices, the latter because of the role gas plays in the Irish power generation portfolio. Given our reliance on imported gas, increases in gas and electricity prices are, in turn, caused by increases in international gas prices as well as increased transport charges and adverse movements in exchange rates. In line with the European average and increasing wholesale gas prices, for example, in the United Kingdom, retail energy prices have increased since 2009. Three of the UK's big six energy companies have recently announced price increases of between 8% and 10.4% for their electricity and gas offerings. Therefore, I welcome the decision of Electric Ireland and Bord Gáis Energy not to increase electricity tariffs this year. The Deputy will be aware that Airtricity has announced its intention to increase prices by 3.8% from 1 November. The matters raised by Deputy Moynihan are naturally a concern to me, the Government, the regulator and voluntary organisations. The work of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other similar organisations in supporting those who are in debt or who have difficulty paying bills is to be applauded. However, the society does not explain how it arrives at the figure quoted by the Deputy nor does my advice support that figure. The affordable energy strategy is the centrepiece of the Government's strategy to protect these households at risk from energy poverty. The strategy was published in November 2011 and identifies 48 actions for implementation. Upgrading the thermal efficiency of people's homes is fundamental to addressing energy poverty, with the main delivery mechanism being the better energy warmer homes programme. Under this programme households can obtain a range of grants to provide draught-proofing, attic insulation, lagging jackets for hot water tanks, low-energy light bulbs and cavity wall insulation, which are free of charge to low-income families.
 Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 The better energy warmer homes programme was allocated Exchequer funding of €21 million this year and this is expected to result in the upgrading of over 10,000 homes. It is anticipated that the better energy allocation in budget 2014 will allow energy efficiency measures to be installed in a further 15,000 energy-poor homes next year, bringing the total number of low-income homes supported by the programme to more than 120,000 since its launch. In total across the wider better energy programme more than 250,000 homes have received Government support for the installation of energy efficiency improvement measures. Responsibility for the regulation of the retail electricity and gas markets is a matter for the Commission for Energy Regulation, which is an independent statutory body. Retail electricity prices are fully deregulated and similarly for gas, except for Bord Gáis Éireann tariffs for domestic consumers. In this regard, I welcome the recent announcements by two of the main suppliers, Electric Ireland and Bord Gáis Energy, to freeze their prices for the remainder of this year. I have no statutory function in the setting of electricity or gas prices. Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the costs of capital, exchange rate fluctuations and the small size of the Irish market. The wholesale price of gas is the most significant factor in the case of Ireland for electricity and gas. This has risen steadily since 2009, driven by events such as those in the Middle East, north Africa and Japan.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	289	The issue has come to light in respect of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and what it has stated about gas and electricity prices. The society is engaging with people and their bills. Information has come to me in recent days in respect of Bord Gáis Éireann having a difficult relationship or making it difficult for families to operate pay-as-you-go meters and almost trying to disown them or get out of the deals they have done with the people involved. I call on the Minister to take up the matter with Bord Gáis Éireann because the information I have is that the company is putting them at arms length and seeking to get rid of those customers who are in difficulty and who are relying on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and others to try and pay their bills. The fundamental issue I have, which I have raised several times, is that we have seen international prices change and so on. Is the Commission for Energy Regulation doing its job properly in allowing these companies to get increases? It is high time that we had a full review of the matter. Certainly, there is evidence in respect of the companies getting a bigger increase than they sought. We need to face this down because there is a crisis.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	290	I hope Deputy Moynihan is wrong, but if he is right I would be concerned about the point he has made about pay-as-you-go meters. The protocol we have in place prevents disconnections where a pay-as-you-go meter is installed. I would be very concerned if his information is correct in that regard and I undertake to act as he says. If he can give me any more precise information on it I would be especially pleased. The thing should be going in the other direction. We are trying to encourage consumers, especially consumers at risk of fuel poverty, to allow the meter to be installed or to enter into a payment plan to avoid disconnection. That is the real issue. Happily, it has not affected us yet this year and I hope it will not, but if we were to have a severe winter, Deputy Moynihan is correct to draw attention to it. The questions Deputy Moynihan raised about the regulator, company profits, prices and so on are major issues in energy policy at the moment everywhere I look. One could not have opened a newspaper or watched a television programme in Britain in the past three or four weeks but it is the subject of political and economic contention. We have seen the big six hike their prices there between 8% and 10.4%. The ESB has given a commitment to freeze prices until the end of the year and into next year, and similarly Bord Gáis Energy. That is welcome but it does not mean to say that there are not people under genuine pressure.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	291	That is a fundamental point. Halfway through 2012 the ESB showed a vast profit but the line given out was that the company would have greater expenses in the second half of the year. However, the company showed the same profits for the second half of 2012 on the back of a major price increase. I was in contact with the regulator on the matter and I am raising it with the Minister now. As the Minister correctly pointed out, there is a fundamental issue in respect of the profits being made by energy companies on our shores and on the backs of ordinary people. We need a fundamental examination of this policy and how we, as a society, are going to deal with it. It cannot be that these companies make vast profits from people who are under savage pressure.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	292	It is a major issue and I too have had discussions with the regulator. The regulator points out that significant investment is needed to maintain the system and security of supply. Investments in energy projects are singularly expensive. Electricity and gas costs in Ireland are influenced by various drivers, including global gas and oil prices, the cost of capital, exchange rate fluctuations and the small size of the Irish market. The wholesale price of gas is the most significant factor in the case of Ireland for electricity and gas and this has risen steadily, as Deputy Moynihan noted, since 2009, driven by events such as those in the Middle East, north Africa and Japan. The regulator will explain that these are all factors advanced by the suppliers when they put in an application. We are price takers, unfortunately. Anyway, it is a matter of concern in terms of the heart of Deputy Moynihan's question, which relates to people in poorer circumstances who have to resort to the Society of St. Vincent de Paul to assist with their energy bills. That is a situation of serious concern to me.

No application proposing the use of unconventional gas exploration or extraction has been approved in Ireland. No decision will be made on applications for exploration licences proposing the use of this technology until after the results of the Environmental Protection Agency research into the potential environmental impacts of unconventional gas exploration has been finalised and its findings considered and fully debated. A final report in this regard is not expected before 2015. It should be acknowledged that physical geography and geology vary from country to country and the Irish environment is different to the environments in which many unconventional gas projects and operations are taking place worldwide. While we can and will learn from experiences in other countries, we should remember that any application proposing the use of unconventional gas exploration and extraction in Ireland must be subject to environmental impact assessments in accordance with the EIA directive. Such an assessment would entail consideration of the potential impact of the project on the population, fauna, flora, soil, water, air, climatic factors, material assets, including the architectural and archaeological heritage, landscape and the inter-relationship between these factors.It is the case, therefore, that if the use of unconventional gas exploration and extraction were to be introduced in Ireland that the risk of flooding would fall to be considered by the environmental impact assessment.

In my role as Opposition spokesman on communications, energy and natural resources, I speak with people from both ends of this debate. I speak with representatives from the companies whose motivation is clear, namely, the desire to make money, which is fine. However, I also speak with people who have been affected by fracking, including people from Colorado and Pennsylvania. Shortly after Christmas, the Taoiseach spoke in glowing terms of what he found in Pennsylvania but the people from those states have told me they thought their Government and the Government agencies were on the side of big business in each step taken with regard to hydraulic fracturing. I was glad to hear the Minister of State indicate the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, will take into account the possibility of flash flooding and of storms when considering this application. However, I ask further that the EPA and the Minister of State himself meet and converse with those who have been damaged by fracking, as well as talking to the businesses concerned and the regulatory bodies. The Minister of State also needs to hear the stories of those who have been damaged by hydraulic fracturing in other jurisdictions. I ask the Minister of State to give that commitment.

My door is open and my job is to listen and to learn. To be specific however, the proposed EPA study will include consideration of the regulatory approaches of other countries that have extensive experience with unconventional gas exploration. This study will examine all of that and the best environmental practice for unconventional gas exploration and extraction projects will entail using the most effective techniques in achieving a high general level of protection of the environment and human health as a whole by demonstrating strict adherence with all relevant environmental legislation. In this regard, the programme will take an overview of the European Union environmental legislation applicable to unconventional gas exploration and this will include legislation that relates to all aspects of unconventional gas exploration. It will examine detailed information on the regulatory approaches of other countries that have extensive experience of this activity. This will include, where possible, a review of case studies where unconventional gas exploration and extraction covered more than two jurisdictions, that is, where transboundary activities would occur. Moreover, a minimum of five countries will be examined, including at least two within the European Union and at least one country in which a moratorium on unconventional gas has been introduced.

As I do not believe Members will get to this issue during Question Time, I have a further question. There is growing evidence that hydraulic fracturing and those involved in it are part of a giant Ponzi scheme, because it is costing three times as much as had been projected to get the volume of gas they are getting in the United States. Will the Minister of State ensure there is an independent, not an industry-based, study, into the real economics of hydraulic fracturing? Will such an independent study feed into the eventual decision over and above the report from the EPA? There are real fears in some jurisdictions that where negotiations have yielded some financial payback to governments, it is offset by the additional costs involved therein. There are real fears that those who are investing in hydraulic fracturing now are getting extremely jittery and worried and that banks are pushing the companies involved to drill to an ever increasing extent to cover the initial outlay.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	On the question of public consultation, I also might add that when the EPA advertised for public views, more than 1,000 submissions were received. Obviously many of them dealt with the environmental impacts to which the Deputy has referred but a considerable number of concerns were raised on the potential impact to human health, leading to the steering group agreeing it would add a health expert to scrutinise the data it had been examining. As for the specific question the Deputy now has raised, the economic cost to a company to do anything in respect of planning, in other words, what it spends on its operation, must be borne by the company itself. However, the Deputy is correct in that if there are other costs on the community, such as improvements to roads, engineering works or whatever, there obviously also are community costs arising from planning permissions. Leaving aside hydraulic fracturing, in the planning process, part of the planning consideration pertains to the economic cost to improvements. In other words, people who apply in respect of a house also are obliged to make a contribution towards water, sewerage and road costs. Consequently, I presume that any application that has an economic impact anywhere in this country and that is wider than the specific company or person making the application, is considered and is part of the planning process. One frequently sees impositions on companies regarding planning applications and moneys levied to ensure that in such cases, whatever they may be, that additional community costs are covered for the community that will be specifically affected.

I wished to make that point and call on the Minister to respond to Question No. 3 in the name of Deputy Mattie McGrath.

Ensuring secure, reliable and safe supplies of electricity is critical to Ireland’s ability to attract inward investment and retain and create jobs. While the case for proceeding urgently with energy infrastructure in line with overall economic social and energy policy goals is critical to the national interest, I am aware that many people are concerned about the impact that new transmission lines and other energy infrastructure can have on the landscape, the environment and on local communities. Accordingly, it is essential that Grid25 and other energy infrastructure are taken forward on the basis of the best available knowledge and informed engagement on the impacts and costs of different engineering solutions. Neither the Government nor I seek to direct the energy infrastructure developers to particular sites or routes or technologies, as was made clear in the July 2012 Government policy statement on the strategic importance of transmission and other energy infrastructure. That statement emphasises that these are matters for the developers and for the forward planning process through regional and local development plans and at project level through the development management process. In this context, energy infrastructure developers are encouraged to work with the forward planning processes at regional and local levels to set clear contexts for assessment of individual applications for planning consent and to facilitate as wide a degree of consensus as possible as to how and where to meet grid development needs. The Government, as detailed in the July 2012 policy statement, expects the companies in making their choices of project specific technologies and routing, as well as mitigation measures, to take account of all relevant national and international standards, to follow best practice and ensure value for money and be informed by detailed consultation at local level.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	It is a wonder that the Minister did not blame the last Government for this as well but in fairness to him, he did not. As we are led in everything by Mrs. Merkel, I do not know why Ireland cannot adopt the technology that is in place in Europe and now is the preferred option in Europe for high-voltage cables. Why did the Minister allow consideration of overhead pylons when it already has been decided in Europe that the best technical option is to have such cables placed underground? In his reply, the Minister referred to engaging with people, with the forward planning processes and with local and regional development plans.That is a load of claptrap because the Minister knows about this better than I do. I heard him speak about this when he was on the opposite side of the House three or four years ago when there was talk of going up to the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dowd's constituency with these lines. I knew what the views of the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, were at that time and I still know what they are but now this has all changed. The Minister and the Minister of State can laugh but that is the fact of the matter.  There is provision for protected views in the county development plan, on which I worked with the council officials, including protected views of Slievenamon, the Galtees and the Knockmealdown Mountains in Tipperary. Has the Minister costed the damage this would do to tourism? A Bord Fáilte survey showed that 24% of people asked said that these monstrosities would impact adversely on the region. Clearly, this energy will be of no benefit to the Irish economy as it will be exported. It is a case of big business and one of smash and grab. Like everything else, the Minister seems to be letting them do what they like; he is rubbing his hands and saying it all someone's else fault. He is the man in situ to ensure that the people's views are listened to. Thousands of people are turning up to meetings and they want answers; they want fair play and consultation.

What is involved here is a €500 million investment to ensure that Munster has sufficient energy supply for economic and domestic needs into the future. EirGrid has learned from previous experience. The reason the Deputy knows about this is that EirGrid has been engaged in a public consultation process opening offices along the route to consult with local citizens about how and where is the optimum route.

The Minister has really fallen into the trappings of power and into delivering whatever Angela wants. All the Ministers will be fighting to go Europe for the EU Commissioner's job because they will not want to face the public. The people of Tipperary are not going to allow these to go ahead. I am pro-business and pro-economic development but I want reasonable account to be taken of people's right to live in safety, in health and to enjoy their environment and not be persecuted by these obnoxious pylons. The figure cited that the underground option would cost three times the overhead option is untrue. I understand this work a small bit. I am not saying I am the salmon of knowledge on everything but I have a small bit of experience in this kind of work and I know that is a lie. It is an untruth.

In that regard, I have acknowledged that a move to e-payments will help to underpin national competitiveness. Indeed, the switch to electronic payments for social welfare transactions is a trend that has been apparent for some time with most new social welfare clients using electric funds transfer methods of payment. As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I am keen to see the development of an e-commerce and digital economy. Social welfare clients should have the same opportunities to avail of the benefits of the digital economy as the rest of us. An Post has many strengths, such as the largest retail presence in the country, a strong brand and a fully computerised network. Post offices already undertake e-payment transactions and, in common with other retail networks, this trend will accelerate in coming years.  The Department of Social Protection payment strategy intends to implement a strategy whereby the bulk of social welfare payments will be made electronically. I understand An Post will pitch strongly for the social welfare e-payment business when it is put out to tender by the Department of Social Protection. I have welcomed the recent selection of An Post as the provider of over the counter cash services for social welfare customers. The social welfare contract is the largest contract held by the post office division of An Post. The move to make social welfare payments electronically will clearly pose challenges for the network both in terms of changes to how business is conducted at the counters and the value of the contract in an electronic payments environment. Addressing these challenges is primarily a matter for the management and board of An Post as part of developing a strategy to secure the future of the network. As Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I see a strong future for the network in using its existing strengths to remain a significant player as a front office for Government services, including those provided by the Department of Social Protection.

The Minister alluded to An Post's strong brand, and every Member of this House has something to say about An Post, but unfortunately it has been losing retail units. In terms of the transfer of electronic payments from the Department of Social Protection outside An Post, we will not turn the river against the hill.An Post must move its business in such a way that electronic payments can be made to people's savings accounts and then accessed by the individual through an ATM card of some type. An Post must move on with that because communities are losing their post offices and there are knock-on consequences from that. This is a State contract and it is time the Minister, as the major shareholder in An Post, examined the ways An Post can move on its business. We must ensure every payment can go through An Post because that is what will be required as time goes on. We must ensure An Post is in a position to deal with those payments.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	364	I agree with Deputy Moynihan. There is no point in us putting our finger in the dyke. The digital economy is here. The trend towards electronic funds transfer and electronic commerce transactions generally is well under way and if we are to stay competitive, we must ensure we can compete in this space. We have a unique rate of retail outlets in Ireland in terms of our population. I understand there are still 1,130 offices of An Post throughout the country. It was good that An Post won the social welfare contract last year but undoubtedly that is moving in the direction of going electronic. Therefore, as Deputy Moynihan says, it must bring in new products. It has been developing new products. It has been developing, for example, a relationship with some of the banks that is very productive from the point of view of An Post and the local customer because some of the banks do not want to see anyone presenting at the counter. An Post can do some of that work, and do it usefully. The new chairman of An Post is a man with many ideas who would agree with the arguments Deputy Moynihan is setting out. Christoph Mueller was a former chief financial officer of Deutsche Post before he took up the job in Aer Lingus, and he has a vision for the future of An Post. The existing management of An Post has done a good job in the new products and services it is offering but Deputy Moynihan is right. We have to grow that. I was glad to see An Post as part of the consortium that won the lottery, for example. That is a very valuable stream of revenue for An Post into the future, but the Deputy is right that the future is digital.

For far too long An Post allowed these retail units to close in smaller communities in particular, and in some urban areas in an effort to rationalise its system at a huge cost to the social fabric of communities. In going after this State contract we must ensure every possible advantage is with An Post in terms of its products and the ability of the punter to get the best possible service from An Post. For as long as I have been a Member of this House we have been talking about transferring the motor tax service to An Post. All these fanciful ideas are great in reports but An Post has never taken them up. It is high time the Minister, as the major stakeholder in An Post, told the company that we must energise this service and give An Post the ability to attract new business in a range of ideas.

The evidence would appear to be, for example, that where a post office has been refurbished and modernised and has the latest technology, it attracts new business. Deputy Moynihan will know that some of the older offices he has spoken about have been run down, and the trickle of business is limited enough. I know the kind of constituency the Deputy represents but, for example, there is very similar terrain at the other end of the country. I got a telephone call before I came into the House about the post office in Greencastle, at the tip of Donegal, which is threatened with closure because of developments in the family who were the postmasters. I then find that the bank has pulled out of the adjacent village of Moville. It seems there might be an argument for An Post looking at what the bank is leaving behind and trying to maintain the Greencastle facility. An Post will argue that very little business has been going through it, but as Deputy Moynihan said, it is important to the local community and it may well be that An Post would look again at this in the light of the decision of the bank in Moville to pull back and provide a service to people in respect of basic bank products as well.

Such a system will be a vital part of the national infrastructure. On 8 October 2013, I obtained Government approval for the launch of a new national postcode system that will provide a unique seven character code to every letterbox in the State in 2015. The Government has also approved, subject to contract, the appointment of a consortium headed by Capita Ireland as the company which will develop, roll out and operate the postcode system. This announcement follows a procurement process run by my Department. Most countries have had the benefit of postcodes since the mid-1900s. In making the move now, Ireland has been able to use the technology and systems available today to move to the next generation system. The Irish code will be the first in the world to be unique to each individual address. This will alleviate the current situation whereby more than 30% of all domestic addresses are not unique. It will mean that even apartments and offices in large developments will have an individual code as long as they use their own specific postboxes. To address any concerns regarding the introduction of a granular postcode system, my Department has engaged with the Data Protection Commissioner’s office on the national postcode system during the procurement process. The commissioner's office has been advised of, and has noted, the rationale and policy justification for the approach suggested for postcode roll-out and implementation. It should be noted that the provisions of data protection legislation will continue to apply to all holders of personal data linked to postcodes and that unauthorised access to or use of that information will be in breach of the law. In addition, the Office of the Data Protection Commissioner is statutorily charged with independently investigating any complaints raised regarding any national postcode system.

I support the introduction of postcodes in this country and I want to see it work well. There are three areas of concern. Irish language people are concerned that the increasing use of English placenames and abbreviations may become part of the postcodes. The Minister might advise me as to how we can guard against that. A second concern is that because someone can now go to the person's individual letterbox, there may be personal security or personal data implications. I am aware that in Scotland there was a legal case regarding postcodes and the outcome was that because it only referred to a district but did not identify the individual house, it could not be regarded as data. The unspoken implication was that had the additional three digits that identified an individual house been in place, there was a potential breach of data protection. Would it be possible to get a breakdown of the costs because it appears to be a very expensive project?

The fact we did not do so in previous decades means we now have the benefit of technology which was not there previously. This unique identifier will be at the leading edge in that regard. The precious local address will not be interfered with. There will be a new line at the bottom of the envelope, so whatever the precious name of the village or the townland will still be there. I do not brush aside at all Deputy Colreavy's concerns about privacy and data protection. That is a very important area to Irish people and we have spent a lot of time focused on that issue. I think the Data Protection Commissioner first became involved in this in 2005. All during the procurement process, my Department has been engaged with him and his office in terms of how implementation of the system proposed does not encroach on personal privacy. He has, in turn, let it be known to us that he will be extremely vigilant about discharging his independent function under the law. He has left us in no doubt about that.

The reason I asked for the financial information was that PA Consulting did a report, although I do not have the date for it. However, based on 2007 figures, it lists the implementation costs and the net value over 15 years. Private postal services, banking, retail, telecommunications and insurance are listed. It appears that an agency like An Post will carry a lot of the financial load here. While other areas will see an increase in the value over 15 years, An Post will see a big loss by virtue of the heavy implementation costs. I do not have information from the Minister's Department, so perhaps we could have that information on the establishment cost, the implementation cost, the maintenance cost and the life-cycle cost.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	371	The cost of the contract over ten years is €25 million. The two big elements of that are the cost of accessing the GeoDirectory data and the cost of upgrading departmental databases, so that they can exploit the new post code system. Some €8.27 million will be paid to the GeoDirectory. That is money which comes back to the State as the GeoDirectory is a State organisation where the shareholders are the Ordnance Survey of Ireland and An Post. It is one arm of the State giving to another one. The bigger element of the cost will be the €9.46 million which is the cost of updating the databases in the main Government Departments which have been agitating for this service, such as the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, the Department of Social Protection, the CSO and any organisation which can use it to improve its service, make it more efficient and provide a better service to its clients.  Deputy Colreavy looked for information on the impact of the implementation of a national postcode on An Post. The impact will be a positive one. There will be more business going through An Post as a result. The estimate we have is that it is likely to improve the bottom line of An Post by approximately 2%. That is welcome in the context of the discussion Deputy Moynihan and I just had about the future of the post office.

The aim of the strategy is to significantly increase the levels of digital adoption in Ireland. It sets out key objectives across three different strands, namely, trading online and entrepreneurship; citizen engagement, and education and e-learning. My Department has worked closely with stakeholders to develop the administrative arrangements for the trading online voucher scheme. This will commence with a two phase pilot project, the first phase of which gets under way this week with a call for applications in Dublin through the Dublin City Enterprise Board. A second phase of the pilot will be progressed in early 2014 and will be followed by a national roll-out with the objective of getting 2,000 small and micro-businesses trading online within 24 months. The strategy also aims to encourage digital entrepreneurship. Earlier this year I renewed the contract with the National Digital Research Centre to provide ongoing support for the translation of digital research into commercial propositions. Results from NDRC's work to date have been promising with follow on private sector investment being secured for a number of the projects which it is supporting. My Department also continues to support the Digital Hub Development Agency. There are currently 72 digital companies operating from the Digital Hub, employing approximately 880 people.  Strand two of the strategy focuses on citizen engagement. Our target is to cut the number of people not using the Internet in half by the end of 2016. This will entail awareness raising, a focus on skills development and basic training. With €1.4 million funding support from my Department, and in partnership with stakeholders, I launched a new national digital literacy training programme earlier this year. The BenefIT 4 programme has already provided training for almost 3,000 people and is operating in over 550 locations nationwide. My Department has also developed an online mapping resource to make it easier to find the nearest BenefIT training location.  The third strand of the strategy relates to e-learning. 
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
A series of technology "Switch On" workshops will be held in schools to showcase the best use of technology in the classroom. This programme builds on the 100 Mbps to second level schools project in which my Department and the Department of Education and Skills are investing in high speed symmetrical broadband capacity for every second level school in the country. The second phase of the schools broadband programme is currently being implemented and I expect that all schools will be connected by the end of next year. We are already learning from the very positive experiences in schools that already have 100 Mbps connectivity and will use the "Switch On" workshops to share these experiences with other schools. We have also asked the ESRI to undertake research on educational outcomes as a consequence of using high speed connectivity in the classroom.

Perhaps the Minister would comment on that. When will the roll-out of broadband to all rural areas - the 30 megabits per second - be completed? Will the Minister commit fully to it? Broadband is like electricity in the 1950s. We need to ensure every part of this country is brought along.

The basic training programme to which I referred is an attempt, in part, to address that but Deputy Moynihan raises the more fundamental question about the availability of broadband in rural communities. The problem is that we have the least densely populated rural areas in Europe. In common with other rural parts of Europe, the roll-out of broadband to these areas is immensely expensive. In regard to where we are with the plan, the Deputy will understand that because the State must intervene, we must go through state aid procedures in terms of getting approval in Europe for State intervention.Every day, the commercial sector is improving the service that is available in large tracts of urban Ireland. Deputy Moynihan is correct when he says that the service is entirely inadequate in parts of rural Ireland. I accept that. We have started the mapping exercise with the suppliers. The EU requires us to present a detailed and supported application for state aid approval to roll out this facility to rural Ireland. I hope - the Deputy should not hold me to this - we will have finished the mapping exercise and made the submission by the end of the year. We are trying to do that with as much despatch as we can.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	385	I propose to take Questions Nos. 9 and 148 together. The 2009 renewable energy directive sets all member states a binding target that 10% of the energy used in the transport sector must come from renewable sources by 2020. The directive also requires that all bio-fuels used to meet the 10% target must comply with certain sustainability criteria. Specifically, they must not be made from feedstocks sourced from certain categories of land and must achieve certain greenhouse gas emissions reductions. This time last year, the EU Commission proposed a set of amendments to this directive and the fuel quality directive to mitigate the potential effects of indirect land use change occurring as a result of the use of certain bio-fuels. This sent a clear message to the market that second generation bio-fuels are preferable to land-based bio-fuels. One of the amendments proposed would limit the contribution that certain crop-based bio-fuels can make towards renewable energy targets for transport in EU member states. The EU Commission considered that the scientific models used to quantify the indirect land use change emissions were insufficiently robust to incorporate binding indirect land use change factors in the sustainability criteria which would have precluded the use of bio-fuels with high direct and indirect greenhouse gas emissions. The Commission also considered that such an approach would require major industrial restructuring that would not be achievable within the 2020 timeframe. Therefore, the Commission proposal is that the requirement to incorporate greenhouse gas emissions factors for indirect land-use change is confined to the member states' reporting obligations with respect to emissions. The intention of this amendment is to introduce greater transparency and highlight the relative performances of different categories of bio-fuels in terms of their ability to reduce carbon emissions. I share the concerns being expressed that bio-fuel production and its use, unless properly regulated, could impact negatively on food production and on food prices. I also acknowledge that those bio-fuels could also lead to increases in greenhouse gas emissions, which would be contrary to one of the objectives of the renewable energy directive. At the Energy Council meeting earlier this year, I conveyed the need for member states to be cognisant in the discussion of the proposed amendments of the potentially adverse impacts of bio-fuels on land use in developing countries. In this regard, Ireland has argued for a restriction on first generation bio-fuels and for incentives to encourage the development of advanced bio-fuels that do not affect food production. Ireland’s preference is for a cap that is as low as can be realistically achieved to mitigate the potential conflict between bio-fuel use in the EU and land use in the developing world, and the potential for higher greenhouse gas emissions from certain categories of bio-fuels.

There is a great deal of concern and alarm that Ireland has not joined the group of EU member states that are committed to the 5% cap. The group includes countries like the UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Belgium and Luxembourg. Twenty-seven EU Commissioners signed off on a cap of 5%. In March of this year, I had an exchange with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, during which he said that Ireland is supporting the 5% cap. When the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, met representatives of non-governmental organisations to discuss this issue, he said they made a compelling case for not providing for a higher rate. He said he was conscious of the negative impact that a rate of more than 5% would have on some countries. It is as if the Minister of State with responsibility for trade and development is saying one thing and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is saying something else. During my exchange last March with the Minister of State, Deputy Costello, I asked him whether he had held discussions with the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte. He said he had spoken to the Minister about this matter the previous day. I do not think the Minister and the Minister of State can have been talking about bio-fuels on that occasion. The commitment to the 5% cap was born out of the Mary Robinson conference on climate justice and change, in which Ireland participated as the host country. A cap of 5%, rather than what was referred to in the Minister's reply, is being proposed at the moment as a compromise.

This is the first I have heard about 27 Commissioners signing off on a 5% cap. I suggest it never happened. If it happened while I was president of the Council, nobody told me about it. Rather than agreeing to a 5% cap, some of the countries mentioned by the Deputy were quite opposed to the line I was pushing as president of the Council. It is not true that the European Parliament has approved a 5% cap. It has voted in favour of a 6% reduction. That is the cap it sought. The Lithuanian Presidency has made a compromise proposal that would involve a 7% cap, but it is being resisted. I think Ireland might support that, although we would prefer to see a lower ceiling. That is the latest position as I understand it.

That is on the record of the Dáil. There is no doubt that Ireland is very generous with its foreign aid. We contribute 20% towards hunger eradication. What is the point of giving aid with one hand and taking it away with the other hand through our lack of commitment on the bio-fuels issue? Non-governmental organisations have been in contact with me today on this issue. I do not doubt that this matter will be followed up further. It is disappointing that one Department is saying one thing, but another Department is not joining up. The dots are not coming together in this regard.

The Deputy is misinformed. After I met representatives of non-governmental organisations during the Irish Presidency, I undertook to submit their arguments into the debate in Europe. I have to inform the Deputy that when I did so, the arguments in question received a very cold reception from some states. If I thought that a blocking minority could be formed in the morning, I would support it. Far from the list the Deputy read out, there is not even a blocking minority, nor is there universal approval of the Lithuanian suggestion of a 7% ceiling. In case I do not get to speak on this matter again, I wish to inform the House that the best and most recent advice I have from Brussels is that the indirect land use change issue, which is known in the lingo as the ILUC issue, is unlikely to proceed to finality in the lifetime of the present Commission or the present Parliament. I am particularly intrigued by the Deputy's assertion that 27 Commissioners signed off on a 5% ceiling. While I know she would not make such a statement unless she believed it to be true, I have to say it is news to me. If she has some evidence to support that statement, I would be glad to get it.

It is essential. Everybody on both sides of the House would agree that everything must be considered. It can only happen, if it can ever happen, if it is deemed to be environmentally safe. It is vital that the full spectrum of potential environmental and human health issues is independently considered, and the results of scientific research must be published. That is the sole and only objective of this proposition from the EPA. It will be 2015 at least before we have those results, but when we do, we can have a full and proper debate based on all the facts in all jurisdictions where fracking is taking place.

I am satisfied to hear what the Minister of State says but unfortunately he did not say "yes, I will". There are people in other jurisdictions who say their water has been damaged, there has been gas build-up in their houses, they are not happy with this thing and the gas companies are trying to buy their silence. They are jumping up and down, as it were, and saying fracking has damaged them. Will the Minister of State ask the EPA to ensure the views of such people are incorporated into the environmental impact study? If they are not, nobody in the report will have any credibility because those people will still jump up and down and shout loudly that they were damaged by hydraulic fracturing but no one ever asked them about it.

That is what they are saving from the reduction in energy costs. That is a fact. The environmental and health aspects must have primacy. We are committed to that on this side of the House. Let there be no doubt about that. I am happy this scientific analysis will take place, that it will be comprehensive, that it will consider all other jurisdictions and that every single citizen of this country, north, south, east or west, will have had a say.

It may not be scientific data but it is not hearsay and the voices of those people deserve to be heard. If those voices are not heard and if they are smothered by a report that refers only to scientific data, it will find no acceptance in this State. In response to the Minister of State's comment on the transformation of the economy of the United States, he should watch that space because I believe that fracking is a giant Ponzi scheme. The potential investors are onto it. They are trying to get their money out and the banks are pushing the companies to drill more and more in order that they can get their money back. It could be the next big busted flush.

I am concerned that the EPA might spend time on a project such as this when the Minister of State's Department ignores the potential to transform our economy through the development of wind and wave energy. The Minister of State does not give anything like the same amount of resources to those energy sources. There is scientific information about toxic substances in the air, the soil, the water and damage to underground water tables, so I do not see why the Minister for State must undertake further studies. The information is available but the Minister of State is not listening to it.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	399	A recent United Nations Environment Programme report outlined some of the dangers posed to human and non-human life by the chemicals used in the fracking process. It pointed out:Fracturing fluid consists of large amounts of water mixed with chemicals and sand. In most countries the chemicals used in fracking fluid are considered trade secrets ... If companies are not required to publicly disclose the full list of chemicals used, assessing potential short- and long-term impacts on public health will be difficult.We should also take on board that fracking is an extremely water-intensive practice. A single horizontal shale gas well will use up to 34 million litres of water, depending on the size of the area and the depth of the well. This excessive water usage can have drastic impacts on biodiversity and local ecosystems, while lowering the water table, resulting in reduced availability of water for use by local communities and agriculture. With regard to the American economy taking off on access to cheap gas, I remind the Minister of State of the Cree Indian saying that not until the white man has cut down every tree and poisoned every river will he realise that we cannot eat money.

We cannot drive our cars without petrol or diesel. Let us stay in the real world. The real world from the Government perspective is that there is an independent study. It is independent of Government and everybody else, taking on board everybody in the country who had an opinion. That has all been put into the mix and out of that will come a scientific study that I will stand over, whatever the outcome. The Department will not influence it. The report will be what the EPA finds. It will be published and will come before this House and will be fully debated in committee. Nothing is hidden here, and nothing is being ignored. We have to live in the real world. We have to examine all of the facts, which will speak for themselves. I will support those facts, whatever they are, but I do not exclude the possibility that the science will say A, B, C, D or E. I do not know what it will say but we cannot reject the fact, as Deputy Daly did, that in Ireland we deal with our energy. We have the third highest wind energy output in the European Union. The Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, and I spend an awful lot of our time on renewable energy, wind and wave energy and so on. Let us have a real, practical and honest debate on this. Reading statements that sound good but do not make sense is not the way we will do business in this House. We will deal in facts alone.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	401	Considerable progress has been made in recent years in both the coverage of mobile telephone and broadband services across Ireland, with a multiplicity of commercial operators providing services over a diverse range of technology platforms. ComReg advises that voice coverage is at 99% of the country. The Government has also undertaken a number of initiatives to bring broadband to those parts of the country where commercial operators have been unable to offer services. The combination of private investment and State interventions such as the national broadband scheme means that Ireland has met the European Commission's digital agenda for Europe's target of having a basic broadband service available to all areas by 2013.The Government's national broadband plan, which I published in August 2012, aims to radically change the broadband landscape in Ireland by ensuring that high speed broadband is available to all citizens and businesses. This will be achieved by providing a policy and regulatory framework that assists in accelerating and incentivising commercial investment and a State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest.  In order to progress the State-led investment for areas where it is not commercial for the market to invest, a full procurement process must be designed and EU state aids approval must be obtained. My Department is engaged in a comprehensive mapping exercise of the current and anticipated investment by the commercial sector to identify where the market is expected to deliver high-speed broadband services over the coming years. The results of this mapping exercise will inform the precise areas that need to be targeted in the State-led investment as envisaged in the national broadband plan. Intensive technical, financial and legal preparations, including stakeholder engagement, are ongoing. The procurement process for the approved intervention will be carried out in accordance with EU and Irish procurement rules. Since the publication of the plan, investments by the commercial sector are underway in both fixed line and wireless high speed broadband services, particularly in urban and semi-urban areas. There is evidence that industry is investing beyond the targets to which it committed in the plan. I will set out some of the key developments in the short and medium term. The e-fibre investment programme is a further very positive development in the Irish telecommunications market. Eircom launched its next generation broadband services in May last with speeds of up to 70 megabits per second, Mbps, immediately available to over 300,000 premises. By the end of this year, Eircom aims to reach more than 600,000 homes and businesses. It has a target to pass 1.2 million premises by June 2015. Full details of its roll-out plans are available on Eircom's website in a user-friendly on-line map. Last week, the company announced the launch of its new television service which is linked to its e-fibre investment programme. This is a further very positive development in the Irish telecommunications market. UPC is continuing with its investment in the cable network and recently boosted its entry level package from 50 Mbps per second to 120 Mbps and its top speed to 200 Mbps. This increase will be immediately available to some 656,000 households in the areas covered by UPC's network. Other fixed operators also continue to invest in local loop unbundling. BT Ireland now supplies broadband access to both Vodafone and Sky Ireland and along with other operators is also investing in fixed infrastructure. Meteor and Vodafone have announced the launch of 4G services and the other mobile service providers are planning similar roll outs in the coming months. Some of this investment will also involve significant improvement to current 3G coverage throughout the country. Deputies will also be aware that the ESB is currently considering the prospect of utilising its distribution network to roll out fibre broadband services. I am, therefore, confident that with the continued significant private sector investment combined with the planned targeted State intervention, we will achieve our ambition of ensuring the ubiquitous availability of modern, resilient high-speed broadband services to all parts of the country in the next few years.

I am sure he, I and everybody else in this House has had experiences in various parts of the country where one moves around the house or upstairs and sometimes out into the backyard or up the road to get an adequate mobile telephone service. This is not happening in other countries nor should it be. I realise fully that the kind of investment that is required should have been undertaken about ten or 15 years ago when this country was overflowing with money but it did not happen. I know the Minister knows that as well. Arising from what the Minister has just said, has any particular deficiency been identified which could be remedied in the shortest possible time, be it in fibre optics, wired, wireless or satellite, which would have the effect of improving the quality of service in respect of broadband and mobile telephony? Of all the complaints I get from time to time from the business sector and those trying to set up small businesses in their homes, the lack of adequate broadband or mobile telephone services is one that comes up again and again. I was told recently that one could boil the kettle while waiting for the broadband service to come on stream. That is not a criticism of the Minister.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	403	Deputy Durkan is correct about the lack of uniformity of the service throughout the country. Unfortunately, that lack of uniformity is in every country with a rural population. We have the least densely populous rural demographics in the EU. That is not an excuse for creating a new digital divide in the country. We must do our utmost so that even where it is not commercial for the private operators to provide the service for which Deputy Durkan is arguing, the State will intervene. I accept that. In respect of the short-term improvements sought by Deputy Durkan, be they fibre optic, wireless or satellite, they are proceeding apace at a faster rate than would have been anticipated even by the regulator. Unfortunately, it does not deal with Deputy Durkan's problem of the black spot where it is deficient regardless of whether it is mobile telephony or broadband. It is deficient. Previous investment by the State, for example, in the national broadband scheme or the metropolitan area networks around some 93 towns has certainly brought about a significant improvement but we are back to the requisite of State intervention to deal with the issue comprehensively.  In conclusion, I will give Deputy Durkan one example of the range of things I mentioned in my formal reply. This is the project envisaged by the ESB in respect of the use of its distribution system to roll out fibre to parts of Ireland that could not otherwise reasonably expect to have such a service delivered to them. The ESB has progressed it to the stage of having held its competition and now has a preferred bidder. In other words, it will open a joint venture with a leading telecommunications company to provide this service to parts of rural Ireland using the distribution system. As far as I know, this has only been done in Chattanooga in Tennessee. Due to the fact that we have an especially firm infrastructure and a temperate climate, the distribution system is capable of giving this service. It would be unheard of in the US or indeed in Europe for a fibre service to be provided in the fashion envisaged by the ESB. It is just one example and one that deserves the support of the House.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	404	Despite denials, the Government's budget contains cuts in the social welfare rates. We have heard in the past week that core payments and weekly payments have not been cut in the same way as they were not cut in the previous year. No matter how often Ministers say this, the fact is that payments have been cut. The jobseeker's allowance for claimants under 26 has been cut by €44. That is a cut. The welfare rate for 65-year-olds who can no longer work due to a disability has been cut by €36.80. That is a cut no matter which way one presents it. There have been cuts to maternity benefit and illness benefit, invalidity pension and adoption benefit. The mortgage interest supplement is being phased out and the bereavement grant has been slashed completely. It appears nobody is safe but what is particularly cruel is the attempt by this Government to demonise young people. Deputy Maloney reckons that young people are all sitting at home looking at flat screen televisions all day. I can assure him that many of them are contacting Deputies.They may not be in touch with him but they are certainly contacting Deputies and businesses to see whether they can find a job anywhere. In regard to the claim by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, that social welfare is a lifestyle choice, I ask him whether he can live on €100 per week. Since the Government came to power in 2011, the unemployment rate in County Laois increased from 8,396 to 8,857, of whom 1,588 are young people. As attacking young people by cutting their rates will not create employment, the Government would be better off focusing on job creation. Youth unemployment has remained at a staggering 30% for more than four years, with 30 applicants for every available job according to ICTU. Young people want to work and we need to make jobs available for them but the Government's policies are failing in that regard.  The budget proposals that Sinn Féin put forward outline how we would reduce the tax burden on ordinary families by taking 296,000 workers on the minimum wage or below it out of the tax and USC net and protecting welfare payments. The Government has let young people down. Some 64,700 people under the age of 25 are currently unemployed. Rather than punish young people we want to give them real jobs, education and training for a future in Ireland. We propose a guarantee of employment, training or education, or an apprenticeship within four months of a young person becoming unemployed. According to the National Youth Council, this can be achieved at a cost of €6,600 per person, or a total of €400 million, which could be provided through a combination of Exchequer and matching EU funding. We are committed to ring-fencing money raised from a wealth tax to ensure that every young person can avail of a job, education or training. We would link the youth guarantee to our job stimulus. Instead of making comments about lifestyles, the Government would be better to focus its energy on the needs of those who receive welfare and young people in particular. It is disheartening for them. They badly need employment and the Government should not think cutting welfare rates will somehow create new jobs. If one takes unemployment and emigration as the barometers by which the public can measure Government policy, Government policy has failed. I ask the Government to stop attacking young people. The cuts are a disgrace. Young people want hope and a future in this country. We are trying to present alternatives and we ask the Government to consider them.

One's credulity is stretched when one hears the submissions made to the House in the climate we have lived in for the last several years. The Government has been accused of being arrogant and impervious to the needs of the people. I begin to wonder whether we have all been living in the same country. I readily accept that the measures taken by the current Government have severely impacted on many of our people, including people we all know and respect or have worked with for many years. We all know the challenging times we have come through and how they have affected the people we represent. They have made huge sacrifices to bear their burden in the clear knowledge they are going in a particular direction. I hope that direction will, by the end of the year, allow us to break out of the strait jacket imposed on us for the last several years. We should get away from the nonsense and play acting of recent times, including playing to the gallery and trying to curry favour.

He could only say, "Let there be more spending". That is what the critics on that side of the House are now saying. Does the House realise where this country would be if that were to happen and the budgetary situation were to worsen? It must be recognised that each Department needs to meet specific targets. If Departments fall short, the consequences will be dire. People who are or were formerly in Fianna Fáil will complain about the hardships caused by budgetary cuts. Of course there are hardships. What other way could it be? A couple of years ago, we had a deficit of €37 billion. How could we reduce it while increasing public spending? It cannot be done. It has not been done anywhere in the world. Wherever it has been tried, it has failed. It failed in 1977. Deputy Mattie McGrath and others like him will remember that far back. Perhaps Deputy Keaveney might not, as he is too young. The situation was somewhat similar. The national debt was not as great as it is now. All of the pundits claimed that we needed to spend more money, to put more money in people's pockets, to generate consumer spending, to provide stimulus. Where have we heard that before?

We must see the light at the end of the tunnel. If we do not stick strictly to the targets that have been set for us, we will get nowhere. We will end up back where we were. There are intelligent people on that side of the House who know full well the consequences of slipping back to 2011 or 2012. We would pay a heavy price. The people of this country deserve better. They have made considerable sacrifices, and it would be a tragedy if those were to be set at naught. Like every Deputy, I deal with constituents on a daily, weekly and nightly basis. We know full well the degree to which hardship has affected the people whom we represent. As far as the country is concerned, this is where the test will come. If people trust that we are on the right track, the economy and everyone will survive and we will not need to repeat the dose for the next three or four years. However, if people are misled by the prophets of doom and those who pretend there is no need to pursue these policies, the price will be large and will have a lasting affect on this country and its people. As in other countries, there will be street protests, baton charges and civic disturbances on a daily basis. We do not want to go there.

I have problems with the Bill, first with its presentation and, second, with the way the members of the Government attack the cuts that they inevitably feel they must make. The House will forgive me for not being informed, as I have only just run this information off the computer. I decided to have a look at a couple of the quangos that the Government has so loudly proclaimed its intention to abolish or reform. Before cutting social welfare, one should consider other possibilities. I came across a little company called the Private Security Authority, PSA, a semi-State with a small budget. It is one of what Fine Gael in opposition called the land of a thousand quangos, those it loudly crusaded to reduce in numbers because of extraordinary waste, duplication and lack of necessity. While I am not well informed about the PSA, I discovered in the first few minutes of reading its report that it is like many quangos in that it does not fall under much examination, including by the House's committees and, I suspect, the Minister who is in charge of it.It is difficult to find out very much about this because, despite its obligations, it has not laid its annual report before the House for at least five of the last seven years. It has not put it in the Oireachtas Library and nobody has noticed. However, one will find out from the report that the board, which is well paid, has managed to have five meetings every year to look at this industry, which is undoubtedly in need of supervision, at a cost per board meeting of just under €2,000 per member. That is only one of nearly 1,000 quangos which are not being properly examined. There is no time to examine them properly at committees on which Members of the House sit. As a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I am aware that many of these Government bodies are not examined with the sort of scrutiny that they should be every year by Members of the Oireachtas because there are so many quangos and so few Members. We have a whole sector of Government bodies running amok, unpoliced, with political appointees at the top, no known expertise and accountable to nobody. Given the Fine Gael pledges in the programme for Government, the Government should examine these 1,000 bodies to see if there is room for cuts, rather than giving that role to each Department and saying that each Minister will make the cuts. These quangos represent a Celtic tiger explosion of wealth under the former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern - not this Government - who created quangos galore to suit political purposes. They should now be abolished. That is where the first line of cuts should come. We should concentrate on that attitude. We should not ask individual Ministers to do this in their own Departments. We should appoint one person - perhaps the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, whose job it is - to say that is where the cuts will come and they will be examined individually. The Government asked to be judged on that count, but I believe it has failed.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	447	There can be no defence for a Minister whose portfolio is social protection to administer these cuts against precisely the people she is supposed to protect. It is as simple as that. The Minister is not doing her job if she visits cruel cuts on young and old, women who have just had children, and those who are sick or bereaved. That is the list which comes on top of last year's list, including lone parents and those in receipt of rent subsidy who are now threatened with homelessness due to the cuts imposed on them by the Minister. The cut in jobseeker's allowance for young people is a straightforward invitation for youth to walk out the door. That is not just an assertion by the political opposition, it is a simple fact borne out by the CSO's figures which show that 40,000 young people are emigrating annually. The Minister may find it funny that 40,000 people are leaving the country or that it is a handy political escape-valve for a Government in trouble. However, it is a national tragedy that our young, educated people are leaving, many of them never to return. Emigration is robbing this country of the energy, talent and education that could help to get us out of this mess. To add to the suffering by cutting the bereavement grant to people who have just lost their loved ones is cruel beyond belief. It is disgraceful to take that support away, particularly as the bereavement grant did not even cover a fraction of the cost of a funeral. The cut in the invalidity pension for 65 year olds is a naked grab against the elderly and infirm. It makes no sense and there is no rationale to attack women who have just had children by reducing the higher rate of maternity benefit. It is shocking that 23,000 of the 24,000 people in receipt of that benefit will lose out substantially. The list goes on. The Government says that it has no alternative. Deputy Durkan says that the Opposition is opportunistic because there are no alternatives to this. We should have a serious debate about that instead of the glib, dismissive and frankly insulting responses we get from the Government. It is true that we can debate and argue over how much tax can be effectively and sustainably levied from big corporations, the wealthy and those on higher incomes. It is, however, preposterous for the Government to suggest that it is impossible. It should be stated for the public record that there are more household, financial and other assets in Ireland today than there were in 2007. That is a fact. Only in 2008 did wealth go down, but it has been on an upward curve since then. According to the CSO, it is up 3.6% this year to €446 billion in net assets. We know that increase is not in the hands of pensioners, the unemployed, workers who have lost 25% of their income or young people. Neither is it being put into our public services. Who has got this increased wealth therefore? One does not have to be a genius to figure it out. For example, the CEO of the biggest bank in the country is on €800,000 a year. The county manager of Dublin City Council has just had a pay rise, after moving from Dún Laoghaire, from €140,000 to €190,000. Some people are doing very well and it is obnoxious that the Government, and particularly the Labour Party, refuses even to discuss the possibility of some tax on the wealthy and big corporations. Surely that would be fairer.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	448	The Minister is likely to sneer at many of the comments from the Opposition. It seems that Ministers have to grin and bear listening to us. I have taken a look at some of the Minister's own reactions to hard budgets when she was an Opposition finance spokesperson. She referred to the 2009 budget as a nightmare on Merrion Street. She said the 2009 supplementary budget was the budget from hell. In addition, she said the cuts in that budget were being introduced to pay for the global speculation of some of the greediest people on the planet. In 2010, Deputy Burton said the budget was the slaughter of the innocents. In budget 2011, however, she delivered what was perhaps the biggest lie of all when she said the principle of the Labour Party was that we are a one-Ireland society and that those who have most should contribute most. That has not been borne out by any of the subsequent budgets which the Labour Party helped to shape. The expectation was that all of the necessary adjustments could be avoided by substituting Frankfurt's way for the Labour Party's way, but the Minister's ten-yard walk from Opposition to the Government benches seems to have fundamentally changed her view of the world. It has discredited politics along the way because that party's policy was played for every vote it could get. The clip we saw recently on the "Tonight with Vincent Browne" television programme featuring the outrage of the current Taoiseach and Tánaiste in 2008 has been expanded upon. I well remember the current Minister for Social Protection's outrage at that time. I am sure there will be clips played of that at some point also.There was no shortage of outrage. Would the Minister's outrage in those years have extended to forcing, in the main, low paid workers to live without any income during the first six days of illness; to cuts in State assistance for those who could not pay their mortgages - this Bill provides for a cut in the mortgage interest supplement and its elimination by 2018 - or to the cut in the bereavement grant to those who need it to bury their dead, many of whom paid for it all of their working lives through PRSI because it was part of the PRSI package introduced in 1970? Countless people have asked me to explain the universal social charge and the reason they are also paying PRSI. People cannot figure out what it is they are paying for as their entitlements are reducing all the time. While I agree education and training is essential if people are to have productive futures, does the Minister really think that people under 25 with primary and master's degrees and PhDs need more training? They are not sitting in front of flat screen televisions leeching off the State and do not require more training. The cut in social welfare benefits for these people will not create new jobs.  I regret that we have so little time to debate this Bill. We have all been shoe-horned into speaking in a small amount of time. It was only when we sat down at the Whips' meeting this morning that we realised just how bad the situation will be tomorrow. If each of the 166 Members of this House wanted to contribute tomorrow on the section on maternity benefits, which is to be cut for the vast majority of people, and adoption benefit, they would have 18 seconds to do so. If each Member was to have an opportunity to speak on the discontinuance of the bereavement grant they would have to do so within the 20 minutes allocated for debate on that section. The 30 minutes allocated for debate on the cuts in jobseeker's benefits for under 25s equates, if all Members wish to contribute, to 18 seconds per Member. This is not the way to do business or to run the country. This is being done for one reason and one reason only, namely, to minimise the negative reaction on the Government, to allow backbenchers to go off next week and remain uncontactable and to prevent the Opposition tabling amendments.

However, like other speakers I am annoyed at the amount of time allocated in this regard. I know the Minister, Deputy Burton, means well and that her job is a difficult one. Not only is she under attack from her Fine Gael colleagues, but she is also under attack from her Labour Cabinet colleagues. It is only right and proper that some of her back bench colleagues are here tonight to support her. While the Minister is doing the best she can under the circumstances, what is proposed in this Bill is a mean attack on people from the cradle to the grave. This Bill provides for a cut in maternity benefit from €262 to €230 per week, which is a €32 reduction. The Government has abolished the air travel tax and has imposed an exit tax, in the form of the withdrawal of the bereavement grant, on people when they die, the very people who worked for and built up this country. If the Government had its way, it would leave them unburied. Last year, the rate of tax payable on a hearse was increased. The next thing to be taxed by this Government will be the trough. Little did I think it would tax a corpse, which is what it is doing by abolishing the bereavement grant. This is a scandalous attack on families and others who need that grant. As stated by other speakers, despite the fact that this Bill does not come into force until 1 January 2014, debate on it has been guillotined. The Opposition does not even have time to table amendments and even if it did there would be no time to debate them because of the guillotine. Is this Government reform? The Government is standing on the ordinary people. Where were the Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Gilmore, last Tuesday when there were 10,000 elderly people - the grey vote - outside this House protesting? I was outside five years ago when the elderly people were protesting, at which time then Deputies Kenny and Gilmore could not wait to get up on the lorry to address the people and make promises to them. They have demeaned politics and let the people down. This Government obtained its mandate from the people on false promises. It should be ashamed. This is the reason for its low rating in the polls. This Bill also provides for the abolition of the €9.50 per month telephone allowance. Community Alert, Neighbourhood Watch, the Department of Social Protection and other Departments have invested hugely in the installation of telephones in people's houses. Often, telephones provide the only contact elderly people have with the outside world. Abolition of this allowance will result in many of their telephones being disconnected, thus all the investment has been a waste. It is a false economy. Without their telephones elderly people will be nervous, frightened and lonelier. Many of them will end up in hospitals.  The reduction in jobseeker's benefit for under 25s is particularly mean. I do not accept that, as stated by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, they are all watching flat screen televisions. The young people with whom I deal - I have some myself - are interested in educating themselves and getting a job. They are not interested in lying around doing nothing. Reference was made to the Government's efforts to decrease dole queues. All that is happening is that young people are being forced to participate in all types of Mickey Mouse schemes and internships, in respect of which they are being abused. This proposed cut is a savage attack on young people, many of whom are living at home with parents who cannot afford to keep them having put them through college and so on. This is the meanest cut of all. I call on the Minister to reverse it. On the evening after the budget was announced members of Young Labour who were outside Leinster House, some of whom are from my constituency, said they believed this was a terrible attack on young people and future generations. This is another attack on families who are already struggling with mortgages, many of whom are in negative equity. These people are only hanging on by their fingertips yet the Government has reduced the mortgage interest supplement for new applicants. It has also made technical changes in respect of invalidity pensions. The Government has made three attempts to cut disability benefits. As I have previously said in this House, I do not know if it is the desire of the mandarins that these people be attacked or if it is because of a lack of compassion and empathy for people with disabilities that this Government continues to attack them when they should be supporting them. This is the fourth attack on them in about 13 months. The Government should be ashamed.  I note also that the minimum contribution in respect of the rent supplement is to be increased. We are hearing all the time that people are finding it impossible to access accommodation in Dublin. There are numerous homeless people on the streets throughout the country. This cut must also be reversed. Child benefit in respect of third children is also be to cut and mortgage interest relief is to be phased out, which is mean given people are dependent on it to survive. The RTE subsidy for OAP television licences is to be reduced by €5 million. Why not make that organisation make cuts? Why impose cuts on elderly people who like to watch television, although not political broadcasts by the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, who said recently that people should never take any notice of promises made at election time, which is outrageous? Elderly people like to watch educational programmes. I wish I had more time. I object to the guillotining of this Bill. It is scandalous. When in opposition, Government members objected profoundly to guillotines. This Government is now the master in that regard. It is guillotining all legislation. The Government's proposed taxing of people on death is shameful.

Ireland had to borrow big to pay its debts. The troika budget was one of the conditions of this bailout. The money borrowed from the troika is just part of the problem. Due to a lack of proper oversight during those years, the total foreign debt owed by government, struggling businesses and householders in this country stands at €1.64 trillion. Every man, woman and child in this country now carries a debt burden of €358,000. Every 70 year old pensioner, unemployed young person and five year old child carries a debt burden ten times larger than the average EU citizen. The big problem with large debts is that they generate high interest. Next year, the cost of servicing the State's €204 billion portion of this huge debt will be about €9 billion. The loan repayments alone are three and a half times the target set for this budget. If this enormous debt did not exist, we could put money into the economy rather than take it out. My heart goes out to the pensioners who in their thousands stood outside this building this week. They built our country. Our pensioners are the people born in the 1920s, 1930s, 1940s and 1950s. They never thought during their working lives that they would live through the destruction of the Irish economy, not once, but twice. The pensioners of Ireland experienced first-hand the effect and after-effects of the other economic war caused by Fianna Fáil. Let us call it EW1, economic war 1. When today's Irish 80 year olds were just five year old children, Fianna Fáil started an economic war with the United Kingdom by withholding land annuities. In retaliation, the UK applied import tariffs on Irish cattle. Fianna Fáil then slapped duties on coal imported from Britain. From 1932 to 1938, cattle exports declined by 66%. Irish industry could not afford to manufacture. The domestic economy froze because nobody had money to spend. It was a political and economic disaster and our current generation of pensioners paid the price during their youth and middle years with poverty and emigration that lasted into the 1960s. In 2010, Fianna Fáil boiled the economy dry for a second time and launched economic war 2 on the citizens of Ireland. The only casualty of an Irish economic war is the Irish people. The pensioners of Ireland bear the scars of two economic wars, EW1 and EW2. They do not need added pressure resulting from whether they are entitled to a medical card. All week I have been receiving calls from people who do not need to worry about their cards but who are worried all the same. I have welcomed the incentives in this budget aimed at creating more jobs. There are signs everywhere that the economy is turning around. Retail numbers are up, as are exports. As the economy grows and tax income recovers, it will no longer be necessary to rob the piggy bank of the public services to pay the interest on the debts of the Fianna Fáil Government. There will be new opportunities to negotiate better ways of paying the debt, but the actual borrowed sums are still hanging over Ireland in the form of Government debt, business debt and mortgage debt. I want to believe that our pensioners, who survived EW1, will come out on the other side of Fianna Fáil's second economic war. For that reason I am calling on my Government colleagues to approach the next budget - the first post-troika budget - by beginning an open national discussion about the feasible ways of reducing the debt, and not just the payments on the debt. It is an important topic to the five year olds of 1933, the five year olds of 2013 and everybody in between, and it cannot be avoided for any longer. I regret there is nobody from Fianna Fáil present to hear that, because they bear the responsibility.
#MichaelMcNamara	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-party	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcNamara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	454	A great shame in recent years has been that the number of people living in jobless households increased rapidly since the start of the recession. We must realise, however, that before this recession began, 15% of the Irish population lived in jobless households. That is an extraordinarily high figure. We have the highest percentage of people in Europe living in jobless households, but we also had one of the highest percentages of people living in jobless households back in 2007 before this crash happened. We have these Punch and Judy debates in this House where people shout slogans of shame and disgrace, but if there is a shame or a disgrace, it is that the figure of people living in jobless households was not tackled when this State had so many resources to invest in tackling the problem. Instead, the State chose to throw money at these people, as it were. No effort was made to incentivise work, to provide training or to provide schemes whereby people could get a job. Instead, money was thrown at them and they were ignored and, in effect, ghettoised. This Government and the Minister for Social Protection have sought to tackle that problem in the teeth of a huge loss of employment in the economy. We are reminded every day of the calamitous fall in employment which was occurring in the run-up to the previous general election and immediately after, but that has been arrested. We have seen an increase in the labour force for the second consecutive quarter, which is the first time that has happened since this recession began. We have also seen an arrest in the rate of decline of those aged under 26 in the workforce for the first time since 2007. We must realise the scale of the problem which preceded this recession before we can fully understand the backdrop to this budget. In that context, I greatly welcome the initiatives which were introduced in the budget and which are being introduced in the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013. I acknowledge the pain it is causing, which people in society are bearing for economic problems which were inflicted by a previous government. It is not correct to suggest, however, that any specific sector of society is being targeted. There is great concern at the loss of medical cards and the change in the threshold, yet a couple who earn just under €900 per week will continue to qualify for a medical card. That is a relatively high income for a couple who will not have to pay school fees or a mortgage and so on, because we are talking about people who are retired. The threshold is still €500 per week for a full medical card for single people. Those who lose a medical card will get a GP-visit card, which entitles them to get free treatment from a GP. If they need further care and they are referred to a local accident and emergency department or a medical assessment unit, they will also receive free medical care there. There is a great deal of scaremongering and people are being intentionally frightened about initiatives which do not affect them in any way. There are initiatives specifically targeted at young people to enable them to join the labour force. Rather than throwing money at them and consigning them to the ghetto of unemployment, labour activation measures are being adopted. For example, the Youthreach programme provides integrated education, training and work experience for early school leavers aged between 15 and 20 who do not have any qualifications or vocational training. The number of places on that programme is being increased. The vocational training opportunities scheme provides a range of courses. The back to education allowance, Momentum and the apprenticeship scheme provide 10,200 places specifically reserved for young people. Young people also have access to a further 69,400 places, and I greatly welcome that.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	455	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2013. My first thoughts are for the people who are, unfortunately, affected by some sections of this Bill. I empathise with them, particularly our elderly. While we go through the motions and debate this Bill, there is a sense that we are standing here with our hands tied behind our backs, bowing towards Europe or the troika, all brought about by Fianna Fáil's reckless years in government, which included Deputy Mattie McGrath at the time. They brought about the disgraceful situation in which we found ourselves when we first took office. They gambled with the futures of our elderly and our children, setting up NAMA and giving out blank cheques everywhere, resulting in us being left in the bankrupt situation in which we found ourselves, but we are slowly getting out of it under this Government. They left us with the worst unemployment crisis in the history of the State. This budget continues the process of repairing the public finances while protecting the welfare safety net and providing a pathway back to work for jobseekers.An additional €30 million in savings will be made through additional fraud and control measures in 2014, while €34 million will be saved through increased efficiencies in management of schemes, bringing the Department of Social Protection's overall adjustment to €290 million. Reductions of €226 million will still impact on, and cause difficulties for, social welfare recipients. However, the lower adjustment means that payments such as the State pension, carer's allowance, disability allowance and all other core weekly payments upon which people depend are protected, for which I thank the Minister. Carers are the backbone of our communities. I am happy that there were no attempts to reduce the already small return carers receive for what is often 24-hour and seven-day a week care of the elderly, infirm or vulnerable. This is a payment I was extremely vigilant to protect for the hardworking caring sector. The Government pledged to develop a national carers strategy to support carers and address their concerns. I am glad we are delivering on this commitment unlike the previous Fianna Fáil Government which promised but never delivered. Carers deserve a proper return for the hours of work they put in on behalf of individuals, families and the health services. Their work helps people to remain in their homes and in their communities, and frees up hospital beds and nursing home places. In addition to care in the home for our elderly, we are providing nearly 23,000 older people with financial support for long-term nursing home care, something for which the Opposition does not give us credit. Child benefit has also been protected in the budget, and will remain a vital universal support for all families and all children. The principal reason that child benefit and the other crucial welfare supports mentioned have been protected is the Department's role in helping people back to work, which in turn has seen the numbers on the live register fall. Crucial supplementary supports for pensioners, carers and people with disabilities, such as the fuel allowance, the energy allowance, free travel, the half-rate carer's allowance and the respite care grant have been protected. Having said this, I am disappointed that the telephone allowance was cut as it affects the most vulnerable in our society. It is of major benefit to older people who live alone in isolated rural areas. This grant goes towards the cost of a personal alarm button which operates through a landline. These panic buttons are a lifeline for many elderly people living in rural areas. In the past four or five years I have been involved in setting up text alerts in communities in Longford and Westmeath and I know the value of the scheme to those people. Last week, I wrote to the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, asking her to consider reviewing this cut. Since then it has been made known that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will consider a special fund following the abolition of the phone allowance. I ask the Minister, Deputy Burton, that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government would push ahead with this special fund and that a type of security fund be set up in order to cover the cost of the phone line for the panic alarm as this is a safety issue for the elderly. Perhaps we could get a little more clarity on this special grant for the operating of panic alarms in the homes of older people and the Minister might have something for us this evening or on Committee Stage. Overall welfare expenditure will fall below €20 billion in 2014 despite demographic pressures in the shape of the increasing number of pensioners. By rooting out welfare fraud, the Department of Social Protection will raise a further €30 million next year through additional fraud and control measures. We simply must ensure that every cent of the welfare budget goes to those who need it most. The strongest protection against poverty is decent, secure and fairly paid work. This budget will help more people back to work, reduce the overall welfare spend as part of the sustained effort to repair the public finances and ensure the safety net remains firmly in place for those who need it most. The numbers in work rose by 33,800 in the year to the second quarter of 2013. The number on the live register is down by 20,000 over the past year, and will shortly fall below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009. While that is still far too high, of course, we are making firm and visible progress. After endless representations on behalf of the elderly in the midlands I am glad that services have improved in Longford and Westmeath with the refurbished wards at St. Joseph's care centre in Longford and Lough Low House in Athlone which was downgraded by the previous Fianna Fáil-led Government. Earlier this year we opened the new 100-bed unit at St. Mary's care centre in Mullingar. These are all positive responses to my endless representations. In order to provide more labour market activation initiatives for young people the Government will enhance and develop the range of opportunities on offer to young people in the form of internships, participation on employment schemes, subsidised private-sector recruitment and supports for self-employment. The full range of youth employment initiatives will be set out in the Government's plan for the implementation of the EU Youth Guarantee which is to be finalised and submitted to the EU by the end of the year, as part of which we will be seeking to maximise the share of EU funding allocated to Ireland. My priority is getting Longford-Westmeath, and indeed the rest of the country, back on the fast track of economic recovery and jobs. I am determined that every opportunity will be offered and taken to reverse the job losses experienced in the midlands over the past ten years, particularly during the time Fianna Fáil was in government. After the big hullabaloo this morning, I am disappointed to see that not one Fianna Fáil Member has appeared in the Chamber for the past hour, which shows their interest in this debate. I will be extremely pleased to welcome the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Deputy Bruton, and the economic forum consisting of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to Longford on 5 November where they will present the action plan and programme for jobs which will encourage firms in Longford and Westmeath to sell their products abroad in lucrative export markets which in turn will create jobs in the midlands. Accessing credit remains a major challenge for many firms. I am confident this will be directly addressed by the partial credit guarantee scheme and the microfinance fund which will be outlined in more detail by the economic forum and other experts, and will in turn help businesses struggling to get loans. Inward investment such as this is essential and more than ever the lifeblood of rural areas such as Longford and Westmeath. All of this is part of our jobs initiative and the Departments of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and Social Protection are interconnected. This is the last budget that we will have under the bailout programme. Step by step the Government is undoing the disastrous policies of Fianna Fáil that brought the country to the brink of bankruptcy.

This undermines the objective of the Taoiseach and the vast majority of members of Dáil Éireann, including me, who want to see the welfare system reformed to encourage people to make the transition from welfare to work. The Bill sends out a contrary message, which is that those who never worked or owned a home have nothing to lose. However, for those who have worked, are in employment or own a house the message is that slowly but surely this very limited State safety net is being pulled from under them.In other words, they may take up work, but at their own risk. This message has long-term economic consequences for us all. It is saying to entrepreneurs that they are better off playing it safe, not starting their own businesses, not trying to better themselves, not taking up employment and not increasing their hours of employment. We need to encourage people to take risks and the best way to do that is to ensure that they have a safety net if they become sick or cannot find work. The other clear message from this legislation is that the Government wants young people to emigrate. This has always been the safety valve of successive governments to address the spiralling costs of unemployment payments. However, the policy is fatally flawed and unsustainable. Why? Emigration is costing our economy through education alone €20,000 every minute. The emigration of almost 90,000 people in the past 12 months is an extraordinary brain drain on our economy. It has cost the taxpayer €9.6 billion to educate these young people. This education is flowing out of our country at a time when we urgently need the best and most innovative to start creating jobs in our country. The policy is economically unsustainable because the €9.6 billion that is lost in education is €800 million more than the total annual education budget. We are rocketing towards a catastrophe and we do not even realise it. I advert to the fear caused by the withdrawal of the telephone allowance. While the Government will argue that this support is small and that there are now mobile telephone alternatives, the practical reality is somewhat different. Older people, the disabled and the vulnerable are fearful. Garda stations in rural communities have closed. Mobile telephone coverage is intermittent. People rely on their emergency pendants. I respectfully suggest to the Minister that this measure should be suspended until three things occur. First, a tailored cost-effective mobile telephone package with a physical desktop handset and efficient pendant service should be rolled out. Second, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources should establish a vulnerable roaming agreement within Ireland immediately with all the mobile telephone operators, similar to that which operates in Spain, France and Italy. This would significantly improve the mobile telephone coverage to the 999 call standard for all users of emergency pendants. Third, persons in areas where there is poor mobile telephone coverage should be able to continue to avail of the telephone allowance. Technology has changed but we must work with older people to ensure that they can maximise the opportunities.

It is startling to listen to the statistics Deputy Naughten has outlined relating to education and the expertise that is flowing out of the country on a weekly basis. The figure he put on it was approximately €9 billion per annum. What we are doing is frightening. The social protection budget exists for several reasons. First, to protect the vulnerable. Second, it cannot be more attractive than taking up employment. Third, we should remember that someone actually pays for it; it does not come down from the sky. There must be compassion and understanding. In overall terms the measures in the budget will not save a great deal. There will be no great monetary gains to the Government. The cut in the telephone allowance and the increase in prescription charges has sent out the message to older people that perhaps there is not much use for them anymore. The damage this has done psychologically has impacted more on that cohort than any monetary downside. I call on the Minister to reconsider the first measure, which comes under her remit. I realise the second measure is probably a matter for the finance Bill. The social protection budget is €20 billion. I am a strong advocate of work-fare instead of welfare. It is not only about protecting the vulnerable; it is about ensuring that it cannot be more attractive for people to be out of work than in work. I fear that we do not have the appropriate measures in place. I am not against the reduction of the jobseeker's fund for the younger age group provided there is training, education facilities and places for them, but I gravely doubt that there are places for them. Many self-employed people, especially after the boom, reduced their level of employment and they have become reluctant to employ people because they are being hit by regulations and charges. We must make it attractive for these people. We must reconsider labour law and the many regulations and charges in place.

I am outraged today. I want the Government to succeed. Why? The reason, as Deputy Anne Ferris mentioned, is our massive debt. Today, is an opportunity for the Taoiseach at the European Council. Today, that opportunity is a must. It was shocking today. I was embarrassed when Deputy Stephen Donnelly brought forward the question of how much is being sought in bank recapitalisation and there was a silence. That is disgraceful. I read on the RTE website today the Taoiseach's letter to Herman van Rompuy dated two days ago about the bank recapitalisation and the promises of June 2012. It is a pathetic letter. Somewhere lost in the third paragraph is a little bleating question; it is not even a question, it is a bleating reminder of what was promised. Where is the stand-up steel spine needed for the people? Otherwise, there will be no social welfare Bill. This is a €20.24 billion Bill but the assumptions underlying the economy are not even being debated and that is disgraceful. We are told that there are 3,000 new jobs per month. I call on the Government to prove it. Where is the evidence? If there is no evidence and if the claim is only half right, then there is a loss of half of €360 million in the calculations of the budget. These are the things that should be examined and that we should be discussing rather than the little detail that follows from the big-picture engineering. The Taoiseach's letter is an embarrassment. I would not ask a junior certificate child to write it.

In it there is a concept called "doublespeak" and that is what the Government speaks, "doublespeak". It says one thing and couches its actions in rhetoric about fairness and reform and all the rest, but in reality what does it do? It savages and attacks the poorest and weakest in our society and treats them with contempt. I offer one example. In the general election of February 2011 the Minister's party, the Labour Party, campaigned for the extension and expansion of mortgage interest supplement. That was a core element of the Labour Party's approach to deal with the mortgage crisis. However, the Government is abolishing it. Will the Minister explain how in two years she wanted to extend mortgage interest supplement because she thought it was crucial to deal with the whole mortgage issue, but now the Government intends to get rid of it? How can the Minister explain or rationalise that? The Minister knew the economic situation the country was in but the Government policy has completely shifted. I will read a quote from an organisation with which the Minister will be familiar, "Today's cut in social welfare for young people is regressive and counter-productive .. [it is] fundamentally unjust". This came from youth wing of the Minister's party, Labour Youth. I spoke to some of the members yesterday when they were protesting outside the House. They are embarrassed. The Minister has made them embarrassed to be part of the Labour Party because of what she has done to them. The Minister need not take my word for it. She should go and speak to them at their conference this weekend. There are disgusted and appalled by this budget. I am referring to members of the Minister's party. That is a fact. There has been certain rhetoric about young people sitting in front of plasma television screens and so on. These people are citizens and equals, exactly like the Minister and me but they are being deliberately targeted. The reforms introduced in this Bill will affect graduates. What they need is not training, but jobs.This is a deliberate attempt to attack them, undermine their incomes and patronise them with promises of training when what is required is job creation and job stimulus. Together with other independent Deputies, I published alternative proposals about how the deficit question could be addressed in a fair and just way. Members have heard from the Labour Party that a wealth tax is impossible. Why does the Minister not read, for example, the paper from Dr. Tom McDonnell of TASC about how a wealth tax could operate in Ireland? Why not even consider it, instead of dismissing us and undermining social democratic arguments for dealing with this crisis in a fair and just way? The policies of the Government come straight from the Chicago school of economics. When the Government forms its budgets and develops its policy, the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues demonstrate that they are the disciples of Friedman and Hayek. Moreover, they implement their policies with a ruthlessness that a Tory Government in Britain in the 1980s could not muster. The Minister should be ashamed of herself and should be ashamed of this Bill. She should resign from the Government and call a general election.

The Minister has many fine qualities and I must state it was the qualities she possesses that attracted me into politics. There is no doubt but that she and I shared much in common with respect to political beliefs and values. Unfortunately, I will not be able to continue sharing that tonight, because I will express my lack of support for this Bill. I have few regrets in politics but none of them relate to my voting against the Social Welfare Bill last year; nor will I regret being obliged to vote against this Bill. The Bill before the House is undoubtedly an effective and terrible attack on those people who voted for the Labour Party in the last general election. I also regret being obliged to witness the Minister breaking her commitment to social justice and fairness because I know her to be a person who wakes up each morning with a view to protecting the vulnerable. It is a sad day when she is forced to do this by the Cabinet. It also is a bad day because I know the Minister to be a person who sets out in politics to bring in people from the periphery to the centre of society. It is a sad day when she is forced to do this. This sort of forced collusion in the budgets introduced both this year and last year is very difficult for people to accept and they feel a strong sense of betrayal with respect to the commitments that were given prior to the last general election in that regard. I do not believe the Minister is actively colluding in this. I have stated all along that she is being forced to do this. Clearly, however, there is an element of witnessing the Minister carry out the right-wing policies of Fine Gael in government and indeed those of the democratic centralists of her own political party. This sort of betrayal against the Minister's own values is difficult for the public to accept. Last year, the Minister and her Cabinet colleagues sold the country and Parliament a pup. When the Government introduced a savagely regressive budget, Members were told it would introduce a catalogue of wealth taxes. However, Members now learn that those wealth taxes, drawn from the wealthiest in society, are simply failing and are not yielding revenue. This year alone, there is a shortfall of €130 million from the wealth taxes in Ireland. No such shortfall has been reported in respect of measures levied against low and middle-income families because they cannot escape to sunnier climes. Instead, the €130 million that has not been yielded from wealth taxes will be levied against working people through their pensions. Moreover, the use of language in this budget has been extraordinary. Those aged under 26 have been told they have not suffered a cut but that it is simply a matter of extending the lower rate to them. This would be akin to me walking into the Minister's office and telling her I was not cutting her pay but was extending to her the pay of an usher. Is that a pay cut or not? Is that not a cut in core pay? The Minister cannot trumpet consistently in this Chamber that she has not attacked core elements of pay or social protection. At least the Minister, Deputy Noonan, has the good grace to accept that there have been cuts of such significance. However, the Minister, Deputy Burton, cannot laud the achievement of protecting core pay. It is undignified for her to so do in light of what has happened to young people. The Minister stretches the imagination in respect of the definition of what are the core elements of social protection. She must go and ask young and elderly people, as well as those with children, whether they believe their core social protections have been maintained, because they would quickly challenge her belief. She does her credibility great damage in that respect.

On budget day, the spin from the Government benches was that the Department of Social Protection had "escaped" with net cuts limited to €226 million, rather than the €440 million that had been bruited in the media for many weeks. In fact, adjustments of €290 million are set out in the 2014 expenditure reports, including a savage cut of €44 million from the abolition of the telephone allowance, the €32 million slashed from jobseeker's allowance payments to those under 26 in a really savage attack on our upcoming generation, the €30 million cut to maternity benefit, the €22 million cut resulting from the new six-day waiting condition for illness benefit and the disgraceful cut of €70 million from the cancellation of the long-standing bereavement grant of €850. One must remember that the Bill before Members is the latest in a sequence of shocking attacks on the most vulnerable citizens since 2008. As I stated with great sadness during the budget debate last week, the Minister's credibility evaporates each time she is associated with a Bill of this nature. I estimate the cumulative effect of cuts to the social welfare budget from the supplementary budget of 2009 up to budget 2014 to be of the order of €3.7 billion. In other words, €3.7 billion has been taken from the most vulnerable citizens. As Deputy Nulty mentioned, Labour Party members and a number of independent left Deputies came out with a modest proposal last week that would have obviated any cuts. There would have been no cuts whatsoever in the social welfare budget. I am aware of the recent report to Deputy Shortall with regard to the wealth tax agenda of last year, which unfortunately has not been delivered. However, even had the Minister asked for that, Members know what would have happened. Fine Gael would have refused absolutely and would not have allowed her to do it. Instead, she would have been invited to go ahead and attack the social welfare budget. This is the reality and the problem and is the reason I urged the Labour Party not to join the present Administration. I did so because there would be nights like tonight, which people would regret deeply. As the Society of St. Vincent de Paul has noted, families still are reeling from cuts in previous years and, in particular, older people and young people believe they were targeted for 2014. Over the past five years, there has been an entire sequence of cuts. I can remember Deputy Stagg - I believe it was in the run-up to the 1992 election-----

We were all together in Labour Left and I believe Deputy Stagg was our leader at the time. We set out the "dirty dozen" cuts of Charlie McCreevy, who was from the Acting Chairman's constituency, and lambasted Fianna Fáil for doing that to the people. It is sad that the Labour Party would be associated in any way with doing that this evening. I note the presence of a distinguished legal colleague in the Chamber, who knows that under Article 40 of the Constitution everyone is supposed to be equal in the Republic, yet young people and older people have been targeted. I ask colleagues to walk away from this budget. Let us have a general election and let us give the people an alternative.

They stood back and allowed the country to go down the drain and took no responsibility for anything at any time except for the golden package with which they left when they were kicked out. Let us be clear on one point: many speakers who have crossed the floor from the Labour Party and Fine Gael did it for one reason and one reason only - to save their own brass necks. I am disappointed that some of the speakers could be so negative about a Minister who has brought social welfare into a new era and has changed the policies of many previous Governments that destroyed the social welfare system to the point at which many people believed they were better off staying at home rather than going to work. I have spoken to a number of people in my constituency, including the people who elected me to this House and my family and friends, who felt that the budget was hard in a number of areas but they accept the fact that without pulling together and making a contribution we will never get out of the economic crisis which has plagued us for the past four years. This budget is the budget to take us out of the bailout. Instead of criticising it we should be all jumping for joy. I believe it is the fairest budget the Government has produced, considering the economic crisis in which we found ourselves when we were elected two and half years ago. The Government was elected on a mandate to create jobs and get the economy moving again. Almost 34,000 new jobs have been created this year. Those figures were not plucked out of the sky; they are real figures. We have come a long way from the days before this Government came into office, when we were losing an average of €7,000 jobs per month. I note from the Minister's speech that she is optimistic that the number on the live register will fall below 400,000 for the first time since May 2009. We are making progress; it may be slow, but we are taking the right steps. The fact is that the more people we have working the more income will come to the State and the more services can be provided to the vulnerable and the old. The reality is that the money is just not there for us to do everything we would like to do, but we are making progress. The Government has had to show backbone and fortitude to get us out of the economic mess in which we found ourselves after years of reckless giveaway budgets that were instituted by previous Governments just to make sure people were re-elected. Not only did the previous Government spend every penny in its own purse but it spent every penny in the purse of every citizen in this country.  It must be pointed out that the Opposition, some of whom orchestrated the dire economic situation in which we found ourselves a few years ago, have not come up with one constructive proposal for how we might achieve the savings needed. It is easy for Opposition speakers to stand up and throw out soundbites, but the reality is that they have no concrete plan to get us out of the shackles of the bailout they got us into in the first place. Despite what has been said, the Government has sought in this budget to protect the vulnerable in society. With regard to supporting the elderly, we have not touched the State pension, the carer's schemes, free travel or the free television licence. Similarly, in recognition of the fact that fuel poverty is a big issue for the elderly people, we have not changed the fuel allowance, and the excise rate on fuel has also been left unchanged. Furthermore, the tax treatment of the elderly remains unchanged, with no change in net income for pensioners as a result of the budget. Those aged 65 and over will continue to be treated more favourably under the Irish income tax code than all other taxpayers. On the specific issue of medical cards, I fully agree with the review designed to take unused medical cards out of the system, as we, the taxpayers, are currently paying for any wastage that occurs as a result of this. It also appears from figures released recently that half of people with discretionary medical cards are 200% over the income limits for the means test. This Government is seeking to protect the vulnerable and ensure that medical cards go to those who really need them and those who are most in need. The reduction in income thresholds for those over the age of 70 will mean that those with an income of less than €500 per week, or €900 for a couple, will still be entitled to a medical card. This means that 85% of those over the age of 70 will still have their medical card and 97% of those over the age of 70 will still have either a medical card or a GP card. On the issue of the telephone allowance, we must remember that it was costing the State €44 million or more, a figure we just could not afford any more. It is worth noting that the other elements of the household benefits package, such as the free television licence and the electricity allowance, have not been touched. It is time for phone companies to step up because they have a responsibility to their customers. They are private companies making profits and they should be willing to stand up and be counted in the country.

I listened to the contributions of speakers to the debate from early this evening and in the last segment I was not sure whether I was watching "Love/Hate", "Will and Grace" or "Friends", given the contributions of some of speakers. I am not sure what world they are living in. Albert Camus, in his writings, speaks about being a stranger in the world, and certainly in my world I am a stranger to the philosophy and ideology of some of the speakers I heard. I do not want to name Members who are not in the House, but I listened to the contribution of Deputy Mattie McGrath from Tipperary earlier and I was concerned that I was wrong in my recollection of electoral politics. I pride myself on having a good memory about elections and politics. I checked the website and noted that the Deputy was elected as a Fianna Fáil councillor and elected as a Fianna Fáil Deputy, yet he is in this House most days parading himself as the Sultan of Brunei or the Duke of Clonmel.

It is bit like Groundhog Day. We have a lesson to learn here. Let us go back to the beginning of modern Irish politics and work forward to today. The Acting Chairman spoke about this earlier and I mentioned it last night. From 1977 to 1981, the most outrageous promises were made by a Fianna Fail-led Government, and what happened? There was chaos. Who came in behind them to clean it up? Fine Gael and the Labour Party. We can fast-forward to one potential exception, Ray MacSharry, who had to do what he did because he had no choice. However, Fianna Fáil could not be trusted on its own and because we could not trust Mr. Haughey, we had to bring in the Progressive Democrats, and then what happened? It was a case of "Sure, you can't trust them. If in doubt, leave them out." They left. We then brought in the rainbow coalition of Fine Gael, the Labour Party and Democratic Left, and for the first time there was a burgeoning surplus, resulting in the creation of more jobs and more money. What happened? We had 14 years of a party. They could not give the money away. The Fianna Fáil Government was like the best man at a wedding buying drink for everybody, but the drink was money for the Irish people, and what happened? The people turned to Fine Gael and the Labour Party again. Whatever else can be said about Fine Gael and the Labour Party, we have pride in our country, we live up to our responsibilities, and we do not shirk or funk the hard decisions, unlike some of the Members opposite who go scurrying to the media at every hand's turn. That is their way - I am not saying that applies to Deputy Dooley - but not our way in government.I will debate what this Government is doing with any Member opposite. Outrage was expressed in the contributions from the opposite side of the House. We are all outraged but outrage does not tell the troika or the markets that we can create jobs or get our fiscal budget right. That is the reason I am proud to be a member of Fine Gael, and I will never resign from Fine Gael. I will never castigate my colleagues in government for making hard decisions. I will do it in the privacy of our own room, in the same way Deputy Dooley did it in Fianna Fáil. In fairness to the Deputy, he did not go running to the media being critical in the way some of his colleagues did. Government is about governing for the people. I will face the Irish people, and I will respect their decision if I lose my seat in the next election because of decisions we took in government. I have tremendous respect for the sacrifices our people have made but how dare the Members opposite come in here and use intemperate language to criticise our Taoiseach. This is about a Government keeping our nation sovereign and giving our people hope. Members should cast their minds back to the 1988 Democratic Convention when Jesse Jackson had one great line for the American people. He stated: "Keep hope alive. You must not surrender." This Government is a government of renewal. We have not surrendered. We have not given up hope, and we have an expectation for our people that will begin again on 15 December when we emerge from the bailout into a post-bailout period. We should not get obsessed with the idea of empathy that we hear from some quarters. The men and women of this Government sitting in this Chamber tonight and every day understand the reality of suffering and the sacrifices our people have made, whether they are a small business owner, a farmer, a public servant, a senior citizen or an unemployed person. We understand that. That is why we assumed the mantle of government and leadership, which had gone. We had a benign Government for 14 years, and in particular for the last two years of that Government, yet we had to listen to the sultan of Brunei, Deputy Mattie McGrath, tell us otherwise. We should face the reality of life. The Government understands the suffering experienced and the sacrifices made by its people as a result of the collapse of our national economy. Consequent to that collapse we have been carrying out a readjustment of what had happened. The Acting Chairman referred to that in his remarks earlier. We had an insatiable desire to spend money. Every day this Government must borrow in the region of €34 million to pay for essential services. That amounts to approximately €8 per person per day. I am not a housewife. I do not have a family to look after. I look after my own budget and if I do not have money, I do not spend it. In the same way if a family does not have money, it does not spend it. Are we really saying our financial situation can continue unchecked or that it is okay to spend money we do not have? In making the necessary difficult decisions in terms of the spending of our moneys, I will support the efforts to realign public expenditure and ensure that those who should pay the most pay the most. In the two and a half years of this Government's term we have balanced that. We have maintained core social welfare payments, and I heard the comments made earlier by some Members opposite. Deputy Nulty was the one Member of this House who was elected with a mandate from the people for the programme for Government.

Nobody on this side of the House has urged more austerity. The opposite is the reality. We have urged spending the money better, that it be more people-centred and invested in jobs, creating better communities and passing on a sustainable economy to the next generation whom we do not want to see emigrate. I was a teacher in my previous career and I have written references for past pupils, as I have said in this House repeatedly. It almost kills people to see their young family members emigrating. One can walk around every GAA club in every parish in this country and see the consequence of the failed policies of the past. If one travels to Australia, America and Canada one will meet Irish people and the one comment they make is that they want to come home to create a life for themselves and their families in Ireland. The Members opposite should not tell me that this Government does not get the pain; we do. We hear about it every day in our constituency offices, in our families and in our parishes and communities. We understand. There is no easy choice to be made now, and when the necessary adjustments are made we will see a better Ireland. There is no dispute about the Government's overall objective. It is about returning to our people a sustainable economy and ultimately restoring our economic sovereignty. That is the task that was given to us as a Government and the mandate we have been given. We have taken over office as a Government, and it is a little like what happens in any family. Without being derisory, it is like an arranged marriage. There are tensions and teething problems but one does not walk out the door after the first row, go out on the plinth and say, "It is over". To return to my fundamental point, it is easy to run away and hide. I accept that people outside this House are hurting as a result of this Government's decisions in the budget and that there are consequences in taking €2.5 billion from the economy. Do the Members opposite believe we would want to do anything differently? Of course we would. We wish we did not have to make fiscal decisions that impact upon people but the bigger picture is about the people and securing the future of our country, and this Government will do that. We have seen it in many different ways. We saw it earlier today when the Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, published the alcohol strategy. We are tackling the mistakes of the past. The Minister for Health, Deputy Reilly, in ten or 20 years from now, will be seen to have been a very good Minister for Health because he has a vision-----

It is about the totality of our nation. The sovereignty of our people is what this Government and this period in our history is about. As a member of a party in government with Labour, I will be happy to have done our country some service because it is about our people. It is not about the one or two or the Galway tent people. It is about all of the people, an gnáth duine, from the man who stands selling the The Echo in Cork to the man who performs the brain surgery, and all those in between. This is Ireland. We are an Irish nation that deserves a new beginning, a new dawn. This Government is doing that. It is making the tough decisions but it must be done and, in time, we will be recognised for giving our people hope again, unlike those who cut and run.

The Opposition parties which went to the bother of putting together their own proposals to deal with the fiscal adjustment required found they were broadly in line with the size and scale of the deficit reduction which needed to be addressed. However, it is not the macro-economic situation on which we disagree with the Government. The history of what did or did not happen is not at issue. What we are here to discuss is the way in which the Government has decided to implement that €2.5 billion adjustment and, in particular, how it has chosen to spread the pain. We would argue that it has done so in a most unfair and inequitable way. The Minister deserves some credit for consistency because this budget follows two previous ones which were, in the judgment of the OECD and the European Commission, regressive in nature. In other words, they targeted the people who could least afford to pay - the poorest and the sick - and continued to protect a certain cohort of people who are doing better. It is not Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin or anyone else saying that; it is no less than the OECD. I compliment the Minister on a hat-trick. She has delivered another swingeing attack on those who can least afford to pay. We will compliment when it is appropriate to do so.  Deputy Buttimer avoided the real issue here which is why have Fine Gael and the Labour Party continued to protect the better off in society at the expense of the poor, the marginalised and those who are sick and most in need of the protection of the State? It has been carried through in the taxation code - we will deal with that in the Finance Bill - and certainly in this Bill. It is an attack on the young, the old, young mothers attempting to bring up families and on young unemployed people and it is exceptionally unfair. For a long time, the Labour Party in opposition bleated about this cohort of people and often referred to them as the marginalised - the people who needed our support and assistance. However, since going into government, the Labour Party has sadly abandoned that group of people. It promised much but has delivered very little in that regard. I understand why Deputy Buttimer would come into the House all guns blazing because the people who elected Fine Gael are largely untouched by the impact of not only this budget but of the previous two budgets and it seems that will continue.  On 28 October 2008 when dealing with social welfare payments, the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, then an Opposition Deputy, said it has been clear for a number of years that this Government, that is, the then Government, cannot protect the sick and it is now clear it does not want to protect the elderly or those with disabilities. It would be worth reminding the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch, that her party, when it crossed the floor and went into coalition with Fine Gael, continued to do what she accused the previous Government of doing but to a far greater extent, as adjudged by the OECD and others.  The Labour Party in opposition rolled out the red carpet and welcomed all on board. It took a broad net approach, told people what they wanted to hear and welcomed them on to the magic carpet but when it got into government, it pulled the rug clean out from under them. It is an appalling vista to see members of the Labour Party come into the House to attack their own Minister. I listened to what Deputy Keaveney had to say. I know he is relatively close to the Minister and has supported her in the past but he struck at the heart of what is concerning people, that is, that the Minister continues to fly this flag that somehow she is the victim in all of this. It is getting to a point where picking up the Sunday newspapers is nauseating because it is all about the poor Minister who is the victim in all of this but she is swinging the axe across the back of the neck of some people who can least afford it and that is unfair. It is a pity the Minister does not stand up and at least have the guts to admit what she is doing and not hide behind this continuous charade of not cutting core provision to people on the social welfare code. Of course, everything is packaged in how one defines "core". For those depending on a bereavement grant, that is a core component of their expenditure at a particular time when they most need it. It ill behoves certain elements in the Government to say to people to shop around and haggle with the undertaker.

When it comes to death, that is most acute. This is one of the most outrageous cuts in this Bill. People cannot haggle with the undertaker and they will go to whoever is available. There is usually only one person in an area in rural Ireland, so it is not as if one can haggle or force down the price. I am not a particular fan of Joe Duffy's radio show but I happened to be in the car today when it was on. An elderly lady, who was quite distraught, said that with this Government we cannot afford to live but now we cannot afford to die. It was quite heart-rending to hear an elderly person who is worried about her husband and how she will face the crisis of trying to deal with the personal loss and the financial burden associated with it. The Minister can wrap herself in the Sunday newspapers and believe she has somehow won the war and convinced some journalist that the issue should not fall at her feet. However, she will not convince that woman who was on Joe Duffy's radio show today that she has not been implicated in these swingeing cuts or that somehow a core payment has not been impacted. The reduction in the jobseeker's allowance for those under 25 is an insult to young people. We are trying to give confidence to young people to create employment and to seek work but we are now saying to them that they are somehow lesser individuals and that they do not deserve as much as others. Many people are married with a family at 25 years of age but we are saying they are somehow a lesser entity. That is an outrageous way to instil confidence in the youth of this country - the people to whom we turn to drive this country forward. Youth unemployment is out of line in Ireland. Some 30.5% of the 15 to 24 age cohort are unemployed while the average in Europe is approximately 22.9%. Again, those are OECD figures. It is discriminatory and pro-emigration as young people who find themselves out of work will leave. There is an indication that standardisation is a way to resolve the issue of maternity benefit. Some 3% will gain while 97% will lose.When the cut in maternity benefit is taken together with what was inflicted last year, it has the effect of taking approximately €70 from the purses of young mothers. That is disgraceful and despicable. I will conclude by referring again to a quotation I used during last night's Private Members' debate. In November 2005, when the Minister for Social Protection was in opposition, she described the then Government's proposals as being "as worthy of credibility as an Al Capone declaration of innocence". If she was to apply that statement to her continuous bleating to the effect that neither she nor her Government colleagues have reduced core social welfare pay, it would be an apt and fitting recognition of her ineptitude in this regard.

The Minister claims to have protected the primary rates of social welfare. She might have done that in her own terms, but I suggest she has slashed and burned all around her to devastating effect. A rose by any other name is still a rose and a cut by any other name is still a cut. It is important to highlight how big the cuts have been. Every year, the Minister tells us she has kept the big bad wolf - the Department of Finance - from the door and single-handedly reduced the cut. When one digs into the figures, however, one finds this is an illusion - an accountancy sleight of hand performed by a Minister who is an accountant - rather than the reality. The Minister announces a headline cut every year. The figure for the first year of her term in office was €475 million, the figure for the second year was €390 million and the figure for the third year was €290 million. She never tells us that each year's figure is merely the current-year saving. As some changes do not kick in until well into the year, one has to wait until the full-year saving is known before one knows how big the cut is in the long term. When one examines the budget out-turn for the year in which the €475 million cut was announced, one finds that the actual cut was €811 million. In the year for which a cut of €390 million was announced, the actual cut was €452 million. We do not know the figure for this year - the Minister is smart - because the full-year saving is not put on the table on budget day. The reality is that the Minister has cut an average of over €500 million from the social welfare budget every year since she came into office. The public is wise to this. When people are presented with big numbers, they look more closely at the detail of how they will be affected. The Minister cut every child benefit payment by €10, but she cut the payment to fourth and subsequent children by much more, thereby particularly affecting large families. She cut the back to education allowance from €305 to €200, or from €200 to €100, depending on the age of the child. She abolished the back to education allowance that was paid in respect of children between the ages of two and four. She cut the maximum maternity grant, which is what most people were getting, from €260 a week to €230 a week. Having finished with the children of the nation, she moved on to vulnerable families. She reduced the age that the youngest child in a single-parent family has to be in order for the parent to no longer qualify for the one-parent family allowance from 14 to seven. In the case of rent supplement, which is the subject of the most severe means test of all, she increased dramatically to €40 a week the rental contribution that has to be made by the poorest cohort of people. This year, to add insult to injury, she has abolished the mortgage interest supplement. This means the withdrawal of the State support that has been offered for many decades to people who lose their jobs while they are waiting to get new jobs. Of course the Labour Party has never had any grá for farmers. The Minister has changed the means testing rules that apply to farm assist payments. As a result, regardless of how hard one works on one's little farm, the Minister will take back from one's social welfare payment 100% of what one earns on that farm. It is the highest rate of tax in the whole country. We hear millionaires complaining about a 50% tax, but this is a 100% tax on small farmers, in effect. It is being overseen by a Minister who talks about encouraging enterprise. It is costing many families up to €100 per week in lost social welfare payments. Having finished with the farmers, the Minister moved on to older people. She reduced the period of time for which fuel allowance is paid from 32 weeks to 26 weeks. This represented a cut of €120 per annum, or over €2 a week. Having initially cut the electricity allowance from 2,400 units to 1,800 units, the Minister got really smart and converted it into cash. When she decided to give people the same amount of cash regardless of the cost of electricity, she was saying that she did not care how expensive electricity gets. Given that energy costs rise inexorably, this was a cut, in effect. In the old days, one's units covered the price of electricity as it went up. As we all know, she abolished the free telephone rental allowance, which was worth more than €20 a month, in two steps. For some reason, she has an awful set against women.

I would say that in 90% of cases, the people who are hurt by this kind of rule change are the women of Ireland. The Minister also cut the respite grant by €325, from €1,700 to €1,375. Having hit elderly people and those who need care, she decided this year to hit the dead by abolishing the bereavement grant of €850.

Her cuts are mean all the time. This year, she has gone after young people aged 22, 23, 24 or 25 who do not have jobs by cutting their payments to €100 a week. The Minister has gone after those who are creating employment by taking away the safety net that existed in the form of the rebate on redundancy payments. Many employers will now be reluctant to take people on because if they have to leave people go, they will face the full cost of redundancy payments. Basically, the Minister thinks people will be fooled if she repeats the mantra that she has not cut primary rates. The reality is that she has cut virtually everybody - children, families, young people, the sick and the old.

I think we can all agree that the past few years have not been easy. We have had tough budgets.This year is no exception. Every Department has had to make savings and cuts and the Department of Social Protection is no different. It had to make savings of €226 million this year which was no easy feat. Despite the cuts we have managed to maintain the State pension, the carer's allowance, the disability allowance and, despite what is said, all other core payments upon which people rely. Child benefit and the respite care grant have been protected. Although we are not in the financial position we would like to be in, when we exit the bailout at the end of the year we will start to see a huge lift in our economy. That said, we still have a huge problem with emigration and with finding jobs and creating employment for young people. That was a big issue for me throughout the by-election. I like to think of myself as a young person. It is not too long since I was in my early twenties and I know how difficult it can be to be that age. Many things are going on in one's life, apart from work and education and upsets in those areas create hassle. This Government understands that. I do, however, support the changes in jobseeker's allowance. For the most part people want to work. They want to educate themselves and to earn their own money. The changes in the allowance place a greater emphasis on work, training and educational supports, instead of focusing on income supports. It is right to reward those who make the effort to educate themselves further, either through work or education. The more people are at work, the sooner our economy will recover. I do not mind saying that I do not believe that a person who is 18 and has just left school should automatically be handed €144 without even trying to look for employment or going into further education or training, to learn a trade or a craft. I certainly did not receive that sum at that age. Young people need to be ambitious and in this country they generally are. There is a time in all our lives when we can enjoy ourselves and not focus on serious things. I would prefer to be part of a government that creates an environment in which young people want to stay. Otherwise, they will emigrate, not because they are not getting enough money from the State but because there is nothing here for them to grab onto. We drive them away because we do not provide for their needs. The Minister for Social Protection has done a lot of work in the background, negotiating the youth guarantee, which will be introduced next year. There are many positive things in the budget for young people, despite what the Opposition says. With the matching funding next year from the EU a fund of at least €100 million will be pumped into youth employment initiatives. That money will help us to develop opportunities that are already there for young people. We need to extend them. We will consider internships, new places on Tús schemes targeted at young people, and new places on JobBridge. The Department of Education and Skills will ring-fence at least 2,000 jobs. We are considering supports for the self-employed. Irish people are ambitious but if they are not given the support to run with new ideas or new jobs they will find it impossible to fund themselves. Under the youth guarantee scheme we will incentivise employers to take on young people. Many positive initiatives are happening. We are far better off providing tools for the younger generation to go out and work for itself and make an input into society instead of creating a social welfare culture in which people do not help themselves or this country, and do not realise their full potential. I support the Bill.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	516	I would like to point out a couple of key figures that influenced the way the budget was put together. Every journalist and every house in this country should know that the adjustment was €2.5 billion not €3.1 billion, as per the first request of the troika. We should also look back further to when Fianna Fáil agreed a memorandum of understanding with the troika, signed by the late Brian Lenihan and Brian Cowen in which the adjustment for this year would be another €1 billion more, due to a promissory note which was over-onerous and because the interest rate on the moneys provided by the European Central Bank was high. This has been re-negotiated to the tune of €620 million. These figures were provided by the Department of Finance. In reality the adjustment would be €4.1 billion or more if Fianna Fáil, the Independents and the Greens were in government today. The memorandum of understanding states that for 2014 the budget for the Department of Social Protection should be €18.6 billion, that is €1.7 billion more than is being taken out here. We will spend €20.3 billion looking after 2.2 million people who receive social protection payments, from old age benefit to child benefit and everything that exists between. It is a bit rich for people to come in here and apologise for bankrupting the country, for having left us at junk bond status and in a position where the IMF, an organisation that is typically brought into sub-Saharan countries to save their people from going bankrupt, had to come in. This embarrassment was not brought upon us by this Government but it will be removed by this Government. Those black and white figures do not lie. There is €1.7 billion less being taken out of the Department of Social Protection than would have been taken out under the memorandum of understanding signed by the Greens, Independents and Fianna Fáil. I would like Fianna Fáil Members to tell us where would they have made that €1.7 billion extra in cuts? They should be honest with us and let us know what they would have done to people.

Ten years ago I was a Member of the Seanad and I remember coming in here to the Dáil Chamber to see the then Minister's Budget Statement. That was a giveaway, easy budget. Charlie McCreevy was almost carried shoulder high. In the smoking area in the Members' bar there was a sing-song, a piano accordion and a bit of Irish dancing by the Fianna Fáil Members who are now so upset that they went missing five years ago. Where are they now? They are not here to debate and listen to exactly what is being said about this Bill. They should come in here and listen to what we have to say. It is an insult to this House that the Fianna Fáil Members are not here to represent their party in a serious debate. I welcome the reduction in the jobseeker's allowance to try to get people back to work. On Saturday night I was in a hotel in Northern Ireland, 15 miles from the Border. The staff in that hotel were all local, and happy to work. There is hardly one local person working in any hotel in this country. Fair play to the people coming into the country who work extremely hard and provide a very good service. There are tens of thousands of jobs in the service industry. The Minister is trying to get people off social welfare and back to work. I thank the Minister very much for taking those courageous first steps and I look forward to seeing people back at work in indigenous industries.

I am delighted to have the chance to say a couple of words on this Bill. Having listened to a couple of speakers from Fianna Fáil, I do not know what planet they are on. I listened to Deputy Ó Cuív saying how tough the budget is and how the Minister, Deputy Burton, has done nothing but cut since she came into office. Does he realise what he handed over to us? First, let us go through his budget in 2010. The main points were: a 4% cut in social welfare payments, excluding the State's old age pension. He cut the basic rates. Child benefit decreased by €16 a month, although it remained unchanged in welfare dependent families, I will say that much for him. Fianna Fáil reduced the jobseeker's allowance for 20 or 21 year olds to €100 per week. They talk today as if the reduction in jobseeker's allowance for young people is something new. Fianna Fáil brought it in for the wrong reason.It brought it in just to save money. It did not bring it in with a real commitment to young people, a youth guarantee and youth activation measures. It never heard of the youth guarantee despite the fact that it was used all over Europe at the time. That is what we had under Deputy Ó Cuív. He tried to pick on the Minister today as though she is in here just to cut for fun. Do people think this Government really wants to be unpopular? Do they think we enjoy making cuts? We do not. That is not what we came in here to do. We came in here to turn the country around - to take a dysfunctional country, fix it and get it working again. That is happening but it is not by luck, chance or anything else. It is through good governance and management by two political parties and in fairness, some good opposition in some cases. I will admit that but we had years of mismanagement before that which put us in that place. It is crazy for Deputy Ó Cuív of all people to sit there and act as if he is amazed that there must be any cuts at all.  The previous Government handed over a basket case of a country. I listened to Deputy Ó Cuív recently defending Brian Cowen, other leaders and Deputy Martin for their role in managing the economy. They claimed they did great things when they were here. Yes, it was great that the pension went up to €230 but the foundations were not there to keep it. It is amazing how this Minister has been able to keep it because the public finances were not put in place to keep all the nice things Fianna Fáil claimed it gave us over the years. All the commitments the previous Government made in each Department since 2001 and 2002 were built on foundations of sand because it put all the eggs of this country into one basket - construction. When construction declined, so did our tax base to fund all these nice things that everybody wanted. The previous Government did not put in place a proper economy to pay for the services that the young, old and middle-aged need. We are trying to turn that around and build an economy based on enterprise and exports - not selling houses to each other. That does not make a country rich in the long term. That is what the previous Government did.  To understand why we are here, Fianna Fáil in government let the budget of the Department of Health go from €3 billion to €15 billion in ten years yet we did not get a health service that was five times better. We got a dysfunctional health service that did not spend money in the right places and did not deliver the health service everyone needed. The people concerned wanted to do it and to try their best but the systems were never put in place to spend that money correctly. Likewise, the spend in many Departments went up and up based on taxes from housing and yet no real reforms took place. We now have Ministers like the Minister for Social Protection and the Minister for Health who are bringing in reforms to make things sustainable in the long run.  It is a pity that we must have social welfare Bills that do involve some cuts and changes that will inflict pain on certain people. It is minimised as much as possible but reducing anything for anybody will cause them a small amount of pain. It will affect some more than others. What we are trying to do in this Bill is to protect the most vulnerable. I have listened to mainly Fianna Fáil spokespersons and probably Sinn Féin Deputies call this budget an attack on the vulnerable. I did not get the chance to listen to all the speeches. It is not. It is an attempt to pick out the areas where one can make some changes without inflicting too much pain on anybody. One does one's best to protect the vulnerable, the elderly and the young but with each budget, it gets a bit harder to protect everybody and keep all those areas. We gave a commitment to protect the basic rates and, amazingly, we have protected them given the public finances handed over to us by the previous Government. That is a commitment.  We also said that we do not believe in constantly taxing jobs because this country is short of jobs. I have no problem with higher taxes at the right time but it is not the right time because we need to win and create new jobs so one cannot keep taxing jobs one does not have. A total of 80% of increases and charges in the first four austerity budgets were on jobs. They were on income tax so one cannot keep doing that. It is not as easy as using the magic pen that Fianna Fáil or Sinn Féin now have and simply putting more taxes on people. That is not the solution because we did that for years. We want to win new jobs. If one raises taxes too much, one will not win those jobs.  I will turn to some of the facts in the Bill. I listened to Deputy Dooley telling me that this is an attack on young people. He also forgets that Fianna Fáil brought in the first reduction in rates for young people. That was its choice. This time, it has been done as part of a strategy because it makes sense to do one's best to encourage young people with carrot, and with stick if necessary, to get into education, training or work where possible. We know that a job does not exist for everybody. We wish there was. Our aim is to get there eventually but one will not do it overnight. One will not do it in six months or even one year but we will get there over a number of years. In the meantime, while one is trying to create a job for everybody, one must keep them as close to the workforce as possible. That is why we have documents like Pathways to Work and why we have the youth guarantee for whose implementation and funding the Minister for Social Protection fought hard in Europe. This is funding upon which we will draw to spend in this country to guarantee young people a future. Yes, they might have a little bit less in social welfare for a few years but they have a future because we will make sure of this through the money being spent on labour activation, of which over €1 billion is for youth activation measures. The budget provides about €15 million for the youth guarantee drawing on some of the European money. That is targeted at young people to get them back to work and into education and training.  I hear people saying that this is not fair, that it will drive young people to emigrate and that young people do not stay at home. That is not the case. Most young people want to get out there, get a job and go to college but there is a percentage that is not engaging. People have used the term NEETs - not in education, employment or training. It is a very common term all over Europe. I believe 20% of young people in this country are in that category. They are not in education, employment or training. They are the ones we are trying to tackle because that is not good for them. Never mind the fact that it is not good for the economy, it is not good for them. It does not secure their future. The percentage of people in that category all over Europe is between 12% and 13%. The last set of CSO figures tells us that there are a number of young people who are not engaged in any system. That cannot continue, which is why we have a policy that stipulates that if a person does not take up a training place, a place in college or a job, the rate of their social welfare payment will be cut. If they take up any of these offers, it will not be cut. The person will be €60 better off if they get involved in their future. That is a wise thing to do. If one wants to grab the headlines, it might not look like a nice thing to do but when one reads the details, it makes sense. That is what we are trying to do as a Government even in bad times. We are trying to do things that make sense. Naturally, we would like to give everybody plenty of money but it is not possible because the money is not there. We are only kidding ourselves about what we have and do not have.  I know the medical card is not part of this Bill but all these people are speaking as if we are taking the medical card off everybody. We are not. Yes, some will lose it and I wish they did not lose it, as do all of us because we all know that a medical card gives great security to a person or family. However, we got a commitment from the Taoiseach yesterday that those who need it will get it. We are not stupid. We deal with medical cards in our offices every day of the week. Some people slip through the net. People who need it do not get it and we must fix that. Individually, we all work hard to make sure they get it back and this happens in most cases. However, there was no announcement that everybody's card would be taken back. That is not what was said. If one works it out, the majority of those over 70 will keep it. Yes, about 3% or 4% might eventually lose it but they would be regarded as having sufficient means. One tries to stretch it to make sure that those who do need it get it because all of us here know people who need a medical card but do not have one because they are just over the guidelines, missed out or did not know how to beat the system. That is why we must help rearrange the finances to make sure those who need it most get it. Yes, it does mean that sometimes a certain percentage of people over 70 might lose it but that is what one is trying to do with competing resources. One cannot do everything one might like to do. We must be honest with ourselves here. We would like to do more but we cannot always do that so we try to maximise resources as best we can and spend the money in the right place.  I heard complaints about maternity benefit. Yes, it is a shame that it will be reduced for some people. It is still there and the six months are there but it is a short-term payment. Any young mother with whom I have spoken would rather have kept that money but understands that her family is much better off having free GP care for under fives.That was introduced for primary health reasons rather than as an economic measure but it also has economic benefits. Families are much better off because the GP card is preferable to a payment that lasts only six months.

If people had no work or no private wealth they starved and their families starved. The only form of State assistance, if it could be called that, was the poor house, and to go there was to be condemned to a prison-like existence and the breaking up of your family. Even if people had work they lived in fear of illness because illness meant loss of a job. Over the following decades working people in Ireland and throughout the world fought and struggled for better pay and conditions and for health and social services that offered them protection. Through those efforts the resources of the State were built up in order to care for the children, the aged, the sick and the disabled. Make no mistake, the austerity regimes that are being imposed across Europe, and not least in this country, are rolling back those social protections and public services that were so hard won by generations of working people. There are those in politics and big business who would roll them back even further to pauperise working people once again in the interests of profit for a tiny elite. Budget 2014 and this Social Welfare and Pensions Bill arise out of that austerity agenda and that austerity mind-set. In advance of budget 2014, and despite the fact that last year, it cut child benefit, jobseeker's allowance and other basic payments, the coalition was claiming it was protecting core social welfare rates. It was a lie then and it is an even bigger lie now in the wake of budget 2014. As Sinn Féin spokesperson on children I deplore this Bill because it is an anti-children Bill. The cut to maternity benefit is anti-children and anti-women. With this Bill the coalition wants to impose, for the majority of maternity benefit recipients, a cut of €832 over their six months of leave, or €32 per week. Mothers who have maternity benefit supplemented by their employers will lose out significantly from the cumulative effect of this cut and of tax measures. This will undoubtedly increase the financial pressure on mothers and young families, forcing mothers to return to work earlier than is appropriate for the best care of the child in infancy and her own health. Although not in this Bill because they were imposed in last year's budget and held over, a nasty surprise is waiting in January 2014 when the child benefit cuts for the fourth and subsequent children kick in. This is how the Labour Party continues to protect child benefit as it promised before the 2011 general election. The illness benefit and injury benefit cuts are cynical, especially at a time when workers' terms and conditions of employment are worsening with the likes of punitive zero-hour contracts where, as in 1913, working hours are determined week to week or even day to day entirely at the discretion of the employer and with no minimum period of employment guaranteed. This means that a significant and growing minority of workers do not get sick pay from their employers but must rely on direct payment of illness benefit and injury benefit. This Bill doubles the number of days without payment of those benefits from three to six, representing a cut of €112.80. The debate on the Bill comes in the week when the Department of Social Protection has confirmed that it is sending out letters to jobseekers with offers of work in Canada. The landlords in this country once hired coffin ships to Canada to clear their estates of excess tenants. There are whole areas of Canada where my county constitutes the largest historic connection between Ireland and Canada. Now we have a native Government encouraging emigration to Canada and Australia and to places all over the globe. Of course it is not just letters from the Department that are encouraging emigration. Quite shamefully in this Bill the Government targets the already meagre jobseeker's allowance payment for young people and reduces it even further. This is based on the spurious assumption that somehow vast numbers of young people are shirking work, education or training. I refute that. It is an insult to the talented young people of this country. The jobs are simply not here. There are not nearly enough training places and for many young people further education is inaccessible and unaffordable. It has been estimated that the cuts to jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance will hit over 20,000 young people in 2014. This is a charter for emigration, without question, but it is also a charter for employers to drive down wages and conditions even further. The JobBridge scheme is basically a free labour scam for employers. The paltry dole for young people, which is down to €100 per week for under 25s, is topped up with a €50 JobBridge payment for which people are expected to do a week's work in a so-called internship scheme. I applaud the Irish National Teachers Organisation for instructing its members not to participate in this cheap labour scheme dressed up as training. Several schools have offered such places to qualified primary teachers. While it is claimed these positions cannot displace existing staff or fill a current vacancy, the reality of short-staffing in schools means that participants would effectively be filling gaps created by cutbacks. At the end of the term of cheap labour there is no guarantee of a job. Cutting pay and welfare payments to subsistence levels is punishing for families and individuals, as well as disastrous for struggling local economies in communities throughout this country. It means less money is being spent in local shops and on local services. The impact of dole cuts on young people in the poorest families is of huge concern. It is predicted that it will lead to increased homelessness among young people at a time when in budget 2014 the Government has once again slashed funding for housing and homeless services. Children, young people and our older citizens are penalised in this Bill. Social Justice Ireland estimates that 88% of those over 65 years of age would be at risk of poverty were it not for social security payments. Attacking older citizens is attacking the vulnerable. Disgracefully, the telephone allowance, which forms part of the household benefits package, is being abolished in this Bill in order to reduce spending by €44 million. This follows cuts of €84 million in the household package in budget 2013. This is a loss of €19 per week for older people. The cut to the invalidity pension for 65 year olds is another nasty measure in this Bill that will cost 65 year old disabled pensioners €36.80 per week. This cut is disguised as the discontinuation of the higher rate of invalidity pension for people who turn 65. Those who had that expectation will now have to wait another year. Older people are also hit with the increased prescription charges and the cuts to medical cards. The scrapping of the bereavement grant is a lousy measure, showing that the Government is prepared to take money out of people's pockets from the cot to the coffin. Let us remember, there is a very significant cumulative effect for older citizens over several budgets because in recent years we have seen reductions in the fuel allowance, the abolition of the Christmas bonus and cuts to home help services. The cumulative effect of successive budgets is felt across all social welfare recipients. I have no doubt we will see this when we are back on the ground and rooted in our respective constituencies. They now face the family home tax, or the so-called local property tax, with a full year payment in 2014 and the imposition of water charges after that. Local authority tenants face the prospect of increased rents under the promised new State wide rental scheme. A significant element of this rent increase will be based on the local authority's liability for the family home tax on its residential properties which, if Minister Hogan gets his way, will be passed on to tenants. Regardless of how the Minister for Social Protection and her colleagues try to dress up this Bill, it is a mean and nasty austerity Bill that penalises the least well off in society. They are being made to suffer yet again because this Government has set its face against taking more from those who can afford to pay more and against the real alternative economic strategies that have been set out by Sinn Féin and others.I reject this Bill.

This is not to say that they got off lightly under Fianna Fáil previously, a fact that they will not forget. Many of the people who have come to me in trouble due to the Government's austerity policies can remember as far back as the Fianna Fáil election campaign of 1987 when that party, under Charles Haughey, put up election posters all over this city and State that read: "Health cuts hurt the old, the sick and the handicapped." Fianna Fáil claimed that there was a better way, but God knows it was not better under Fianna Fáil. Nor has it been better under this Government. The older constituents have been hard hit by this budget. The nastiest cuts are the ones that make it more difficult for them to have telephones and the one that removes the bereavement grant under section 8 of the Bill. We as a people put great store in how we bury our dead. It is an important part of how we deal with the grief caused by the death of a loved one. It is a matter of love and pride for any family, widow or widower to know that a loved one was given a decent funeral. How cruel would one need to be to devise this cut? I would love to know who sat around a table and presented this proposal. Was it a member of the Cabinet or one of the gang or four? The young did not escape either. In section 9, the Minister reinforces the call to our young people to emigrate by cutting their jobseeker's payments, encouraging them to go. Despite the denials by many of the Minister's party colleagues and backbenchers that there were no cuts to jobseeker's payments, Deputy Feighan congratulated her 15 or 20 minutes ago on her decision to cut them. It is disturbing that the Department of Social Protection is actively encouraging people to emigrate. We in Sinn Féin have always suspected that the Government's main tool to reduce unemployment figures was emigration. The letters that have been sent out in recent days prove this. I have a letter from the Department. It refers to a vacancy, a vacancy number and employer details. According to it, the Department had been advised of a vacancy that might have been of interest to the person concerned. The location was in Canada, with salaries and conditions to be advised. This is what the Department under Deputy Burton's Ministry and this Government is sending to people across the country. A young man in Tralee received two letters from the Department on the same day informing him of a vacancy in Canada. The crazy aspect is that he has been in full-time employment since the start of the summer. Not only is the Government encouraging unemployed people to leave the country, but also employed people. The individual in question went through a State-sponsored training course for eight months with more than a dozen other people. It looks like we are training people for export like cattle. Given the recent budget reductions in respect of young unemployed people, the use of schemes such as JobBridge, which is clearly being exploited for cheap labour, and now this, it is clear that the Government is trying to make this country a cold house for young people. I travel all over the west and south coasts and am very much involved in the GAA. In every single rural area that I visit, youth clubs are finding it difficult to field teams because young people have been forced out of the country to Canada, Australia, America and England to find employment. Nor is it just young people. Due to drastic cuts and restrictions, people who are employed are also being forced to leave the country. The only way the Government can manipulate the figures is by forcing young people away. For this reason, Deputy Feighan congratulated the Minister on doing a good job by cutting jobseeker's payments. She should be ashamed of herself.

For those who are forced to rely on social welfare, there has been no break or relief in this budget. The Government, in particular the Labour Party, seems determined to stick to the line that it has not cut basic rates of social welfare. How it can continue to trot out that line with a straight face is beyond me. The idea that the Government has not cut basic rates is a fiction more creative than "Love/Hate". There can be no social welfare payment more basic than jobseeker's allowance. When someone is unfortunate enough to lose a job and his or her income dries up, it is the jobseeker's allowance on which that person relies for food, clothing and a roof over his or her head and to take care of his or her family. It is the most basic and fundamental role of a welfare state that we support those who are out of work until they have the opportunity to work again and that, in the meantime, we give them enough to live on with some degree of dignity. The Government has made all sorts of weak and cynical arguments to justify this cut. It has tried to peddle the line that young people of this age are often at home with their parents, do not have dependants and do not have the same costs. However, every Deputy knows many young people of that age who are living in their own places. Many of them are married or in long-term relationships. The Government believes that such people will be able to run households on between €100 and €144 per week. It is absurd and insulting. In the long run, the young people affected will not be able to manage. The Minister knows this. In an ugly attack, the Government has also tried to justify this by claiming that young people who are unemployed are lazy and idle and that this is an initiative to rectify a poverty trap. The Taoiseach stated: "Our young people should have the opportunity to be in education and training, not languishing on dole queues." All that this cut does is punish young people. In any case, there are nowhere near enough quality training and education places available to young people at this time. Labour Deputies have referred to young people who are lazy, staring at flat screens all day. The Minister for Social Protection stated: "What we are getting at the moment is people who come into the system straight after school as a lifestyle choice. This is not acceptable, everyone should be expected to contribute and work." That is unacceptable and untrue.

He examined the track record of our young people's ability and desire to work. He examined how Irish people had worked when jobs were available. He wrote that, for young people aged between 20 and 24 years between 2004 and 2006, the Irish employment rate was the fourth highest in the EU 15, considerably above the average of other EU 15 countries. There would be a high level of people in that age group still in education, but nearly 70% of Irish youth were working. Michael Taft also examined the category of people aged between 25 and 29 years, when people have by and large left full-time education. He found that this group's employment rate was the second highest in the EU 15, way above the average. It fell to fourth lowest in 2012, just above other peripheral countries. The work is not there. There are 32 people unemployed for every vacancy. No amount of moralising to young people will change that. The Government has given up on helping or supporting our young people. A generation has been deemed expendable. I resent this deeply and hope that it comes back to haunt the Government. It is far from the young alone who have been hit by this appalling Bill. The sick, elderly and those struggling with mortgages are all taking a big hit. In section 4, the waiting time for illness benefit has been doubled from three to six days, effectively bringing it in to a second week. This could do one of two things - either cause a sick person to go without at a time when they should not have to or the employer will carry the can, thus placing further pressure on small businesses. There are cuts to maternity benefit, putting expectant mothers under severe pressure financially, and cuts to the adoption grant. I am particularly disgusted at the ending of the bereavement grant. This Bill will cause genuine suffering and hardship. I hope government Deputies will reflect on the suffering their constituents will endure when they troop through the lobbies.
#RobertDowds	unknown-#RobertDowds-party	unknown-#RobertDowds-dob	unknown-#RobertDowds-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	556	Having listened to the last few speakers, one would think that the Minister, Deputy Burton, sat up in bed at night thinking about how she could punish people. I happened to meet her a few days before the budget and she was clearly distressed by the fact that she would have to cut anything at all. Every effort of hers was aimed at minimising the budget's negative impact. That is the type of person she is and the public knows that. Nobody wants to stand over a situation where cuts have to be introduced. The thrust of the Government's work is to get the whole county back in line so that more people are employed and the country can afford to provide health, social welfare and other services. I wish to address two main areas. The first concerns the removal of the €850 bereavement grant. Clearly this is regrettable but there is a lot of misunderstanding about the situation. It is important to draw attention to all the supports that are there for bereaved families. I will list them because listening to some speakers one would think there were no such supports. For example, various social welfare payments, including the State pension, remain for six weeks following a death. The widowed person still gets a once-off payment of €6,000 where there is a dependent child. A person who dies as a result of an accident at work gets a funeral grant of €850. For those who are unable to pay, there continues to be an exceptional needs payment which averages at €2,000. It is important for people to realise that those supports are there. My second point concerns the under 25s. We would all prefer if nobody's money was being cut but it is worth remembering that the 22 to 24-year-olds will get at least €144 per week. That is more than double the sum of £56.80 paid in Britain and Northern Ireland. Greater job activation measures aimed at the younger cohort of the population are useful and constitute a valuable asset for our community. For example, the Department of Education and Skills is ring-fencing a minimum of 2,000 additional training spaces for the under-25s.  Proposals under the youth guarantee scheme will incentivise employers to offer more job opportunities. In addition, the JobsPlus eligibility level will move from 12 months to six months for those under 25. There will be an additional intake of 1,500 in the JobBridge scheme and 1,000 places will be created on Tús schemes to target young people.  The Minister, Deputy Burton, is aiming at creating a situation whereby people will be ready to take up jobs as our economy lifts up. We want everybody to think in terms of having a job, thus working for themselves and for their community. In an earlier contribution, my colleague, Deputy McNamara, said that even when things were good, 15% of families had no work. We do not want to see people on the dole, however, and so we are preparing for that economic upturn.  It is important to keep checking the job activation measures to see that they are working effectively, but we must alter them where necessary. Labour means work and Labour is the party of work. We believe in work for all and we will not rest easily until we achieve this.

I welcome the two Fianna Fáil Deputies in the Chamber, which is good to see. They had abandoned the Chamber for most of the evening but they are now back. I might suggest to them that when they speak about budgets and social welfare they could start off by apologising to the people of Ireland for the mess they left the country in when the last Government collapsed. They should start every sentence by saying, "We are so sorry for the mess, hardship and misery we caused". That would be a great start and they might have some credibility if they began to criticise what we are trying to do in turning around this awful mess. Things are improving dramatically, however. There is more traffic on the road, there is more activity and there are signs of an uplift. Our Sinn Féin friends seem to relish words like "disastrous", "crisis" and "misery". Everything for them is "appalling", "shocking" and "terrible".

Some 19% of tax is paid by the top 1% of earners, while 41% is paid by the top 5% of earners. Some 77% of tax is paid by the top 23% of earners, while 14% of workers do not pay any tax at all. That is impressive and progressive. The Minister for Social Protection is doing a very good job. The expectation was that her Department would have to cut a lot more but that did not happen. There have been no changes in weekly social welfare payments for all 1.45 million current beneficiaries. There have been no changes in child benefit or the fuel allowance. The free travel pass, free television, electricity, gas and over-80s allowance have remained the same. The State pension for older people has been maintained at current levels. The half-rate carer's allowance is to be maintained and the extra weekly payments for carers for more than one person will be retained. We should examine the Government's macro-economic strategy which is focused on trying to get more people back to work. That is ultimately what it is all about. I know many people who started off on the JobBridge scheme and are now in full-time employment. I have met employers and employees who are delighted with the scheme. I would like to make two suggestions to the Minister in relation to JobBridge, the first of which is that start-up businesses be allowed to take on more than two interns. I have met employers who would like to do so. SMEs with fewer than ten employees should also be allowed to take on two interns. Second, the Minister might consider shortening the length of time in respect of which people must be unemployed before qualifying for JobBridge. Currently, the requirement in this regard is 12 months. I believe it should be reduced to six months or less.  There is scope to do more with JobBridge. This is what I and my colleagues are being told by employers and employees. The scheme is very successful. Six months is a long time to be unemployed. If people unemployed for six months were allowed to access JobBridge employers could take on more employees, some of which could be permanent positions, and create more business. This is already happening under the scheme as established. I would welcome the extension of the scheme to persons unemployed for six months, if possible. In the UK, there is a cap on benefits. I congratulate the Minister on not introducing a cap here, although it is something that should be considered in the longer term. There are other things happening about which I am concerned. For example, I understand an issue arises in regard to social welfare payments being exempt from the Fines Bill. However, that is a matter for another day. It is important it is easy to move from social welfare benefits to work and vice versa. We need to put in place more measures to allow this to happen.  I would like now to speak a little about illness and so on. I was struck recently by the number of people in Ireland on disability benefit. Tens of thousands of people have left the workforce due to disability. This has occurred despite that we have a younger and healthier workforce. Since 2006, there has been a 37.7% increase in the number of people who have left the labour force, citing a condition that substantially limits one or more basic physical activity. Many people cite psychological and emotional conditions. The question we must ask is how has our population become dramatically more unhealthy during the past few years and is the State recognising conditions which up to now were not regarded as conditions which deemed people unfit for work? David McWilliams has done a lot of work in this area, which I have been examining carefully. In a perverse type of way some of our schemes incentivise people to be unwell. Perhaps we should be incentivising people to be well. We all know the power of the mind. One can almost convince oneself to be unwell. I accept that there are people who are genuinely unwell and people with genuine disabilities. We must be careful not to categorise people as fraudulently or genuinely unwell. However, there is a middle ground in this regard. We must focus on fitness, wellness and health. We need to consider incentivising employers to ease people back into the workforce. I know there are already schemes in place which do this but we need to do more. I am alarmed at the number of people currently unwell in our society for one reason or another. We need to undertake more research to find out why this is the case. As stated by David McWilliams, there are some cases that are not legitimate and are fabricated or exaggerated. This makes life more difficult for people who do have disabilities because taxpayers will come to think of all people who are stressed, bullied, immobile or injured as faking it. This is an issue we need to address. We need to ask ourselves if we are in some way or other incentivising people to be unwell and what we are doing to incentivise people to be well. Many of our schools operate the Green Flag system. Perhaps consideration should be given to what can be done in our schools to encourage teachers and children to be healthier during the school year, at the end of which an analysis could be undertaken to see if they have improved over the course of the year. Those schools which are successful could then be awarded a flag, similar to the Green Flag. This would be worth investigating and doing. This year, €19.6 billion will be spent in the area of social protection, which is a huge amount. I know there was pressure on the Minister to reduce that figure. One way of decreasing that amount is to get people back to work. If this means additional training schemes and so forth, so be it. I was recently told by an employer that there was a vacancy in his business, in respect of which the salary was €33,000 per annum, but he was finding it difficult to find someone to fill the position. He was extremely annoyed that this was the case. We need to start linking employers with people looking for jobs. We need to make it easier for people who want to hire to do so. I welcome the change in respect of social welfare offices, which are supposed to be doing this work. It is important we push to ensure it is happening. In 2006, a good friend of mine, the late Seamus Brennan, put forward proposals for supporting lone parents. Despite that those proposals contained some good ideas, nothing in that area has happened since then. I would like to see that debate reopened to see if we can do more in that area.

#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	565	I will come back to Deputy Stanton's remarks later. First, it is important we acknowledge, as we always do when debating social welfare and pensions Bills, the enormous amount of work done by the staff of the Department of Social Protection, including those in its regional offices and thank them for their assistance to us through the Oireachtas inquiry lines. If other Departments were as helpful as the Department of Social Protection, our lives and the lives of those we serve would be an awful lot easier. I heard many Government Deputies refer to work and getting people back to work. One does not have to be in the House to hear what is said here. We all sign up to that desire. However, to provide work one needs to create the conditions in which employers can create jobs. This Bill continues a trend of undermining support for employers and the support available to employees from the Department of Social Protection. For example, illness benefit has now been extended to six days, which will result in a €22 million saving for the Department but which will be passed directly on to small business. The lower rate for employers' PRSI is also being abolished. I spoke to a gentleman last night who employs 14 people, seven full-time and seven part-time, in a retail business. The change in PRSI alone will cost him €10,000 next year. He is also operating in a very difficult environment. The change in PRSI will result in the loss of two of the seven part-time jobs, which people will end up dependent on the Department of Social Protection for support. As I said last night during the debate on older citizens, when one aligns decisions taken by the Department of Social Protection with decisions taken by another Department, some people are getting more than their fair share of the budget hit. Much was said during last night's debate about elderly people and the abolition of the bereavement grant, which does not make any sense in terms of the upset it will cause versus the relatively small saving being made. I know the Minister has outlined the other supports available. However, there are difficulties in accessing those supports. At a time of bereavement there are many demands on the family pocket. This little grant, in terms of the overall cost of a funeral, was a specific allocation used to pay the undertaker's bill. The other issue is the increase in DIRT. I know this is not a social protection initiative, but many people put money aside to pay for their funeral. We are all used to hearing this, and now they will lose whatever little bit of interest they were making on that because of the decision in the budget. Again, it shows how different Departments have different initiatives but nobody seems to be co-ordinating. It is not just this Government that does that, but every government. We need to stop the silo way we have of doing business in this country. Some of the awful cuts in this Bill, such as the single parent tax credit, do not seem to recognise the difficulties that separated couples have when they try to make provision to look after their children collectively, for the sake of family stability. Two parents may be working to support their children and they have different pressures on them. This cut undermines the very difficult circumstances that apply in situations like this when parents try to work together. We have got many e-mails from men - from women as well - which show the efforts that people are making to try to give their family some kind of stability in a break-up situation. This measure undermines those efforts and sends a very bad signal to those who are trying to make those efforts. We had a very good presentation on Pathways to Work at the enterprise and jobs committee a few weeks ago. Much progress is being made in reaching the targets. However, it is one thing to reach the target, but quality is another. How effective are the one-on-one profiles and the interviews in the time that has been given? While that work is being rolled out, the decision to reduce the social welfare component for those new entrants aged under 25 is wrong, given the vacuum that exists. There are still not enough proper activation places for a large cohort of people, and there are still delays in getting it. New entrants have options under the back to education scheme, but it may not suit many of them and we are now reducing their payments to €100. Nobody wants to become dependent on welfare, but I do not think the supports and backup are properly in place yet. Perhaps the Minister might clarify whether a particular emphasis in the Pathways to Work scheme will be put on the targets on those aged 25 and under, but I think this is a very ill judged cut. Coupled with the letters going out to people recommending job vacancies abroad, this sends the wrong message to people. I have spoken already about the cuts to community welfare offices around the country. The Minister and I will agree to disagree on this. I am still not convinced it is the right thing to do. I notice that it is not in the Bill, so I presume that the Minister has to sign an order, but getting rid of the telephone allowance is the wrong decision because it is not just Eircom that is getting the line rental. It is not only the telephone but the pendant. We all like to think we can live without a landline, but we cannot. However, older people are not mobile friendly and in recent years that pendant has become very important. The Minister needs to look at that decision again. It is not part of the Bill, so she has a difficult decision to make. At least she must ensure that the funding to community organisations is ring-fenced to ensure that nobody will lose their landline and then their emergency pendant. From a security and health point of view that does a huge amount of work. Deputy Stanton referred to the issue of illness and invalidity. He has a point there. This is one of my difficulties with the way this Bill is being rammed through the House, for no apparent reason other than to slam down dissent that may arise in Government Buildings. Many of these changes do not take effect until 1 January. In respect of Deputy Stanton's proposals on illness benefit, some good work has been done on the "fit to work" schemes that could have been debated on Committee Stage if there was a proper Committee Stage. The issue in respect of the telephone allowance and the different supports available could have been debated if there was a proper debate. If there is to be any real progress with Dáil reform the first week after we proposed a change in the legislation, the notion is that Second Stage is for speeches and Committee Stage is where it happens, but we are going to ram through Committee Stage in four or five hours tomorrow. This Bill will suffer as a result. Changes that might enhance the Bill, and might enhance the experience for those who need the support of this Bill, could have been done if Committee Stage was debated over a number of weeks in the proper fashion. Deputy Stanton must have got out of the wrong side of the bed this morning. I listened in 2009 and 2010 to the Minister, when she was in opposition, slamming the cuts introduced then. We have heard what the Taoiseach said in 2008 about medical cards and what he is saying this week. Now the Minister is publishing Government funded PR material about all the adjustments being made, without saying that the majority of the adjustment was done under the last Government, every single measure of it opposed bitterly by the Minister. If we should apologise, then perhaps the Government Members should apologise for the false promises made immediately prior to the last election, in full knowledge of the seriousness of the situation. These included the promise not to change welfare rates and other changes that the Government is now making. At the end of the day, people who are in receipt of any payment are looking for an understanding within the political system that this Bill is impacting on many people in a very negative way. Unfortunately, the way it is being rammed through the House will not allow us to examine it sufficiently. The Bill will take effect when enacted and only then will we see the real impact of it, which will be a very negative impact for many hundreds of thousands of people in this country.
#JohnBrowne2	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-party	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-dob	unknown-#JohnBrowne2-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2013-10-24 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	566	I compliment social welfare officials across the country who have been very helpful to us over the last year. They are working under serious constraints. Their offices are understaffed. It is taking 18 months for appeals to be heard and between six and nine months for carer's allowance applications to be dealt with. It is taking months for jobseeker's benefit to be dealt with. There is a problem in that the offices are completely understaffed at the moment. The Minister should look at this issue, particularly in respect of the carer's allowance. The length of time it is taking for people to get approval for carer's allowance is a scandal. I have had many situations in my own county where people applied for carer's allowance and by the time it was approved, the person who needed to be cared had passed away. The Minister should look seriously at that situation. The cuts that the Minister for Finance announced in the budget include the abolition of the bereavement grant, the reduction of jobseeker's allowance and the supplementary welfare allowance for those aged under 25, the abolition of the mortgage interest supplement, the reduction in the maternity benefits and the issues that we are not discussing tonight for some reason, such as the abolition of the telephone allowance, changes to the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance which were seriously reduced, and a reduction in exceptional needs payments, which is causing major problems for poorer families. Then we had the reduction in the ESB allowances as well. The Government has continued to hit the less well off in our society in the last two years. Perhaps the new Deputies are not up to speed with what their older colleagues said prior to the last election, when promises were made to protect the old and the less well off, and that everyone would receive the medical card and so on. Clearly there are were a lot of false statements. Many issues were used before the last election and when the then Opposition parties formed this Government, the tune changed. I would like to raise a couple of issues in respect of young people.The cut in the social welfare payment for young people will have a serious effect. Obviously many people will emigrate to Canada, Australia and America. The Department of Social Protection is already advising people that jobs are available in Canada and so the thinking of the Government seems to be to get more people to emigrate. When young people go on a Tús scheme, community employment scheme or any of the other schemes, after one year they are placed back on the dole queue, which is not right. In many cases the training courses available are not suitable. The south east was very dependent on the building industry over the years. Many young people are out of work because there are no longer jobs in the building industry. These young people are looking for further education and training that is relevant to the jobs available in the region. Most of the jobs available in the south-east region are in farming, fishing or related industries. It is important that the new FÁS training schemes and the other training schemes coming on board should be made relevant to an area. One size does not fit all and it is very important that we have training schemes that are relevant to young people. The social welfare system at present does not encourage people to take up temporary work. While people might get a job for three or four months in the fruit area or other areas, they then find it very difficult to get back on social welfare. This is a major problem that needs to be addressed. As a result people are not taking up temporary work because they claim it takes several weeks to get back on their social welfare. A new system needs to be introduced. I have taken this up with my own Ministers in the past. When people go on a temporary work scheme they should automatically resume getting jobseeker's payment as soon as possible.

It is not help that is needed but action on the ground. I see it in the strawberry industry in Wexford where people get three or four months' work. People in the local area will not take that work because of the difficulty of getting back their jobseeker's payment. That issue needs to be addressed. As Deputy Calleary said, the elimination of the telephone allowance will cause major problems in rural areas in particular. In many cases older people are the only ones who have a landline. People who supply the panic buttons say that a landline is required. I know the Taoiseach and Minister have said that we will talk to those involved in Community Alert and others to see what can be done. It does not cost a huge amount of money and the telephone allowance should be restored to these people as quickly as possible. People in my constituency are very annoyed about the reduction of the bereavement grant. It was not a huge amount of money, but it was significant for older people and families on the breadline. It was another mean cut by the Government. Some people get on FÁS schemes or community employment schemes in general for a year. They go to the local GAA club, rugby club, soccer club or whatever organisation is involved. When the year is up they go back on the dole. They go through all that for the sake of an extra €20 a week. I do not know why this happens. Putting them back on the dole is certainly no help to the person. I do not think it would break the Government if they were allowed to remain on those schemes for a particular time. A number of organisations have informed me that if they were allowed to keep the person, they would pay the €20 a week, which is €1,000 a year. We should be more inventive with these schemes to ensure people stay on them allowing them to stay in some kind of work. People like to get up on the morning and go on the scheme. They like to be involved in the local community and they like to help out those local community organisations. However, dumping them back on the dole at the end of a year is not good enough. I would criticise many of the Government's reductions. When the Minister was on this side of the House, we were lacerated for not giving more - let alone making cuts. This Government's budgets have been regressive and not in the interests of the less well off in our communities. The Minister will need to look again. Perhaps she is unable to fight the battle at the Cabinet table to ensure that the less well-off are protected. I come from Wexford where there has been the heartbeat of Labour for many years. Given the position he now holds, I certainly expected the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to protect the less well-off and vulnerable, including the older people who marched to Leinster House this week to protest at the change in medical cards. However, seemingly the Labour Party has abandoned all of the ideals and beliefs it had throughout the years regarding the less well-off and poor in our society. That is a pity because these people built up the country. They have worked hard on small incomes throughout the years to ensure we had a prosperous country. People like us have been elected to this House to look after and protect them, and to ensure they have a decent standard of living. Somewhere along the way the Labour Party has abandoned these ideals. I do not know why.

I was trying to imagine a budget that would be welcomed by those on low and middle incomes, by those people who have worked all their lives, reared their families and given great service in their communities as opposed to being outside the gates of Leinster House protesting as they have been last week and this week. I was trying to imagine a budget that would be welcomed by those with mental and physical disabilities and by young people. However, we saw the reaction to the budget and see the essential unfairness of it. The Minister met many of the groups making pre-budget submissions. Organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community, and Social Justice Ireland are the ones most directly involved with the people who always tend to be affected most by budgets. There are glaring discrepancies between what the Society of St. Vincent de Paul called for beforehand and its reaction after it. A small point is that those in full-time third level education no longer qualify for the back-to-school clothing and footwear payment. That was fine at a time when there were jobs for people at third level, but they have gone. The one-parent family tax credit will bring independent families into depending on organisations such as the Society of St. Vincent de Paul thereby further increasing the demands on its services. I believe there will be major problems with the measure relating to young people because some of those people are parents, some live with their children and some live apart from their children. They may have been in private rented accommodation but they are now going to be back with their families, putting an extra burden on them. We know there is a major housing crisis in Dublin Central. Therefore, I am unsure where all these people are going to live. For those who do not have a place to live, the changes will drag them into homelessness and we know the demands on those services already. Those who go into emergency hostel accommodation will find it difficult to access training and education. The hostel charge is between €50 and €75 per week. What will be left for people then? We are going to see an increase in the numbers begging on the streets. I met representatives from the Centre for Independent Living immediately after the budget and they had grave concerns about the effects on the people they represent as well as fears of more cuts coming along. We could pay for all of these things and it could be a fair budget if we collected all the corporate tax and perhaps even increased it a little. Furthermore, if we brought in a financial transaction tax many things could be paid for.

This is a lousy Bill. We all know that tough decisions must be made and that the deficit must be closed, but that is not why this is a lousy Bill. It is a lousy Bill because it does not represent tough decisions. In January last year, a senior unguaranteed bond relating to Anglo Irish Bank for €1.25 billion fell due. The bond was bought in 2007. According to the rules under which that bond was bought, rules fully understood by the people who bought it, no more than a few hundred million euro should have been paid out. Instead, the Government paid out €1.25 billion plus profits.

Even to find out who owns the bond would have been useful because it was probably brought on the secondary markets for a fraction of the price. That would have been leadership but that is not what happened. What happened instead was this Bill to close the deficit, targeting pensioners, pregnant women, the grieving and the young. As the Minister knows the Bill will bring in approximately €100 million to the Exchequer next year. Therefore, 13 years of the cuts that this Bill will bring in would pay for one Anglo Irish Bank bond that was paid last year. That is what is happening in this country and that is why this is a lousy Bill. It is not only a lousy Bill, it is a dangerous Bill because it is discriminatory. Regardless of what any of us think about the need for training or the lack of motivation for people to train, the Bill discriminates against people based on their age. The Equal Status Act 2000 states that discrimination shall be taken to occur where a person is treated less favourably than another person is, has been or would be treated on a variety grounds including gender, race, sexual orientation and age. This Bill discriminates against Irish citizens based on age. Approximately 180,000 young people have emigrated since 2008 and the vast majority of these, some 84%, say they are leaving to find work. For those who stay, we have an unemployment rate of 28%, which does not include anyone who works for even one hour per week. God only knows what the real rate of unemployment is if we include people who work a Friday night in the local pizzeria. The logic that I have heard from the Minister, her Cabinet colleagues and the Government backbenchers is that this Bill is being brought forward because the young people in the country are not sufficiently motivated to take up a job or a training course. The Government view is that it will take their pocket money away and those affected can simply move home. However, the latest analysis from the Vincentian Partnership for Social Justice estimates that the amount of money a person needs to live at home with his parents and lead a dignified life will be €184 next year. After this Bill such a person will be left with a little over half of that amount. The only logic I can find in the Bill is the following: because we care for young people so much, what we are going to do is deprive them of the opportunity to lead a dignified existence and then perhaps some combination of humiliation and desperation will get them up off their lazy flatscreen-television-watching backsides. What is the result? It is not more jobs. This Bill will not create jobs. The result is discrimination, emigration and homelessness. It is getting worse. According to the Central Statistics Office, more young people will leave the country this year than since the start of the crisis. The rate at which they are leaving the country is accelerating. The so-called tough decisions in the Bill are being made because the real tough decisions, that would have put it to international anonymous foreign investors that they must share the burden, have not been made. This Bill represents the worst aspects of a weak dysfunctional political system in this country.

I wish to make a quick point. This is not the way to do business. Introducing a time motion at this late stage, even though it may have been agreed by the Whips, is not acceptable. We are confined in the number of hours that we are supposed to squeeze in all of the amendments and discussions on Committee and Report Stages despite a promise by the Government that it would approach it in a different way.

I was stuck in this Chamber discussing the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill because the Government Chief Whip scheduled the Whips meeting at a time when the debate was already under way. I also said that I did not object to the time motion in itself. The difficulty is the fact that we are limited in time tomorrow. I call on the Minister of State, Deputy Kehoe to withdraw his remarks. Our deputy Whip, who was the only other person who could have attended, is in hospital today.
