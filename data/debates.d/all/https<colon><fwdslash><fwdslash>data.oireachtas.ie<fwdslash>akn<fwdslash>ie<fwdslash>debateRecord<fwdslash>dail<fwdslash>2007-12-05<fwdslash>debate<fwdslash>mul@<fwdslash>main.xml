          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">In respect of the huge increase in the use and misuse of drugs throughout the country, last year more than 1,700 new injecting drug users presented at the Merchants Quay needle exchange in Dublin.  In fairness to the Garda and its drug squads, nearly two tonnes of cocaine and more than one tonne of herbal cannabis have been seized this year.  However, the number of heroin addicts seeking treatment outside Dublin increased by 500% up to 2005 and there has been a reported 900% increase in the number of those seeking treatment and assistance to deal with drugs related problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">On 13 February this year, when I asked the Taoiseach about this matter, he stated: "I do not believe. . . there are serious drug problems in every village, community and locality because that is not the case."  I do not want to refer to current tragedies and difficulties but the list of people, particularly young persons, for whom the use and abuse of drugs has had tragic consequences and the list of those who are currently having difficulties are there for everybody to see.  Given the scale of the task facing the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, has the Taoiseach changed his mind in the intervening nine or ten months?  Is he willing to acknowledge that there is a major problem in every community and that the drugs issue demands real intervention and a national drugs strategy that is capable of dealing with the phenomenal increase in the use of drugs?  Does he accept that his remarks in February are not accurate now?  Is he satisfied that the national drugs strategy is capable of dealing with the scale of the challenge facing us?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_3">What I said in February was in the context of my statement that all young people should not be portrayed as being involved in drugs.  To brand all young people with being involved with drugs would be disrespectful to the huge number of young, responsible people, both teenagers and those of a slightly younger age who are not involved with drugs.  Last week, I outlined my view in a very good debate on the drugs issue in which Deputies from all sides put forward their views on what is happening in communities.  For 20 years there has been a drug problem in my constituency and in most cities and it has extended outwards.  However, its portrayal as a problem affecting all young people is what I was talking about in February.</p>
          <p eId="para_4">We are aware from all the reports in the past two or three years that there has been an increase in the use of cocaine.  That is reflected in the availability and use of cocaine all over Europe.  It is highly dangerous to glamorise cocaine as a recreational drug, which is a trend that has crept into Irish life.  As I said in February and have repeated since, I strongly caution everyone, particularly young adult males, against using cocaine or any other illegal drugs.  There are extremely high risks associated with cocaine use and serious physical and mental health problems arise from its use.  It is particularly dangerous when combined with alcohol and other substances.  There has been a number of tragic cases throughout this year, not only in recent weeks.  These messages on the real dangers associated with cocaine use need to be highlighted throughout the community.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">It is important that people see the direct link between their misuse of illegal drugs and the criminal activities which facilitate it.  Deputy Kenny is right in terms of the huge amounts of drugs available.  I do not deny this because it shows up in the figures for drug seizures, which this year include 113 kg of heroin with an estimated value of €22 million, 1.6 tonnes of cocaine valued at approximately €117 million, 1.3 tonnes of cannabis resin, 1.7 tonnes of cannabis herb, the best part of 280,000 ecstasy tablets and about 34 kg of other drugs.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Garda are invoking a number of broad strategic responses to address the issue.  As well as the review of the national drugs strategy, which was discussed in the House last week and is the responsibility of the Minister of State, Deputy Pat Carey, the Garda is identifying, targeting and dismantling national and international drug trafficking networks which are supplying and distributing illegal drugs in the State.  It is conducting intelligence driven operations, focusing on the illicit drug trade, logistics, distribution and financing.  It is working with other national and international law enforcement agencies on joint actions designed to reduce the availability of drugs and the proceeds derived from the drug trade and working in partnership with statutory, community and voluntary groups to reduce it.  A number of other measures are also being taken.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">Drugs in society is a big challenge and we must do all we can to address it.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, promised to take on board, as part of the review of the national drugs strategy, many of the good suggestions put to him during the question and answer session at the end of the debate on drugs.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_8">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  I would not want anybody to believe we are portraying young people in general as being involved in drugs and I do not believe that was the Taoiseach's intention.  This is an issue that concerns every household in the country.  I have said this before, in so far as Government action is concerned, we will support the actions of Government to deal with this scourge which is causing such difficulty for so many people.  The Government is faced with the reality of having to deal with the scale of the problem.  Deputy Flanagan has pointed out on a number of occasions that only about 10% of drugs coming in is seized.  For every tonne of cocaine that is confiscated nine tonnes are on sale at locations around the country, despite the best efforts of the drug squads and the Garda.  The Government is faced with having to deal with the scale of what one sees on the ground, for instance, 13,000 heroin users in Dublin and less than 30 detox beds.  The case is being made for extra gardaí, extra resources and so on but vigilance from everybody is involved here.</p>
          <p eId="para_9">There is a real concern here from a parent's and a student's point of view.  Let us take a second level school in any part of the country.  I have been told by students that it is possible to buy ecstasy tablets for €2.50 out of their pocket money.  We all know the consequences of that infiltration and infestation in schools and what it can lead to.  This is a challenge for everybody.  I made a suggestion previously based on analysis of works done in other countries where a voluntary code applies.  The boards of management, teachers, parents and pupils decide that in their school they will not do drugs and that a voluntary code is introduced for random drug testing.  I do not mean taking swabs or saliva.  There are very sophisticated methods of detecting whether drugs are in use in any school.  The consequence has been not only a realisation that drugs are not done in those schools where the voluntary code applies but the beneficial other consequence has been in terms of focus on examinations and results for all students concerned.  It is not all about stick either.  One has got to have a sense of imagination.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">Given the challenge and the vulnerability of so many young people not involved with drugs and the pressure on them, would the Taoiseach support in principle the introduction of a purely voluntary code where boards of management, teachers, parents and pupils would say "yes" under conditions A to C, or whatever, that they will agree to random drug testing, which does not include taking swabs or saliva, in their schools so that reality can be brought about, that drugs do not infest our schools, where pupils can buy ecstasy tablets for €2.50?  If the Taoiseach's officials were to examine what has happened in other schools, where this applies, this would be worthy of consideration by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_11">The Deputy raised two points.  On the first, it is always very difficult to determine how much of the drugs are confiscated by law enforcement agencies and how much of the drugs come into any jurisdiction.  I do not have a precise figure.  In so far as there is a figure, the UN report states that 40% of the output of cocaine is intercepted.  That is the only meaningful figure, 40%, but the fact is that it is still a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">The Deputy raised the second issue with me previously.  The Minister of State, Deputy Carey, the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, and their respective colleagues are looking at that issue.  It is operated effectively by the No Name Club on alcohol set up by Eddie Keher, many years ago and works well.  That code exists as well as its booklet and system.  Despite the perception that all young people drink that is a very successful organisation.  The Deputy asked if I would lend my support, that system could be replicated into other schools.  I would of course support anything that helps the vast majority of young people.  The reason I defended this issue and the young people is that I have been told that in inner city second level schools principals and teachers say that in their view about 96% of people would not be near drugs.  I am not saying it is not a problem, that is not the issue, but there is a perception that they are all on drugs.  I agree with the Deputy that it is not difficult to get them.</p>

          <p eId="para_18">Under the strategy, the Garda national drug unit is co-ordinating large-scale operations against drug dealing and trafficking.  Additional assistance is being made available from specialised Garda support units.  The Government has given considerable resources to the National Bureau of Criminal Investigations, the Bureau of Fraud Investigation and the Criminal Assets Bureau because practically all the drugs used here come into the country.  The Garda Síochána, the Customs service and the Navy have been instrumental in establishing, earlier this year, a marine analysis and operations centre on narcotics which operates out of Lisbon.  The centre will focus on intelligence and at local level the Garda has the national drugs unit, the Criminal Assets Bureau initiative which was set up.  This year it is including in its policing priorities for 2008, the Garda is represented on the local and regional drug task forces which is important in so far as having area and national plans are concerned.  The Garda has made provision for joint policing committees in local communities and they are being spread up around the country which is hugely important in working with parents and young people to try to deal with the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">A number of very valid points were made last week.  I understand that following last week's debate on the national drugs strategy and statements by the Minister of State, Deputy Carey, there were 5,000 hits on the Crosscare drug awareness website.  This shows the demand for information on the dangers of drug misuse and learning how to deal with it.  This came about because of the debate here and the initiatives run by the <i>Irish Examiner</i> the previous week and last week.  The challenges posed by cocaine use are significant but we are confident we can meet these challenges through a co-ordinated approach utilising the structures of the national drugs strategy.  On the positive side, a recent report concludes that the treatment of cocaine misuse, primarily in the form of counselling, can and does work.  My last point, which relates to the first point I made, is that all of us have a responsibility and a job to try to remove what was — but which has diminished a little — the glamourisation of cocaine and its use as a recreational drug.  Regardless of what sector one comes from this is seen as an acceptable form of Friday night and Saturday night activity.  Anything we can do, as the debate did successfully last week, to remove the glamour, recreational and social aspects from it would be a good day’s work.</p>

          <p eId="para_20">I wish to raise a different law enforcement issue.  Last Wednesday, my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Broughan, asked the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform for the numbers of warrants which have been issued by the courts for the arrest of persons throughout the country.  The reply he received is amazing.  According to the reply Deputy Broughan received there are 111,453 warrants outstanding.  That number is equivalent to the population of a large five seat constituency.  That is the number of warrants for arrest that have been issued by the courts that have not yet been executed.  I want in particular to focus on two of those categories.  The first is bench warrants, which are normally issued for people who do not turn up in court, in many cases defendants and those on bail.  Some 36,000 warrants issued by the courts for the arrest of people who have not shown up in courts have not yet been executed.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">The House will recall that Donna Cleary was the unfortunate woman who was shot through the window of her own home.  She was killed by a man for whom a bench warrant had been issued but who had not been arrested.  In my constituency, when two gardaí were killed by a speeding car, one of the young men in the car that ran into the gardaí had a bench warrant issued against him but he had not been arrested.  Some 36,000 bench warrants have been issued for the arrest of people who do not show up in courts but these people have not been arrested.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">Even more seriously perhaps, almost 4,000 committal warrants have been issued by the courts but the people involved have not been arrested.  Committal warrants are issued where somebody has been convicted by a court of an offence and a judge has decided that person should be in prison.  In other words, almost 4,000 people are out there, convicted of offences by the courts, with judges having decided they should be in prison, but they have not yet been arrested.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">Does the Taoiseach agree this demonstrates a serious problem in the criminal justice system?  Is there some explanation for this number of warrants, which appears to be increasing?  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report last year commented on the fact that the number of warrants not being executed is increasing by approximately 25% per year.  It is a problem that appears to be on the increase.  I would like an explanation as to why these people are not being arrested.  Will the Taoiseach tell the House what will be done to improve the situation?</p>

          <p eId="para_24">Obviously, I will not dispute the figures provided in reply to a parliamentary question.  The Deputy stated that the total figure for warrants is approximately 111,000, including some 36,000 bench warrants.  I regularly see figures relating to the number of people who evade warrants on a weekly basis, which is a very small number.  With regard to the Deputy's figures, I do not know how the question was categorised and have not read the details.  Nonetheless, many people who are called and do not turn up on a particular day, for one reason or another, will turn up within a very short period, perhaps the following day or week or at the next court sitting.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">If I understand the Deputy's point, we want to know the actual figure for people who entirely evade the judicial system or criminal justice system and do not turn up when a warrant is issued.  Some of the cases relate to people for whom a warrant was issued and they either forgot about it or were sick and could not attend court, but later turned up.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I am not sure if the reply to the parliamentary question details the actual figure over a given court session for people who have evaded the system.  That is the key figure, and it is not 36,000.  During the entire 30-year period of the Troubles in the North, the number of outstanding warrants relating to people who did not turn up was approximately 20 — some of their names are well known to gardaí.  While I do not know the total figure for people who have evaded the system, I imagine it is small.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">The Criminal Justice Act 2006 introduced a comprehensive package of measures enhancing the powers of the Garda with regard to improving the criminal justice system.  Included in that legislation were the powers to deal with anyone who infringes on or evades the law in any circumstances.  If I recall the debate on that Bill, the figure was not very significant.  While I do not know the figure, it will be easy to get for the Deputy.  As part of those powers, we broadened the range of sentences, provided for alternatives to custodial sentences and introduced restriction on movement orders and a new system of fixed charges for public order offences, particularly for reoffenders or those who tried to evade justice.  We increased penalties relating to various categories of people who were ongoing offenders.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">To answer the Deputy's question on what action we are taking, the Criminal Justice Acts of 2006 and 2007, with the DNA legislation which, if it is not before the House, will be published shortly, are measures which will deal with people who defy bench warrants or the law.</p>

          <p eId="para_29">I note the Taoiseach finds it difficult to believe the figures, for which I do not blame him.  However, the figures on which I rely were provided in response to a parliamentary question.  That reply from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform stated: "The number of bench warrants, penal warrants and committal warrants which were recorded on the PULSE system as being on hand on 25 November 2007".</p>
          <p eId="para_30">It is not the first time the problem has arisen, if not the scale of the problem.  The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report states "unexecuted bench warrants are still increasing at an annual rate of about a quarter of the number issued".  Indeed, the previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform introduced Operation Anvil, which was designed to address the problem of people who were at large despite bench warrants having issued against them.  There is clearly a problem in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">When the Criminal Justice Bill was before the House last year, the Labour Party through Deputy Howlin proposed that where warrants are issued for the arrest of people, there should be some system whereby when those people interface again with the State, whether through a social welfare office, FÁS office, HSE centre or other arm of the State, the Garda can be alerted to the fact they are out there.  Such a system might operate through the use of PPS numbers or otherwise.  The Government did not accept the proposal.  Will the Taoiseach consider introducing some such measure?  There is clearly a huge problem with people whom judges have decided should be arrested, either because they have been convicted of a crime and have not yet been arrested or because they have not appeared in court.  A much more effective system is required than the one we appear to have at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">Anything that tidies up the system would improve it.  However, I do not want to give the impression that when bench warrants are issued, a significant proportion of those for whom they are issued do not turn up.  From security briefings and from following Northern issues, I know they may not always turn up at the prescribed time but they do turn up.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">I do not have the figure for those who are evading justice completely.  The Garda Síochána and Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform view on this is that it is inevitable in any criminal justice system that at any given time there would be a significant number of warrants awaiting execution.  It should be borne in mind that the vast majority of the outstanding warrants relate to financial penalties.  Most of the figures relate to fines.</p>

          <p eId="para_37">It is also the case that many individuals would be subject to multiple warrants, which the Deputy will know from the list.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">I do not know the precise figure for the number of outstanding warrants that would be acceptable at any stage.  Obviously, if there are 14,000 gardaí, there will be an increasing number of warrants.  The last Garda Commissioner is on record as stating that steps need to be taken to reduce the number of outstanding warrants as much as is possible.  I accept the Deputy's point that there must be a tidying up of the system.  The Garda Commissioner stated that each regional commissioner had been directed to give priority to the issue and to examine the procedures in their areas for executing warrants.  The Minister, Deputy Brian Lenihan, has taken a number of steps to deal with this issue.  A genuine difficulty at the moment is that cases concerning the non-payment of fines clog up the system because gardaí must seek warrants to enforce their payment.  There is an initial warrant therefore and a further warrant is required to enforce the payment.  A pilot project is under way whereby outstanding fines have been pursued by an outside debt collection agency, rather than requiring gardaí to obtain warrants.  That pilot project is proving to be very successful.  The Department, in consultation with the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service, will take that matter forward.  I am not sure in how many districts that pilot scheme is operating but if it is clearing up the system it should be extended.</p>
          <p eId="para_39">There is a fines Bill before the House which, among other things, provides for the payment of fines by instalment.  Anything which avoids the necessity of issuing a warrant should help to reduce pressure on the warrant system.  The Minister is examining other legislative measures which might help to improve the efficiency of the fines collection system, particularly by reducing the amount of Garda time involved in the warrant process.  I am told that is a considerable amount of time.  Many gardaí are now on specialised duties such as the one we have just discussed.  I will raise the question elsewhere but I still find it difficult to imagine that there are 36,000 outstanding bench warrants.</p>

          <p eId="para_41">Yes, but the point I am making is how many of those are multiple cases and how many of those people turn up?  I am told that bench warrants continue to be issued for a large number of defaulters so they come into the total figure.  I do not believe the figure is 36,000.</p>

            <p eId="para_146">The figure for last year was 54, while the projected figure for this year, given that there are just a few weeks left, will be in the order of 60.  Most of the applications are either accepted or partly accepted, while others are referred elsewhere.  In my Department, however, most of the freedom of information applications concern straightforward issues — they are not quite as complex as those covering other Departments — and are accepted or partially accepted.</p>

            <p eId="para_147">I have asked this question before and the Taoiseach will probably answer me in the same way again, but where a person's application under the Freedom of Information Act is rejected and their appeal is allowed, they are still charged.  As regards his Department, does the Taoiseach think that, in fairness, where an appeal is allowed a person should be charged?</p>
            <p eId="para_148">On a wider issue, but still related to freedom of information, the Taoiseach is aware that one cannot obtain documentation prior to the introduction of the Act.  As regards yesterday's business, which is the topic of some conversation, does the Taoiseach consider it appropriate to release all papers concerning the casino issue so that people can make up their minds about it?  The casino was never built, yet those papers cannot be obtained under the Freedom of Information Act.  People have claimed that the Taoiseach was involved in this matter, while he claims he was not involved in any wrongdoing.  Would it not be a good idea to release all those papers because the issue is dead as an infrastructural matter?  People could then be allowed to make up their own minds on it.</p>

            <p eId="para_149">On the first issue, as I said before, there are not many appeals concerning freedom of information applications to my Department, but there is a large cost involved.  First, if it is a personal matter, as with most of the cases we deal with, there is no charge whatsoever.  The €15 fee is modest compared to the average administrative cost, which is approximately €425.  If the matter goes to the appeals commissioner there is a final stage whereby somebody can still get the report before the final report and at that stage there is no cost.  People have copped on to that mechanism because I notice a number of cases go to that stage.  Other than that, the costs involved must be reflected.</p>
            <p eId="para_150">As regards old cases, it is difficult enough to get old files in my Department, not to mention other Departments.  The Department of Finance has fairly good records and it gave me a report on that matter, which was a live issue with a number of organisations for an extensive period.  While a number of points were made, the issue came down to whether, in 1994, I had given approval for a process to allow a confidential agreement.  To be frank, if I had been asked to give approval to that, I am sure I would have, but I was not asked.  Nobody was asked at that time.  An Post — the national lottery — went ahead and did that for a five-month period in 1994 and in 1998, but I was not involved.  If I was asked, however — I will be honest about it — I see no reason that I would not have given it, looking at the papers.  In 1998, the then Minister was asked for approval in advance and he gave approval.  That is all it was about.  The totally unfair allegation was that there was something wrong with that, but there was nothing wrong with it whatsoever.  These things get two days' headlines and then the journalist would not admit that he was wrong, but he is wrong.  I did nothing wrong and even if I had given approval it would not have been wrong.</p>

            <from>Deputy Eamon Gilmore</from>
            <p eId="para_151">Going back over the figures on the number of freedom of information applications made to the Department of the Taoiseach, there is a marked difference in the numbers that were made subsequent to 2003.  In 2002, 146 such applications were made, while the figure for 2003 was 142.  In 2004, the figure dropped dramatically to 45.  There were 54 last year and the Taoiseach says the figure for 2007 will be 60.  The one thing that occurred in terms of the higher and lower figures was the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003, which introduced a scale of fees for making applications.  It is €15 for the application, €75 for a departmental review and €150 for an appeal to the commissioner.  As Deputy Kenny said, that is non-refundable even if one wins the appeal.</p>
            <p eId="para_152">The Information Commissioner has drawn attention to these fees and has pointed out that they do not apply in other jurisdictions.  She has recommended that they be dropped.  What consideration has the Taoiseach given to this recommendation?  The fees clearly have an impact on the number of applications being made.  Perhaps this was the intent of the amending legislation but it is certainly discouraging people from making FOI requests.  Nothing else explains the difference in the figures before and after 2003.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_27">
            <from>The Taoiseach</from>
            <p eId="para_153">In my Department, the figure has levelled out at approximately 50 to 60.  When the Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 was enacted, there was quite a number of people endeavouring to obtain information and there was a huge surge of applications.  Second, companies and individuals were doing trawling exercises with a view to using the information they obtained commercially to the benefit of a client base.  This is partly why the changes were made.</p>
            <p eId="para_154">The FOI system is a matter for the Department of Finance in the first instance and I have no plans to review it.  The system that was introduced in 2003 followed a review that considered carefully all the options that were available, as stated correctly by Deputy Gilmore.  A fee of €15 is very modest, particularly when compared to the administrative fee for processing an application in 2003, that is, €425.  I am not sure if it has been updated since then.  Nobody would agree that the fee is unreasonable and discourages responsible FOI requests.</p>
            <p eId="para_155">One should remember that all FOI requests for personal information are free.  It is also important to point out that there is no charge for the time taken in making a decision on an FOI request.  In most other jurisdictions there is a charge levied in addition to the application fee.  This would be a bit unreasonable but we do not have it here.  There was a significant decline in the number of requests in my Department but the figure has increased again.</p>
            <p eId="para_156">It costs €75 for an internal appeal and €150 for an appeal to the Information Commissioner.  There are significant reductions for medical card holders, for whom the fees for internal appeals and appeals to the Information Commissioner amount to €25 and €50, respectively.  Appeals for personal information are entirely exempt from fees.  An appeal to the Information Commissioner involves a quasi-judicial process and in most cases it can take many months and entail considerable work and effort back and forward.  The fee is a fair reflection of the work done.</p>
            <p eId="para_157">It is important to note that a person who appeals to the Information Commissioner receives a preliminary decision that represents a fairly accurate reflection of the likely final decision.  This is the point I was making to Deputy Kenny.  Even towards the very end of the process, the requester can withdraw the appeal and obtain a full refund of the fees charged.  Some 30% of the appeals made to the Information Commissioner are withdrawn at this stage.  The system is fair and not unduly expensive.  Requests are entirely free if personal information is being sought.  Most requests concern individuals or staff issues.</p>

            <p eId="para_158">Will the Taoiseach agree that the fee should at least be refunded where the appeal is successful?  This is reasonable.  I cannot understand why the fee should be retained if the appeal is successful.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
            <p eId="para_160">To return to the kernel of these questions, the statistics, is the Taoiseach aware that the number of FOI requests made across the public sector in 2006 was 32% lower than in 2002?  This points to the impact of the amending legislation of 2003.  Requests for official and policy information as opposed to requests for personal information, in respect of which fees do not apply, as the Taoiseach stated, dropped by 55% between 2002 and 2006.  Does the Taoiseach not accept that the statistics stand very solid in support of a comprehensive review of all the matters pertaining to the FOI process, particularly the impact of the amending legislation of 2003?  In light of this information, will the Taoiseach undertake to ensure that a comprehensive review be undertaken to put the FOI system back on track in accordance with the manner intended at the outset?  The cold statistics to hand would be damning enough if we were considering comparable numbers of bodies to which the legislation applied between 2002 and 2006 but they are even more grave considering that, annually over this period, more bodies were added to the list of bodies to which the legislation applied.  In light of this, will the Taoiseach indicate his intent to carry out the required review and make appropriate amendments to the current legislation to allow citizens, communities and interested bodies make appropriate inquiries as they would wish?</p>

            <p eId="para_162">Regarding my Department, when the legislation was enacted in 2003 there was obviously pent-up demand on the part of individuals to make FOI requests.  This has not changed and any individual seeking information about himself, in the first instance or on appeal, is not subject to a charge.  There is no difficulty about this and the changes made in the 2003 Act have no bearing on it whatever.  The legislation did have an effect on individuals who engaged in a trawl for non-personal information.  The legislation was never designed so people could do this.  It was not enacted so somebody could seek information on whatever came into his head and have public servants moved from other jobs in order to find it.  Its purpose was to allow people obtain information that was important or which pertained to policy.  It was not to allow people to do significant trawls to see if they could find useful information and then try to use it for commercial purposes.  This was happening and the Act was to counter it.  Such trawling was not unusual and it happened in other countries also.  People had to allow the Act to settle down for a while and carry out their search.</p>
            <p eId="para_163">The Freedom of Information (Amendment) Act 2003 allowed us to bring about some kind of controllable order to address the matter of people spuriously sending in FOI requests when it was totally free to do so.  The extension of the Act to public bodies has brought about a great improvement in the system.  It is a matter for the Department of Finance.  Last year saw the biggest ever extension of the FOI Act in that it was made applicable to 137 more bodies.  The level of openness and transparency is such that there are now 520 bodies covered by the legislation compared to 67 before the 2003 Act.  The goal of the legislation has been achieved and it should be hailed as an enormous success.</p>

            <p eId="para_164">The Taoiseach made the point very well in his reply, where I had indicated that the statistics do not show the whole picture, that the extent of those bodies to which the freedom of information legislation applies is huge.  There is an almost 800% increase in the number of bodies and yet the statistics show a huge reduction in take-up.</p>
            <p eId="para_165">Does the Taoiseach not accept that the Information Commissioner's recommendations, based on her experience in that position, merit action on the part of Government?  There is a requirement to carry out the review that people recommend.  Does he accept that nobody here has suggested that the initial intent was to open up opportunities for people to trawl for entertainment purposes or whatever?  Nobody has suggested that all the fees be absolutely scrapped, but they should be more token than punitive.  Certainly when one moves towards the appeals process, the fee is prohibitive at €150.</p>
            <p eId="para_166">There is a requirement, therefore, for a review, for which people here are arguing.  Will the Taoiseach please take that on board and acknowledge the collective lobby of the Opposition groupings that are reflective of the Information Commissioner's recommendations in this instance?  Will he indicate whether he will conduct the necessary review?  Based on the information he has shared with us, there is a huge increase in the number of bodies and a significant reduction in the uptake so there must be something wrong.</p>

            <p eId="para_169">It is a great honour to be elected to this House and to be able to ask the Taoiseach of this country a question.  Does he believe it is right that I, as an elected representative for the people of County Mayo, should have to pay for information that concerns a citizen in this State?  Will he consider that in the context of the freedom of information legislation?</p>
            <p eId="para_170">I made a freedom of information request to the Minister for Transport on the Shannon issue.  A newspaper got the information after I had made the request but it had to pay for it.  I am open to correction but I believe I was asked for €300 or €400 for the information.  I do not have a budget for that.</p>
            <p eId="para_171">A serious complaint was made about a man to the local authority by a neighbour.  All the man wanted to know was who had made the complaint.  He had to make a request under the freedom of information legislation and had to pay €15.  The local authority then asked for a further fee to examine the matter.  That is not right.  If somebody makes a complaint in a letter and signs it, the local authority should not require someone to make a freedom of information request but should just give the information.  If I want information from the Taoiseach or his Department, I should not have to pay for it.</p>

            <p eId="para_188">Sometimes freedom of information requests fall within the ambit of a Government decision, that is, between two Departments.  In such cases, does the Taoiseach not accept that his Department has a role to sort the competences as one would expect in regard to a Cabinet matter?  It is best if I give an example in regard to the Constitution and the Minister for Education and Science.  Every child is entitled to attend school, but the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has argued that if people have student visas, their children cannot attend school.  Members of the immigration bureau visited school children in their classes and told them they should be removed and that if they cannot attend private education, they could be deported with their parents.  I asked a parliamentary question on that matter and I accept it was sent to the Departments of Education and Science and Justice, Equality and Law Reform.  We will leave the contradiction aside, but in such a case, the issue is getting information.</p>
            <p eId="para_189">Is the Taoiseach concerned that many of the quangos that have come into existence have made themselves immune to freedom of information requests?  This is not about costs but about ordinary citizens submitting requests on policy matters.  The process is long and unwieldy.</p>
            <p eId="para_190">The Minister for Transport will be aware of issues concerning CIE.  It is impossible to elicit from CIE how it decided to sell its property rather than seek money from capital funds for the national development plan.  I presume the Taoiseach is interested in the national development plan.  Citizens are interested in how CIE decided to sell off its sites to provide money for public transport.  The Minister for Transport will answer my letters but how do I get an answer from a body such as CIE that will not answer me?  It will answer if the Department of Transport writes to it.</p>
            <p eId="para_191">There is a string of quangos to which power has leaked from Parliament.  This is a matter for the Taoiseach and the Government.  I am very amenable to co-operating in this regard, but I repeat something I said earlier in this session, that is, Parliament is constantly leaking its powers and responsibilities to unaccountable bodies that are not covered by the Freedom of Information Act.</p>

In approximately one quarter of all requests, we would at least give the policy information we can give.  In terms of policy and without straying into other areas, Members of the House may ask parliamentary questions and there is the freedom of information process.  In regard to CIE and major policy questions, however, such a body is answerable to committees of the House, to which it must answer for its policy decisions.  That is a method of trying to get them to answer these questions.</p>

            <p eId="para_202">The Great Famine had a significant impact on Ireland, including loss of life and the transformation of Irish society, as well as establishing an enduring pattern of high emigration and the development of diaspora nations.</p>
            <p eId="para_203">The Famine has been commemorated in recent years through the opening of the Famine Museum at Strokestown Park, County Roscommon in 1994; the unveiling of the National Famine Monument at Murrisk, County Mayo in 1997, which was replicated on the UN Plaza in New York in 2000; the installation of Famine figures at Custom House Quay, Dublin in 1997; and a similar installation unveiled last June by the President at the Irish Park in Toronto.</p>
            <p eId="para_204">Earlier this year, I informed the House that I was positively disposed towards the establishment of an annual memorial day for the Great Famine.  I envisage that the annual memorial day would be organised by various bodies with an interest in famine prevention and-or overseas aid at which the Government would be consistently represented.  A recent example is the Holocaust Memorial Day, which was introduced in recent years and which is organised by a committee of representative organisations.  I have arranged for the matter to be considered at official level with a view to having recommendations for an appropriate and sustainable commemoration.</p>
            <p eId="para_205">Representatives from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Arts, Sport and Tourism, the Office of Public Works and my Department are considering the appropriate timing and location for a commemorative event and the possible nature of the commemoration, reflecting the historic and terrible loss of life, the significance of the Great Famine for the Irish diaspora and the continuing issues of hunger and food security.</p>
            <p eId="para_206">The possibility of financial support for the commemoration of the Great Famine will be addressed in the recommendations being prepared by the interdepartmental group.  The interdepartmental group is expected to report shortly on proposals for an annual memorial day.</p>
            <p eId="para_207">My Department will continue to co-ordinate the commemorative arrangements with regard to the 400th anniversary of the flight of the earls.  The domestic programme this year included, in particular, events in Donegal on the anniversary of their departure in September 1607.  Their journey across Europe will be commemorated next year with events arranged along the route and culminating in Rome.  Suitable programmes are now in preparation in my Department, working in partnership with the relevant embassies of Ireland.</p>
            <p eId="para_208">The arrangements for the annual commemoration of the Easter Rising, the national day of commemoration and the remembrance at the Memorial Gardens at Islandbridge will also be prepared under the auspices of my Department.  Other themes and events may be adopted during the course of the year.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_61">
            <from>Deputy Enda Kenny</from>
            <p eId="para_209">I thank the Taoiseach for his reply.  We have discussed this issue on a number of previous occasions.  I know it is not possible to have a separate day for every event where requests are made.  The Taoiseach's establishment of a committee to look at a memorial day is the way to proceed.</p>
            <p eId="para_210">The Great Famine was a catastrophic event, and in its own way was the cause of an outflow of people from here to the US, Australia and other places, which has consequences for the contemporary diaspora.  Is there a timescale for the committee to report back?  What is the outcome of that?</p>
            <p eId="para_211">The Taoiseach has revived the 1916 commemoration day, which was an appropriate thing to do.  A very big celebration was held two years ago, while smaller ones are planned for other dates between now and 2016, for which another Government has a long-term series of projections.</p>
            <p eId="para_212">I am not sure about what is planned for the commemoration of the flight of the earls.  The Taoiseach reminded me slightly of Hannibal's march on Rome.  Will it be Ahern's march on Rome in 2009 when all those Ministers behind him tog out and head overland for Rome?</p>
            <p eId="para_213">Under the legislation that is available, it is open to any country to mint a special commemorative €2 coin.  This has been taken up in Spain, Finland and other countries.  Has consideration been given to minting a special €2 coin to commemorate whatever event or person is in question, be it Owen Roe O'Neill, the flight of the earls or some other person from history?  It seems to have been very acceptable in Finland and Spain and I believe it has been done in Greece.  Perhaps the Taoiseach might comment on that.</p>
            <p eId="para_214">In a commemorative sense, I know the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, spent €38,000 on sending out two copies of <i>Judging Dev</i> to every school in the country.  Was that a commemorative tactic?  What was that about?  There is such a range of books about Irish historic figures.  I could not contemplate what was the educational value of sending two copies of <i>Judging Dev</i> to every school in the country.</p>

            <p eId="para_220">There has been very active community involvement, both North and South, in the commemoration of the flight of the earls.  They have just brought their 2007 commemoration to an end.  There was an emphasis on the story at home, which is one of a time of change and progress in Europe.  The Irish College in Louvain, where the earls found their initial refuge, and the history of the Franciscan scholar, Luke Wadding, were featured this year and will be featured next year.  They managed to put a few of these together and I believe they are continuing that next year.  I do not think it is a very big event.</p>
            <p eId="para_221">In respect of the commemoration of the Great Famine, I think we agree it is appropriate to have an annual memorial.  I was pressed here about it last year and earlier this year.  There is no doubt about the significance of the Famine in history and our official commitment to humanitarian relief.  I would like to make it a meaningful day rather than a day when nothing happens.  If we could try to place it in the context of how we suffered from famine, the fact that others still suffer from famine, what we do as a country in respect of overseas development aid which involves one of the highest figures in the developed world and the fact that so many of our NGOs are modern-day missionaries and that lay people are now doing this work, it could be a worthwhile effort.  I do not want it to start off and to become nothing very quickly.  It requires a bit of thought.  I hope the report will be available shortly.  I think they were aiming to have it by the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_222">I welcome what the Taoiseach said about the plans to commemorate the Great Famine.  That is appropriate and the way he proposes to go about it is the right way.

            <p eId="para_226">I have a number of quick points.  In respect of the so-called Famine, does the Taoiseach have any difficulty in referring to it as such?  It was an imposed hunger on the Irish people at a time of plenty.  It equated with the genocide of the Irish people at the time and we must not lose sight of that.  There was not a famine in Ireland.  The potato crop failed and the people died in their millions or were forced to leave our country at that time.</p>
            <p eId="para_227">I agree that that terrible tragedy that was visited upon us should be commemorated nationally and by the State.  I ask the Taoiseach again to elaborate on what he might consider in that regard.  When is it planned to hold a meeting of the all-party consultative committee on the 1916 commemorative programme?  There has not been a meeting since the new Dáil has been formed.  Has there been any further development in the Taoiseach's thinking and the Government's disposition towards the funding request for the film on the life of James Connolly, which was mooted and which the Taoiseach is on record as welcoming and supporting in principle?  Can the Taoiseach provide further information on the Government's position in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_228">St. Patrick's Day 2008 will mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Fenian movement, the Irish Republican Brotherhood, one of the most influential bodies of Irish political thinking in our history.  Are there plans to mark the 150th anniversary of the founding of the Fenian movement in Dublin?  What does the Taoiseach suggest might be appropriate?  As an opening suggestion is it possible we might look again at the quays of this great city, one of which still bears the name, and commemorates the rule on these islands, of the so-called Famine Queen, as she was referred to by many Irish people, Queen Victoria?  Is it not appropriate to revisit that quay?  As it is directly across from the Croppy Acre, maybe it could become Fenian Quay?</p>

I am not aware if there is a particular commemoration or if an organisation has requested funding regarding the Irish Republican Brotherhood.</p>
            <p eId="para_230">We received proposals from some organisations on commemorating the great Famine.  I stated that the best way to do so was to bring together the relevant officials from the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Arts, Sport and Tourism, my Department and the Office of Public Works, as well as anyone else these officials meet from time to time to examine timing, location and nature of a commemorative event.  We must try to do something enduring because the request in the House and outside is to reflect the historic and terrible loss of life, the significance of the great Famine for the Irish diaspora and the continuing issues of hunger and food security.  We can examine the role modern Ireland plays and the contribution it makes to the world, particularly where hunger is still prevalent and rampant.  I have asked the committee to examine this.  I wish to make sure that, if the commemoration is focused on a day, organisations are involved and it becomes a meaningful and respectful day.  They are the only terms of reference I would suggest as well as the correspondence we have received from organisations.  I await the committee's report.</p>

An independent review of inland fisheries is being carried out by an interdepartmental committee, chaired by the Department of Finance.  I do not believe the work is finished but the intention was to conclude that work, get agreement on the national fisheries authority and deal with the legislation in mid-year.  It will probably be later rather than earlier in 2008.</p>

          <p eId="para_277">In recent times, November has been one of the best months of the year for the Minister for Finance.  Today, of all days, will tell a different story.  The serious decline in the housing construction market clearly confirms the continuing fall in Exchequer receipts from taxes such as stamp duty.  Exchequer figures for November show that total tax receipts are almost €2 billion behind the target set out in last year's budget.  The Department of Finance signalled last Friday that taxes collected this year would be approximately €1.7 billion below target.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">What will today's budget bring and what will be the Minister for Finance's priorities for the economy for the year ahead?  With inflation running at 4.8% — among the highest rates in Europe — the scope for an expansive budget is limited.  The budget is very relevant to the Fine Gael motion.  There is not a great deal in that motion with which I disagree.  The issues of competitiveness and rising labour costs are key drivers for any economic outlook.  The budget will determine whether the calls within the motion will bear fruit.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">My colleague, Deputy Penrose, outlined a number of fundamental points relating to the lack of investment in infrastructure and issues of public sector pay.  It is true that infrastructural spending in this country is well below par.  There may have been serious spending on inter-urban routes such as that between Cork and Dublin, but there are still regional disparities which have not been sorted out.  How long does it take a train to get from Dublin to Sligo?  If a burst water pipe can turn Dublin's principal motorway into a car park for eight hours, then what can we seriously expect from a Government that is lunging from one crisis to another?  There are secondary and non-national roads throughout this island that are rarely travelled by Ministers, and that eminent backbencher from south Kerry himself admitted that if there was a pothole to be filled in the absence of the Ceann Comhairle, he would look after it.  Should we be living on an island as prosperous as this with even one pothole to our name in this day and age?  The fact they exist at all is a testament to the lack of investment in non-national roads throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In regard to broadband, there are parts of north Cork where people are still dialling-up to access the Internet.  Dialling up in 2007 is a joke.  Data published by the European Commission shows that in 2007, 74% of households in the Netherlands have broadband access compared with 31% in Ireland.  Who is responsible for ensuring that Ireland meets its goal of becoming what the Government calls a "world-class knowledge economy" in just over five years?  How can we compete on a global scale if the roll-out of broadband is at such a paltry level?</p>
          <p eId="para_281">The Fine Gael motion calls on the Government to take necessary actions on public sector pay.  It is difficult to comprehend just exactly what this means.  The vast bulk of both public sector and private sector workers are operating at wage levels that keep them and their families' heads just above the water-line.  A total of 1.5 million people have salaries worth less than €38,000.  To survive on a wage of €38,000 in today's terms is a difficult task.  Real people operate and survive within this bracket, but they are under pressure in this society.  Their mortgages have increased and they have borrowed to meet the demands of day to day living.  They are overworked, overcharged for child care and overstretched.  Their average basket of food items is increasing at a rate of 4% to 5% per annum.  People on this income bracket can ill afford to absorb such increases, yet they are the back-bone of this economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">Today the Minister will present the usual budget of tax and social welfare changes.  He must look at this income bracket and provide some measure of relief to increase real income to offset the increasing cost of living.  Fianna Fáil made generous election promises on health, education and justice with more teachers, more gardaí and more consultants promised.  Today will tell whether the Minister intends to fulfil those promises.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">There is a nervousness about Ireland's economic prospects, and much talk of a tight budget.  This motion largely addresses those concerns.  There is a school of thought that says we should not play politics with the economy.  I do not wish to score points, but I do want to remind this Government that its handling of the economy has a bearing on people's jobs and their mortgages and how they provide for their families.  In supporting the spirit of this motion, but not the full tenet of it, we believe it is the role of an Opposition to contribute constructively on how to maintain economic prosperity and further economic development.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">There are serious issues about our competitiveness and we have to face up to that.  However, there is also a lot that is positive about the economy.  In that respect, as a nation we need to focus on opportunities.  The economic review and outlook, produced by the Department of Finance last month, predicted that the economy will grow by about 3% next year.  It is not what we would want but it is growth and we should acknowledge that.  We still need to focus on the possibilities.  Growth in the economy is no longer driven by the export of goods.  However, growth of services exports is very healthy.  We need to continue the focus on sectors such as sales, research and development and high-value traded services.  We need to ensure, not just that we invest in research in our universities, but that the knowledge being generated is turned into commercial activities and that young indigenous companies survive.</p>
          <p eId="para_285">The agricultural sector is a mainstay of our economy.  Food and drinks exports account for over €8 billion.  We must also look to our rural economy and ensure that investment continues in the agri-food sector.  We ignore the potential of the rural economy at our peril.  At the same time, we must continue to ensure we can attract foreign investment.</p>

          <p eId="para_286">I welcome the opportunity of saying a few words.  It is very easy to speak against the Government amendment to the motion.  The motion has some very good proposals, but there are some points with which I disagree.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">This is a sad day for my constituency because we have just lost 500 jobs, so competitiveness is not an abstract discussion.  I find it extraordinary that the larger parties in this House failed to discuss the price we have paid for a speculative version of the economy.  There is nothing vague about this.  In the Minister's speech last night, we heard about the contribution the mortgage payment makes to inflation.  How does this come about?  Between 1995 and 2000, our growth rate was sustained by an export performance.  Between 2000 and 2005, exports often went in the wrong direction and our growth rate was sustained by a revaluation of the property base of the economy.  The unchecked speculative tendencies, supported by the large parties of this House, have gone like a dose of salts through the economy, making it impossible for two people on modest incomes to afford even a first home.  We must look at where real productivity is taking place in the economy.  There are 250,000 small and medium enterprises hiring 800,000 people.  In serious economics, we need to be able to look at the productive base of the economy.  We also need to be able to look at the genuine factors that are affecting competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_288">We have an opportunity this afternoon regarding the hidden agreements made by the semi-State bodies to sell their assets.  For example, CIE offered to sell some of its property to release money for the capital programme in the national development plan, disgracefully abandoning responsibility to public transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_289">The Ministers of State here today are people for whom I have respect and I listened with great care to the Minister last night.  There is a need for an integration of life-long learning, to which the Minister referred in his speech.  It is ridiculous that all the different Departments and agencies place difficulties in the way of a worker who wants to go back to his or her education.  There are huge impediments to getting off social welfare and going back to education, or going from a low-paid, low-skilled job into further education.</p>
          <p eId="para_290">John Maynard Keynes once said that one should begin to worry about the economy if the ratio of difference in incomes between the people at the top and the bottom increased by more than 50 to one.  What about when it is 5,000 to one?  Will anybody speak about the immorality of non-executive directors of banks and other companies rewarding themselves with outrageous salaries, which they then deliver into ostentatious expenditure?  The only people who salivate at their performance are those who write in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>.  Do not ask the hundreds of thousands of low-paid civil servants, many of whom are drawing family income supplement, to watch on while these slobber at the trough and the media admires them.</p>

          <p eId="para_293">"The old order changeth, yielding place to new," said Tennyson, in a poem which begins, "So all day long the noise of battle roll'd", capturing the turbulence and soul searching which great changes often bring.  The trouble with Ireland, unlike Camelot, is that the old order is taking too long to change, despite the noise of economic battles, and introspection is not providing radical alternatives.  Neither is Fine Gael, in the person of its spokesman, who seems bent on presenting to the world an image of this country which is damaging, dismal and disingenuous, the product of a mind and a party more concerned with political point scoring than national advantage.</p>

          <p eId="para_295">I will first deal with public sector reform, the elephant in the room, the old order that must change.  We and the trade unions are requiring public service personnel to provide services to a modern economy within a system and a culture that are outdated and inefficient.  Companies and individuals in the private sector, who contribute enormous sums to the public purse, are demanding change as are many, quietly, within the public service whose potential remains untapped and inhibited by a culture that drives out initiative and restricts the desire and need of individuals to have some control over the work they do.  It is time for all stakeholders in the public sector to come together to help create for this country a modern, state of the art public service system.  A system that will enable the people within it to realise their full potential, giving Ireland the vibrant, creative, confident, competent and professional service that it must have to maintain its success and to continue to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_296">Pretending that Ministers can change systems and mind set in months, or years, is a political game that takes up too much time in this House.

          <p eId="para_305">Neither have I any difficulty in understanding how and why those mistakes were made and accepting them as the natural consequences of a steep learning curve.  Change, ideally should be the child of foresight and planning, but is frequently an orphan who arrives on the doorsteps of governments, commercial enterprises and individuals bearing gifts or problems, or both, all needing immediate attention.  When favourable trade winds, aided by the horse trading ability of the Irish, began blowing billions of euro into a system which for generations had dealt with pennies in a ponderous, conservative, and reactionary manner, something was bound to give, and it did.  On the Committee of Public Accounts I watched decent people time and again trying to explain why millions of euro had disappeared down financial black holes that they did not have the experience to anticipate or the ability to prevent.  These were the growing pains of a nation, the cost of moving from nickels and dimes to billions, the inevitable consequence of winning the European jackpot.  It revealed the inability of the system to cope, but how could it be avoided?  Awash with money and short of experience we made mistakes.  We created enough boards to empty a rain forest and enough safe hands to provide goalkeepers to the world.  We also created an economic miracle that is the envy of the world and released a spirit of adventure and creativity that has made Ireland and Irish companies significant and respected players on the international economic stage.</p>

          <p eId="para_310">It is true that we made mistakes, but it is untrue that we could have prepared in any real way for the fact that we were going to do so well.  Infrastructure development of all types everywhere follows success as, initially, do mistakes.  Nobody can prepare for something that may happen, the extent of which is unknown, by spending money yet to be earned.  It is disingenuous to suggest otherwise.  Countries such as Dubai, India and Russia are still desperately trying to improve their infrastructure and grappling with the effects of wealth, with varying degrees of success, and they all have low wages or vast natural resources, or both.  Nor is it true that inflation, the fall of the stock market and rising interest rates are problems faced only by this country.  They are worldwide problems.  They affect us, but there is little an open economy can do about that except stand and fight and that is what this Government and country are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">Low-skill manufacturing has moved to low-cost countries.  It always does.  That is economic reality, not Government mismanagement.  It is also an indication of how successful we are.  It was inevitable that our agriculture sector would be pressed by international market forces to consolidate and rationalise.  That has happened.  Now agriculture and the food companies reliant on it are reaping the benefits.  If Fine Gael members wish to believe the sub-prime lending debacle, the fall in the dollar, the increase in the price of oil and China's voracious appetite for raw materials is the responsibility of Fianna Fáil, they may do so, but I doubt anyone believes them.  I doubt they believe it themselves, but they have come into this House in the hope of persuading the public that it is the case.  That unworthy task, that three card trick, has now been exposed.</p>

How is it, amid all the doom and gloom they laid before us yesterday, that the Central Statistics Office announced this morning that Ireland is creating a net extra 1,300 jobs a week?  Please explain.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">As an economy we are where we should be: fighting for our share of the high-end markets of the world and promoting Ireland as a location for multinationals who also serve that market.  We are doing so with vigour and confidence, using the experience gained at the boardroom tables of the world over many years by organisations such as Enterprise Ireland and the IDA.  They have experience, ability and significant Government support.  They are doing a good job.  In my work I will support and assist the SME sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">The State is more efficient in the use of funds.  Major infrastructure developments are coming in on time and on budget.  We have, and continue to attract, companies that need exceptional skills and are prepared to pay for them and we are producing top class companies of our own.  We continue, at an increasingly fast and confident pace, to improve our transport and broadband infrastructure and our IT networks.  We have some way to go, but we are getting there and we are more confident about and focused on what we are doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">The Government recognises that Irish third-level educational qualifications should not just be common, but should also be universally recognised as hallmarks of academic excellence and, to this end, the Government continues to invest heavily in education.  We should in some way seek to bring together Pythagoras and Picasso, the sciences and humanities, for the benefit of both, providing we do not dilute the primary degree.  At a time of worldwide economic upheaval it is easy to forget this country has come far and fast and that Ireland continues to be a destination of choice for inward investment and a hotbed of local endeavour and enterprise.  The Government will ensure this continues.</p>

          <p eId="para_321">The underpinning role of the social partnership process and the range of commitments agreed under Towards 2016 is also acknowledged.  The National Development Plan 2007-2013 further demonstrates a level of investment and a range of measures across the policy spectrum which reinforces this strategy.  The European Commission places Ireland in the first tier of member states with the strongest record and progress in pursuit of the Lisbon goals.  As far as the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment's responsibilities are concerned, Ireland scores highly in terms of best enterprise environment due to the ease of starting a business, good access to capital and relatively low levels of administrative red tape.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">The significant sums the Government proposes to spend on science, technology and innovation over the lifetime of the National Development Plan 2007-2013 will bring Ireland into line with research and development performance in leading countries and enhance the development of a knowledge-based economy.  Our development agencies, particularly Enterprise Ireland, are committed to delivering on these objectives.  Enterprise Ireland has achieved significant success in reaching and exceeding its own ambitious targets over 2005-07.  Growth in global markets through the internationalisation of Irish companies is a core element in our strategy towards sustaining wealth and employment creation in Ireland.  This process of transformation will continue to be relentlessly driven.  Support for this transformation will continue to involve extensive engagement with the SME sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">During last night's debate it was stated that the indigenous sector has been neglected.  This is quite untrue.  It totally misrepresents the policies that have been introduced to reflect the recommendations of the Small Business Forum.  It also completely ignores the extensive reorganisation that has taken place in Enterprise Ireland and other agencies to provide more effective programmes and opportunities to the indigenous sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">Finding new ways to compete, as well as restoring cost competitiveness, presents a major challenge and an opportunity to develop an innovation driven economy and society which maintains competitive advantage and increases productivity.  Innovation has no policy borders.  We will, therefore, continue to strive for consumer-driven innovative products and services as well as developing new business models, organisational structures and skills for innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">The services sector is an emerging area where innovation can be better exploited, for example in the area of environmental goods and services and renewable energy.  New thinking on services innovation is required to adapt to new models of economic activity emerging in the globalised marketplace.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">As a small open economy Ireland is particularly vulnerable to external factors which weaken its cost base.  The solution lies in supporting innovation, improving the productivity of labour through balanced regulation, increasing knowledge and skills and in playing to our strengths by tapping into our innate ability as networkers and for building partnerships.  Success does not depend on Government and policy alone.  It requires a joint commitment by enterprise, society and Government to promote innovation in every sphere of business and public service.</p>

          <p eId="para_328">We are building a consensus around the creation of a national innovation agenda which combines an awareness of the depth and breadth of innovation activity already taking place and supported by our development agencies, with a determination to stimulate the demand for more innovative products.  With that in mind I will shortly be publishing a comprehensive policy statement which will act as a guide to our approach in fostering innovation demand and an innovation culture in the economy and society.  In his contribution last night, Deputy Morgan mentioned the all-island aspect of competitiveness.  In this policy statement I will take account of innovation policy activity in Northern Ireland where it can contribute and help in the context of our innovation agenda.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">International investment decisions to invest here are not merely goodwill gestures.

          <p eId="para_336">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate in the context of the budget and yesterday's announcement from Abbott.  There has been very little discussion in this debate of the key tests to measure our competitiveness from a policy perspective.  There is a plethora of external indicators and factors that all affect our competitiveness.  However, we should be concentrating in this debate on our competitiveness from a policy perspective.  How can we influence and change things ourselves?  The new chief executive of the IDA, Mr. Barry O'Leary, said recently that over recent months the Irish media had been focusing almost exclusively on job losses.  Despite that, he said, we have shown a remarkable ability to replace lost jobs with new and higher value activities.  What we need in this country, he added, and it was sadly lacking from the Fine Gael benches, is fresh thinking in this matter.</p>

Instead, we were treated to a rant of rhetoric and negativity, the like of which I have rarely heard in this House.  There was almost blind panic at the Abbott announcement yesterday, ignoring the fact that for every 500 jobs lost 1,800 are created in this country.  This is a sign of a party not sufficiently confident to express any positive alternative and not mature enough to embrace the realities of a modern economy.</p>

The strategic innovation fund, PRTLI, which has benefited the University of Limerick, Science Foundation Ireland, research clusters, the strategy for technology and science, the innovation voucher initiative, Enterprise Ireland's research and development scheme, and most importantly, the national skills strategy aimed at upskilling the workforce.  Where were the matching policies or the alternatives last night?  The reality is there were none.  We were treated to a tirade of negativity from the Fine Gael Party.</p>

          <p eId="para_342">In the limited time I have I want to make two points.  A key test as regards competitiveness has been, and always will be, employment levels.  Competitiveness is always directly linked to labour supply and employment levels and almost uniquely in OECD countries, Ireland has maintained historically high levels of labour market participation and extremely low levels of unemployment.  I have a final concluding remark.  Surprisingly, from the Opposition benches there was no mention last night whatsoever of what is perhaps the most important factor driving competitiveness, in terms of FDI and economic growth in the last few years, namely, our corporate tax regime, which is under direct attack from some elements in Europe.  These are determined to undermine that regime and there was no mention of this last night from the Opposition.  We need, however, collectively to send a message to the effect that the Government is determined to resist and fight all efforts to undermine our very attractive corporate tax regime.</p>

It is important to point out, however, that for the 500 jobs lost there we are creating twice as many.  We are creating more than 1,300 jobs net weekly and this cannot be lost on the Members of Fine Gael who have tabled this motion.  To succeed we must be competitive and clearly the international commercial fraternity seems to believe Ireland is competitive and a good country in which to set up.  While we may be losing some low-skill jobs, which are by their nature mobile — we have seen many of them move to the Far East — they are being replaced by high-quality well-paid jobs.

Last year we saw for the first time that more than 2 million individuals were employed.  That trend will continue and it affords an opportunity for Irish people to live and work at home.  In the short time I have I want to thank the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment for ensuring that a quality employer such as Merck Sharp and Dohme, MSD, has set up in Carlow.  We have a 65 acre business park there which it has taken over and we look forward to welcoming MSD and many other foreign companies under the Government's FDI programme.

By and large they are small and medium enterprises established by local people who took a risk with the support of a competitive environment and a supporting Government.  Deputy Nolan mentioned the intervention of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, in Carlow.  He also intervened in the village of Drumconrath in my constituency to ensure jobs were retained.  The people of Drumconrath and I are grateful for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_355">We must push forward with infrastructural projects such as ports and roads and stop opposing.  We must recognise it is not doom and gloom.  We are not going down the Swanee.  We are fighting forward and perhaps creating more jobs than ever before.  We have enormous sympathy for companies such as Abbott and Coca Cola.  Coca Cola is not directly located in my constituency but more than half its workforce comes from my constituency.  It will close down and that will be a big blow to my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_356">We and the Opposition must recognise that jobs are created all the time.  Deputy Peter Power stated that 1,800 jobs are created for every 500 jobs that are lost.  We do not want to lose high quality jobs but all sides must acknowledge that jobs are being created all the time.  We seek the big names and high quality jobs but we must keep focusing on local people who are willing to be entrepreneurs and become leaders in their communities by employing people and keeping people in rural communities where enterprises can locate.</p>
          <p eId="para_357">I will encourage the Government to do everything it can to encourage small and medium enterprises to establish at appropriate locations in rural areas.

Ireland has experienced an economic spring brought about by its business people and entrepreneurs and it remains part of the business civilisation which spans the globe.  Despite the downturn in the housing market over the past year, GDP growth in Ireland from June last year to June 2007 was 5.5%, comparing impressively with the 2.5% growth rate in the eurozone and 2.8% in the 27 EU countries.</p>

Two weeks ago I noticed one of the Sunday newspapers had two pages in its main section with the banner "Financial Apocalypse".  For all the talk of economic decline and Armageddon, we have virtually full employment, lower unemployment than in the US or the OECD average and, to the disappointment of many foreboders in this country, there was a decrease in the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate between the second and third quarters of this year.</p>

          <p eId="para_370">The promotion and increased facilitation of renewable energy generation, the total of €149 million for research and development in energy sources in the national development plan and the industries deriving from these points of focus will mean the creation of thousands of jobs and a large reduction in energy costs, which is a key factor in keeping us competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_371">Other ongoing developments add to our successful economy.  Ireland is consolidating itself as a knowledge economy.  Ireland's strength will not be in steel rolling mills, car plants or ship yards but in the educational ability of our people.  A total of €2.8 billion will be invested in science, technology and innovation during the lifetime of the national development plan.  Third level expenditure on research and development has been growing at more than 7% since 2004 with Irish Exchequer funding of higher education research and development increasing on average by double digit figures in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_372">I welcome the spending of more than €200 million in the business and technology park in Carlow by the major company Merck.  As Green Party spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, I will continue to encourage the Government, a party of which I am proud to be a member, to develop our business sector and support our tourism industry to realise its full potential.  The image of Ireland is of a clean, green country, and we must capitalise on our breath-taking landscapes, walking trails, local gourmets, businesses, micro-energy and business promotions, the promotion of organic and non-GM food and our hospitable culture.  In this regard, Government support for the tourism and food industries will see increased growth in indigenous industry and less economic reliance on foreign investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_373">Competitiveness is being sustained in what is a fundamentally healthy outlook for the Irish economy.  This morning, business media proclaimed that for every 500 jobs lost in Ireland we are gaining 1,500.  The green energy revolution is upon us and we can capitalise on it.  There is 7% investment in renewable energy business at present.  We can push this to more than 50% as happened in parts of Germany.</p>

          <p eId="para_378">Before I forget, I wish to point out to Deputy Peter Power that corporation tax of 12% was a rainbow Government initiative.  We agree with it and believe in it because we started it.  We will certainly keep it and will even improve on it.  People speaking here often forget reality and I wanted to point that out.</p>
          <p eId="para_379">I will not speak about doom and gloom, I will speak about confidence and where we need to go.  We will speak about new ideas, but in my speech I wish to focus on what we can fix, and the Government has a direct role in fixing.  As a party, we are prepared to work with any Minister or Department on new initiatives and ideas but we also have to face the facts.  According to a recent ISME survey, business confidence in Ireland has plummeted to a four year low.  Small businesses, particularly in the distribution, retail and construction sectors, are markedly less optimistic about the prospects for the economy than they were one year ago.  The slowdown in the housing market and the continuing erosion of competitiveness are feeding the gloomy mood.  However, the Government seems to have no effective game plan for tackling the challenges we face other than to mouth the usual platitudes.</p>
          <p eId="para_380">The Minister of State's contribution was probably the most honest I heard today.  He admitted that mistakes were made.  I agree with him that we have had some success but we cannot continue to look backwards instead of developing confidence and competitiveness for the future.  We must keep our heads out of the sand.  It will not be easy because an effective plan is needed to reduce costs and inflation and to make us more competitive.  The single biggest challenge facing small businesses in Ireland is competitiveness.  The cost of doing business has increased significantly due to a mixture of high inflation, strong growth in wages, particularly in the public sector, increases in the cost of State services and a greater burden of regulation.  It is now 8% more expensive to do business in Ireland than in Britain.</p>
          <p eId="para_381">The Government's attempts to address this issue have been driven by public relations rather than policy.  Put under pressure by Fine Gael and Eddie Hobbs to deal with inflation, the Government decided in a blaze of publicity to abolish the groceries order.  Fine Gael opposed the decision because we did not believe it would impact on prices and feared it would significantly affect small suppliers of the multiples.  Abolishing the groceries order had little or no impact on the price of food, although it did lead to a reduction in the price of alcohol, the benefit of which remains to be seen.  Thankfully, Government Deputies are to lead a review of the abolition.</p>
          <p eId="para_382">As any economist could have pointed out to the Government, food inflation was never the real problem.  Between 2000 and 2006, the consumer price index rose by 27.5% but food prices rose by 16.2%, below the overall rate of inflation.  Ireland's high rates of inflation and costs of business are driven by charges for water, refuse and miscellaneous services, which have increased by a whopping 239%.  The cost of electricity has increased by 52%, motor tax by 27% and rail transport by 32%.  In other words, the main price increases have occurred in services provided by the Government or in the utilities it regulates.  As far as businesses are concerned, the Dick Turpin of rip-off Ireland is the Government rather than the private sector.  This morning, the CEO of the IDA appeared before the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, where he admitted that the contribution charges imposed by local authorities are having a serious effect on business location decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_388">The Minister of State should listen to me.  In certain counties, councillors from all parties have been forced to vote on charges.  They are too high in some counties but fair in others.  They were introduced because the money provided to local authorities for infrastructure projects was cut.  When I was first involved in local government, the average contribution from a local authority to infrastructure projects was 10% to 15%.   The contribution at present is approximately 30%.  The CEO of the IDA admitted this morning that the contributions affect business.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Insurance and telephone costs have decreased but these are outside Government control.  The increase in Government controlled charges is a major problem which must be addressed.  A process of real reform is needed to bring about value-for-money governance.  In the past two years, 35% of all new jobs created in Ireland have been in the public service, yet I know of nobody who would say there has been a 35% improvement in its quality.  On the contrary, we seem to be going backwards in a number of areas.  Controlling the public sector is key to this but, given the pay awards given to the Cabinet, I am not convinced that will happen.  The Government needs to instill a belief in service in the public sector.  I do not believe, however, that every Minister will provide the leadership required in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_390">The retail and planning guides are being reviewed in the UK by that country's Competition Commission.  I hope the same does not happen here because the retail guidelines work very well and we do not want them changed.  If anything, we need to do more to support small businesses in our towns, which might require giving more funding to local authorities to make our towns more accessible for work and shopping.  Just because the UK decides to make changes, I hope we do not go down the same road because doing so would seriously affect our competitiveness without reducing inflation.</p>

          <p eId="para_391">I speak as a new Deputy as well as a businessman.  I was disappointed in the contribution of the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, whom I respect.  One would think that Fianna Fáil had just entered Government rather than having been there for 18 of the past 20 years.  There have been some positive initiatives, such as the success of the economy, but there are also negative factors.  The job of Government backbenchers is to slap Ministers on the back and tell them what great fellows they are, but the job of the Opposition is to point out inadequacies and failings so that the Government will address them.  I was interested to hear Deputy White's contribution.  The only element missing from her conversion to Fianna Fáil was the de Valera style cailín looking out over the half door and having us all speak in Irish.</p>
          <p eId="para_392">One of the major negative factors is broadband availability, in which we are lagging significantly.  We are told that we are near the European average but we are only marginally ahead of countries such as Bulgaria, Poland, Slovakia and Hungary.  These are hardly the examples by which we should style ourselves.  It is disturbing how far we lag behind countries such as Japan, with 90 MB, or France, with 44 MB.</p>
          <p eId="para_393">I have two companies in County Wexford which have no access to broadband, whether wireless or cable, even though they employ more than 200 people.  They find it embarrassing that when they receive telephone calls, they have rush into internet cafés in the town to download broadband data.  The Minister of State is, like me, from the south-east region, where three towns with populations approaching 10,000 people, namely Gorey, Enniscorthy and New Ross, have no connection to MANs.  That is an absolute disgrace given that towns with populations of fewer than 1,000 are connected to MANs.  The Government must take stock of the facts we are setting out.</p>
          <p eId="para_394">Deputy English touched on some of the issues in regard to how the Government is influencing inflation.  Not alone did the Government change the Planning and Development Act 2000, but it also removed the provision in the legislation for imposing planning and development levies.  The Minister of State criticised Fine Gael members for voting in development levies but local authorities were obliged to introduce them.  The Government took the Act from the Statute Book and replaced it with a requirement that the local authorities had to impose development levies or lose income.</p>
          <p eId="para_395">Foreign direct investment in Turkey for 2004 was €3.5 billion.  In 2007, it is expected to be €25 billion.  Countries such as Turkey are moving on while Ireland moves backwards.</p>

          <p eId="para_397">I am pleased to have an opportunity to speak to this timely motion before the House and thank my party's spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, for tabling it.  Tackling competitiveness should be an urgent priority in budget 2008.  The foremost priority of the Minister for Finance when he makes his Budget Statement this afternoon must be to rebuild competitiveness and boost productivity.  The National Competitive Council's annual report, which was published recently, is an indictment of the Government's record in this area.  The report sets out the many challenges we face in this area, including the shift of growth from being export and productivity led to domestically driven growth which is dependent on new jobs in construction and public services for increases in GDP.</p>
          <p eId="para_398">The unfortunate slowdown in activity in the property market and increasing unemployment mean many challenges lie ahead.  Ireland's price and cost environment remains distinctly unfavourable towards firms and households.  General cost levels are among the highest in the European Union and the position is worsening, with inflation rates still among the highest in the EU.  In response to these developments, labour costs are increasing across a range of sectors at a rate well in excess of the EU average, which increases the threat of a wage-cost spiral.</p>
          <p eId="para_399">Physical infrastructure remains poor and despite high levels of investment, Ireland's international rankings in this regard have not significantly improved since 2000.  Our transport, energy and ICT infrastructures, upon which so many of our exporting sectors depend, lag behind those of our counterparts in the OECD.  The Government must ensure we bring inflation under control.  Currently running at 4.8%, it is doing untold damage to business and is affecting our competitiveness.  The Government needs to tackle rising business costs by setting an inflation target of 2%, as requested in the motion.</p>
          <p eId="para_400">The Government must also take the action needed on regulatory reform, public sector pay and taxation to ensure the inflation target is achieved.  We need better value for money regarding our infrastructure projects.  We also need to promote the creation of a lifelong learning culture and develop better performing higher level educational institutions.</p>
          <p eId="para_401">The loss of 500 jobs yesterday at Abbott Ireland in Galway shows the scale of the economic crisis affecting the economy as another large employer falls foul of international competition.</p>

          <p eId="para_405">Abbott Ireland has been a great employer, providing the type of high-end biomedical jobs Ireland is supposed to be attracting but is instead losing as our competitiveness declines.  The deficit in broadband services is one of the road blocks to competitiveness.  Ireland languishes behind other countries in league tables of broadband penetration.  This and the slow speed of broadband services here affects our ability to attract high-tech industries.  Recently, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, diverted €10 million of the funding allocated for broadband investment to the budget for the greener homes scheme.  This sends out the wrong signal.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">Tackling competitiveness should be an urgent priority in budget 2008.  I hope the Minister for Finance heeds the motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_407">I congratulate my party's spokesperson on enterprise, trade and employment, Deputy Leo Varadkar, on tabling the motion.  It is time the Government started to live in the real world.  The serious economic problems being experienced daily were evident yesterday when Abbott Ireland in Galway announced it would close.  I knew something was afoot when the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Micheál Martin, visited Castlebar the other day to announce a €70 million package for a company in the town.  While the announcement, which will not deliver new jobs, was welcome, I knew bad news was on the way.  One must watch out when a Minister visits an area to make an empty announcement.  The bad news duly came and further bad news will soon come because Ireland is no longer competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">Indirect taxation is creating a major problem.  People cannot afford to pay the stealth taxes imposed on them and small businessmen are being crucified by local authorities.  They do not get value from the rates and must pay water and refuse charges to cover the cost of increases in the salaries of local authority employees, which should be covered by central Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Tesco and Dunnes Stores are destroying small businesses.  In England communities are coming together to try to stop multiples from locating in smaller towns because they are destroying businesses and jobs.  Deputies say one thing when in opposition but do nothing about it when they cross the floor.  That applies to all Governments.  It is time we gave small businesses, which provide employment, a chance.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">The other day, a businessman in my constituency informed me that the costs of rent and the charges he pays to the local authority for water and rates mean that he will not be in business next year.  He has a young family and will have to apply for social welfare payments, which is not good for the country.  It is time small businesses were supported.  Representatives of local authorities should be told they cannot pass on higher costs through stealth charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Is the backbench Government Deputy who I heard giving out about the Opposition listening to people on the ground?  The reason we are losing jobs and that investors no longer want to invest here is that the Government has become arrogant, believes it knows everything and will not listen to anybody.  Companies, particularly in the manufacturing industry, can invest in Britain and other cheaper parts of Europe.  The Government needs to live in the real world.</p>

          <p eId="para_412">One of the great myths successfully perpetuated during the recent election campaign was that Fianna Fáil is competent in economic matters.  I look forward to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, explaining to the House today how, in 12 short months, the surplus of €4 billion he presided over last year has become a €2 billion deficit.  This development destroys the myth that he and the Government are competent in economic matters.  We hear that the Government will borrow money.  While I have no difficulty with borrowing for sound economic projects, I do not trust the Government in this matter because we have seen where Fianna Fáil borrowing led us before.</p>
          <p eId="para_413">On a point raised by Deputy English, one of the cornerstones of our economic success in the past 40 years was the introduction of free secondary education by the former Minister for Education, Donogh O'Malley.  A further pillar on which our recent economic performance was built was the delivery by the former Taoiseach, Mr. John Bruton, of a corporation tax rate of 12.5%.  Now we see Fianna Fáil Ministers sitting around tables in Europe threatening to negotiate changes in the corporate tax rate and thereby undermine one of the foundations of our economic success.</p>

          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_415">It is a fact.  Competitive issues impact on our constituencies.  On 28 June, I raised under Standing Order 32 the threat to 120 jobs in Molex Ireland in Millstreet, but unfortunately my request to adjourn the Dáil to debate the issue was ruled out of order.  Since then, the job losses have been announced and 120 people in this small north Cork town face a new year of uncertainty and unemployment, as do their colleagues in Abbott Ireland in Galway.  Molex Ireland is just one example of companies in rural areas relocating to more favourable locations due to competitive and cost issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_416">Ireland has lost considerable cost competitiveness in the past five years and is no longer viewed as a prime location in which to do business.  Rural areas will continue to suffer most at the hands of a Government which has failed to manage these issues and provide suitable infrastructure in rural areas.  Deputies referred to roads and broadband.  A report published by Agri Aware this week on the future of the Irish economy, particularly in rural areas, points out that one of the significant characteristics of Irish economic performance in the past couple of decades has been the imbalanced nature of economic activity and development, with the eastern seaboard doing significantly better than most other parts of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_417">To date the national spatial strategy has not succeeded in achieving its objectives of generating more balanced regional development.  Rural areas are still not seeing the sort of infrastructural investment necessary to generate economic activity.  Rural Ireland is still not a focus of policies aimed at innovation and economic dynamism.  Take for example infrastructure as basic as broadband and roads.  Many parts of my constituency still await the roll-out of first generation broadband.  We have heard the Government speak of third and fourth generation broadband.  We certainly feel as if we are on the hind tit in rural Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_418">Macroom and Charleville, towns in my constituency, desperately need a bypass.  The Macroom bypass is not on the Government's inter-urban routes or the Atlantic gateway and we have been told recently by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Dempsey, that we will have to wait at least until 2015 before that is completed.</p>
          <p eId="para_419">The nature of EU funding is changing.  I notice that the Gaeltacht areas in my constituency will not have a more competitive advantage in terms of relocating industry than any other part of the country.  That is a further failure of a Government that has paid lip service to the Irish language.</p>
          <p eId="para_420">A small industrialist in my constituency paid more than €300,000 per annum for electricity supply.  Last year he negotiated a new supply at significantly less cost for the units of electricity he would consume.  However, because of regulator charges, over which the Government has presided he has to pay in addition to the cost of the units, of the order of €60,000 to €70,000 to a regulator, so that his net bill for electricity has increased.  That is a damning indictment of a Government that professes to care about economic competitiveness and is evidence in a single case of how the Government has failed.</p>

          <from>Deputy James Bannon</from>
          <p eId="para_421">Ireland is currently on the high road to nowhere unless investment is urgently put in place to counteract infrastructural deficits, and if our economy is to retain its competitiveness.  According to the latest global competitiveness index, compiled by the World Economic Forum, Ireland's infrastructure was ranked poorly at 47th and is the most problematic factor for those wanting to do business in Ireland.  The report ranks Irish ports as low as 64th best in the world, roads at 60th and rail infrastructure as low as 55th.  Traffic congestion is costing business more than €2.5 billion per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_422">Ireland's share of world trade has been declining since 2002 and as a result net exports, that is exports less imports have contributed virtually nothing to national economic growth since 2003.  In a huge blow to Irish competitiveness, our inflation rate is growing at a rate of 38% faster than the rest of the Eurozone.</p>
          <p eId="para_423">According to the <i>Sunday Independent,</i>“Messrs. Cowen and Ahern are master muddlers”.  I would be inclined to say “experts at muddying the waters”.  The Government’s election manifesto was based on miscalculated growth targets, but we are told that we should not be afraid as what was promised will be recycled and repackaged for the next two or three years, or hopefully less in the short lifetime of the current Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_424">The inescapable fact is that Ireland's competitiveness is foundering on the shaky foundations of our substandard infrastructure.  Rural Ireland is suffering continuing job losses as demonstrated by the loss of 500 jobs in Abbott's in Galway and 32 in Longford yesterday.  With further manufacturing job losses likely and agriculture also set to be hit, unbalanced regional development policies need to be changed.  The Government cannot stand idly by and allow rural Ireland to become more economically depressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_425">The past ten years will be regarded as a wasted decade.  A debt fuelled property and construction boom has provided unprecedented resources to the Exchequer but they have been largely squandered by the Government and a Minister for Finance with no thirst for reform but a huge appetite for reckless spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_426">The Government and Eircom have been jointly responsible for an appalling performance in the delivery of broadband services across the country and particularly in Longford-Westmeath.</p>
          <p eId="para_427">Rural Ireland is losing money, time, jobs and investment and cannot afford further Government mishandling of the telecoms sector.  The inadequate investment to date in broadband roll-out, rail and road infrastructure and waste disposal, is placing a heavy burden on businesses in the form of higher costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_428">I have no doubt that the multitude of taxes and levies imposed by the Government has raised the cost of production and depressed jobs.  What is needed is an industrial strategy and that is not evident in current Government policies.  This is the general principle that has served this country well since Alan Dukes' Tallaght strategy of lower taxes and higher skills.  I have much more to say if time permitted.  The Government should be ashamed of itself for the way it has performed during the past 11 years——</p>

          <p eId="para_431">D-Day has arrived and this afternoon the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, will rise in this Chamber to deliver his Budget Statement.  The Minister said during the election campaign, when referring to the economy, "There has been a transformation in Ireland in the last ten years".  There has been a transformation all right, the boom has turned to gloom and doom, inflation is rising, tax receipts are plummeting, the construction industry is under pressure, oil prices are at an all time high, the economic outlook is bleak and uncertain.  Over the past ten years this Government has presided over Ireland's deteriorating competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Job losses have become the norm in my region in recent months, 178 job losses at Tyco Electronics, 30 job losses at John Crane Limited, 80 job losses at Thompson Financial and 51 shed at Aer Lingus.  Yesterday we heard more devastating news in the region — the loss of 500 jobs at Abbott Vascular in Galway.  Manufacturing jobs are haemorrhaging from our region and the Government has failed to act.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">The latest CSO quarterly national household survey confirmed that the mid-west region was the only region failing to show an increase in employment growth with the number of persons in employment falling by 2,700.  These figures are consistent with the release of information to me following a parliamentary question that job numbers decreased in the Shannon free zone by 3.8% between 2004 and 2006 with the number of companies operating in the Shannon free zone reducing from 112 to 101.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">Companies in the Shannon free zone spend in excess of €610 million on wages and Irish sourced materials and general sales of 3.3 billion with 70% of these sales accounted for by the international services sector.  The picture is similar throughout the county of Clare.  Permanent job losses have fallen from 2,735 to 2,678 in companies supported by the IDA and Enterprise Ireland throughout County Clare, excluding the Shannon free zone during the same period.  Significantly though, there has been no growth in the number of companies in the county which totals 142.  The IDA supports nine companies in the county, six of which are located in Ennis.  I am very disappointed that we have not seen the development of new companies in other areas of the county, particularly in west Clare where the growth and development of industry is vital in ensuring that the benefits of economic and social progress are distributed throughout rural areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_435">In January 2007 responsibility for indigenous industry was transferred from Shannon Development to Enterprise Ireland.  In this sector prior to this it was one of the areas showing a growth in job numbers rising to 1,674 in 2006 from 1,621 in 2002.  It is important that the growth of indigenous industries is encouraged and that Enterprise Ireland continues to support community enterprise centres.  It is currently in discussions with such a group in Kilrush and I hope this project will come to fruition.  Kilrush has been transformed in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_436">There is no doubt the orange light is on in our region but will the Government heed the warning signs?  The Government has no joined up thinking when it comes to balanced regional development.  Recent months have shown how little our region features on the Government's radar.  The failure to safeguard the Heathrow slots in the region is unnerving the already nervous industrial sector.  With 70% of sales from the industrial estate to international markets the loss of this connectivity will add unnecessary costs to doing business in our region.</p>
          <p eId="para_437">If our region is to continue to be attractive for inward and indigenous investment we must have first-class services.  We must have first-class access by air, road and rail and first-class broadband connections throughout the county.  It is vital, therefore, that this region is chosen for a pilot programme for the extension of the new generation network and that broadband is fast tracked to rural communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_438">Government action is required to stop the slide.  Connectivity to Heathrow must be restored.  With 40% of US based companies located in the west of Ireland a daily year round US direct service must be maintained.  Infrastructural projects promised under Transport 21 must be fast tracked.  The Government has failed to announce funding for the $53 million tourism and economic development plan in recent times and I hope funding is provided for this in today's budget.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">I am delighted to have the opportunity to address this motion and to do so from a positive perspective.  Ireland's competitive performance is, quite frankly, solid.  We have many competitive strengths that are often ignored, underplayed or minimised.  We have heard many of the negative aspects in this debate yet there is hardly any recognition from the Opposition of how far we have come, let alone of the distinctive competitive capacity we have developed in many areas over the past few years.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">For example, I heard comments in the house that our indigenous sector is neglected.  This displays an amazing lack of understanding of the wide-ranging restructuring that has taken place within Enterprise Ireland to design new programmes so our important SME sector can adapt, innovate and grow in the context of globalisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">Almost all of the activities of the Irish economy are ultimately validated by the international marketplace and its impact on jobs, growth and prosperity.  Since 1994, our exports have grown at a rate twice that of the European Union and three times that of total world trade.  Our export growth is among the highest in the OECD.  Seven of the world's top ten ICT companies have a substantial base in Ireland.  Thirteen of the top 15 pharmaceutical companies in the world have substantial operations in Ireland.  Eight of the top ten software suppliers in the world have operations here.  We have created more jobs in the past ten years than in any similar time in our history.</p>

          <p eId="para_447">Our economy has been transformed.  The change has not been centred just in the foreign direct investment sector, it has spread throughout the economy such that local companies now have the capacity and financial muscle to be foreign investors in their own right.  The stock of outward direct investment from Irish firms grew by almost 325% between 2000 and 2005 or from $28 billion to $118 billion.  We are deeply interconnected and entangled with the global economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">These changes are beginning to make a real impact on the nature of economic activity and employment in the economy.  As we earn the dividend in terms of growing employment and greater prosperity, throughout the world others now look to Ireland as one of the best examples of sound economic management and creative solutions to the challenges of modernisation.  I do not believe there is one Member in this House who has not, while abroad, experienced being congratulated by strangers and acquaintances on our economic success.</p>

          <p eId="para_450">Is this tangible evidence of an uncompetitive economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_451">There has also been considerable negative comment about infrastructure but these comments completely ignore the fact we are improving and catching up with an unprecedented growth rate.  These observations also overlook what has been and will be achieved.  In November 2005 the Government launched Transport 21, a €34 billion ten-year capital investment programme to transform transport infrastructure and services.  This was in recognition that delivery on this front was absolutely central to our competitiveness and continued long-term and sustainable social and economic prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_452">There is no doubt the unprecedented level of economic growth in the past decade, particularly since the turn of the century, has put massive pressure on our roads, rail, air and other public transport services.  By 2015, however, we will have transformed the national roads network with high standard interurban routes connecting the island's main cities and other key road routes such as the Atlantic road corridor.</p>

          <p eId="para_458">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I will take up where the Minister of State, Deputy Seán Haughey, left off in regard to the roll-out of infrastructure.  One of the key issues affecting our lack of competitiveness is the lack of development of infrastructure, particularly road and rail infrastructure, which I will address with regard to the situation in my constituency.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">For many years, bypasses have been sought for three towns in the area, Adare, Newcastle West and Abbeyfeale, but we are no nearer their construction than was the case ten years ago.  It is many years since the decision was taken to bypass Adare.  A third examination is under way to try to identify the route of the bypass.  Is this efficiency?  There is serious gridlock, morning and night, in and outside the village, which has created frustration for those commuting to and from Limerick city from the west of the county.  Not alone that, serious rat-runs have developed on the byroads around Adare.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Local people are extremely concerned for their safety and that of their children.  When drivers leave the main road, they often do not observe the speed limits and driving standards they would if they were commuting on the main road.  What is accepted as the most beautiful village in the country is clogged up with articulated trucks and heavy traffic, although 15 years ago it was expected that this traffic would be removed from the area.  There are also major traffic hold-ups in Newcastle West and, in particular, Abbeyfeale, so that access to Kerry and other areas is being frustrated.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">With regard to rail infrastructure, just three weeks ago the Foynes connection which serviced the town for 150 years was disconnected.  The Foynes route was not being used but we were assured it was in a care and maintenance position, with a view to a service being reintroduced if developments relating to marine-type enterprises in Foynes, which we have long promoted, came on stream.  That rail connection has now been disconnected.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">We hear of intercity connectivity.  We need more than just connectivity between the city of Limerick and Dublin and between Dublin and Cork.  Areas outside these also deserve an opportunity to develop and deserve the infrastructure that would encourage people to invest in them.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I recently asked when funding would be provided for the Adare bypass but was told it was not a matter for the Minister.  However, when I asked the Minister to report on the delivery of vital infrastructure projects, such as key road and rail projects, he had no problem answering.  I was given the information and found that Adare was not included.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">The Minister could have answered when I first asked the question.  This is an indication of how the Government chooses what to answer and what to account for in the House, and this applies to several Ministers, not just the Minister present.  If there is negative news, it is not the Government's business but if there is positive news, it is prepared to answer.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">Public representatives come under much pressure with regard to the provision of broadband in our areas.  While some broadband services have been rolled out by Eircom and other companies, there are large areas where the people are crying out for connectivity to do their business.  The Government should make it a priority that a 100% broadband service would be available in every area, particularly rural areas, where people are now prepared to work from home using proper connectivity rather than sit stuck in long lines of cars.</p>

        <speech by="#JohnOMahony" eId="spk_202">
          <from>Deputy John O’Mahony</from>
          <p eId="para_466">I am glad to contribute to the Fine Gael motion.  It is particularly apt it should be debated at this time, just before the budget, when the Government has another chance to create conditions for Ireland to reverse the trend it has experienced in recent times and help make our country competitive again.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">All the facts and figures in this year's report by the National Competitiveness Council confirm in stark terms what we are already seeing on the ground.  Our share of exports in world markets has fallen since 2002 and domestic inflation has eroded Irish price and cost competitiveness.  In addition, as regards productivity growth, Ireland has lost its place as an international front-runner and now lags behind the OECD average.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">The lack of physical infrastructure across a wide area of the economy has been a major source of competitive disadvantage.  The inability of our roads, rail, ports and airports to cope with economic and population growth in the 1990s is now coming home to roost.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">The Minister of State, Deputy Haughey, said that we are improving and catching up.  While the east coast might be improving, that is not the experience in the west.  The boom in the construction industry in recent years and the growth in jobs it produced masked the fact that manufacturing and agriculture lost thousands of jobs in the same period.  Construction now accounts for one in seven workers, compared to one in 17 in the United States.  With the building boom slowing down rapidly, one does not need to be a genius to work out that we have a problem on our hands.</p>
          <p eId="para_470">It is accepted that Ireland's international competitiveness has weakened and that problem is multiplied to an even greater degree in the west.  Rural areas, including small towns, are struggling to compete nationally, not to mind internationally.  If our national infrastructure cannot keep up with demand, what chance has the west coast of doing so?  It has been way down the priority list during the boom years when there was a golden opportunity to advance balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_471">The west urgently needs the western rail corridor to help develop the region.  Part of the corridor is currently being built from Ennis to Claremorris, but no date has been given for rebuilding the remaining section to Sligo.  This section passes by Ireland West Airport Knock, offering an ideal opportunity to develop the region in a structured and linked-up way.  Completing the western rail corridor will connect the two gateways of Galway and Sligo, thus revitalising smaller towns along the way.  The completion of the western rail corridor from Mayo to Sligo is the true test of the Government's commitment to balanced regional development.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The snail's pace roll-out of broadband in the west is not giving business and industry a chance to complete on an even playing field.  I could give countless examples of individuals with small businesses who are unable to operate in numerous parts of Mayo because broadband is not available to them.  One such example is in Kiltimagh where people are awaiting the Government's go-ahead to operate MANs.  The IRD in the town is frustrated that the connection to the network, which has been there since 2003, has been denied to them despite umpteen requests to the company operating the scheme on the Government's behalf.  Kiltimagh is currently promoting the Cairn international trade centre project, which could provide 150 jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_473">The map supplied for Transport 21 opening up the regions tells us everything about the competitiveness problems facing the west.  Only one motorway is going into Connacht.  Other projects, such as the N26, have been delayed.  In addition, the N6, N17, N83, N5 and many others are so far behind that they need to be seriously accelerated if we are going to attain competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">Ballina and north Mayo's progress is being seriously curtailed by the infrastructural deficit in the region.  At the other end of the county, Ballinrobe and Ballyhaunis are in a similar situation.  If Ireland is to become competitive, we need a much better and more prudent use of our resources than has happened in the past ten years.  I commend the Fine Gael motion to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#LeoVaradkar" eId="spk_203">
          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_475">In tabling this motion, Fine Gael hoped to promote a serious debate on the future prospects of the economy, which depends on competitiveness.  Together with my colleagues, I recognised the initial economic success of the Government in its first three years in office.  However, we also charted the subsequent change in policy and demonstrated how a series of serious policy mistakes caused Ireland to fall from fifth to 22nd place in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness rankings.  In the greater part of my speech, I focused on Fine Gael's proposals to restore competitiveness.  I concluded with an optimistic outlook for the economy in the longer term, provided we make the necessary changes in areas such as infrastructure, regulation and public sector reform.  One Minister, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, described public sector reform as the elephant in the room, an old order that has to change.  After ten years, however, nothing is going to change as long as this Government stays in power.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Despite the comments of the Members opposite, most of my speech dealt with Fine Gael's serious proposals to improve competitiveness, but all of them were ignored by the Ministers involved.  Rather than engaging in a serious debate on this issue, all three Ministers delivered snide, negative, mean-spirited and bitter speeches that were unbecoming of Ministers who have been in office for ten years.</p>

          <from>Deputy Leo Varadkar</from>
          <p eId="para_482">It is interesting to read the Minister's speech which mentioned the word "competitiveness" 18 times, yet refers to Fine Gael 19 times.  In his speech, the Minister of State, Deputy McGuinness, used the words "Fine Gael" six times, twice more than the word "competitiveness".  They are more interested in slagging off the Opposition — they are afraid of us for the first time in a long time — than they are in addressing serious issues like competitiveness.  They accused Fine Gael of being unwilling to take a policy stance which would upset any substantial interest group.  We took a stance on benchmarking and if the Government had had the courage to take such a stand, it would be upsetting a lot less people than it is today.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">The Minister said we are unable to adopt a fiscal policy, which is totally untrue.  Only last week, Deputy Bruton published a document setting out in detail our fiscal policy and budgetary perspectives.  It is there for Ministers to read should they choose to do so.  The Minister also argued that we used selective statistics, but he is an expert in doing that himself.  For example, he claimed the IMD ranks Ireland second in investment and first in CPT.  However, he omitted the fact that the IMD has reduced Ireland's competitiveness ranking from fourth to 13th since he became Minister.  On our share of world trade he selected out services.  He said our share of services went from 1.87% to 2.54% in 2006.  The National Competitiveness Council states clearly that Ireland's share of world trade services, a small but growing component of Irish trade, increased in 2006 after a slight decline in 2005.  That is true, but the Minister left out the NCC's statement that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_484">Ireland's overall loss in world market share is not simply a reflection of the growing role of developing economies in world trade.  While China continues to gain market share globally, a range of developed economies also continue grow their international trading sectors, including Germany, Japan and the UK.  Ireland's net contribution to world trade has fallen for each of the past four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_485">The Minister lectures us about using selective statistics.  I will cite another part of the Minister's speech which is factually incorrect.  It is appalling for a Minister to get his facts so wrong.  He claimed that Ireland had the lowest unemployment rates in the OECD after Denmark and the Netherlands.  We checked those figures with the OCED today and using standardised, seasonally-adjusted unemployment rates the following countries, in addition to the Netherlands and Denmark, have low unemployment: Australia at 4.3%, Austria, 4.4%, Japan, 3.8%, Korea, 3.2%, New Zealand, 3.5%, Norway, 2.6%, and Switzerland, 3.6%.  Should I continue?  It really is extraordinary.</p>

          if existing inter-county Leader programmes will cease under the delivery of the new Leader programme in favour of single county structures; if existing rural development programmes will finish as a result; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          </question>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_217">
            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_778">Arising from the joint ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures, the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and to improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  This process is informed by the following guiding principles: improving on the ground services; streamlining structures to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads; bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures; and strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_779">The core objective of the process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and alignment of local delivery structures.  The intention is that for the future, there will be one local development company in any given area and fewer local development companies overall.  This will provide full county coverage and eliminate overlaps and previous fragmented arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_780">Following exhaustive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, the Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development companies in March of this year and clarified the arrangements in respect of the membership of the boards of these bodies in late July.  Leader and partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_781">The realignment of local delivery structures will bring the overall number of local development delivery bodies to 55, comprising 38 integrated Leader-partnership bodies in rural areas and 17 partnerships covering urban areas.  In most cases, the Government agreed that coverage areas would be aligned with county and city boundaries, with the number of structures in a county determined on the basis of population and overall geography.  Some companies will continue to operate on a cross-county basis and there would be no objection to companies in separate areas taking a joint approach to the rural development programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_782">The existing Leader+ and NRDP programmes for 2000 to 2006 have now effectively concluded and the process of closing the programmes is under way.  Applications will shortly be sought from prospective local action groups with regard to the implementation of the new rural development programme 2007-2013.  My Department is providing funding to Leader companies to enable them to meet their obligations regarding the administration and closure of the 2000 to 2006 programmes and maintain continuity and expertise pending the commencement of the new rural development programme.  Transitional arrangements are also being put in place in respect of other development schemes, such as the rural social scheme, pending the necessary administrative adjustments arising from the boundary changes coming into effect.</p>

            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_783">How many current inter-county programmes will be affected by this change in the structure?  Could the Minister also tell me how many people working with existing Leader companies will be affected by job losses?  A suggestion has been made by Leader groups, particularly in Cavan-Monaghan, that what the Minister is doing breaches EU regulations.  Will the Minister respond to this?</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_219" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_784">In response to the last question, I am confident this is not so.  In respect of the number of groups that were cross-county and are now single county, off the top of my head, I cannot give the Deputy an answer.  As far as I can remember, part of one of the groups in Mayo extended into west Sligo.  That has now become a county group in Sligo.  In respect of Leitrim north Roscommon, I understand that they are setting up a body in Leitrim and a body in Roscommon.  There was already a Cavan partnership and a Monaghan partnership, while the Leader programme was a joint programme for the two counties.  Since we are amalgamating the Leader and partnership programmes, they could not agree as to whether it would be a Leader partnership for the two counties or two Leader partnerships.  That was where the difficulty arose there.  There were a number of community partnerships in Kilkenny and south Tipperary so it does not just relate to Leader companies.  There will be one in Kilkenny and another in south Tipperary.</p>
            <p eId="para_785">One must understand that there were partnership groups involved in every part of this process as well.  We are maintaining Duhallow, a programme in a part of County Limerick whose name escapes me at the moment and the Gaeltacht and the islands because the Gaeltacht does not lend itself to a county structure and it is important to provide services.</p>
            <p eId="para_786">It is obviously up to new bodies in respect of employment but the intention was to employ everybody.  Where some body stands outside the process——</p>

            <p eId="para_789">The Minister accepts that the Leader companies have done a good job where they have been working even if there were two in particular counties.  Now that they are being amalgamated, people are concerned that there will be job losses but the Minister has confirmed that most of these people will move in with the company that is selected.</p>
            <p eId="para_790">When is it expected to announce Leader IV and its funding?  Many people, particularly in rural areas, wait to apply for grant aid and companies are waiting for their funding.  When does the Minister expect to have it up and running?</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_223" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_791">Most of the companies have now been set up under the new structure.  As the Deputy is aware, the Leader company in Cavan-Monaghan wrote to the EU.  They wrote to us and we replied to them.  I hope to move ahead very shortly and announce the programme.  The good thing is that full funding for the programme is still preserved so no matter when we start, it is still there for the 2007-2013 period so the money is secured.  I am very anxious to proceed with this.</p>
            <p eId="para_792">Nobody has ever criticised any work carried out by Leader companies or partnerships.  People always tell us that we have too many bodies out there.  All I would maintain is that in the overall scheme of things, it is better to have the one agency delivering the partnership, the rural social scheme and the Leader programmes in any one given area.  It is better for the community and at the end of the day, I always look to what the ordinary person on the side of the street would like and I think they like the idea of one community-based partnership agency being able to provide all the services.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs" eId="spk_224">
            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_794">I assume the Deputy is referring primarily to the tragic cocaine-related incident that occurred in Ballybeg in Waterford last week.  I express my condolences to the family of Kevin Doyle on their great loss and send my good wishes to John Grey and his family.  I hope he makes a full recovery.  The details of the incident available to me are those reported in the media.</p>
            <p eId="para_795">Since I became Minister of State with responsibility for the national drugs strategy earlier this year, I have repeatedly warned of the dangers of illegal drug use.  In that regard, I have a particular focus on prevention and believe that if we can prevent people starting a drug habit, we can help prevent the heartache and pain, as well as the social and financial problems that arise as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_796">The challenge is to change attitudes among problem drug users and potential users and this is not an easy task.  At national level, responsibility for a national drugs awareness campaign rests with the Health Services Executive in the first instance but my Department is involved in developing proposals through the advisory group established in that regard.  The upcoming campaign will focus on cocaine.  Its primary aim will be to communicate the dangers of cocaine use, with a particular focus on so-called "recreational cocaine users" in the 15-34 age group.  It will utilise appropriate media, such as social network websites, to target this age group.  Other proposals include the use of billboard and bus advertising and targeted radio advertising.</p>
            <p eId="para_797">It will not be possible to get the national campaign up and running for the Christmas period, although the health promotion unit of the HSE hopes to post "banners" advising of the upcoming campaign on several prominent websites.  However, the campaign will kick off early in the new year.  Furthermore, I am sure the Garda will be particularly vigilant regarding the risks of drug use over the Christmas period.</p>
            <p eId="para_798">Meanwhile, a significant level of information in regard to the dangers of illicit drug use is disseminated at local and regional drugs task force level through specific projects, drug awareness weeks and other initiatives funded by my Department.  Also, the main aim of projects funded by my Department through the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse.  In that context, it should be noted that under the fund, money is also being made available to five national youth organisations to disseminate drug prevention and awareness messages to young people.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#JackWall" eId="spk_225">
            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_799">I thank the Minister of State for his detailed reply.  Obviously, we have seen in recent months the effort, time and dedication given in respect of road traffic deaths.  A similar matter is coming on stream now.  I wish to be associated with the sympathies expressed by the Minister of State to the Doyle family.  I also wish the Grey family well.  After a major level of debate, advertisement and involvement in road deaths, we need a similar effort in drugs and the deaths related to drugs.  A chance meeting in a public house led to the person in Waterford going to a party and the young man, who fought cancer and had the world at his feet, is unfortunately dead.  I acknowledge the Minister of State's point about advertisements but it is no use that the HSE will take steps in the new year.  I ask the Minister of State to broadcast verbal warnings on the radio and an appeal before the Christmas party season begins.  It would be of benefit and it should be done.  I ask the Minister of State and the senior Minister to consider this.  They have the lead in this and have the support of the Opposition, as seen in last week's debate.  This should be a once-off measure, after which the HSE can undertake a campaign.  Something should be done for the Christmas period.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_226" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_800">The debate last week began that process.  The Taoiseach called on anyone likely to get involved in drug misuse not to do so.  I echo the call of the Doyle family that young people say no to drugs.  A number of local radio stations are working in this regard.  The cross care site seems to have attracted an enormous amount of attention when Members spoke of engaging with web-based technology in promoting awareness campaigns.  I found it extraordinary that there were 5,000 new registrations on that site.  Today I received an e-mail from another web-based organisation involved in drugs education, stating that it is prepared to co-operate with the scheme.  I do not underestimate the challenge.</p>
            <p eId="para_801">I call on anyone tempted to get involved in drug misuse to say no to the temptation.  I ask people to look out for unusual behaviour in their work colleagues aged 20 to 35, including unusual attendance or absence patterns or missed repayments on the house, apartment, car or motorbike.  At home, those living with younger people should look out for unusual patterns of coming, going, sleeping and eating or valuables disappearing from the house.  It may be due to other factors but these are signs associated with drug misuse.</p>
            <p eId="para_802">Excellent campaigns by transition year students throughout the country on alcohol and drug misuse have taken place.  This is a lethal cocktail — alcohol and drugs, or polydrug use, is the new phenomenon we must address.</p>

        <b>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs</b>
          the way his Department spent the €200 million which the Government says it spent on problem drug use in 2006; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_804">The estimated expenditure of over €200 million on problem drug use in 2006 refers to spending across all Departments and agencies, rather than the figure for my Department alone.  Through the interdepartmental group on drugs, relevant Departments and agencies reported on their 2006 expenditure and the total was in excess of €200 million.  Of this amount, €41 million related to expenditure under the drugs initiative young people's facilities and services fund, funded through my Department.  In this context, the figures, which should be interpreted as indicative, relate only to services that are considered to be directly attributable to dealing with problem drug use.  The figure does not take account of many mainstream services that also assist in tackling problems associated with drugs misuse.  It has not proved feasible to accurately segregate the funding aimed at assisting problem drug users from that aimed at the wider community.  A breakdown of the 2006 expenditure is set out in the following table.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_830">Last week we stated that over €200 million was spent on drugs and, on the streets, there is reason to believe it is not working.  Whatever is happening to this money, it is not being spent on services.  The tragic loss of the young man celebrating his 21st birthday brings home the lack of knowledge and understanding of the misuse of drugs, even on a once-off basis.  People in my area have asked what impact the local task forces have and the manner in which the money is distributed to local task forces.  How is there a lack of initiative from the local drugs task forces to deal with people on a one-to-one basis?  Is it due to funding or are there not enough people employed in the services?  Why are we dependent on voluntary groups, such as the Lions Club, to fund the travel of people such as the chief executive of Tacade in England to give in-service days to teachers in the Dublin area?  Why is this not funded by the Government?  I stress how important it is to seek the alcohol and drug awareness programme for students of senior cycle in school.  It has not been set up and the Minister's reply last week suggested it would be some time before it is set up.  We cannot wait any longer.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_229" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_831">There is still a serious misunderstanding of the magnitude of the problem facing us.  I have never tried to minimise the challenge with regard to the scale of drug misuse.  The local drug task forces and increasingly the regional drugs task forces have an impact.  I am fairly conversant at this stage with their work.  The local drugs task force work is a collaborative effort drawn up under the national drugs strategy.  It is not the Government's strategy alone, it is a national drug strategy, primarily driven by the voluntary and community sector.  I do not denigrate the input of State agencies but those working on the ground fully understand the impact the problem has on communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_832">Deputy Byrne asked how the money is distributed.  This happens through a process of submission, strategic plans and detailed submissions to the local drugs task force, in the first instance, which is then referred to the national drugs strategy team.  A detailed assessment is done at that stage.  Members of the national drug strategy team work full time and are drawn from State agencies and the community and voluntary sector.  They make recommendations to me and, in my experience and that of my predecessor, the vast majority of programmes recommended are approved.  The teams are aware of the allocation of money and the amount available to each local and regional task force is approved in consultation with them.  The money available in the coming year will be no less than the amount for last year.  All programmes are drawn down by prior agreement with those proposing them.  Account is taken of value for money and a value for money audit has been carried out on most of them, with positive outcomes.  The local and regional drugs task forces are the most efficient method of delivering services.</p>

            <from>Deputy Catherine Byrne</from>
            <p eId="para_833">I agree with the Minister of State.  I grew up in an area plagued by drugs.  People ask questions, including whether the local drugs task forces are making an impact.  I was informed by three different local drugs task forces last week that one of the biggest problems they face is that of young people taking ordinary pills.  This is a major problem in every community, even that which I represent, and I am concerned about it.  I accept that money is being channelled into the projects but I must question whether what is happening on the ground is sufficient.  It is obviously not sufficient because, if it were, young people of ten or 12 years of age would not be taking pills of all sorts.  They can get some of these in the medicine chests in their own homes.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_834">The projects are having an impact.  One of the best projects I have seen in recent times is the transition year project in the Deputy's area which is run in conjunction with the Ballyfermot youth service and local schools and which relates to raising awareness of drugs and alcohol misuse.  The Deputy is well aware of Base and other projects in Ballyfermot, Inchicore and the south inner city and the impact they are having.  One of our difficulties is that because there is a greater range of services available, more people are presenting in order to make use of them.  This is a good sign of the effectiveness of these projects.  It will be a long time before there is an entirely adequate response to many of the challenges we face.</p>

          the work that has been carried out in respect of the promised 20-year strategy for the Irish language since 1997 to date in 2007; if it will be published by the end of 2008; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_836">As I advised the House on a number of previous occasions in reply to related questions on this matter, and more recently during the course of statements in the House on 8 November 2007, the Government published its statement on the Irish language in December 2006.  That statement provides for the development of a 20-year strategy for the Irish language, which is intended to be the foundation for practical action for supporting and promoting the language, based on a modern, integrated approach.</p>
            <p eId="para_837">My Department, during the course of 2007, has been engaged in a public procurement process regarding the appointment of consultants to advise in respect of the strategy.  This process is nearing completion and I expect that consultants will be appointed by the end of the year.  It was envisaged at the time of the statement's publication that it would take up to two years for the strategy to be prepared.  I am confident that this target will be achieved and that the strategy will be completed by December 2008.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#BrianOShea" eId="spk_233">
            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_838">The answer is more or less as I feared.  It is almost a year since the statement on the Irish language and there is still no absolute guarantee that the consultants will be appointed before the end of the year.  The Minister stated that he expects the strategy to be completed by the end of next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_839">There is a need to examine the background to this matter.  There are contradictory dates on the Department's website but in June or July 2004 Fóram na Gaeilge was established and charged with advising the Minister on the strategy.  On 30 December 2005, Coiste Comhairleach na Gaeilge, the advisory council set up to advise the Minister on the Gaeltacht Commission's report, and Fóram na Gaeilge were amalgamated.  The Department has been dealing with the Irish language since 1997 but there is still no firm date regarding when the strategy will be produced.  The Minister has come around to the view — he was not always enamoured of it — that a strategy is fundamental.</p>

            <p eId="para_857">An aontaíonn an tAire go bhfuil an coimisiún iltheangach sa Chomhaontas Eorpach an-imníoch faoin easpa réamhullmhúcháin a bhí déanta againn nuair a aithníodh an Ghaeilge mar theanga oifigiúl san Eoraip?  Ceann de na gearáin a rinne sé, ná go bhfuil graiméar na Gaeilge as chló agus as dáta agus go bhfuil institiúdí éagsúla ag cur a chuid gramadaí féin ar fáil agus go bhfuil seo ag cur daoine ag leibhéal na hEorpa ar strae.  Cén uair a chuirfear graiméar Gaeilge cruinn, ceart agus nua-aimseartha ar fáil?  B'fhéidir gur féidir linn a bheith ag déileáil le canúintí sa tír seo, ach is léir nach féidir a bheith ag déileáil le canúintí ag leibhéal na hEorpa.</p>
            <p eId="para_858">As the Commissioner said, the entire lack of an Irish grammar, interpreters, etc., is undermining the use of Irish at European level.  He did not say that without good reason.</p>
            <p eId="para_859">Tá an tAire i ndiaidh snas a chur ar an ábhar, ach ní shílim go bhfuil an cheist freagartha aige.  Cén uair a bheidh graiméar úr Gaeilge ar fáil agus cén uair a bheidh go leor aistritheoirí agus lucht teangan ar fáil leis an obair thábhachtach a dhéanamh?  We all bent over backwards to have Irish recognised at European level.  However, we do not have the personnel or an Irish grammar in place.  Is Irish joke atá ann.</p>

            <p eId="para_860">An chéad uair gurb' fhios domsa go raibh suim ag an Eoraip i gceist na grammadaí ná ag deireadh na bliana seo.  I bhfad roimhe sin, bhí mé taréis iarraidh ar Fhoras na Gaeilge breathnú ar an gcaighdeán oifigiúil.  Aontaím leis an Teachta nár breathníodh ar os na 1950í.  Tuigeann an Teachta an cúlra a bhaineann leis an gcaighdeán agus an caoi ina dtógadh isteach an chéad uair é.  Chreid mé go raibh gá ann athbhreathnú a dhéanamh ar sin.  Mar is eol don Teachta, tá mé tar éis iarraidh ar Fhoras na Gaeilge tabhairt faoi sin, os rud é go bhfuil an fhoras ag obair leis an bhfoclóireacht agus go bhfuil an choiste téarmaíochta faoina gcúram freisin.  Tá an obair sin ar bun.  Bhí sé ar bun i bhfad sula dhírigh éinne an Eoraip ar an gceist.  Tá gá againn fhéin le caighdeán atá suas chun dáta.</p>
            <p eId="para_861">Maidir leis an gceist eile, is cuimhin liom cruinniú a bheith agam le Conradh an Gaeilge agus na eagraíochtaí eile nuair a bhíodar ag éileamh stádas oifigiúil oibre don Ghaeilge son Eoraip.  Ag an am, mhínigh mé dóibh gur chreid mé go mbeadh dúshlán ollmhór ann ó thaobh cúrsaí aistriúcháin de.  Dúirt na eagraíochtaí nach raibh an ceart agam ach chreid mé go raibh.  Mar is eol don Teachta, bhí an-deifir ar na bpáirtithe uilig sa dTeach seo go dtiocfaí ar aghaidh le seo.  Glacadh leis, buíochas le Dia, agus d'aontaigh an Eoraip leis.  Tugadh amscála an-ghearr — 1 Eanáir 2007 — don rud seo a chuir i bhfeidhm.  Tá dúshláin ann, ach táimid ag teacht leis na dúshláin sin.  Tá go leor céimeanna tógtha le déanamh cinnte go mbeidh daoine ar fáil le freastal ar na riachtanais.  I gcás an Tí seo, ní gá duit a bheith i do abhcóide nó i do aturnae chun aistriú a dhéanamh ar reachtaíocht.  Tá riachtanas ag an Eoraip gur chóir do oifigigh cáilíocht a bheith acu ó thaobh an dlí de, móide bheith in ann aistriú a dhéanamh go roinnt teangacha — ní díreach Gaeilge-Béarla — chun a bheith cáilithe le obair a dhéanamh ar Achtanna nó rialacha na hEorpa.  Is dúshlán breise dúinn é sin.  Tá a fhios ag an Teachta cé mhéad daoine leis na cáilíochtaí sin atá sa tír seo.  Tá dúshláin ann, ach tá comhoibriú iomlán de chuile chineál á thabhairt ag an Rialtas sa gceist seo.  Tá comhoibriú á thabhairt ag na Rannaí Stáit agus tá sé le fáil ón Eoraip.  Creidim go n-éireóidh linn na dúshláin a shárú, ach beidh de deacair.  Thuig mé ón dtús go mbeadh sé deacair.</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_875">I propose to take Questions Nos. 54, 57, 59, 71, 92, 94, 98, 99 and 189 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_876">We have already discussed issues regarding the development of the 20 year strategy on the Irish language in my reply to Question No. 52.  It was envisaged at the time of the publication of the Government statement that it would take up to two years for the strategy to be prepared.  I am confident this target will be achieved and that the strategy will be completed by December 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_877">A report was published recently on the linguistic study on the use of Irish in the Gaeltacht.  This report was presented to the Government and a decision was made to establish a Cabinet committee to consider matters arising from the analysis and recommendations of the report, and to agree an integrated action plan to secure the future of Irish as the community language in the Gaeltacht.  It will be my intention to ensure that these processes will proceed in tandem.  In the interim, my Department will continue to operate a range of schemes and initiatives, in conjunction with Foras na Gaeilge and Údarás na Gaeltachta, to support the Irish language in the Gaeltacht and in the wider community.</p>
            <p eId="para_878">Fóram na Gaeilge continues to have an role in advising me on the proposed strategy.  At a meeting that I had with the fóram on 5 March 2007, it was agreed to establish a sub-committee of the fóram to function as a link with my Department in the preparation of the strategy.  This sub-committee met in May 2007 and again in early November.  A further meeting has been scheduled for later this month.  Among the matters considered was the appointment of consultants to assist my Department in preparing the strategy.  I expect that a person will, in the near future, be assigned in my Department to assist in this work on a dedicated basis.  During the course of 2007, my Department has been engaged in a public procurement process for the appointment of consultants to advise on the strategy.  This process is nearing completion and I expect that consultants will be appointed by the end of this year.  It is intended that the public will be consulted during preparation of the strategy, as public support for the process will be vital.  With regard to the sum of €300,000 that has been earmarked to cover costs associated with the strategy's preparation, those costs will occur mainly in 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_879">The Government remains fully committed to providing every support to parents who wish to raise their children through the medium of Irish.  The issue of the national curriculum and immersion education for Gaelscoileanna is one for my colleague, the Minister for Education and Science.</p>

            <from>Deputy Brian O’Shea</from>
            <p eId="para_880">I thought the Coiste Comhairleach and Fóram na Gaeilge had been amalgamated.  Can the Minister clarify that?  This all seems to be about postponing the issue.  I know the Cabinet committee has been set up, but there are issues pertaining to the Gaeltacht that the Minister could proceed with himself.  He does not need to wait for what emerges from discussions.  He should consult with other Ministers about what their Departments could do to make Irish a strong community language in the Gaeltacht.</p>
            <p eId="para_881">I welcome the Minister's commitment to seek public support.  I have long said that, as the Irish language belongs to everyone, the more people who engage with the language, the more momentum and strength it will gain.  Can the Minister proceed in implementing the recommendations of the linguistic study as it pertains to his Department?</p>

            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_882">The best thing is to let the Cabinet committee deal with the linguistic study.  Since 1997, many things have been done to promote the Irish language in the Gaeltacht.  Údarás na Gaeltachta now commits a fixed percentage of its capital to language based industries.  It was also given much funding for the promotion of the Irish language, especially for youth clubs and so on.  We have invested a huge amount of money in facilities in the Gaeltacht, which are very important for activities there and for the Irish colleges.  We set up the campaí samhradh trí Ghaeilge.  With the cúntóirí teanga, we put native Irish speakers into schools to assist children whose Irish is not fluent.  The cuairteoirí baile scheme is operating on a pilot basis and the idea is to support parents in language issues from the time their children are born.  We operate a scheme to coach children in sports through Irish.  The growth of language-based industry in the Gaeltacht was well highlighted by Údarás na Gaeltachta in the awards ceremony on TG4 last Sunday.  Many things are happening and we will do more next year, pending the work of the Cabinet sub-committee.</p>
            <p eId="para_883">We are already involved in language planning in a number of communities, which is a big part of the linguistic study of the Gaeltacht.</p>

            <p eId="para_887">Has the Minister had discussions with the Minister for Education and Science on immersion education for gaelscoileanna?  If he has not, why not?  This is a big issue for gaelscoileanna.  The Minister for Education and Science has taken one view, but this Minister has another view.</p>
            <p eId="para_888">We were promised a dedicated civil servant to work in the Department daily to prepare the strategy.  Has that civil servant been appointed?  When will he be appointed?  Has any meeting taken place with Fóram na Gaeilge?  A number of people have also approached me who want their court cases dealt through the medium of Irish.  Has the Minister made any approach to the Courts Service on this issue?</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_259" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_889">That last issue is clearly laid down in the Official Languages Act 2003, so they have a right to have court cases heard in Irish, be they in the Gaeltacht or elsewhere.</p>
            <p eId="para_890">Regarding gaelscoileanna, responsibility for education is a matter for the Minister for Education and Science.  She made a decision on this matter, and as a member of the Cabinet, I support that decision.</p>
            <p eId="para_891">On the appointment of civil servants, as I said in my first answer, that has not happened.  It will have to happen as soon as we finalise the procurement process because we will need somebody to back them up.  Until we have the consultants in place, it is not greatly important, although later it will be critical.  The procurement process is drawn out and that is why last year I said it would take two years instead of one.  I foresaw that these issues would take longer.</p>
            <p eId="para_892">As I said in my reply, the last clear research by Fóram na Gaeilge was last March, but it set up a fochoiste on the strategic plan, which has met twice and will meet again this month.  When I set up Fóram na Gaeilge the question was not what Deputy O'Shea said.  It was not asked to advise on establishing such a strategy, but to advise on the advisability of having such a strategy.  When we discussed it, we decided to have a two-step process.  We decided to publish a clear and understandable Government statement on the headlines of Government policy on the Irish language.  This was the first time it had happened since the 1960s.  To publish a detailed strategy before we had all the headlines in place and publicly known would not have been right.  They agreed with that approach and it is worth the extra time to do it this way.  Ráiteas i Leith na Gaeilge is a clear statement.</p>

            <from>Deputy Jack Wall</from>
            <p eId="para_893">In my area there are three or four Gaelscoileanna and a Gaelcholáiste.  The parents are finding it difficult to match the education system and advance it through Irish.  Is there a short-term solution, for example, grants to allow local communities to work through the education system to have Irish classes?  In my area, successful Irish classes have been started in a small rural hall.  We will lose momentum if we wait until December 2008.  We will lose parents because they will become disillusioned about trying to apply the education system through Irish and feel they are getting lost.  Are children losing out because of this?  That is the most significant problem.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_261" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_894">Deputy Wall has asked a valid question.  One of the challenges we have faced in the past five years is the fact that Foras was on care and maintenance.  There is a link between the funding we provide and the funding in Northern Ireland.  It did not allow them to expand the programmes as I would have liked.  We need the coalface programmes, whether RAPID, CLÁR or Irish language, that get to the people who need the services.  I have always said the Gaelscoileanna should not be just a school but a community.  We must particularly support parents.  Even if they do not require fluency in the language, they should have enough to assist their children.  With the limited funds on the Coiste na Gaeilge, we have managed to increase those funds in recent years but there is a high demand.</p>
            <p eId="para_895">We provided much more money this year to Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge and they are producing books in Irish that are much higher quality and more attractive and that is important.  I also established an Irish language DVD scheme for children because while children can get English language DVDs of suitable children's programmes off the shelf, one cannot get the books and DVDs in Irish.  One of the advantages of modern technology is children probably learn as much language from the television as they do from their parents, and if the television is talking in Irish, children will absorb this quickly.  We are trying to be innovative.  The way Deputy Wall suggests we go is correct and I will work with Foras subject to resources to move in that direction.</p>

            <p eId="para_937">As the Deputy is aware, my Department was established in 2002.  Expenditure under the islands subhead of my Department's Vote from June 2002 to date is in excess of €61.5 million.  This figure includes capital expenditure in the order of €42.8 million which was directed towards infrastructural works, such as piers, slipways, airstrips, coastal protection and roads.  The current expenditure of €18.7 million over the same period was directed principally towards subventions for the transport services to the islands, including ferry services, air services and a winter helicopter service to Toraigh.  This expenditure information is available in a breakdown on a county basis, which I am happy to provide to the Deputy on request.</p>
            <p eId="para_938">As the Deputy knows, I was reappointed to my current office earlier this year.

            <p eId="para_939">In the circumstances, the Deputy will appreciate that it was not possible to collate the detailed information sought by him in the time available.  However, if the Deputy has any particular case in mind, I would be glad to provide the relevant data.</p>

            <p eId="para_940">I do not believe the purpose of the question was to collate information but rather to see what impact the grants were having on the island communities.  Are they making island life easier?  Are the people living there enjoying the benefits of the Celtic tiger economy as the rest of us are supposed to be?  Under what specific headings were the grants allocated, for example, tourism, recreational and community facilities etc.?  What is the population of the islands that is  being addressed?  Are the numbers decreasing or has there been an increase in population?  What is the Minister's overall view on ensuring island populations are good vibrant strong communities?  What else may be done as regards developing the island communities?</p>
            <p eId="para_941">It is good to hear about the infrastructure.  The purpose and tone of the question essentially is to find out where the islanders stand regarding the mainland population and how they are developing their own communities.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_301" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_942">When I initially became Minister of State with responsibility for the islands in 1997, two aspects predominated in terms of maintaining populations on the islands.  One was the physical infrastructure.  Some islands lacked water, others electricity while piers were a pervasive problem on virtually all the islands.  Roads were also a major problem and so on.  A substantial amount of money has been spent on getting the infrastructure to an adequate standard.</p>
            <p eId="para_943">The other major issue at the time, after which enormous strides have been made, related to the ferry services which were totally inadequate for modern living.  Islanders are no different from anybody else in that they want to get to and from where they live safely with ease, on a guaranteed service with a proper timetable at a reasonable price.</p>
            <p eId="para_944">To put the Deputy in the framework as regards how things were, at that time the Gaeltacht islands had subsidised ferry services, but the non-Gaeltacht islands did not.  Virtually every island with a small population, such as Long, Heir, Whiddy, Beare, Cape Clear and Sherkin, all have subsidised ferry services now.  Moving up along the west coast, Inishmore, Inishmaan, Inishboffin, Turk, Clare, Inishbiggle, Aranmore and Toraigh all now have subsidised ferry services.  I believe that was crucial.  However, the requirements are now changing and employment has become a major issue.  For that reason, I have arranged a dedicated Leader partnership just for islands, even though there are only 3,000 people there, because unless they have dedicated services we will not get the benefit of the infrastructural spend in terms of developing the population and so on.  A fairly comprehensive programme of work is in hand.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_302">
            <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
            <p eId="para_945">To be fair to the Minister, he has done some very good work for the islands and I could not take that away from him.  There are three islands in my constituency and the Minister knows that the number one issue for many years has been infrastructure and getting on and off the islands.  What are the Minister's key priorities for the islands for next year?  Will the Leader partnership for the islands promised in the agreed programme for Government happen?  Is an island allowance in place at present and, if not, what proposals has the Minister for the islanders in that regard?</p>
            <p eId="para_946">Islanders have a major cost factor to bear.  People living on an island must come to the mainland to shop.  They have to get their goods delivered to the pier and then they must pay to have them transported by boat to the island.  There should be a substantial allowance if we are to encourage people to live on the islands.  In any event, we must give them the infrastructure, back-up and supports they need.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_303" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_947">Regarding the islander's allowance, there is €12.76 extra available per week for people on old age and invalidity pensions, etc.  Regarding the Deputy's second question, the Leader partnership company is being set up.  That is all arranged and elections are taking place at present.  That is a major innovation.  Formerly they had their own Leader company.  Now they will have a Leader partnership and I believe it is much better to provide services from within to the islands.</p>
            <p eId="para_948">The third issue touched on by the Deputy related to the major initiatives for next year.  The substantial infrastructure programme continues.  As well as that, I have arranged for Údarás na Gaeltachta, my Department and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann to do a socio-economic study of the islands.  We have to find out precisely how much extra it costs an individual to live on an island.  If one wants to make a case for resources, one must always have the facts.</p>

            <p eId="para_949">Regarding the figure of 3,000 the Minister has given, is that the total population of all the islands and is it decreasing or increasing?</p>

          <speech by="#EamonOCuiv" eId="spk_305" as="#Minister_for_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív</from>
            <p eId="para_950">It is an approximate figure.  Compiling the island population is much more complicated than in the past because by Sunday night most people will have returned to the mainland.  Therefore, one gets a smaller population than one would if a census were taken every day and divided by the number of days in the week.  The figure is about 3,000 and is still decreasing on aggregate.  However, the rate of decrease has slowed down.  One of the challenges associated with turning rural populations around is the high number of old people who do not have families living with them.  Even when one is turning around the population structure, one can still get an absolute decrease in the population.  The big challenge, however, is the number of children at school and the number of people aged between 25 and 55 living on an island.  That is the target group we must reach.</p>

          the plans he has to increase the amount of support offered to volunteers to €5 million per annum; if he has begun to identify stakeholders within the community; the contact he has had with these stakeholders; the means he has identified as the most appropriate way to use this funding to further promote and develop volunteering here; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_953">I propose to take Questions Nos. 56 and 83 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_954">It is certainly encouraging that the ESRI statistics show an increase in the figures volunteering and back up the findings of the taskforce on active citizenship, which reported earlier this year.  My Department has been steadily increasing support and funding to strengthen volunteering over the past two years.  Chief among those measures is the funding provided to 13 volunteer centres around the country with a further eight at an advanced stage of pre-development.</p>
            <p eId="para_955">The Towards 2016 agreement includes a commitment of increased funding of €5 million per annum to support volunteering and the Department will use this substantial funding to further promote and develop volunteering in Ireland.  The funding is primarily being used to fund the expansion of volunteer centres throughout the country, as recommended by the task force report.  Expansion of volunteer centres to one per county will cost €5 million to implement.</p>
            <p eId="para_956">The consultation with local stakeholders within the community is being conducted in a number of ways.  The task force on active citizenship conducted a very detailed consultation with stakeholders throughout the country in compiling its report.  My Department consults at national level with the social partners and in particular with the community and voluntary pillar through regular partnership meetings.  The Department regularly meets bilaterally with national organisations and with volunteer centres to discuss progress and matters of interest.  The expansion of the number of volunteer centres is being conducted in consultation with the local partnership companies.</p>

            <p eId="para_957">I tabled this question because efforts on the ground did not seem to reflect what we were being told as regards the various organisations we come across in pursuit of our daily work.  I should like to know from the Minister of State how the report was determined and how many people and committees were evaluated and where they were done.  What was the urban-rural divide in this regard?  On the ground, as I understand it from looking at committees, the percentages being talked about here do not appear to be reflected in reality.  I hope they are, but it does not look as if there are many more volunteers on the ground now compared to 2002.  In any organisation or association I am aware of, it seems to be a few core volunteers that carry the burden at all times.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_958">During the consultation process on the White Paper on supporting voluntary activity, I understand a wide range of road shows were held and regional consultations took place.  There was consultation with the primary voluntary stakeholders.  The same exercise was carried out during the consultation phase of the task force on active citizenship.  I am aware it engaged extremely proactively with all organisations, big and small, throughout the length and breadth of the country.  Targets were set that an extra 60,000 volunteers per year would be recruited as part of the process of enabling volunteer centres.</p>
            <p eId="para_959">The Kildare volunteer centre has an extremely proactive engagement with NUI Maynooth and I launched an initiative there a couple of months ago.  Students from 60 different nationalities with people from Kildare are on a database and are available to get involved in voluntary activity.  This is the pattern throughout the country.  At present, there are 13 county volunteer centres and three are at an advanced stage of development.  I expect the remainder will be rolled out during the lifetime of the Government.</p>

            <p eId="para_960">People are busier but they want to support, help and get involved in their communities.  The major problem is people are afraid that if they get involved through bringing children to sporting events they will be sued.  Recently, the Law Reform Commission issued a report stating that the Government must introduce legislation to protect people doing work on a voluntary basis and that it is wrong for people to be sued for work they did on a voluntary basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_961">Last year, Fine Gael proposed a Good Samaritan Bill which was voted down by the Government.  What proposals does the Government have to introduce legislation to protect people who want to give voluntarily of their time to help and support their communities?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_962">I cannot comment exactly on what legislative proposals there may be, but Deputy Ring raised a valid point about the risk posed to people in getting involved in any form of activity, whether it is voluntary or otherwise.  Earlier this week, my Department funded 64 national organisations across a wide range of disciplines.  This was to enable them to provide a range of supports to volunteers over a three year period, including training of volunteers, upskilling facilitators and ensuring the areas of concern are addressed.</p>
            <p eId="para_963">It is important to encourage volunteering and have the supports necessary to underpin this involvement.  On the international day of volunteering it is appropriate that we call on more people to make their talents available to their local communities.  In return for this they will have a sense of satisfaction in contributing to the community.  The Department has a wide range of grant supports.  Deputy Ring's county is good at drawing down these grants so County Mayo must have a strong base in volunteering.</p>

            <p eId="para_965">Recent surveys show that 150,000 people leave home before 6.30 a.m. to go to work and do not return until 7 p.m.  In instances where people must travel some distance to work, they do not have an opportunity to get involved in their local communities.  Subsequent to this, their children will not get involved with clubs.  That is why I was concerned when I saw the data stating that community involvement rose from 21% to 29%.  In many towns and villages in Kildare and other places of which I am aware, this rise does not seem to be reflected.  What is the Minister of State's view on this?  How will the Department address these concerns?</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_966">The issue of commuting poses challenges for a number of people.  In many ways, this was dealt with by newer communities in expanding towns in Leinster.  One of the ways my Department will engage with these towns is through the young people's facilities and services fund and by providing additional facilities for communities, ensuring more people work with clubs and organisations.</p>
            <p eId="para_967">We should not underestimate the resource of people who take early retirement.  Recently, I was in Waterford and saw a large number of people who took early retirement from a variety of occupations, including the Garda Síochána.  They have begun to drive many voluntary initiatives and this will develop.  We commend that practice.  The databases of county volunteering committees, organisations such as Volunteering Ireland and Young Social Innovators will be the enablers in local communities.</p>

          if, in regard to the commitment given in the programme for Government, he will outline the specific proposals he has to develop and strengthen the range of projects being undertaken through the local and regional drugs task forces; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_314" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_970">During the term of this Government, we will continue to develop and strengthen the range of projects being undertaken through the local and regional drugs task forces under the national drugs strategy.  In this regard, we will be informed by the work of the drugs task forces regarding the needs identified in their areas to tackle the problems associated with drug misuse.  I envisage that the projects involved will continue to address issues such as prevention of problem drug use, appropriate treatment and harm reduction measures, rehabilitation and aftercare as well as supporting families and communities affected by illicit drug use.</p>
            <p eId="para_971">Approximately 300 interim funded community based projects in the 14 local drugs task force, LDTF, areas in Dublin, Bray and Cork have recently undergone an evaluation process and the report on this is expected to be finalised shortly.  The recommendations of this report will help to inform decisions regarding the future mainstreaming of projects to various agencies and on how the range of projects might be strengthened in the future.  In the meantime, approximately €20 million is being provided in 2007 for the continued implementation of the strategic plans of LDTFs and to address emerging needs identified in the communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_972">More than €14 million per annum has been earmarked for the full implementation of the strategic plans of the ten regional drugs task forces, RDTFs.  As one would expect, expenditure was low in the early period following the establishment of the RDTFs, but it is now building up as progress on the implementation of the plans accelerates.  This year's combined expenditure will be approximately €7.5 million, an increase of more than €3 million on the 2006 spend.  We expect this figure to rise to the full implementation cost over the next two or three years, thus facilitating the development and strengthening of the range of projects being undertaken around the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_973">Furthermore, capital funding will continue to be made available through the premises initiative fund to meet the accommodation needs of community-based drugs projects in the task force areas.  It is envisaged that such expenditure is likely to increase next year, especially as the RDTFs become more firmly established.</p>
            <p eId="para_974">The Deputy should note that initial steps are being taken in my Department in the process that will lead to the development of a new national drugs strategy for the period 2009 to 2016.  This process will facilitate the consideration of all aspects of the national drugs strategy and it may give rise to further development and strengthening of projects at community level.</p>

            <p eId="para_975">I welcome the detailed reply given by the Minister of State.  With regard to the projects he mentioned, the one thing we must do is consider the alternatives we can provide for young people who are attracted to drugs.  What linkage has the Minister of State created through national sport and recreation organisations to develop alternatives?  In many cases, we see associations going into large estates, cherry-picking the best young players and leaving many children behind.  They are bored and have nothing to do and this is where drug barons can establish themselves.  They can get youngsters with no recreation or sporting facilities available to them and who do not have an inclination to get involved in such activities.  How many meetings has the Minister of State had with various associations on this matter?  I realise the good work done by the task forces.  However, we need to link this with initiatives taken by national sporting organisations.  The two together can make a difference in providing an alternative to the problems which communities throughout the country encounter at present.</p>

          <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_316" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Community,_Rural_and_Gaeltacht_Affairs">
            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_976">A key part of the national drugs strategy is precisely what Deputy Wall mentioned, namely, creating alternatives.  This is being done, primarily through the young people's facilities and services fund which is an engagement with existing organisations.  I do not want to provide another layer of development.  I am anxious that we work with existing organisations, local authorities, national sporting organisations and youth services.  I see productive work where this has happened.</p>
            <p eId="para_977">As I mentioned, last week in Waterford I saw excellent work done through a collaboration between youth services, the local authority and national and local sporting organisations.  In Dublin, boxing is important.  The Neilstown boxing club, for example, has benefited greatly from collaborating with my Department and the local drugs task force on developing alternatives.  I meet the organisations mentioned by the Deputy in the context of their membership of local and regional drugs task forces.</p>
            <p eId="para_978">Approximately 30 sports and recreation officers have been appointed to drugs task force areas under the young people services and facilities fund and others have been appointed in RAPID areas.  Their task is to engage young people in non-mainstream sports.  Particular attention has been given to minority sports and young women, who are not great participants in some sports, have been targeted in certain areas.  I believe in the value of engaging with existing organisations and we will embark on the roll-out of the young people's facilities and services fund for a range of projects in other parts of the country.  On Friday, I will be in Carlow to open a new youth centre which was developed on a collaborative basis by my Department, the young people's facilities and services fund and the local partnership and RAPID programmes.</p>

            <p eId="para_979">Last week's edition of <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> reported that drugs are available through the Internet.  What proposals do the Government and the Garda Síochána have to stop this?  It is bad enough that drug pushers are in every corner of the country but now drugs can be bought over the internet and received through the post.</p>
            <p eId="para_980">Is the Customs and Excise being given the support and finances it needs to stop illegal drug smuggling along our coasts?  There is no doubt that the Irish Coast Guard has never before found as many drugs but that is only a small proportion of the overall quantity.</p>
            <p eId="para_981">When will a programme be established to educate young people in schools about the effects of drugs?  We already have videos and tapes from sporting organisations.  The issue should be part of the curriculum and videos should be shown in schools on the effects of drugs on families and individuals.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Carey</from>
            <p eId="para_982">In regard to Deputy Ring's last question, an effective social, personal and health education, SPHE, programme is operating in every school.  It is taught to junior certificate level and the National Council for Curriculum Assessment is now working on developing a programme for senior cycle.  As I noted earlier, valuable programmes are being rolled out at local level and in-service training for teachers is being provided by the Department of Education and Science and the support team for the SPHE programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_983">In respect of resources for the Customs and Excise, I am unsure whether the Deputy is referring to matters such as scanners but I am informed by the Revenue Commissioners and the Customs and Excise that the resources they seek are made available to them.  They are working closely with coastal communities and ports authorities to ensure drugs are intercepted.</p>
            <p eId="para_984">The report in the <i>The Sunday Tribune</i> is worrying.  Classified drugs were ordered over the internet, paid for in cash and sent through the regular postal service.  I have already had discussions with officials in my Department and the national drugs strategy team and we will meet next week to address this and other issues.  I will not pretend for one minute that it will be easily addressed but it is a worrying development.  I would discourage the practice because it is highly dangerous and entirely illegal but stopping it is easier said than done.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
          <p eId="para_989">Today, I present my fourth budget and this Government's first one against a challenging economic backdrop.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">INTRODUCTION</p>
          <p eId="para_991">Our economy has experienced extraordinary growth for more than a decade.  At home and abroad our success has been lauded.  That success is down to the commitment and drive of our people.  Recent Governments have succeeded in managing the growth of the economy so that it has been sustained for much longer than anticipated.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">The global economy is beset by uncertainties, financial markets are highly volatile and the construction sector domestically is experiencing a slowdown.  However, we must not lose sight of the fact that the fundamentals of the economy are still good — a point often lost by some.  Next year will see our economy growing at a relatively modest pace.  In this changed environment of more moderate growth, this Government will manage the resources available so that growth will be sustained into the future.  Today's budget is important in that context.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">As Minister for Finance, I must place one economic objective ahead of any other — that we do things now that will position our country for sustainable development over the years ahead.  This objective does not conflict with our commitment to make Ireland more environmentally friendly.</p>
          <p eId="para_994">CONTEXT AND AIMS</p>
          <p eId="para_995">Since becoming Minister for Finance, I have reformed the way the budgetary process is operated to enable better transparency and to improve accountability and scrutiny by the Oireachtas and its relevant committees.  For example, annual output statements were provided by Ministers earlier this year to accompany their Estimates of expenditure and I published the pre-budget outlook in October.  That outlook showed that delivering all that we did this year would mean increasing current expenditure by €2.3 billion in 2008 to almost €51 billion.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">Today, I am announcing all new spending and taxation measures in a single unified budget.  This reform allows us to focus on the totality of what Government is spending with taxpayers' money.  By making spending and revenue decisions in a more transparent manner within the overall economic and budgetary parameters, we will ensure that Ireland maintains a sound and sensible fiscal policy, fully in line with the provisions of the EU's Stability and Growth Pact.</p>
          <p eId="para_997">What this means is that the rate of increase on public current expenditure in 2008 has to moderate to take account of the resources available but, even so, I am still providing almost €53 billion, which is a net increase of more than €1.7 billion.  This includes almost €960 million for welfare supports in 2008, which is just over half of the total additional spending announced today.  I am also providing more than €8.6 billion in 2008 for investment on the capital side.  When I compare that with the resources available to me, I am planning for a general Government deficit of 0.9% in 2008, which is the appropriate response at this time.  This is the context in which my budget is set.  This budget is focused on the future challenges and addresses them now in a way which is sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">Investment in a sustainable future is this Government's top priority.  I have consistently stressed the importance of the national development plan in the realisation of this goal.  In the past, Governments have reacted to economic slowdown by stalling capital investment.  I will not do so.  On the contrary, I am providing more than €8.6 billion for capital investment in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_999">In the proposals I announce today, I will also: protect the incomes of the vulnerable; promote our environmental goals; support ordinary working people; help home-buyers; and boost our economy, while adapting to the reality of more moderate growth into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1000">I will do all this while, at the same time, ensuring that the budgetary outlook remains positive and builds on the improvements in our fiscal position to date.</p>
          <p eId="para_1001">ECONOMIC AND FISCAL BACKGROUND AND TARGETS</p>
          <p eId="para_1002">2007 Economy</p>
          <p eId="para_1003">The pattern of very strong growth, mainly as a result of buoyant domestic demand, has eased as this year has progressed but growth still continues at a rate that is the envy of many other countries.  For 2007 as a whole my Department expects GDP growth of around 4.75% is now likely.  This is a very good performance in the circumstances.  We estimate that an additional 72,000 jobs will have been created this year and that unemployment will be among the lowest in the European Union.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">This budget is being framed against the background of significant uncertainty in the international economic environment.  Since the summer, global financial markets have experienced considerable volatility and while the impact of such developments on the world economy appears to have been contained so far, we must acknowledge that downside risks remain.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Another issue is the significant appreciation of the euro against the dollar.  This partly reflects financial market developments as well as growing concerns regarding the outlook for the US economy.  This is of particular concern to us given the importance of the US both as an export destination and a source of inward foreign direct investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">Ireland, of course, has deep international links and we are not immune from such developments.  As I have said before, retaining flexibility and continuing to improve our productivity is the route to enhancing the competitiveness of our economy.  The measures I will outline in this budget will help to achieve these goals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1007">In light of all of these adverse international developments, many of my colleagues elsewhere in Europe are revising down their growth forecasts.  In these circumstances, our short-term economic prospects are still impressive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1008">2008 Economy</p>
          <p eId="para_1009">Nevertheless, for 2008 it is fair to say that the prospects are for somewhat more modest growth than we have become accustomed to.  This reflects developments in the international economy as well as domestic developments.  In relation to the latter, the main factor weighing on overall growth is the prospect of somewhat lower output in the new house building sector.  Against this background, my Department is forecasting that GDP will increase by 3% in real terms, 24,000 new jobs will be created with the total number at work increasing by a little over 1% and unemployment at 5.5% by the end of next year, inflation will ease and the harmonised index of consumer prices will average 2.4%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1010">This economic outlook, while still reasonably impressive, means that it is more vital than ever that we retain our flexibility, act responsibly and continue to raise our productivity.  If we do this, it will protect and enhance our competitiveness and employment levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1011">Responsible Management</p>
          <p eId="para_1012">Responsible management of the public finances has been one of the prime drivers of our economic success.  Our national debt is now around 25% of GDP, one of the smallest in the developed world.  It is right and appropriate that we should run budget surpluses when the economy is performing very well.  It is equally right and appropriate that we borrow when the growth outlook is less favourable.  However, the move into deficit must involve productive borrowing, which will strengthen our economy for the long term.</p>
          <p eId="para_1013">Accordingly, I have set the following fiscal targets for next year: growth in total spending of 8.6% to maintain and improve the provision of services and to invest in the future; gross current spending growth of 8.2%; capital spending growth of the order of 12%; a general Government deficit of 0.9% of GDP, which is fully consistent with our EU obligations; and a debt to GDP ratio of just under 26%.  These targets are realistic and achievable and a reflection of the underlying health and strength of our economy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1016">We must maintain the basic correspondence between spending and resources if we are to avoid piling up debt for the future and if we are to continue to afford the massive capital investment that is vital for all our futures.  Obviously, the pattern of income and spending can vary from year to year but the overall trend line must be correlated with the resources available.  We must get back to lower single digit increases in current spending as quickly and as prudently as possible, particularly in view of my determination to maintain capital investment as set out in the national development plan.  A measured deceleration is required, not a sudden slamming of brakes, especially when we are entering a period of below trend growth by Irish standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">My priorities are clear and straightforward, namely, to protect the weaker in society through maintaining a high level of social spending, deliver better and more effective public services, seek value for money at all levels of public spending and continue to invest heavily in public infrastructure.  Our priorities for current spending remain health, education and social welfare, which account for almost 80% of total current spending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">At the core of all this spending must be the search for quality of service and value for money.  As the pre-budget Estimates showed, we need nearly 5% more in 2008 compared to 2007 to stay as we are with existing levels of service.  This requires all Departments to continue to monitor closely and examine carefully how efficiently and effectively resources are being utilised in the provision of all public services and this is what I intend to do using appropriate value for money initiatives.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">The Government has agreed to an efficiency review of all administrative spending across the whole public service.  I have set out in the summary of budget measures my intentions as to how the review should proceed.  I refer colleagues to B.24 in the budget summary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">INVESTMENT FOR THE FUTURE</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">National Development Plan</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The national development plan is an ambitious programme of investment in the future.  Nothing on this scale has ever been attempted before in our history.  It will transform our country socially and economically and I am determined to roll it out as planned and thereby secure our future.  The national development plan is my top priority.  Postponing or delaying it would be a major policy error.  It would damage activity next year and impair our quality of life in future.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">The new multi-annual capital envelope for each Vote group, which is published today in the budget documentation, provides for total capital expenditure to be maintained at an average of 6% of GNP during the next five years.  All Departments have had their capital allocations increased from the pre-budget Estimates levels by more than €1 billion in total.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">The main elements of our capital investment programme for 2008 will concentrate on transport, education, housing and environmental services, with significant spending in other areas such as health, agriculture and enterprise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">Transport</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">I am allocating €2.7 billion for investment in rail and bus services, national and secondary roads, regional airports and ports.  Of this, nearly €1.7 billion will be invested in our national roads network, thus continuing this Government's unprecedented levels of investment in this key piece of infrastructure.  We are building high class roads, which are absolutely integral to economic activity and long-term economic and social prosperity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1027">During the coming year, this massive investment will deliver significantly on the M50 upgrade as targeted, resulting in four lanes between the N4 and Ballymount and a transformed and fully functional Red Cow junction.  The West Link bridge will also have four lanes by the end of next year and we will have barrier free tolling.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">Elsewhere around the country, almost 30 km of dual carriageway will open between Kilbeggan and Athlone, 37 km of dual carriageway will open between Cashel and Mitchelstown and almost 20 km of dual carriageway will open to bypass Carlow town.  All these are key components of the major inter-urban routes between Dublin and our main regional cities and the National Roads Authority is working to ensure that they are delivered on time and within budget.</p>

        <speech by="#BrianCowen" eId="spk_323" as="#Tánaiste_and_Minister_for_Finance">
          <from>Deputy Brian Cowen</from>
          <p eId="para_1030">Through a combination of Exchequer and local government funding, more than €600 million will be provided for regional and local roads.  This will continue the commitment which the Government has shown over the past decade to the renewal of this vital network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">I am also investing almost €1 billion in our public transport system next year.  This significant level of investment means that right across the country we will continue to make real improvements.  Key projects such as the Cork to Midleton commuter rail line and phase one of the western rail corridor, which will link Ennis to Athenry, are through planning and the year ahead will see them readied for service in 2009.  Construction is also due to begin on phase 1 of the Navan rail line, linking Dublin to Dunboyne.  Irish Rail will also continue to introduce its fleet of 183 rail cars into service across the intercity network.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">In Dublin, too, we will build on the great success of the Luas by adding much needed additional capacity on existing lines.  By the summer, the capacity on the Tallaght line will have increased by 40% and construction work will continue on the line extensions to the Docklands and Cherrywood in south Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">Water Services Infrastructure</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">Huge effort and resources have been devoted in recent years to the upgrading of our water services infrastructure.  The €4.7 billion for water services in the national development plan, of which more than €471 million is allocated for 2008, is an unprecedented commitment to the provision of the infrastructure needed to support development and economic growth while, at the same time, ensuring environmental sustainability.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">We have made huge strides over the past few years in expanding the scale and coverage of water and sanitary services infrastructure across the country.  Virtually all major cities and towns now have modern wastewater infrastructure in place and we are pushing ahead with the remaining schemes at top speed.  In national terms, some of the more significant achievements include increased compliance with the requirements of the EU urban wastewater treatment directive from 25% in 2000 to some 92% at present; and the completion of more than 350 schemes, including exceptionally large wastewater projects in Dublin, Cork, Limerick, Wexford, Galway, Drogheda and Dundalk.  Other large water projects in the 2008 programme of works include those at Ballymore Eustace, Limerick city, Donegal Bay, lower Liffey Valley, Portlaoise, Waterford and Dungarvan, Castlebar and Roscommon.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">Education Infrastructure</p>
          <p eId="para_1037">Total expenditure on education in 2008 will be €9.3 billion including €828 million for capital investment.  Over the last three years alone, more than €2 billion has been invested in educational infrastructure.  With this funding we have delivered 28 new schools, with construction underway at a further 16 new schools.  We have delivered 77 largescale refurbishments or extensions of existing schools, with construction in progress at a further 44 schools.  This is in addition to over 1,300 small scale projects delivered in 2006 and over 1,500 in 2007.  Construction work this year alone will deliver over 700 classrooms to provide permanent accommodation for over 17,500 pupils.  Given that there are 4,000 schools and that 9,000 building projects have been funded in these schools since the beginning of this decade, the Government is proud that the existing building stock has been substantially renewed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">However, the next challenge, and I believe the first priority for educational expenditure in 2008, must be to provide additional new accommodation to cater for the 13,000 additional children who will be seeking school places next year.  This rate of increase in enrolments poses a major challenge for the education system.  Accordingly, I am allocating an additional €95 million in capital funding for the primary school building programme in 2008.  This will bring to €594 million the total budget that will be available for infrastructural investment in schools in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">Other capital funding for education includes €184 million for infrastructural investment at third level and €50 million for various smaller programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1040">Housing</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">The Government is firmly committed to addressing housing needs and through targeted measures, providing an appropriate accommodation solution for lower income groups and people with special housing needs.  I am making available a total housing package of some €1.7 billion in Exchequer resources, which together with non-Exchequer financing will bring the total overall housing package to some €2.5 billion.  This will support the delivery of the ambitious Towards 2016 commitments entered into with the social partners, with some 9,000 new social housing units to be commenced or acquired in 2008 and the provision of 5,500 new affordable homes.  Further households will be assisted through the continued roll-out of the rental accommodation scheme and support for homeless services.  All in all, our aim is to address the housing needs of some 20,000 households in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">The funding being provided for housing will support the important quality improvements in social housing, particularly through regeneration programmes successfully under way for example in Ballymun and Fatima Mansions and now being developed in other urban centres.  I am particularly impressed by the work of John Fitzgerald and the Limerick regeneration agencies and I am pleased that today's package will support their initial work in developing a new vision for the socially disadvantaged areas of Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">Carbon Report</p>
          <p eId="para_1045">There is growing and incontrovertible evidence of the challenge to us all posed by global warming.  The Stern Review together with the recent reports from the UN's Inter-Governmental Panel on Climate Change illustrate the seriousness of the issue if things do not change.  That is why we must act now.  That action will require changes in the lifestyles we all lead and the choices we make on whether to consume or conserve resources.  This should not be seen as a defensive strategy but as a forward looking, proactive response to this challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_1046">The programme for Government undertook that I would give a carbon report in this budget.  This is the first such report.  Our current greenhouse gas emissions amount to some 70 million tonnes based on latest data.  We will have to reduce that over the period 2008 to 2012 to an annual average of 63 million tonnes to meet our Kyoto commitments.  An even greater effort will be needed to achieve up to a 30% cut envisaged by the EU for 2020.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">All sections of the economy contribute to carbon emissions.  Transport, for example, represents about 20% of emissions.  This has been growing quickly due to increasing car use.  Energy accounts for 22%, industry around 17% and agriculture 28%.  Every element in our nation has a part to play.  Some have already made significant strides and some are in a position to take more effective action than others.  All must contribute as best they can to the necessary reductions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">The programme for Government also states that the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will follow the carbon report in the budget with a report providing more detail on the progress being made towards meeting our targets for emission reductions.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, will give further information about this report tomorrow.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The programme for Government commits the Government to seek an all-party approach on climate change targets but in advance of such agreement to target a reduction of 3% per year on average in our greenhouse gas emissions.  The target requires everybody to play a part.</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">The Government too has a role to play.  We have put climate change at the heart of decision making by setting up the Cabinet committee on climate change and energy security.  In previous years I announced tax and spending changes in this area.  For example, in 2006 I introduced the favourable tax treatment of bio-fuels.  Last year I provided for new grants for growing and harvesting bio-fuel crops and increased funding for an expanded range of energy conservation grants.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">This year I am announcing a number of additional spending and tax measures to continue to support the Government's efforts to meet our greenhouse gas emissions targets.</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">Environmental Taxation — VRT</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">As I announced in last year's Budget Statement, a public consultation process was carried out by my Department in relation to rebalancing vehicle registration tax to take greater account of CO2 emission levels.  There has been broad support for a fundamental reorientation and rebalancing of that tax.  I am bringing forward today a series of changes that constitute the most fundamental reform of VRT since its inception in 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_1054">The revised VRT system will be enacted in the Finance Bill and will be introduced with effect from 1 July 2008.  The main features of the new scheme are: the VRT rate applicable to cars registered on or after 1 July 2008 will be determined by the CO2 emission rating of the car and will no longer be related to engine size; a seven band CO2 emissions system — A to G — will apply.  It will be underpinned by a new CO2 emissions labelling system for cars, on the lines of the energy efficiency labels for white goods, to be introduced by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and seven VRT rates, ranging from 14% to 36%, depending on the car's CO2 emission level, will continue to be applied to the open market selling price of the car.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">Let me be clear that this measure is not about penalising people for their reasonable lifestyle choices.  It is about providing them with opportunities and incentives.  By explicitly linking VRT rates to carbon emissions on the basis of a new and highly transparent labelling system, we are providing individuals and families with the opportunity to make choices to help the environment and with financial incentives to do so.  Of course, the higher emitting cars will pay more, but by making sensible and informed decisions, many families could see their VRT bills reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">Since this measure is not aimed at raising money but rather to assist the environment, the intention is that it will be broadly revenue neutral.  I will continue to give recognition to the efforts of vehicle manufacturers to promote new technologies.  Existing incentives for certain hybrid electric and flexible fuel cars are being extended to 1 July 2008.  Thereafter and in addition to the benefit of the new CO2-based VRT system, I will be providing for a further top-up relief up to €2,500 on the VRT payable on such cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">In an effort to foster the use of electric cars and electric mopeds I am also introducing an exemption from VRT.  This exemption will apply from 1 January 2008.  Further information on the new VRT system and related changes to the car capital allowances scheme are set out in the summary of budget measures and in annex D.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">Motor Tax</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">Motor tax is an essential contributor to local government funding.  Motor tax has not been changed since 2004.  Since then the CPI has risen by around 15%. It is proposed to increase the existing motor tax rates by 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litres and 11% for larger cars from 1 February 2008.  Details are contained in the summary of budget measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">To complement the changes in the VRT system, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government also intends to bring forward proposals that will link motor tax to CO2 emissions for new cars from 1 July 2008.  These measures will allow consumers to act in an environmentally responsible way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">Other Environmental Tax Measures</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">The programme for Government has as an objective the introduction of a carbon tax in the lifetime of this Government, on a revenue neutral basis.  This will be part of the terms of reference of the forthcoming commission on taxation.  I intend to establish the commission very shortly and it will begin its work early in the new year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">I also intend to reduce VAT on certain seeds and bulbs for bio-fuels, and to amend the business expansion scheme so that recycling companies can have easier access to that scheme.  Details of these measures are set out in the summary of budget measures.  In the context of the forthcoming Finance Bill, I will examine, with my colleague, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, the feasibility of providing businesses with targeted incentives to support the installation of certain energy efficient equipment also.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">Increased Spending on Energy Conservation and Research</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">Our energy use has grown by 70% in the past 15 years and we are especially reliant on imported gas and oil to meet our energy needs.  Energy security and climate change are challenges that face all countries and that shape our energy policies.  It is important that we balance our objectives of keeping energy costs down, ensuring security of supply and keeping our greenhouse gas emissions to a minimum.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The White Paper, Delivering a Sustainable Energy Future for Ireland 2007 to 2020, which was published earlier this year, sets out the Government's strategy for achieving these aims.  The Government, through the resources provided in the national development plan and the resources of the State's commercial energy companies, as well as through policy measures, is committed to meeting the strategy set out in the White Paper.</p>
          <p eId="para_1067">The key goals of the White Paper include energy security, energy diversity and energy reliability.  To help achieve these goals, there will be expenditure of €8.5 billion in the energy programme of the national development plan.  The State energy companies will invest over €7 billion of that amount, mainly in the electricity and gas transmission and distribution networks, in new and modernised power generation and in wind energy projects.  Next year, these companies will invest approximately €1.7 billion in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_1068">The Government has created gas and electricity markets that are fully open to competition.  From 1 November this year, there has been an all-island electricity market, facilitated by the North-South electricity interconnector and other existing and planned interconnectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_1069">Exchequer investment in energy has increased significantly in recent years — next year, at €86 million, it will be over twice the level it was in 2005.  This reflects the increased importance the Government attaches to the energy sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1070">The NDP provides almost €150 million for energy research.  In this budget, I am allocating €13.2 million for that purpose, an increase of €7 million on last year.  The additional allocation for 2008 will go in particular towards measures to develop renewable energy from ocean sources.  It is an area where we as a country could make a very significant contribution if the research is successful.  If the research looks promising, as I believe it will, I will consider making considerably more resources available in future years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1071">The best way to reduce our dependence on imported oil and gas is, of course, through energy conservation.  In this budget, I am allocating an additional €13 million to energy conservation.  Of this, €5 million will fund a pilot programme of home insulation.  In addition, there will be funding for a variety of measures which include the building energy rating scheme and a variety of technologies whose application will ensure that we use energy more efficiently.</p>

          <p eId="para_1089">I am making a number of changes in the farm taxation area arising from reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the recent growth in the adoption of innovative farm business structures.  The payments to farmers under the EU sugar beet compensation package include an element for diversification aid.  I am providing that the income from these diversification aid payments will be spread over six years for the purpose of calculating income tax liability.  This measure follows on the Finance Act 2007 provision which has already provided for similar treatment of the restructuring element of the package.  It will cost approximately €9 million next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1090">The Finance Bill will include a provision to avert a claw-back of income tax when a farmer who has opted to avail of the special income tax averaging arrangements subsequently enters a milk production partnership.  I am aware that, on occasion, the break-up of a farm partnership may be necessary because of changed personal circumstances.  To facilitate developments of this nature, I intend to introduce a new relief from capital gains tax on the dissolution of farm partnerships.  The relief will run for a period of five years and full details will be contained in the Finance Bill.  This measure is estimated to cost approximately €5 million next year and in a full year.  The farmers' flat rate addition for VAT is being retained at 5.2% for 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1091">The House will recall that in last year's Finance Act, I extended stamp duty relief for farm consolidation.  I am pleased to state I have recently signed the order to commence this relief following the receipt of the necessary EU state aid approval.</p>

          <p eId="para_1095">The fishing industry in Ireland is facing major challenges at present.  Earlier this year, the Cawley report provided a blueprint for the future of the fishing industry.  It confirmed the need for restructuring of the industry, including a significant reduction in the number of boats in the white fishing fleet.  My colleague,the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Mary Coughlan, successfully secured EU state aid approval for a decommissioning scheme for fishing vessels.  Given the importance of the fishing industry and the role it plays in our coastal communities, I am allocating €21 million for this scheme to begin next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1102">This budget provides significant resources to allow us to address the needs of those most disadvantaged.  This approach has enabled us, as a society, to deliver significant improvements for people on low incomes in recent years and this continues to be the best way to deliver future social welfare enhancements in a sustainable way.</p>
          <p eId="para_1103">The Government is committed to working closely with the social partners to achieve even more.  We have already met the important thresholds that we set ourselves some time ago.  We are determined to consolidate these substantial achievements and continue to make progress.  In line with this overall approach, the improvements in social welfare benefits and child care payments that I am providing for today will amount to an additional €957 million in 2008 and €980 million in a full year.  This is over half of the increase in total current spending compared to the pre-budget outlook.</p>

Today, the Government will further build on these achievements by increasing the full personal rate of the State contributory pension by €14 per week and the State non-contributory pension by €12 per week.</p>

It intends to continue to do so by increasing child benefit by €6 per week for the first and second child, bringing it to €166 per month, and by €8 for the third child and subsequent children, bringing that payment to €203 per month.  It will also increase the early child care supplement, payable in respect of all children under six, by €100, bringing that payment to €1,100 per year.  These increases mean that families with two children under six will receive a tax free payment of €6,148 in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1121">Other Social Welfare Measures</p>
          <p eId="para_1122">The budget summary contains a range of other social welfare improvements, the full details of which will be announced by the Minister for Social and Family Affairs.

          <p eId="para_1123">Health</p>
          <p eId="para_1124">In recent years health has been by far the largest beneficiary of new resources available for public services.  The Government is committed to keeping health as a key priority area.  It is equally committed to working to protect Ireland's economic and fiscal situation as the key prerequisite to providing the funding required to develop and improve health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_1125">Much of the public debate about health services is focused on the increased cost involved.  While there are valid concerns about the growth of health spending, both nationally and internationally, the proper context for this debate is one which views health spending as delivering benefits as well as accruing costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1126">We are determined to see that the extra budget resources now being made available by the Government to the Health Service Executive secure the optimum improvement in the quality and delivery of health services.  To achieve this objective, the Government will work in partnership to overcome any obstacles to change in the health system and to continue to improve policies and practices in all areas of service delivery.  My colleague, the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and the Health Service Executive will advance this work through the health forum established under the social partnership agreement Towards 2016.</p>

This additional funding will allow for the development and strengthening of local drugs task forces and the roll-out of services to new commuter-belt towns.  That is a priority in light of recent events.</p>
          <p eId="para_1140">Increased Duty on Tobacco</p>
          <p eId="para_1141">From midnight tonight, I am raising the excise duty on cigarettes by 30 cent per packet of 20, inclusive of VAT, with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  This increase serves to underline the desire of us all to curtail the consumption of tobacco in the interests of improved public health.  I believe this measure should be welcomed generally. </p>
          <p eId="para_1142">It has also been suggested to me that there might be public health benefits arising from a switch to lower alcohol beverages.  This will require some study and, indeed, some adjustments by industry.  I am giving notice now that I intend to bring forward measures in this area in my next budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1143">Development Aid</p>
          <p eId="para_1144">In addition to our commitments to the vulnerable here in Ireland, the Government recognises our responsibilities as a rich country to the poorest of the poor in developing countries.  I am providing for an additional €84 million in the Vote for international co-operation in 2008.  This will bring our total ODA allocation for next year to €914 million, up to 0.54% of GNP.  This amount is three times that spent in 2000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1145">SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY AND</p>
          <p eId="para_1146">INNOVATION</p>
          <p eId="para_1147">Significant and sustained investment in science, technology and innovation is an essential part of the drive to make Ireland a more knowledge-driven economy.  Ireland must be at the forefront in generating and using new technology.  This requires us to strengthen the national innovation system, in particular by focused interventions to support the development of our research and development base.  This base has grown significantly over the past few years, with total gross expenditure on research and development growing from just over €800 million in 2000 to an estimated €2.3 billion in 2006.  While the Government has contributed significantly to this increase, I am pleased to note that private sector investment has also grown from under €500 million in 2000 to over €1.6 billion in 2006.  This investment, both by Government and private companies, will help secure the economic future of the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_1148">In 2008, I am increasing the capital provision by €36.5 million to a total of almost €300 million for continued investment in basic research in centres for science, technology and engineering and in strategic research clusters.  Research and development activity, innovation management and collaborative effort between industry and the third level sector will attract significant support next year.  This will be matched on the current side by an additional €12 million for higher education research, bringing the total STI expenditure on the current side to €133 million nextyear.</p>
          <p eId="para_1149">Research and Development Tax Credit</p>
          <p eId="para_1150">Ireland is now viewed by multinational companies as a location for research and development activity and the changes I will announce today to the research and development tax credit scheme will help to further embed these companies in Ireland around such high value-added activities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1151">I propose to enhance the research and development tax credit scheme.  The base year for expenditure used to calculate expenditure on research and development is being fixed at 2003 for a further four years to 2013.  The change will provide an additional incentive for increased expenditure on research and development in future years and will offer more certainty to industry concerning the tax credit scheme.  This improvement will cost €60 million in a full year and is an essential complementary measure to Government spending on STI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1152">REWARDING WORK</p>
          <p eId="para_1153">Income Tax</p>
          <p eId="para_1154">I now wish to turn to the income tax code.  In the last decade, the income tax system has been made fairer, friendlier, more progressive and more rewarding for working people.  The express purpose of the programme for Government is to build on and further progress that tax agenda over the next five years.  Today, I will take a positive step down that road by presenting to the House the first of five instalments in our income tax agenda.  The various measures proposed constitute a well targeted income tax package that protects and enhances the income position of those in employment and supports those who find themselves in difficult circumstances or on fixed incomes.  It will meet the Government's priority to use tax credits and bands to keep low income earners out of the standard rate band and average earners out of the higher band.  The protection of more vulnerable groups must remain my priority in addressing income tax decisions and that is what I am doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1155">I am increasing the personal tax credit by €70 for a single person and €140 for a married couple, while the employee tax credit will also be increased by €70 per annum.  This will keep 32,600 income earners out of the tax net.  For a single person on PAYE it will move the entry point to the income tax system from €17,600 to €18,300 per annum.  The employee PRSI and health levy entry points are also being increased in line with these changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1156">The 20% standard income tax band is being widened by €1,400 per annum to €35,400 for a single person and €44,400 for a married one-earner, while the band for married two-earner couples will be €70,800.  With the projected average industrial wage for 2008 being about €34,000, it means that we will protect people on average earnings from liability to tax at the higher rate.</p>
          <p eId="para_1157">Other Tax Credits</p>
          <p eId="para_1158">With the needs of certain more vulnerable groups in society in mind, I propose to provide further increases in the value of a number of other personal tax credits.  The tax credit for an incapacitated child will be raised by 22%, or €660 per year, to €3,660.  The level of the married personal credit and the home carer tax credit is being increased by almost 17% to €900 per year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1159">The age credit will be increased by €50 to €325 for a single person and by €100 to €650 for a married couple, with the age exemption limits also being increased by €1,000 and €2,000 to €20,000 and €40,000 respectively.  I am also providing for significant real increases in the credits for widowed persons and widowed parents.  These are targeted and concrete measures that underline the Government's resolve to look after the needs and welfare of those most deserving of our support.  I also intend to increase the allowance for trade union subscriptions from €300 to €350 per annum.</p>

          <p eId="para_1172">Small and Medium Employers</p>
          <p eId="para_1173">In term of supporting small and medium enterprises I will introduce the following measures: the small company tax liability threshold for the payment of preliminary tax on the simpler prior-year basis is to be increased from €150,000 to €200,000; the tax liability threshold for new start-up companies at or below which they do not have to pay preliminary tax in their first accounting period will be increased from €150,000 to €200,000; the small business VAT registration thresholds will be further increased from €35,000 per annum for services and €70,000 per annum for goods to €37,500 and €75,000, respectively, from 1 May 2008 — this measure will take about 2,700 businesses out of the VAT system.  These measures will support business and enterprise and will cost €16.5 million in 2008 and €27 million in a full year.</p>

In this regard, I propose to reduce the stamp duty charge on financial cards as follows: a 25% cut in the duty on credit cards, reducing the charge from €40 to €30; a 50% cut in the duty on combined cards, reducing the charge from €20 to €10; and a 50% cut in the duty on ATM and debit cards, reducing the charge from €10 to €5.

          <p eId="para_1193">Over recent months, the dynamics of the housing market have changed fundamentally.

          <p eId="para_1200">The housing market is an important aspect of our overall economy and the sustainability of economic activity can be assisted or impeded by the efficiency of that market.  What I am not prepared to do is to introduce a set of small changes that would make the system more complex, but would do little to improve the functioning of the market.  I decided that if this Government were to act, it would introduce something that would represent a step change in the operation of the tax system on residential property transactions.  For that reason, I am today announcing fundamental changes to the current system of stamp duty for residential housing.</p>

          <p eId="para_1202">Purchases of residences with a value of less than €1 million will be charged to stamp duty on the basis that no tax will be payable on the first €125,000 of the consideration, and the balance will be charged at 7%.  Only those houses valued in excess of €1 million will pay at a higher rate of 9% on the portion of the price which is in excess of that figure.

          <p eId="para_1209">For example, a couple buying a new home for the national average house price of almost €370,000 will pay just over €5,000 less than at present.  The effective tax rate falls at all levels — the duty paid on a €350,000 home will fall from 6% under the current stamp duty regime to about 4.5% under the new system and the duty on a €500,000 house will be reduced from 7.5% to approximately 5.25%.  No transaction under €1 million will be charged much more than approximately 6% duty.  This measure will take immediate effect and it will cover instruments that are due to be presented to the Revenue Commissioners no later than 5 December.</p>
          <p eId="para_1210">The exemptions that apply in the current system — for example, for first-time buyers and buyers of new homes — will be retained.  In addition, the current five-year rule, which requires a full claw-back of the stamp duty exemption where the owner-occupier moves out and lets the property, will be reduced to two years.  This will allow for the retention of an important control in the system, will better reflect the increased career and residential mobility of our population and will give potential young house buyers greater flexibility and certainty in their choices.</p>
          <p eId="para_1211">These progressive reforms will lead to a simplification of the system that will increase the efficiency of the housing market, boost confidence and support employment and overall economic activity.  They are the right reforms, introduced for the right reasons at the right time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1226">The level of applause would indicate many backbenchers wish there was a regime change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1227">The truth is this budget represented a very stern test of the leadership of the Minister.  It was a test to see if he had the courage to break down the patterns of incompetence and indifference which has surrounded this complacent Government and the vision to embrace real reform and see real change in the way we spend money.  This is what the country has been crying out for.  The bleak answer today is that he is not willing to face those challenges.  He has bottled the challenge; he is all bark and no bite.  He cannot see that the reason our public finances are in the diabolical state they are in is the sloppy, self-indulgent and wasteful way this Government has spent money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1228">The Minister is a back seat passenger in the Department of Finance just as he was a back seat passenger in other Departments before this.  He is avoiding the imprint of failure by simply not facing up to the challenges which ought to be addressed.  As a result of his behaviour, we have seen that the gains of the Celtic tiger have been frittered away.  The tax bonanza has been spent but we do not have a world-class infrastructure, a world-class health service or efficiency in the public sector.  The money has been spent but we have not delivered the change for which the country was crying out.  We trail every league in service delivery.  Whether in infrastructure, health or waiting times, we are at the bottom of the league.</p>
          <p eId="para_1229">The Minister's reign in the Department of Finance has been characterised by leaving problems to fester until it is too late, when the damage is done and the benefit of action has been impaired.  We see that again today.  He waited for the housing market to collapse before he addressed the needed reform in stamp duty.  As a result of his obstinate refusal to reform that tax, we have seen housing sales diminish month by month to half what they were at the beginning of January this year.  He is a great man to have six months after a crash in the housing market.</p>
          <p eId="para_1230">The same is true of the environment.  This Government promised it would reform VRT in 2002 and here we are six years later.  It is six years during which 600,000 extra cars went on the road — 600,000 extra cars with more carbon emissions now than six years ago.  That is the reality.  It is too late to address these issues.  The time to address them was much earlier so we would not face huge fines for which we will have to borrow to pay in the year ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1231">The Minister can talk the talk but he does not walk the walk.  Prudence and reform are new sound bites he has picked up in the Department of Finance and he delivers them in sombre tones as befits his hoped for new status in Government.  The truth is that it is all about sound bites.  There is no action to back it up.  It is simply not enough to change the rhetoric while perpetuating the bad practices of the past.  The public will look back on this budget as one where the opportunity to take real decisions, which would change the way money is spent, was fluffed and the soft option was taken instead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1232">It is a hit and hope budget — persisting on the same path but hoping for a better outcome this time.  However, we know what will happen when that hope is not realised.  Ordinary families and small businesses will have to pick up the cost.  It will not be the 16 Ministers who have trousered their huge increase in public pay, who are happily insulated in their State cars from any changes to motor tax and who are free from any risk to their pensions while many in the private sector are seeing the collapse in the value of their pensions as we speak.</p>
          <p eId="para_1233">Under the Minister's stewardship, the high promises trumpeted earlier this year are all gone.  Nothing has been done in this budget in respect of tax reform.  The prudent surpluses are gone.  In terms of Ireland being a debt free country, we are heading in the wrong direction.  The 8,000 extra frontline staff are not being delivered.  Instead we are seeing obstinate refusal in the face of all evidence to adopt some serious-minded reforms, to stop the big pay increases to senior people in the public service until results are delivered, to demand efficiency and performance from the big spenders, to stop the creeping growth in bureaucracy and to face the flaws in decentralisation which is manifestly failing in so many areas.  None of this serious reform has been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1234">They say that if one gets the reputation for being an early riser, one can lie in bed all day.  That could be said of this Government.  In the early years, it was alert and ready to face changes.  It felt the throb of the economy and it moved to deal with issues and real challenges but that day is long gone.</p>

          <p eId="para_1236">They have got used to lying in in the morning, bingeing on junk food and not exercising.  The result is what we see today.  At the slightest hint of deterioration in the economy, we see the public finances plunge from a €4 billion surplus to a €2 billion deficit.  That is some achievement for a Minister — to have squandered all that money and to have so little to show for it.  It is shoddy spending habits.</p>
          <p eId="para_1237">Under the guise of this debt fuelled tax bonanza, the Government has thrived.  We have seen Government spending grow by an alarming six percentage points of GNP.  That is three percentage points extra on income tax and three percentage points extra on VAT.  That is the reality of the extra costs this Government has loaded on in the space of seven years.  Now the property boom bonanza is gone, those realities will come home to roost.  Those tax bills will have to be met and that is why we have not seen proper indexation of the tax code today and no proper provision for tax reform which was trumpeted from the hill tops a few months ago.  That money has been spent and there is little to show for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1238">The changed economy has brought new rhetoric.  We hear this bleating about productivity, reform and equity.  However, it is like listening to a chain smoker talking about the threats and dangers of smoking.  He has known it for years but he has done nothing about it in the past and is doing nothing about it today.  There is no reform in this budget and there is no willingness to face up to the changes we need to make to get efficiency and delivery at the frontline from the huge budgets that have been built up.  It is a hit and hope budget and it is simply not sustainable.</p>
          <p eId="para_1239">Today's budget presents us with €3.9 billion extra in spending and €1.6 billion extra in tax.  In any man's language that is spending more than double the revenue coming in.  That is not sustainable.  One cannot go on plugging the hole by borrowing, as the Government plans to do this year.  This time last year we were told we would have a surplus of €1.8 billion in 2008 and yet the Minister told us today we would have a deficit of that amount.</p>

          <p eId="para_1242">Looking ahead, the prospects of those who cheered the Minister a moment ago, seeing their great programme for Government being delivered are nil.  If one looks at the figures the Minister projects for taxation for 2010, one will see it is €6.3 billion off what was forecast when the manifesto was published. That blows the entire manifesto out of the water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1243">We now have no strategy from Government.  Its programme for Government does not stand up to any scrutiny.  The promises, such as the 2,000 extra gardaí, the 4,000 extra teachers or the 2,000 extra consultants, have gone in a puff of smoke because the money is spent.</p>

          <p eId="para_1244">The tragedy, of course, is that it is not just these manifesto promises that will be broken once again.  We have seen it time and again from this Government.  The tragic truth is that if the economy continues to be managed the same way the Minister is managing it today in this budget, we will quickly be unable to afford the investment in infrastructure that we need.  We will see serious threats to this economy emerge if he continues with this approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_1245">We need reform in the way public money is spent.  We needed it seven years ago.  Even now, it would be welcome but there is no serious reform being delivered here.  This Minister has spurned the opportunity of reform every time it has been presented to him.  He spurned it when benchmarking was there, a huge €1.3 billion increase which could have leveraged change.  He spurned it most recently when his own big pay increases were coming up for scrutiny when he could have demanded performance before they would be paid to senior managers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1246">He failed to bring in the sort of scrutiny that the Committee of Public Accounts recommended to this House in a very good report less than two years ago.  He has failed to bring in that scrutiny because he is afraid to see people scrutinise the way public money is spent.  He has run away from that measure, which could have leveraged reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1247">Instead, he has taken the easy option.  In the last period when this Government was in office, it created 178 new agencies.  This is the sort of new outsourced Government that is unaccountable.  They all have their own public relations and human relations departments, as well as their own glossy annual reports and personalised Christmas cards.  We will see them all flowing in during the next few weeks.  However, they are not delivering value and need to be rationalised.  Many of them duplicate work done elsewhere.  We need serious change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1248">It is not good enough for Ministers to join the solemn chorus of calls for wage restraint and reform when they are like the army generals sitting in their armchairs way back behind the line asking others to go over the top into machine gun fire.  When it comes to their comforts, there will be no change.</p>

          <p eId="para_1250">Their four new parliamentary committees, their three new Ministers of State with their entourages and their own huge pay increases, which include €38,000 for the Taoiseach, have all been paid and it is others, such as pensioners, who we ask to make do with so much less.  Ordinary workers on the average industrial wage are asked to pay tax at 41%, the same rate as that paid by a millionaire.  Where is the sense of priority or justice from a Government that approaches issues like that?</p>

          <p eId="para_1254">The tragic truth is that we would have a resilient economy today that would be capable of dealing with the challenges if the programme of reform had been started.  We have only to look across the water to see what Gordon Brown and the Labour Party in the UK did when they demanded annual efficiency changes and over the period in question were able to release what would be the equivalent in Ireland of 6,000 extra frontline staff to frontline positions to deliver services.  We could have already resolved the question of our need for 2,000 extra gardaí, 2,000 extra consultants or 2,000 extra teachers.  That could have been resolved by a proper efficiency approach along the lines of the approach taken not only in the UK but in many other countries.  However, this Government just wanted to throw money at problems.  The tougher the problem, the more it threw money at it and the more it did not face up to reform.  That is the sad situation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1255">Who will be the casualties of this unreformed Government that is spending money freely and not delivering results?  It will not be Ministers, that is for sure.  It will be older people waiting for care, children with special needs abandoned to dropping out of school early and the vulnerable communities that are prey to drugs and the violence of organised crime.  They will be the victims who will pay for a budget that will not face up to the realities of an economy which is working superbly in the private sector but which has not addressed the issue of productivity, efficiency and reform in the public sector.  Most of the problems we face as a country come directly from Departments controlled by the 15 Ministers across the floor.  That is where the high cost and our loss of competitiveness is coming from.  We have a Government complacently whistling its way along and not addressing this crying need for reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_1256">Again, we see a huge disappointment in the area of taxation.  Indexing bands and credits to simply meet the cost of wage increases was a core commitment and one which, above all, the Minister said he would honour but he has not honoured it.  He has not honoured the 4.5% increase in wage thresholds which he said he would deliver.  To meet the cost of inflation now, one would need €90, which he has not delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1257">We have also seen that, once again, more ordinary taxpayers on modest incomes will be plunged into the top rate as a result of not indexing.  Next year, 750,000 people will be on the top rate of tax of 41%.  That is the reality.  Even people on the average industrial wage will find themselves on the top rate.  Is this not an extraordinary situation?  Here was a Minister who promised in the last programme for Government that only 20% of taxpayers would be on the top rate.  Instead we see a massive 750,000 of them on the top rate.  He has reneged on that promise in respect of 250,000 people.  We still see ordinary people being asked to pay tax at the same rate as multimillionaires, which is not acceptable and must change.</p>

          <p eId="para_1261">For example, over 600,000 people in the private sector do not have any pension whatsoever.  We were promised that we would see a one for one scheme.  Indeed I believe the Green Party was the first to advocate having such a scheme to help the lowest paid people invest in pensions for their retirement so that they would not be solely dependent on social welfare pensions and would not be plunged into poverty in their old age.  Nothing is being done about that.  We have had two huge reports, no doubt at huge cost, and nothing is being done to address the needs of those with no pension cover.</p>
          <p eId="para_1262">I suppose that even during straitened times, families would have looked for some support to cope.  What do they find?  The sum total of €1.38 per week is offered as extra child benefit at a time when the price of all the basic food items — bread, butter, milk and eggs — is increasing by 15% or 16%.  What Minister could say that a child could be supported with an extra €1.38 per week in such a climate of rising costs?</p>

          <p eId="para_1264">A slightly better increase of €2 per week in the child care supplement is being offered.  One might say this is extraordinarily generous but the reality is that out of their pre-tax income, people must find an incredible €18,000 per child to support children in child care.  That is the reality in the tiger economy of today.  Families where both parents are forced to work face that obstacle of €18,000 for each child.  This issue must be addressed and has been persistently ignored by this Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_1266">Instead of trying to address this, the Government is, once again, penalising people who opt to drop out of the workforce to provide care at home for a period.  The penalty they face has been ratcheted up once again today.  An extra €1,400 penalty is being imposed on people who opt to stay at home.  The combination of the bands and the PAYE allowance they will give up by dropping out of the workforce is now an astonishing €8,500.  That is the tax penalty the Minister thinks should be imposed on a parent who decides to opt out of the workforce for a period to care for a young child.  Where is the justice in that and the commitment that we would see home carer's tax credit doubled?  That has disappeared and a measly tax credit increase of €130 was offered.  These issues have been festering and have not been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1267">Another hidden element that will affect children and young families is that there is no improvement in the medical card.</p>

          <p eId="para_1269">We were told there would be a major increase in the supplement in respect of children and that it would be indexed in accordance with the industrial wage.  A family with two children is deemed by the Minister to be too wealthy to receive a medical card if the parents are on the minimum wage.  At €17,800 they will be deemed too wealthy to receive a medical card.  What sort of planning for the future is that if low income families cannot be permitted receive care for their children from a doctor when needed?  It is so shortsighted and such an abandonment of the sense of equity that the Minister said would inspire his budget that I cannot understand the thinking.</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1272">Many children with special needs have been dependent on psychological assessment and many school principals must play God in deciding which children with serious problems will be allowed have a psychological assessment.  That situation will continue in a budget that was supposed to address the situation with equity.  We will continue to see children accommodated in temporary accommodation.  There is no squaring up to the needs of families.  Despite difficult times we should have found space to address families.  There is no greater long-term investment than investing in the future of our children, particularly those in low income backgrounds.  We want to see them progress, not drop out of school because their needs were not diagnosed in the early stage of their education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1273">There is little for older people to cheer about in this budget.  The sum of €14 is not bad, compared to what Ministers might have given out, but it compares poorly to the €700 the Minister awarded himself.  Older people are facing high increases in costs at present.  Basic foodstuffs, which take up much of the older person's budget, are increasing extraordinarily rapidly, as is fuel.  At least €12.50 of that €14 will be absorbed by meeting the increased cost of products.  There will be little spare cash for people to make any slight improvement in their lifestyle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1274">Other areas forgotten in this budget include the living alone allowance.  Why do we decide that 121,000 people who live alone should not get more than €7.70?  This has not been changed in decades.  Why do we decide that widows, who live alone with children, cannot access the free scheme unless they are aged 60?  These are small changes that could have brought the equity that the Minister said would inspire his budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1275">There will be an extra 60 cent per week in the fuel scheme to meet the higher fuel costs for older people this winter.  It will not go very far.</p>

          <p eId="para_1277">The tragedy is that making ends meet is not the only worry facing older people.  They have been waiting for proper standards of policing of nursing home care and other care facilities.  They have been waiting to see the high chance of picking up infections in hospitals addressed.  They continue to wait.  They have seen home care packages axed because the bureaucracy in the HSE ran out of money.  They are part of the 200,000 unrecognised people waiting to see a consultant for the first time, waiting to join the queue of 41,000 for a medical procedure.  This budget is letting old people down at a time when major increases in health budgets were committed to by the taxpayer.  The results that would make a difference to their lifestyle have not been delivered.</p>
          <p eId="para_1278">The conversion of the Minister to changing stamp duty is something I must welcome.  I argued for it before and during the election.  I tabled an amendment in June to implement it.  Who opposed it on every occasion?</p>

          <from>Deputy Richard Bruton</from>
          <p eId="para_1284">It is welcome but it is coming too late, after stamp duty revenue and sales have halved in the past nine months and confidence is at a low ebb.  It does not represent a proper housing policy and we must examine the detail of a dysfunctional housing policy over which the Minister and his colleagues preside.</p>
          <p eId="para_1285">I welcome the increase in mortgage relief, a concession of €800 in cash terms.  It will go some of the way to meet the €3,000 extra that young families have faced in the past 12 months as a result of increases in interest rates.  It will be a welcome assistance.</p>
          <p eId="para_1286">However, I part company with the Minister on the matter of rental relief.  Why has he decided that those who rent should get only €1.50 extra in rent relief?  These are among the poorest families, who cannot get on the housing ladder, are in a weak position and cannot get loans from mortgage companies.  They are not given anything.  The total of the subsidy they will receive from the Minister is less than €15 per week.  Rents in Dublin are €500 per week, as the Minister knows.  What sort of contribution is this towards those in the weakest position?  Rents have increased by 20% in most cities over the past 12 months and the Minister can only come up with €1.50 per week extra in rent relief.  The Minister is out of touch with what is happening in the housing market.  Other schemes are similarly out of touch.  Regarding the rental accommodation scheme, why must low income families wait 18 months, being unemployed, before they can qualify for support from the public sector?  What is the sense in that and what sort of poverty trap is it creating?  That is the big idea from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to address the housing crisis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1287">What is the situation in respect of the shared ownership scheme?  The subvention element in the shared ownership scheme only applies if one's income is less than €28,000 but no one in the country would be considered for a housing loan with an income under €28,000.  The shared ownership scheme is a dead letter scheme and is collapsing as we speak.  It has ceased to support families who need our support in a difficult time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1288">I give the Minister one cheer for some reform of stamp duty but I do not endorse his housing strategy that is failing so many people.  Even the Central Bank, hardly the source of radical thinking, tells us that half the people in the country cannot afford to buy a house and that this is unsustainable.  The tragedy is that the bill for high cost Government has come home to roost, not just for taxpayers but for those trying to compete in the real economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1289">The Government and its policies accounted for half of all inflation during the past seven years.  In addition, it loaded stealth taxes equivalent to €3,500 per annum onto every family.  Inflation in sectors controlled by the Government is running at two and a half times the rate that obtains in equivalent sectors in other eurozone countries.  Ireland has become a high-cost country primarily as a result of Government action.  I will provide one statistic which, more than any other, illustrates this fact.  Price increases in sectors controlled by Government during the past seven years stand at 45%.  Manufacturing companies trying to export goods abroad — the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Martin, will be aware of this — have seen their prices fall by 17%.  That is the contrast.</p>

That sort of culture needs to be introduced in the public sector.  However, thinking along these lines is miles away from that which occurs around the Cabinet table.</p>
          <p eId="para_1292">With his decision to increase motor tax by10%, the Minister is again dipping into the pockets of motorists.  This is not a green tax.  Any notion that it is such a tax does not stand up to scrutiny.  This is more about picking the pocket than about protecting the planet.</p>

It has been estimated that the environmental damage done by most cars with petrol engines stands at 9 cent per litre.  However, the Minister is collecting €2,500 per annum from motorists.  They are a soft touch and that is what is behind the change in motor taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1297">I welcome the changes relating to VRT.  These changes are timely and I agree with the Ministers for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputies Ryan and Gormley, on the need to take climate change seriously.  However, people should not forget that the Government produced a strategy in 2000 which advocated introducing a carbon tax by 2002, increasing investment in buses, ceasing coal use at Moneypoint by 2008, rebalancing VRT, introducing integrated traffic management and supplying 12.5% of our electricity needs from renewable energy sources by 2005.  Precisely none of this has come to pass.</p>
          <p eId="para_1298">It is time to reform the system of VRT.  Why did we not reform it before we built 500,000 additional houses, put 600,000 extra cars onto our roads and failed to take heed of patterns of energy use?  The consequence is that we now face a fine because we failed dismally to meet our international obligations.  We must now borrow to pay this fine.  In the years since changes to VRT should have been introduced, average emissions per car have increased by 11%.  The time to act was several years ago.  I welcome the belated conversion of the Minister.  However, as with everything else he has ever done, he acts only when he is forced to do so.  He does not anticipate change or make changes in a timely manner.</p>

It is not enough for the Minister to repeat the mantra that the Government is committed to the NDP.  The latter is important, particularly if it is delivered effectively, on time and on budget and if the projects relating to it stand up to scrutiny.  Taxpayers should not be asked to issue a blank cheque.  If the Minister is serious about this matter, he should publish the evaluations relating to NDP projects in order that we might say that they will deliver value for money.  He should also outline prior commitments to the policy frameworks that will surround capital investment.  Time and again money has been invested in expensive capital projects and then mismanaged subsequently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1301">It is time for the public sector and the Government to face up to real change.  What we should have been presented with today was a decision to suspend the big pay increases and make them conditional on performance.  We should have insisted that every public body should deliver independently audited efficiencies of at least 2% in 2008.  We should also have initiated immediate audits in respect of all agencies.  Such audits would have brought about the far-reaching rationalisation of those agencies.  Why do we have a taxi regulator, an aviation regulator and a bus regulator?  Why not a single transport regulator?  Why do we have a health insurance regulator and a financial regulator?  Why are the two not integrated?</p>

That was the purpose of the big book with which we were presented in October.  Everything that is already in place will remain intact.  The Government is only focused on how to spend the money that is left over.  If we want radical change and reform, we must engage in a root and branch examination of what is happening in those programmes.  We should not state that existing services will remain in place and that we will tack on a little more funding.

There is a new generation in Ireland, the members of which are ambitious, energetic and creative.  These people give their best and expect high standards elsewhere.  They will not tolerate the sluggish, complacent and wasteful approach the Government continues to display.  They have carried those opposite on their backs for too long.  Today was the opportunity to show that the Government has the ambition and capacity to lead in terms of introducing change.</p>
          <p eId="para_1309">Leadership is not about talking gravely in solemn tones.  It involves having intense, driving determination to achieve best practice in the context of what happens in the public service.  Leadership also involves demonstrating that one can lead from the front and that one will not seek to protect one's own comforts but will instead shoulder the load and demand the standards of oneself that one demands of others.  In this most important test, the Government has failed.  It is time to initiate the programme of reform to which I refer.  Today, it was already seven years too late to do so.  The Government has again failed to instigate change.</p>

          <from>Deputy Joan Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_1311">This budget constitutes a frank admission of economic incompetence on the part of the Minister for Finance and the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats-Green Party coalition.  That a Minister for Finance should think it necessary to change the stamp duty regime twice in six months is an extraordinary admission of failure.  The mismanagement of the housing market is written all over the budget.  The increased borrowing and limited tax and social welfare packages reflect the hit the Exchequer and the economy have taken from the property slump.  The total allocation for improvements in the health service amounts to the equivalent of six days' spending on health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1312">On numerous occasions we warned the Government that allowing house prices to race ahead unchecked was making life impossible for buyers and that the economy was over-reliant on construction.  However, it refused to listen and the sky is now dark with the chickens that are coming home to roost.  This budget is an attempt to muddle through tougher times.  It is not the new departure for a new era which the economy needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1313">Among the headline changes of the budget, disability services see practically no change.  In The Next Steps Forward, pensioners were promised €100 over five years, which is €20 per week.  Today they receive €14 per week for contributory pensions and €12 for non-contributory.  There is no improvement in medical card coverage and no fundamental reform of PRSI, which was a major element of the Taoiseach's pre-election promise in his Ard-Fheis speech.  There is a small improvement in the income disregard for carers, which will be pretty well meaningless in the context of the inflation that faces them when they do their supermarket shopping.</p>
          <p eId="para_1314">What about the Green Party?  In the spirit of Christmas, the Gordon Ramsay of the Government, the Minister of State with responsibility for food, Deputy Sargent, yesterday put up his tasty recipe for sprouts on his Department's website.  I do not like them myself, but he obviously loves them.  His instructions were to cover the pan and boil them briskly until the water is absorbed, add a knob of butter or margarine and keep an eye on them so that they do not burn at a later stage.  What happened?  The most green aspect of this budget is the cover of the budget document.  The knob of butter is spread thinly over all the little social welfare increases.  It is interesting to see that while Fianna Fáil are in hock to the builders, the Green Party seems to be going overboard on the Brussels sprouts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1315">The Minister was trying to juggle too many balls today.  There were nods to the left, nods to the right, nods to prudence, nods to the public sector, nods to tighter spending controls and nods to greater efficiency.  From this Government, a nod is as good as a wink.  The Minister offered us a lot less in the package than the sum of its parts and an awful lot less than what the public is entitled to, as we enter far more turbulent times than we have experienced in the past 15 years.  The Minister wants to reassure his party and the public, but he cannot escape the message contained in last Saturday night's White Paper and the grim message contained in the raw figures of declining tax revenues under almost every heading.  Not since the 1980s has the graph of Exchequer revenues shown such a sharp dip, not even in the period of currency turbulence between 1992 and 1993.  I am sure the Taoiseach must remember those times well, if only for those close and friendly meetings with his adviser and friend, Mr. Padraic O'Connor.  As ever, leaders should beware the ides of March.  This is also the first time since 1993 that the national debt to GDP ratio has gone up.  Stevie Smith wrote a famous poem 50 years ago about a man thrashing about in stormy waters.  Onlookers thought he was having a lark, but as the poem states, he was not waving but drowning.  That describes the Minister for Finance perfectly today.</p>
          <p eId="para_1316">This Government no longer commands the economic agenda.  It looks on helplessly as an economic storm looms over the horizon with no idea at all on how to come to grips with the new reality.  Only a few short months ago, the same Minister offered voters a rosy scenario of our country's prospects.  The Next Steps Forward threw caution to the wind with extravagant claims on tax, PRSI, pensions and living standards.  Today's budget is a survey of what survives and a belated acknowledgement that we are in for a bumpier ride than was suggested to the public in May.  Economic growth is on the slide.  The Minister's forecast is for 3% at the beginning of the budget.  I do not think he will be lucky enough to hit 3%, the way the housing market is at the moment.  Every forecast is a little lower than the one before and nobody can rely on what the Minister says today.  It will be adjusted a dozen times before we have another Budget Statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Meanwhile, inflation is set to remain stubbornly high and that is as much the fault of this Government's domestic policies as the fault of international conditions, such as high oil and commodity prices.  For most people, the budget is about the cost of living and it has no good news on that front, and little prospect of better news for the time to come.  Working families will not be getting similar pay rises to Ministers.  Over 1 million of them will earn less in a whole year than the Taoiseach's proposed rise in salary of €38,000.  These people will not have the luxury of being exempt from extra fuel and car taxes like the Ministers who are driven around in State cars.  There is a wider gap than ever between what Ministers experience daily and the reality of belt tightening that families will have to endure.  People in the ordinary economy are living in a parallel universe to members of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1318">The proposed changes in stamp duty are really a humiliation for the Minister for Finance.  In June, he brought in stamp duty reforms which he told us would restore stability and certainty to the housing market.  He told us that the changes would be good for certainty, good for affordability and good for society.  Today, he had to return to stamp duty for the second time in under six months with his tail between his legs.  This is an admission of economic incompetence.  The Minister has mismanaged and misjudged the housing market and the Exchequer borrowing he is announcing today is the direct result of that.  The bungling of the stamp duty issue has been extraordinary.  The flight from the housing market first began with the former Minister Michael McDowell's attention grabbing stunt.  He declared that stamp duty could be abolished because the Government did not need the revenue.  It was followed by months of  inaction by the Government, followed by a badly constructed and inadequate reform last June.  The Government did not realise that the problem with stamp duty was not simply about first-time buyers, but more especially about those trading up.</p>
          <p eId="para_1319">In the reform proposals for stamp duty put forward by the Labour Party in 2006 and before the election, we pointed to the difficulties for those who were trading up.  These people had exhausted their first-time buyer's relief on buying an apartment, but five years later had one or two children and desperately needed to buy a family home.  We told the Minister that was where one of the critical problems existed, but he refused to listen.  Since then, the housing market has slumped and the Minister is now trying to rescue it from the wreckage of his policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">Old habits die hard with this Minister.  Somebody buying a second-hand house for €500,000 in the Dublin area will save €11,250, which is welcome.  However, somebody buying a house for €2 million will save €28,750.  That is the way all these reforms go.  In the June reform, stamp duty for first-time buyers was abolished so that many of those who benefitted were very wealthy families able to spend over €1 million on houses for their children.  With this new reform, the more one has, the better one does.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">Things happen in the real world.  There are oil shocks, climate shocks, wars and a sub-prime crisis.  I think I was the first person to mention that latter term in this House.  One of the journalists working here asked me what sub-prime meant.  Now every junior bank clerk and first-year economics student knows all about it.  Stuff happens.  As former British Prime Minister Harold Macmillan said: "Events, dear boy, events."  Plans for spending and taxation should take into account the major uncertainties that a frothy housing market generates for consumer demand here and across the developed world.  One needs a contingency reserve in one's plans for what may happen and I do not see one in what I heard today.  The changes in the housing market are a serious concern for many people, not just for the banks and financial institutions which are worried about the quality of their land and property lending.</p>
          <p eId="para_1322">Before the election the Minister and his party boosted the housing bubble as far as it could go.  Now that the bubble has burst the consequences for many ordinary families may be severe.  Although Irish house prices are falling, they remain extraordinarily high by international standards.  In today's climate of much higher interest rates young people who want to enter the housing market cannot afford the €350,000 to €450,000 that is being demanded in our cities for modest one-bed and two-bed houses and apartments.  Funding a mortgage cost of €1,600 per month on a home cost of approximately €350,000 is an enormous financial strain on most young people whose earnings have not kept pace with interest rate rises.  The bursting of the housing bubble happened because the Government encouraged house prices to rise to ridiculous levels.</p>
          <p eId="para_1323">While house construction costs rose, they did not rise as fast as land prices.  Crazy land prices for developers speculating in land fed into enormous price increases for modest family homes.  Given the close relationship between Fianna Fáil and the developers, we cannot suggest that Fianna Fáil, the Minister for Finance and the Taoiseach did not know about this.  They chose to put their heads in the sand and allow the market to be stoked higher.  The Irish banks have been willing accomplices in allowing land for family housing to be bid up to crazy prices.  Much of that speculation took place in an environment that was not only tax free, but in which the Minister and his predecessor created an endless range of unnecessary tax breaks for property investment.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">The Minister talked about the school shortage but could not even force the builders to hand over sites for schools at current use value.  He had to allow his friends in the building industry to demand top dollar for school sites.</p>

          <p eId="para_1329">Deputy Kennedy is a great survivor from the old Dublin County Council.  Let us not get into tribunals now.  I would not advise the Deputy or his party to talk about land values or rezoning.  The Government must take responsibility for what happened in the housing market.  The short-termism of winning votes in the general election led the Minister, his Department and financial regulators to turn a blind eye to what was happening in the financial and housing markets.  The measures he introduced today to offer additional mortgage interest relief are welcome, but we need measures to control speculation in housing land.  People's homes are for living in, not for speculative frenzy.  If the Government were not so deep in vested interest to land and property speculators, it would already have addressed this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1330">The fall in house prices is accompanied by rising rents.  How is that for crazy economics?  Only in Ireland — we usually say "only in America".  This reflects the impact uncertainty is having on the market.  There is a strong underlying demand for housing, but first-time buyers in particular are wary of making such a major purchase in a falling market.  It is hard to see where this will end and when prices will level out.  There is a substantial downturn in construction.  The level of activity and employment in the housing sector was always unsustainable, but the uncertainty on house prices means the number of houses being built is falling rapidly.  I did not see in the Budget Statement the Minister's estimate of the number of houses to be built.  I do not know if we will get it but it seemed to be falling below 50,000.  I could not find it in the book so I do not know what the Minister expects.</p>

          <p eId="para_1332">Rising rents help only investors.  We need houses as homes for families.  It is notable that tax relief for people renting increased by 11%, but by 31% for people renting out a room.  The Minister is still trying to have it both ways.  He is trying to keep the investors, above all else, happy, but he is not prioritising families that want to buy homes to live in.  Given the way the market is turning, in favour of investors as opposed to families and individuals buying to live in an area, we have a problem in every new estate in every part of the country with an over-dominance of investors who are churning tenants.  The consequence in many new estates is that communities cannot be built up.  The Minister should talk to his local GAA club.  If the tenants change every year, how does one develop community?  The Minister has not got that balance right.  He still tries to have it both ways.  Last year he promised to close some of the loopholes in stamp duty that allowed property developers to avoid paying stamp duty on some large transactions.  He failed to proceed with that.  He listens more to the big developers than to the people who want to buy a home to live in.</p>
          <p eId="para_1333">Today's budget bears more than a passing resemblance to those of 2003 and 2004 after the 2002 general election.  It is standard operational procedure for Fianna Fáil to throw money around before an election and then to retrench, cut back and tax in the immediate aftermath.  We are to have a revival of that musical from the McCreevy days.  The growth rate of the economy has slowed significantly.  It is one thing to present an optimistic picture, but another to be in denial.  We are coming down from 14% spending growth and pre-election largesse.  The Minister said today he hopes to keep growth in current spending at approximately 8.2%.  We need a different approach to fiscal policy to face up to such different circumstances.  Unfortunately we do not know and will not know how the corrective measures proposed by the Minister will impact.  This year we saw the impact of the HSE trying to live more moderately within its budget.  The consequences of the cutbacks were not pleasant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1334">Even as expenditure growth is reduced to a more sustainable level we must have regard to key economic and social objectives.  It is unfortunate though not surprising that the Minister failed in that task.  Ireland may be heading for a period of slower growth.  It will take a number of years for the imbalances built up under this Government's stewardship to unwind.  However even a lower growth rate, skilfully managed, should yield a dividend.  In most European countries a growth rate of 2.5% to 3%, which the Minister projects, would yield social improvements and a social dividend for families.</p>
          <p eId="para_1335">What are we getting for the 8% increase in current spending?  There is a fairly minimal social welfare budget and most Departments are being told to soldier on for another year, without any extra resources for improvements in service.  The allocation to the fire services in the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government failed to provide for a full local fire service in Bray, even after the tragedy that town experienced recently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1336">The vast bulk of the expenditure plans in this document are devoted to keeping things as they are.  In other words, it is the Government's intention to simply plough on, doing things the way it has always done them.  There will be plenty of rhetoric about the need for other people to be realistic and more productive, but there will be no serious endeavour to change the way the Government conducts its affairs so that real progress can be seen from this 8% spending growth.</p>
          <p eId="para_1337">The Minister has provided for a significant increase in capital spending at 12%.  We have urged a more ambitious capital investment programme for years, in public transport and research.  We welcome the additional resources for the national development programme, but I wish I could have more confidence in the Cabinet's capacity to deliver the projects on time and within budget.  I can cite two cases in point.  Ireland lags dangerously behind as regards broadband access.  The CEO of eBay, a big employer in my constituency, tells of his "embarrassment" when he has to reveal Ireland's weakness in this area to his international colleagues.  The percentage of Irish businesses and homes with access to broadband is one of the lowest among Europe's leading states.  More importantly, he highlights how this might seriously reduce Ireland's chances in securing new foreign investment projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_1338">I want to also mention the annual bugbear of integrated ticketing, an essential precondition for the operation of improved public transport.  Tens of millions have been spent with no end product to date.  It has not moved forward one iota in the past 12 months, so who is in charge?  Most major cities operate one, even where there is a mixed delivery of services by private and public operators.  Munich, Rome and Lisbon operate smart cards that offer seamless transfer from buses to trains to trams.  I wonder whether the Taoiseach has ever used the metro link of his beloved Manchester to get to Old Trafford, or does he get his friends there to lay on a limousine service?</p>
          <p eId="para_1339">This is where aspiration gives way to cold reality.  Extra billions may be allocated to the capital programme, but will it all disappear in extra costs, overheads, consultancy and service charges?  The record of this bunch of Ministers in the delivery of services on time and inside budget is hardly inspiring.  Capital investment is not the only investment governments need to make.  They also need to invest in communities and the people for both economic and social reasons.  The Fianna Fáil manifesto at the last election contained a number of worthwhile initiatives, which if implemented, would mark real social progress.  I do not pretend that all of these plans can be implemented straight away.  However, the budget could have begun the process of implementing the most important of them.  We were promised 4,000 new teachers for our schools, a doubling of the capitation grant for primary schools.  In the area of health, we were promised 1,500 extra hospital beds and 2,000 hospital consultants.  There were to be 2,000 extra gardaí on our streets.  In social welfare there were to be further increases in eligibility as regards the carer's allowance.  I do not regard what has been done today as coming anywhere near fulfilling that promise.  On and on it goes, not to mention all the tax promises that were made in the Ard-Fheis speech, when the Taoiseach threw money around like confetti.</p>
          <p eId="para_1340">I do not expect the Minister to implement all these plans straight away, as I have said, but he could make a start.  Along with most Deputies, I would love to see some of those 2,000 gardaí on the beat in my constituency in the future.  I could certainly find work for the 4,000 teachers and the 2,000 hospital consultants would make a real difference to the health services.  How many of them will be employed this year and what planning is being done to ramp up teacher training?</p>
          <p eId="para_1341">The Minister claims his budget leaves a strong financial balance sheet.  The jury is out on that claim, but the social balance sheet is not as strong as it ought to be, in any sense.  As a country, Ireland must get past the antiquated notion that all capital spending is investment and all current spending is consumption.  The knowledge economy we aspire to is driven by education, which is crying out for investment at almost every level.  There is an urgent requirement for more capitation funding in primary schools, a need for targeted reductions in class sizes and we need specific measures to deal with literacy and numeracy problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_1342">Addressing many of these issues will require current spending, but it is ultimately investment in the productive capacity of the economy.  Studies show that it is the quality of teaching that most influences the quality of outcome in educational achievement.  There is no better investment in the future of our country, for example, than to set out a plan to provide universal free pre-school education.  The return on that investment would be enormous, but this budget does not recognise that type of expenditure as an investment at all.  I find it surprising that Ministers so consistently refuse to listen to the National Competitive Council's advice on this issue.  It is a Government agency that is asked for its advice year in year out.  It points out that those countries with enviable records in economic competitiveness set great store by the provision of early childhood education.  It is a topic of lively debate in the USA, for example.  This winter's headline book from Harvard University Press is called <i>The Sandbox Investment</i>.  I would like the Taoiseach to read it with the same care he has devoted to Robert Putnam’s book, <i>Bowling Alone</i>.  The Harvard book argues that pre-school investment has a priceless payoff.  The author states simply that the kids first policy is smart economics.  Putting kids and education first is smart economics, according to Harvard, this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">There are more than 878,000 workers, as per page C22 in the budget, on such low incomes that they do not qualify to pay tax at all.  These are people for whom a winter 'flu without a medical card or a doctor-only card becomes a nightmare, particularly if they have one or two children and must make multiple visits to a doctor at €50 per time, along with another €30 for medication.  If any member of such a family gets sick for more than a three-week period, medical costs for just the 'flu could easily amount to €300, the equivalent of a full week's net wages.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul refers to the many people, the 878,000 in this category, as the working poor.  These are people in work on low wages.  They are not paying much tax or PRSI, but they have to pay doctor's bills, for school trips, rent or a mortgage on an affordable house if lucky enough to get one.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">Child dependant allowances are critical for such families.  I welcome the increases today, small as they are.  However, they should be paid at least on a fortnightly basis.  The method of paying them on a monthly basis and the early years supplement on a quarterly basis does not help the budgeting of families on the margin, who need every penny on a regular basis.   Family income supplement, FIS, has to be made more accessible for such families.  A whole range of Government agencies, such as the National Economic and Social Council, have researched this and suggested, in line with proposals made by the Labour Party a long time ago, a supplementary child benefit payment or a refundable tax credit.  The Government has been stalling, perhaps because such a proposal would be costly, and I have no doubt there would be administrative difficulties to be overcome.</p>
          <p eId="para_1345">Nonetheless, such a payment could make a significant impact on the lives of the one in nine children who live in poverty.  In this respect, one of the groups most at risk of poverty is children in lone parent families.  The one parent family payment is structured in such as way as to make it harder for people to move into financial self-sufficiency while also making it harder to form long-term relationships.</p>
          <p eId="para_1346">Social welfare penalises young people who want to get married or live together openly.  The penalty ranges from €70 and upwards per week to more than €1,200 per month if rent allowance is involved.  Some time ago, the Minister promised to put an end to or modify the co-habitation rule because it makes no sense to encourage parents to live apart when they could be living together and caring for their children.</p>
          <p eId="para_1347">What about individualisation?  The Minister also presides over this tax penalty on a parent who wants to stay at home with children, particularly during the baby years, or on someone who may want to stay at home and care for an older relative.  I recall the Minister promised this time last year, as well as in his manifesto, that he would address the issue.  At present, a married couple where only one person works pays an extra €6,240 per year in taxation.  I did the maths on the changes quickly and after this budget the penalty will increase to €6,270 per year.  A two income couple will pay €6,270 per year less in tax if their income is €70,800 or higher.  This is the legacy of Charlie McCreevy with regard to individualisation and the penalty on choice for families who may want to care for their children full-time at home.</p>
          <p eId="para_1348">Last year, the Minister introduced a modified table of who pays income tax at the higher rate.  Today's figures show a shift up from 19.8% last year to 21.58% of families who pay tax at the 41% rate.  Even on the modified tables the Minister now provides on the people who will drift into the 41% bracket, this is an increase of 66,000 people.  This is because the changes in the bands and credits are not and will not be sufficient to provide for the increase in wage inflation expected next year.  More and more people, particularly young single people earning more than €35,000, will pay tax at 41% if they receive a bonus or an overtime payment.  They will also pay PRSI so they will continue to be heavily targeted by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_1349">The Government proposes to use €50 million of taxpayers money in 2008 to pay fines to the EU Commission because Ireland is above the emissions target.  We pay higher electricity prices to the ESB so it can buy emission allowances because it plans to emit so much more CO2 than the allowance it received in the emissions trading scheme.  If the Government had developed renewable energy properly instead of frustrating it at every turn, renewable energy would be producing much more electricity than it does at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_1353">What about today's announcements on motor tax?  We support the proposal to give reductions in VRT to people who buy emission reducing cars.  This is the proper direction to go.  However, last year hybrid vehicles accounted for less than 2% of sales of motor vehicles.  A Lexus, which I understand is the model of choice for many people, costs €30,000.  How many families will be able to opt for the Lexus to avail of the cut in VRT?</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">Let us be honest about it and call a spade a spade.  The increases in motor tax are about raising revenue and not revenue neutrality.</p>

A couple of green Ministers do not a green Government make.  The buck stops with the budget.

          <p eId="para_1368">Inflation was 4.8% in October, which is more than most people's pay increases.  Many private sector workers have had no pay increases at all in the past year.  Due to Government incompetence, consumers have had to endure large increases in electricity and gas prices which the Labour Party were proven correct to describe as totally unnecessary.  Inflation impacts most on those on low incomes and social welfare, for whom food and fuel are significant elements of the weekly budget.  Given that the current scenario is likely to continue, it is important that the Government develops a mechanism to protect the living standards of those on low incomes.  Today's budget did not adequately address that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1369">My greatest concern with this budget is that it says little regarding the threats from a changing world economy.  The changes currently taking place in the United States in the area of credit have not yet fully worked out.  I would like to know whether the Minister has a plan B should the chill winds we are experiencing become worse.  It can be amusing for some people to see the masters of the universe and the bankers sweat but it is not appropriate in this case to feel a sense of <i>schadenfreude</i>.  With the credit crunch, ordinary businesses, self-employed people and families on average incomes will suffer.  Already, business people are finding that borrowing has become more expensive.</p>
          <p eId="para_1370">Public confidence in this Government's ability to manage competently is decreasing and the feel-good factor is disappearing rapidly, two sentiments which are more important to sustaining Fianna Fáil in power than any factor of Government personality or policy.  While I hope that the times will not be too bad, particularly for those on lower incomes, we may be about to witness a transformation of politics.  Today, the Tánaiste played to Fianna Fáil backbenchers in his bid to succeed the Taoiseach when he should have been looking after the wider economy.  Only time will tell whether the gamble he took will be successful.</p>

        <speech by="#ArthurMorganSF" eId="spk_472">
          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1371">I welcome the opportunity to respond to the Tánaiste and Minister for Finance in this budget debate.  I intend to expose the hypocrisy of the pre-election promises made by this and other Governments on tax cutting which grossly misled voters on the state of the finances and the management, or mismanagement, of the economy.  I will also give examples of how things could and should be done differently.</p>
          <p eId="para_1372">Since the summer, the Tánaiste has been beavering away to condition the public for a tight budget.  He has been strenuously trying to dampen expectations created by his own party's unrealisable pre-election promises.  In advance of the election, Fianna Fáil promised 2,000 additional gardaí, 4,000 teachers, 1,500 hospital beds, 2,000 consultants, tax and PRSI cuts, affordable housing and much more.  The deceit on which the election was won was clear for all to see when tax cutting proposals which were never viable had to be abandoned in the face of a €1.75 billion shortfall in tax revenues.  Despite the fact that the economy is still relatively strong, the Tánaiste has done such a good job of lowering expectations that people expected nothing from this budget.  It suited him to keep expectations low and to foster fears of a harsh budget because it allowed him to present the budget he has delivered as being better than expected.</p>
          <p eId="para_1373">How should we judge this budget?  People will ask whether it lifts them out of poverty and deprivation, ensures a more equal distribution of the benefits of prosperity, puts the economy back on a more stable competitive footing, delivers an improvement in quality and capacity within our creaking public services, reduces the financial pressures on hard pressed families or delivers value for money for taxpayers.  These are the question that people across the State will be asking as they examine the details of what has been delivered.  In many senses, however, it is too early to judge this budget because we have not yet seen the fine print.  We will have to examine its contents, as well as the measures that will be announced by Departments, in the hours ahead.  There is a very real concern it contains hidden cuts in public services which will not become apparent until Departments start to allocate their own budgets.  I recall the HSE cuts which affected patient care despite the Minister for Health and Children's assurances to the contrary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">Last week, Sinn Féin set out our priorities for maintaining healthy public finances, building the economy and investing in health, education, housing and child care.  We also proposed measures to help people return to the workforce.  As finances become tighter, we realise it is not possible to deliver the levels of improvement in capacity and quality in public service we want in one or two budgets but the priorities have to be right.  Front line services in primary and preventative health care, school buildings and class sizes, pre-school education and child care infrastructure should have been delivered in this budget if the Tánaiste wanted a positive appraisal.  Scandalously, no mention was made of improving child care infrastructure or of pre-school education.</p>
          <p eId="para_1375">This budget will be disappointing for ordinary workers struggling on low and medium incomes and people seeking an improvement in public services such as health and education.  There will be widespread disappointment at the failure to increase the medical card threshold, which is set at a mere €184.  It is telling that the standard social welfare payment of €185.80 is higher than the medical card threshold.  The allocation to the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which is symbolic of the Government's support for private health care, is increased to €100 million despite being of little benefit to most people requiring hospital care.  That money should go to the public sector rather than bolstering the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1376">This is a minimalist budget.  I acknowledge that increases are being made to social welfare but these are too low to keep families faced with sharp increases in the cost of living out of poverty.  While the gains from widening of the standard rate tax band are welcome, they will be lost again when stealth charges are inevitably imposed by cash strapped local authorities across the State in the form of increased service charges and management charges for residents resulting from the failure by local authorities to take charge of estates.</p>
          <p eId="para_1377">The announcements on social housing are not adequate to ensure the end of social housing waiting lists any time soon.  Doing more in this area would have had the additional benefit of boosting the declining construction sector and helping the 43,600 unfortunate families who have languished on the social housing list for lengthy periods of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_1378">Where are the long overdue steps towards the creation of a State pre-school system?  The measures on child care do not go nearly far enough to assist families who are unable to cope with child care costs equivalent to a second mortgage.  The additional €100 per year in the early child care supplement will do little for these people.</p>
          <p eId="para_1379">The Tánaiste stated that the economic prospects for farming have improved, with increasing producer prices and food exports, but there was no acceptance by him that farm incomes are falling or stabilised at a very low base.  Many small farmers, particularly beef and suckler farmers, are surviving on unsustainably low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1380">Sinn Féin was the only party that argued in the run-up to the election that the Government, in light of the slowdown in economic growth, could not afford to cut taxes and maintain, let alone improve, public services and provide essential infrastructure.  It was the only party to oppose proposals from the Government parties and others to introduce tax cuts on the ground that such cuts were not viable.  There is now widespread acceptance that this is the case, as the 2008 Estimates of receipts and expenditure have proven.</p>
          <p eId="para_1381">No one doubts that presenting a budget in the current economic circumstances is more challenging than in previous years.  As an open economy, Ireland is affected by international developments, including rising oil prices, the declining value of the dollar and international credit crunch.  At home, we are experiencing a slowdown in the construction and property sectors, on which the economy has become excessively dependent, and face increased competition from low wage economies in the accession states, Middle East and Far East.  Ireland, as a whole, continues to suffer from significant infrastructure deficits and lags behind other states in terms of research and development capacity within enterprise, while the level of engagement in upskilling and retraining by workers remains too low.  All these factors act as a wake up call, a reminder that we need to take action to put the economy back on a solid foundation and ensure we regain competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_1382">The current account has a surplus of more than €7 billion.  The State is also in a strong position in terms of the debt to GDP ratio to borrow for capital projects.  More could have been done to improve public services.  Projected growth for the coming years, while lower than previous predictions, remains healthy by international standards.  The Minister forecast GDP growth of 3%, which is a difficult but achievable target.  The problem is not the percentage of growth — GDP growth of 3% is respectable — but that the Government planned its expenditure programme, as outlined in the programme for Government, on the basis of an over-optimistic assessment of growth.  This projection was not based on a realistic assessment of future economic developments given that a perceptible change had been under way in the economy for the past five years.  It had become flabby and had started to rely on construction and consumption, rather than the exports which had been central to economic performance in the early days of the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_1383">The slowdown in the construction and property sectors has, predictably, had a substantial impact on tax receipts.  Although the Department's tax strategy papers identified this possibility as likely in advance of budget 2007, the Government refused to accept this view and proceeded to make foolhardy proposals to cut tax.  We now have the farcical position of the Minister for Finance trying to rewrite history and cover up the reality of the approach the Government took.  This will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1384">Delivering a speech as part of the Indecon public policy lecture series recently, the Minister for Finance stated: "In managing our public finances we have not in the past and we will not in the future plan the public finances around the assumption that tax receipts from the property and wider construction sector will continue to grow in future years as they have done in the recent past."  The course of action the Minister proposed to avoid is precisely the one the Government chose.  The shortfall of €1.75 billion is a glaring reminder that it planned public finances around the assumption that tax receipts from property and construction would continue, despite clear signs of a slowdown in this sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_1385">We now face crucial decisions on the direction the State must take.  My party will hold the Government to account to ensure decisions to raise or reduce overall taxation revenue are made on the basis of what is needed to meet social goals and other spending demands.  For more than ten years the Government has pursued a policy of low levels of personal taxation and public service provision, with a growing reliance on stealth taxes.  Changes in the tax base in the past decade have involved cuts in income taxes which have benefited the better off and increases in indirect taxes which disproportionately impact those on low incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1386">While the Minister has announced a number of positive taxation measures as part of the budget, these initiatives maintain the <i>status quo </i>and do not constitute a move towards a fairer or more progressive taxation system.  Why has he again failed to strengthen the limit on the use of tax reliefs by certain high income individuals introduced as part of the 2006 Finance Act?  This should have been done to ensure tax reliefs are not exploited by some high income individuals to reduce their tax bill to the point at which they pay less tax than ordinary workers.  This is a ludicrous position which should have been prevented.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">While Sinn Féin welcomes the Minister's decision to increase tax credits to keep those on the minimum wage out of the tax net, we remain concerned that the minimum wage is not meeting the benchmark of 60% of the average industrial wage.  I welcome the increase in the standard rate income tax band.  My party strongly argued that those on or below the average industrial wage must be kept within this band.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">I also welcome the Minister's sensible decision not to proceed with the cut of 1% in the top rate of income tax which his party proposed in advance of the general election.  This measure would have cost the Exchequer €280.4 million and benefited those on higher incomes most, as was the case with the reduction in the top rate from 42% to 41% in last year's budget.  Reducing the standard rate tax band by 2% would have cost the Exchequer €1.13 billion, revenue that is clearly needed to fund our public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">In the run-up to the budget, Sinn Féin argued that maintaining healthy public finances had to underpin the Government's approach to budget 2008.  If public finances are not kept in a healthy state, the Government cannot ensure that everyone's basic rights to housing, health and education are met, nor can it deliver infrastructure to ensure our cities, towns, villages and businesses are served by modern transport and telecommunications infrastructure and everyone has the benefit of a comprehensive regime of social protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_1390">While Sinn Féin welcomes the changes in vehicle registration tax, we question the reason this step was not taken when it was signalled last year.  Why did the Minister believe it necessary to give people a year to purchase their high emitting vehicles without having to face any consequences?  Why will this measure not come into effect until July when most other measures will take effect almost immediately?</p>
          <p eId="para_1391">Sinn Féin also welcomes the increases in mortgage interest relief.  Many of those who bought their homes in recent years are being pushed to the limit as a consequence of increases in mortgage interest — I believe there were nine in all — introduced in the past year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1392">As I indicated, the tax measures announced today do not contain anything radical.  We can only urge that the proposed commission on taxation be set the task of determining the best way to fundamentally restructure to tax system to create a progressive, redistributive tax system through which revenue is raised in a fair, transparent and accountable manner in order that Government has the revenue needed to reduce inequalities, improve public services and deliver infrastructure.  The commission must also address the recent explosion in stealth taxes and charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_1393">I will address a related matter which remains largely ignored by Government, namely, the expansion of low paid employment, a development which has serious long-term consequences for the tax take, both in terms of income tax revenue and revenue from spending taxes.  Although figures for employment growth for 2007 show a net increase of 78,400 new jobs for the 12 months to the end of June, there was no commensurate growth in income tax receipts because the vast majority of the new jobs were low paid.</p>
          <p eId="para_1394">Government priorities must also include ensuring that attempts by any employer to depress wages in key sectors of the economy through the exploitation of migrant workers are prevented.  The use of agency workers to drive down pay and conditions can be stopped through the introduction of new legislation.  I and other Deputies have called for the introduction of such legislation on many occasions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1395">As we speak, the Minister of State with responsibility for labour affairs, Deputy Billy Kelleher, is plotting with his British counterpart to block an EU directive that would give 30,000 temporary workers the right to the same pay and conditions as full-time staff.  This is a disgrace.  Nothing in the budget, in terms of adjustments to tax credits and bands, will compensate for the loss of earnings people across the State will experience if the downward pressure on pay and conditions arising from the failure to regulate for equal rights for agency workers is not addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1396">The Minister's increases in social welfare, particularly with regard to pensions, carers and lone parents are welcome, but in the main do not go far enough to tackle poverty in the State.  The increases in the main payments may be in line with inflation but given the low rate of existing payments they will not go far towards improving the life of somebody reliant on welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_1397">The universal nature of child benefit and the early child care supplement means the minimal increases have the least effect where needed, nor do the increases offer anything substantially different or innovative in terms of encouraging people out of welfare and into work.  This was the main social welfare priority for my party in our budget proposals.  We recognise the large sector of people in receipt of welfare who would rather contribute to the economy but are caught in welfare traps and poverty.</p>
          <p eId="para_1398">We called for the medical card scheme to be extended to five years for people returning to work, for family income supplement payments to be increased substantially and automatically flagged and wage disregard thresholds to be raised.  Once again the Minister has failed to use the opportunity presented to him to achieve something of note.  Instead we are left, as usual, with a piecemeal approach to welfare, with incremental, paltry increases that, weeks into the new year, will be of limited benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_1399">We welcome the fact that the proposals to cut PRSI contributions have not been announced as part of this budget.  We all want to see the burden of taxes and PRSI on ordinary workers reduced, but it can only happen if it is visible and viable.  This is not the case if the cuts will undermine the capacity of the social insurance fund to meet social protections, such as redundancy payments, maternity benefit and social welfare.  This was demonstrated by the latest actuarial review of the social insurance fund which predicted that the fund's surplus is projected to be exhausted by 2016 on the basis of the central economic assumptions and benefits indexed in line with earnings.  The proposed 2% cut in the employee PRSI rate would have cost €720 million in a full year, while the 1% cut in the self-employed PRSI rate would have cost €220 million in a full year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1400">A key priority for Sinn Féin is increased quality and capacity within public services.  This must involve getting better value for money in public spending.  To do that, Ministers and their Departments will have to demonstrate better management of their respective briefs.  The wasteful over-use of consultants will have to be abandoned, or, at least, significantly reduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_1401">Promises to improve the health service are in tatters as the unworkable mess that is the HSE fails more and more of our citizens, most notably in recent times the women affected by the breast screening scandal.  Undertakings made before the election to address the crisis in primary education mean little to parents whose children cannot access a place in primary schools.  The key question against which this budget has to be assessed is whether it provides the revenue needed to address the deficits in key public services.  Has the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, provided what is needed to increase quality and capacity in public services?</p>
          <p eId="para_1402">The population of the State has grown considerably in recent years from just over 3.6 million in 1996 to 4.2 million in 2006.  In some areas, such as the greater Dublin area and the commuter belt, the population growth has been dramatic.  Quite simply, public services have not been adequately expanded to meet this demand and the pressure is being felt in schools and in hospitals in particular.  Public transport is full to capacity in urban centres, while rural areas lack any proper public transport infrastructure.  If one walks down this city this evening, one can hardly walk past the bus stops because there are dozens of people queuing to board grossly overcrowded buses.  The public is willing to use public transport if it is provided but, unfortunately, it is not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1403">Social housing output has not been sufficient to meet demands and there are still approximately 43,600 families on social housing waiting lists.  Other essential services, including the fire service, remain under resourced.  I have a communication from a colleague in Donegal who told me that a constituent of his has been on the housing waiting list for 15 years.  She was pregnant when she signed on to the housing waiting list.  She has again been promised a house next year.  There is a reasonable expectation that she may eventually be housed next year.  When her child, probably over a year later, is attending college that will be 16 or 17 years without a proper home.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1415">The people of north Wicklow who experienced the awful tragedy of the death of two firemen are forced to campaign for funding for a full-time fire service for an area which has experienced huge increases in population but no commensurate increase in essential services. Across the State, teachers are forced to teach children in prefabs.  In particular, I am aware of a number of Gaelscoileanna which have been forced to operate under these totally unacceptable circumstances.  In the Taoiseach's constituency, teachers in Gaelscoil Barra in Cabra have been teaching classes in dilapidated prefabs for ten years.  In Clondalkin, Gaelscoil Na Camóige has been existing in second-hand prefabs for 15 years.  In the Tánaiste's constituency, Gaelscoil Portlaoise's classrooms are made up of eight prefabs for the past nine years.  Gael Scoil Gort Alainn in Montenotte, Cork, has been occupying temporary buildings for the past 14 years — there are many more examples.</p>
          <p eId="para_1416">In the Dublin commuter belt, there has been a complete failure to put in place the education facilities needed.  As a consequence, we have the situation where some schools turned away non-Catholic children.  In one area of west Dublin, Lucan, Sinn Féin representatives have been inundated with requests from non-Catholic parents to help get their children into primary school.  That is some situation in the 21st century when we are talking about developing high-end marketing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1417">In areas like west Dublin and in particular Dublin 15, parents are putting their children's names down when they are born and are still forced to camp outside schools for registration in a new term.  More and more children are being forced to wait until they are five years of age before admission to school.</p>
          <p eId="para_1418">The €95 million extra allocated for primary school building is welcome but, as the Minister said, there are 13,000 new enrolments due next year.  That €95 million will barely cover the school places needed for them let alone go towards improving the conditions in dilapidated schools right across the State.  We will have to scrutinise in more detail the spending plans of the Department of Education and Science.</p>
          <p eId="para_1419">The programme for Government promised to double the income limit eligibility for parents of children under six years of age and treble it for parents of children with a disability.  It has reneged on that commitment.  The Government could well afford to help more low income people, to increase it to €250 per week for 2008 as demanded by the Combat Poverty Agency — hardly a radical organisation.  Even this would not have gone far enough because all those earning on or below the minimum wage should be eligible for the medical card.  They have failed to prioritise access to primary care in this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1420">The state of the health service has been under a particular spotlight in recent weeks and rightly so.  Figures from Trolleywatch indicate that whereas there were 159 patients on trolleys and chairs in accident and emergency departments on 4 December last year, yesterday there were 268 patients which is almost a doubling of the number.</p>
          <p eId="para_1421">Services across the State are overstretched.  For example, the Rotunda hospital's capacity was so overcrowded during the summer that women were moved into the hotel adjacent to the hospital for treatment.  Children in need of orthodontic treatment in the Kerry area are currently on waiting lists for six years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1422">In the health service we continue to have end-of-year budget over-runs and the Health Service Executive has imposed cuts in services to patients.  In my own region, the latest fallout from HSE cuts is that there will be no elective surgery in Dundalk hospital in December.  We have already seen medical and general surgical elective work postponed in Navan and the planned closure of the orthopaedic unit at Navan for the whole month of December.  What savings are involved in the closing of that unit?  The nurses are still employed on a salary, as are consultants and administrative staff.  The HSE has admitted this fact.  To be fair, my colleague, Councillor Joe Reilly, researched this matter and got to the bottom of it.</p>

          <from>Deputy Arthur Morgan</from>
          <p eId="para_1424">The only net saving from the closure of that unit for the month relates to the artificial body parts involved — the new hips and knee joints that would have been implanted.  We all know that the people who now require those hips and knee joints will still require them in January, February and April.  However, they must endure pain and suffering over the Christmas period and then wait in the ever-lengthening queues until that provision is made.  In the meantime, I have no doubt many of these people will attend at accident and emergency units over the Christmas and New Year period.  Where is the saving?  Moreover, the National Treatment Purchase Fund is also getting paid for these operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1425">Some 1,700 operations have been cancelled in Our Lady's Hospital in Navan in the past three years due to bed shortages.  Up to eight operations per day have had to be cancelled at Cavan General Hospital and many patients requiring rehabilitation after serious accidents and-or major surgery are being denied admission to the National Rehabilitation Hospital in Dun Laoghaire because of the cutbacks.  In other cases, we have the outrageous situation where expensive facilities in hospitals are not operational because of staffing caps applied by the Department and the Minister, which prevents additional people being employed to run them.</p>
          <p eId="para_1426">For example, in Waterford Regional Hospital, a brand new cardiac unit has been built at a cost of approximately €1.2 million and a consultant has been hired to head up the unit.  However, the new unit, which is due to open in January 2008, will be left idle as the HSE is refusing to fund another €1.5 million to equip and staff it.  Patients in the south-east region must continue travelling to Dublin or Cork for cardiac investigation and treatment.  The unit is justified or it would not have been built in the first place, but it will just sit idle.</p>
          <p eId="para_1427">The accident and emergency ward at the Mercy Hospital in Cork is currently lying idle because of a dispute between the HSE and nurses over staffing levels.  When questioned about this on a recent visit to Cork, the Minister's response was that solving the problem was not her area of responsibility.  The Minister for Health and Children is not responsible for anything that happens in the HSE.  We should have a motion of no confidence in the Minister every week until we get some movement.</p>

          <p eId="para_1443">While an open day was held at the Tullamore hospital before the election, it is only providing very limited day services.  The poor conditions in the old hospital have been highlighted in the media.  At one stage, patients in the hospital had to go for a week without hot water, yet Deputy Curran is shouting.</p>
          <p eId="para_1444">Sinn Féin wanted a small number of key commitments addressed as part of this budget.  They included delivering the 3,000 beds needed and increasing the medical card threshold to €250 per week for 2008 with a commitment to increase it to the level of the minimum wage over the next two years.  This budget should have contained a commitment to provide the revenue to roll out the cervical cancer screening programme State-wide in 2008.  We also demanded an end to the misuse of public money in the form of tax breaks for private hospitals and the co-location land gift scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_1445">If the cervical cancer screening programme had been rolled out, it would have incurred a cost upfront but we should consider all the savings that could have been made with regard to palliative care, trauma for patients and days taken off work.  Even an accountant would have worked out that it would be better to put in place the preventative care rather than let people suffer what they must currently suffer.</p>
          <p eId="para_1446">A key financial pressure on many families is the cost of child care.  In particular, the ability of low income parents to participate in paid employment is being threatened by the changes to the child care subvention scheme which the Government is set to introduce.  Across the State, many community child care projects are under threat of closure.  It is deeply disappointing that this was not a priority in the Minister's budget speech.</p>
          <p eId="para_1447">For example, the Larchville and Lisduggan community child care project in Waterford city, which benefited from €1 million in capital funding and which it is hoped will be open in January, will be under huge pressure because of the changes.  In the constituency of my colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, child care workers at Farney community crèche in Carrickmacross have predicted that, if this scheme goes ahead, many parents will pull out of the crèche because they cannot afford it, and it will have to double its fees.  Like other such child care facilities, it could be forced to close, resulting in loss of jobs and services which allow parents to go to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1448">Sinn Féin had two key child care demands it wanted to see delivered in this budget.  The first was the introduction of a universal pre-school session of 3.5 hours per day, five days a week for all children in the year before they go to school — the National Economic and Social Forum costed this at €136 million.  The second demand was the suspension of the child care subvention scheme and extension of the equal opportunities scheme by six months, pending reform of the subvention scheme and entailing detailed consultation with child care providers using the scheme around the State.  These measures should have formed a core part of this budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_1449">With regard to housing, the property market slowdown should have prompted the Government to do what it should have done a decade ago, namely, shift policy towards funding the local authorities to provide social and affordable housing.  This budget does not go far enough on social and affordable housing.  If more young working people had access to social and affordable housing, this would create more disposable income, which would stimulate the economy rather than having it paid to banks and building societies.  Such a shift in Government housing policy would also keep up levels of employment in construction.</p>
          <p eId="para_1450">Housing should be seen as part of our essential infrastructure, not just as a market for land speculators and property developers.  It is also reasonable to borrow to increase the social housing stock.  In advance of the budget, Sinn Féin demanded that 12,000 social housing units be constructed in 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1451">Our economy has come on leaps and bounds over the past two decades — I willingly accept this fact.  However, we have failed to use the successes of recent years to build for future competitiveness.  We are beginning to feel the squeeze with regard to our lack of infrastructure, knowledge capacity and flexibility, and will find it difficult to adapt our economy for future competition.  For too long, the Government enjoyed the benefits of an economy based on low costs and low taxes.  Developments in China, India and eastern Europe mean we can no longer hope to compete in that kind of market, nor should we.</p>
          <p eId="para_1452">While we are still competitive, our rankings are slipping.  Since 2002, we have fallen 17 places to 22nd in the World Economic Forum's competitiveness rankings.  Our increases in consumption and investment, rather than strong export growth, the slowdown in Irish productivity growth, particularly in high-tech sectors, the contribution of net exports to economic growth being small or negative in recent years and the high reliance on the construction sector for employment have all led to this drop.  We have seen a slide-off in both the construction and manufacturing sectors and, worse, we have seen parts of the country become economic blackspots.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">East Cork recently lost the proposed Amgen development and in Waterford 470 jobs were lost in Waterford Crystal.  In Galway yesterday, we saw the loss of 500 jobs from Abbott Ireland.  Recent CSO figures confirm Tralee is one of the State's worst unemployment blackspots.  There are 1,300 people out of work in the north Kerry town – an unemployment rate of 14.2%.  The Government and its employment agencies have done little or nothing to bring replacement industries to that area.  Not one job has been created by the IDA in north Kerry in the past five years, which is some indictment.  This neglect of the west and south west can also be seen in the decision to allow Aer Lingus to move from Shannon, which will have a devastating effect on the region.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">We need to be more innovative, not traditional, to ensure we are developing the kind of economy we want for the future.  Sinn Féin has consistently argued that ending the partition of our country will contribute to the building of a strong competitive economy.  Much of the business community, North and South, is behind us in this demand.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">Duplicate government and public service structures, an unnecessary administrative burden on those wishing to do business in both jurisdictions and two currencies mean we are competing with ourselves for economic investment and development.  Ireland's physical infrastructure, North and South, also remains a source of competitive disadvantage.  Successive Governments over the boom years to date have failed to introduce the infrastructure needed to build competitiveness.  We built a motorway that could not handle traffic capacity around Dublin and then handed it over to private operators who profited from it.  In fact, it took the authorities ten years to cop on that the M50 needed an extra lane.</p>

          <p eId="para_1462">We have a serious public transport deficit both in urban areas, where there is not enough capacity, and in rural areas, which, in many cases, have no public transport at all.  For example, in a situation mirrored across rural Ireland there is no Government subsidised public transport available to the people of north and west Donegal connecting rural parishes to larger urban areas.  These communities are losing their bus routes one by one due to commercial considerations, as private operators focus on profitable routes.  That was always going to happen because they will suck up profitable routes while the Government will not subvent the less profitable ones.</p>
          <p eId="para_1463">We pay the highest rates for broadband which is the slowest in Europe.  The State was recently ranked 17th of the 27 EU member states for broadband access, behind the accession states of Latvia, Estonia and Slovenia.  The root cause of this was the decision of the Government to privatise Eircom.  Once again, a profitable company was sold off rather than being used to roll out this crucial infrastructure, which has a major impact on competitiveness and economic development across the island.</p>
          <p eId="para_1464">We came belatedly to research and development and failed to invest sufficiently in it to redress that imbalance.  I welcome today's announcement on funding for research and development but I am disappointed that there was little or no mention of the need for investment in ICT in secondary schools.  In transport, energy, information and communication technology, Ireland's infrastructure lags well behind that of comparable OECD countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1465">I am pleased to see the Minister's commitment to improving infrastructure.  However, as the roll-out of projects under Transport 21 falls far behind schedule, there remains some concern that Departments are purposely slowing down the roll-out of capital projects under the national development plan in order to reduce budgetary pressures in the year ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1466">This was not an innovative budget and there was no radical edge to it.  The Government welched on the chance to take some exciting steps on child care, education and obtaining real value for money.  I had expected significantly more from the budget.  Over the course of the summer we all appreciated that the Minister for Finance, aided by other Ministers, was deliberately damping down budgetary expectations, and with considerable effect.  Media speculation clearly indicated that a harsh budget was in store, whereas we got a neutral budget.  People may think that because it was neutral it is not bad, but we should examine the missed opportunities for innovation and infrastructural development, as well as the educational and health deficits.  However, when Ministers and their agencies are not accountable, how can we expect any significant developments from the Government in terms of providing economic leadership?  It simply will not happen.  The budget was a disappointment and I rest my case.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1487">(2) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</p>
          <p eId="para_1488">This resolution provides for excise duty increases on tobacco products with effect from midnight tonight.  The increases amount to 30 cent, VAT inclusive, on a packet of 20 cigarettes, together with <i>pro rata</i> increases on other tobacco products.  The increase will bring the price of a packet of 20 cigarettes in the most popular price category to €7.45.  It will ensure that taxation policy continues to play a key part, along with the work of the Department of Health and Children and the Office of Tobacco Control, in discouraging smoking.  It is among young smokers in particular that price sensitivities are greatest.</p>
          <p eId="para_1489">It is anticipated that the excise yield from tobacco products will be €1.228 billion in 2008.  This represents an increase in yield of €54 million over the projected figure based on the existing excise rate, with increases in the VAT yield also.  The increase is expected to reduce cigarette consumption next year by approximately 1%.  I recommend the resolution to the House.</p>

          <p eId="para_1493">I am not quite convinced these increases in excise duties on cigarettes result in a reduction in cigarette smoking.  I know they raise some very healthy revenues for the State, and this measure will raise an additional €63 million, but where is the evidence that they actually cause people to give up the fags?  We hear this every year and it is very difficult to argue against the case for an increase in excise duty and that it is designed as a health measure.  It raises revenue but does it reduce tobacco consumption because I do not see any great evidence that is the case?  Perhaps the Taoiseach has some figures which will convince me otherwise.</p>
          <p eId="para_1494">Apart from that, it has an impact on people who are hooked on cigarettes.  I am thinking particularly of older people who have smoked all their lives and who are on small incomes.  This is another hit on their relatively meagre incomes.  Where is the evidence this is actually working as a health measure?</p>

          <p eId="para_1495">The evidence is that the amount of tobacco and cigarettes being sold over the past few years has increased.  Perhaps I am wrong about that but I am pretty sure it is the case that there has been an increase.  The excuse given is that a large number of people have come here from central and eastern Europe, that they smoke a lot and that is the reason for the increase.  I am, however, a bit sceptical that is the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_1496">The Taoiseach said he expected a 1% decrease in consumption.  What were the estimates in previous years in respect of decreases in consumption?  Did they prove accurate?  Obviously, the purpose of levying increased taxes on tobacco is as a sin tax and it is, therefore, only effective if it reduces consumption and is not successful if it only increases revenue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1497">There is a large number of boxes of cigarettes which have stamps on them.  What measures will be put in place to ensure cigarette manufacturers and potentially retailers do not cash in on those cigarettes stuck in the middle, so to speak, between the new and the old regimes?</p>

However, this is a farce.  A 30 cent increase will not stop anybody buying a packet of cigarettes but a €3 increase might do so.  If we put a €3 increase on a packet of cigarettes, we would see a reduction in revenue to the State from cigarette smoking.</p>

          <p eId="para_1504">It is a nonsense that this is a health measure.  It is not a health measure; it has no effect on the consumption of cigarettes because it is a small amount.  It will bring in €63 million in one year.  If it was effective, it would reduce the amount of money coming to the State.  However, it is not effective and the Department of Finance can happily predict that it will increase the amount of revenue to the State by €63 million.</p>

          <p eId="para_1505">The measure will probably have a positive effect in so far as it will discourage potential new smokers.  If the price of cigarettes was prohibitive, it would probably have that effect.  However, if one is a committed smoker, it will not change one's behaviour at all.  If it is proposed as a health measure, the Government must look at the issue of smoking cessation.  If some of these moneys could be diverted to smoking cessation measures, then perhaps it would be seen as a more productive move.</p>
          <p eId="para_1506">I also urge the Government to look at nicotine replacement substances, such as gums and patches, which are very prohibitively priced.  Their sale is also restricted in that they are only available in pharmacies, although they are widely available in supermarkets and multiples in other mainland European countries.  If one is to discourage people from smoking, one needs to look at the distribution of those products as well.</p>

We should remove this product from the consumer price index.  The type of approach the Deputy suggested, which would be hugely beneficial from a health point of view, could be taken without having an adverse effect on the economy.  If we leave this product in the basket of goods which make up the consumer price index, then we cannot do what the Deputy suggests without other consequential effects which we cannot determine.  I agree with the principle of what the Deputy suggested but I support the resolution.</p>

          <p eId="para_1516">I support the proposal for a 30 cent increase in the price of a packet of cigarettes.  It is very difficult to decide on the amount by which one should increase excise on cigarettes.  In last year's budget, there was a larger increase.  I am aware of the issue of contraband.  If the increase is too high, there will be more smuggling and more cigarettes will be sold on the black market.  There is always a fine balance to be struck between what one wants to achieve socially and financially.</p>
          <p eId="para_1517">I am sure Deputy Stagg did not mean to say smoking is harmless or to send out that message.  There should be a very clear message from everybody here that smoking is very bad for one's health and, therefore, I concur with those speakers who would, by and large, favour a larger increase in excise duties.  As I say, contraband is one issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1518">There is also the question of freedom of choice.  I also support the principle that people have the freedom to choose whether they want to use cigarettes.  As a society, we must never be too heavy-handed in telling people what they can and cannot do, as opposed to telling people what they should and should not do.  In all the circumstances, I support the proposal from the Government.</p>

I think I have stood here for probably 15 out of the past 17 years to speak about this issue and we say the same things.  Consumption is falling in spite of the increased population and, as Deputy Varadkar correctly stated, the fact there are more eastern Europeans here.  Consumption is down from 7 billion five years ago to 5.35 billion this year.  I was surprised by these figures.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_1531">Yes.  Even in terms of the population, it is having an impact.  Information from very extensive surveys that have been carried out by the Office of Tobacco Control indicates that the proportion of the population that smokes is 24%.  This compares with 27% five years ago and 31% eight years so it is coming down proportionally as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_1532">Of course, the survey shows the proportion of smokers varies considerably between age groups, with the highest incidence being among young people between 19 and 35.  Some 32% of them smoke.  The logic put forward by the Irish Cancer Society and others is that by bringing in this tax, the quartile of the people one affects consists of young people.  If they do not take it up when they are young, one has a chance of that running through.  Alternatively, if they get into it when they are young, one will never get them out of it or, at least, it will be a far more difficult challenge.  There is a very high incidence of smokers in the 15 to 18 age group — the percentage is over 17%.  While the overall downward trend in the number of smokers is welcome, it reflects the wide range of measures taken over the years to discourage the habit and the scale of the threat it still poses to public health.</p>
          <p eId="para_1533">Today's increase of 30 cent will ensure taxation policy continues to play the part about which I spoke and it should be particularly helpful in discouraging younger smokers.  That is really the challenge.  Consumption fell by 5% last year and, hopefully, the figure for this years will be 1%.  I suppose that 1%, like everything else, always sounds a bit meaningless but a fall of 1% represents 59 million less cigarettes.  Even if we do not include a few of our colleagues, it is still a fair cut in consumption.</p>
          <p eId="para_1534">In respect of excise duties on tobacco, fiscal policy is part, of course, of the overall health strategy aimed at discouraging smoking through other means, increasing prices in real terms.  Groups like the Irish Cancer Society and ASH say the increase should be far larger.  The Irish Cancer Society would like us to increase it by €2.  I have tried for many years in different capacities to get the social partners to agree that, like other countries, we could leave it out of the inflation figures.  If we get agreement across society, we could do this and it would have a far more significant effect.</p>
          <p eId="para_1535">In fairness to Deputy Stagg, he is consistent in his argument that it would have a bigger effect but, obviously, inflationary pressures do not allow us to do that.  The Minister for Health and Children, like previous Ministers, would argue for a far higher increase but we just cannot do it in circumstances where it would have an inflationary effect, which would not work well for the economy.  Other countries have managed to deal with that.  We try that on a regular basis and tried it again this year but it is just not a runner.</p>
          <p eId="para_1536">In respect of illegal tobacco products, the Revenue Commissioners continue to implement measures to combat this threat.  These measures include continuing seizures of illegal products, prosecution of offenders, monitoring the Internet sites, instigating test purchase to identify the importation routes, monitoring of sales patterns to identify and investigate irregularities, targeting enforcement activity and action taken at EU level to improve the controls of excisable products in the community.  All of these measures are being taken to curb it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1539">There is ongoing monitoring of international courier and air freight.  Of course, the indicative limit of 800 cigarettes is used by the customs service to determine the legitimate import of cigarettes.  However, an individual is entitled to import more than this if they can prove when questioned that this amount is for personal use, which is a bit strange.</p>
          <p eId="para_1540">The 13% increase raises the CPI by one fifth of 1% — 0.2% — but it is important that we support policies to reduce the incidence of smoking.  It is having an effect but there is no doubt we could introduce larger increases if it did not effect the CPI.</p>
          <p eId="para_1541">I have said over a number of years that there is a problem with the illegal importation of cigarettes.  We have the second highest excise content and retail price in the EU after the UK.  There are vigorous efforts to combat this smuggling and there has been a huge amount of seizures this year.  Up to the end of October, just short of 13,000 seizures were made, yielding 56.7 million cigarettes with a retail value of €19.4 million.  This is big business and the smugglers are still there.  Over 10,200 seizures were made from postal consignments and almost 2,300 were airport seizures.  The cigarettes seized had a combined retail value of around €12.3 million.  Seizures at sea ports yielded a smaller amount.</p>
          <p eId="para_1542">There have been over 110 convictions this years, including convictions for street trading.  We have also brought in Operation Hawkeye as part of which more than 300,000 cigarettes were seized in the period from August to October, with 200,000 cigarettes and 90 kg of roll-your-own tobacco being recovered on one premises alone.</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p title="motionProposal" eId="para_1553">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1554">(1) THAT in this Resolution "Schedule 1" means Schedule 1 to the Stamp Duties Consolidation Act 1999 (No. 31 of 1999).</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1555">(2) THAT this Resolution shall have effect as respects bills of exchange drawn on or after 6 December 2007.</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1556">(3) THAT Schedule 1 be amended in the Heading "BILL OF EXCHANGE" by substituting "€0.30" for "€0.15".</p>
          <p class="indent_2" eId="para_1557">(4) IT is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this Resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</p>
          <p eId="para_1558">This resolution provides for an increase in stamp duty on bills of exchange and is not a broader resolution.  This includes an increase on cheques, from 15 cent to 30 cent.  Stamp duty on the items in question has not been increased since the budget of 2003, when the charge was increased from 8 cent to 15 cent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1559">It is appropriate that the increase should be made at this time.  There are two main reasons, the reductions made to stamp duty on financial cards announced today and the context of encouraging greater use of electronic means of payment.  The increased rates of bills of exchange will apply to cheques supplied by financial institutions to customers on or after 6 December and for drafts and orders drawn on or after the same day.</p>
          <p eId="para_1560">Stamp duties on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes have existed for many years.  When electronic means of money transfer, such as money transfers, ATM cards and debit and laser cards were introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to those products to ensure the stamp duty receipts from cheques were not eroded.  Credit cards first became liable to stamp duty in 1982, ATM cards in 1992, and debit cards in 2003.  The rates of duty and their application have been amended on a number of occasions, most notably in the budget of 2003, when the duty on each financial instrument was increased.  Regarding the changes now introduced to stamp duties applicable to financial cards, credit cards and cheques, the stamp duty rates on cheques and other bills of exchange are being increased from 15 cent to 30 cent.  This is in accordance with the Government's commitment to move towards a system of e-payment and a reduction of cash-based payment.  The reduction of stamp duty on financial cards, combined with the increase in the rate applicable to cheques, should serve this commitment.  We have announced a number of reductions today; this is an increase and is part of a move to a paperless financial services industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_1561">Fine Gael will oppose this measure on a number of grounds.  It is a doubling of charges, from 15 cent to 30 cent.  Does it apply to bank drafts, electronic transfer and cash cards, devices that will soon be introduced to Ireland allowing people to put money on a card?  It is a stealth tax and will affect the elderly if it applies only to cheques.  Most people use electronic transfer but the elderly have continued to use cheques.  The budget provides some increase to the elderly but it is a low rate of increase.  An increase of 6% does not deal with a level of inflation of 15% across a range of areas.</p>

          <p eId="para_1563">Many of us remember much comment in the House and in society in general some years ago to discourage older people from holding large amounts of cash in their homes.  People were robbed and assaulted, or murdered in the case of one man, for relatively small amounts of cash in the house.  Much effort went into encouraging people to open bank accounts, transfer their pension payments to the bank and use a cheque book for major bills.  Many of these people have not moved on to credit or laser cards for a number of good reasons.  Many older people are not comfortable with credit cards, particularly the new chip and pin system, because they find it intimidating.</p>

Many people were persuaded to open a bank account and use cheques.  It seems this measure is being implemented for the convenience of the banks, who wish to move people from cheques to electronic means, thereby reducing the amount of paper transfers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1570">Sinn Féin opposes this resolution because people who use cheque books are, in most cases, those with low academic attainment and low income.  While I accept that the intent of the motion is to move business and civil society to e-transactions, we will get to that point anyway.  The people I described see credit and bank cards as high level, technological devices well beyond them.  To penalise them in this way is not fair or reasonable.  I am satisfied we will get to where this resolution seeks to bring us in any case.  We can spare more time for those lagging behind.  This resolution is included at the behest of the banks.  I do not care who it is at the behest of, but we should afford these people more time to work their way through the system and we will all live happily ever after.  It is grossly unnecessary.</p>
        </speech>

          <from>Deputy Billy Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_1571">I am opposed to this resolution.  There are many hidden charges in the banking system.  The Taoiseach referred to the reduction in the charge on credit cards, which I welcomed.  The Minister for Finance could do more to expose the hidden costs in the use of credit cards.  Many people pay their bill rather than examining the small print.  This should be more explicit.  Regarding the use by elderly people of credit cards, in many areas of the country we do not have cashpoints or credit card facilities.  This is an unfair mechanism.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572">The Opposition sent out wails of concern when this was mentioned in the budget speech.  A comment was made earlier by a member of the Cabinet and I thought it was unbecoming of a Minister to respond in the manner in which he did.  Perhaps the individual in question is out of touch with the people.  The addition of a charge in respect of cheques is unwarranted because people use cheques on a daily basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573">My final point relates to bank drafts.  For a number of years I have been urging the Minister for Finance to track down the uncashed bank drafts that are in existence.  Banks are holding tens of millions of euro in uncashed bank drafts.  The banks are aware of the identities of the owners of these drafts.  In many instances, the people involved are deceased and there is no mechanism in place to deal with these drafts.  The position is similar to that which obtained in respect of dormant accounts.  When a person passes away and his or her estate is being processed, members of the legal profession never seek bank drafts, they only request statements relating to deposit accounts etc.  I am aware of bank drafts that have lain unclaimed in bank vaults for a number of years.  This is notwithstanding the fact that the banking authorities are aware that these moneys are outstanding to the estates of various individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1574">The Minister gave a commitment a couple of years ago that he would pursue this matter with the financial institutions.  I raised it at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service but, to date, nothing has happened.  Will the Taoiseach give a commitment to follow up on this issue because some families are owed tens of thousands of euro by the banks and they are not aware of that fact?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_563">
          <from>Deputy Michael Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_1575">Why should people be taxed for paying their bills or using their own money?  The banks are paid by people and they impose heavy charges, legal or illegal.  Everyone is aware of what happened in Britain last week when people's personal details, which were being stored electronically, were lost.  The banks here sent out certain customers' information to other customers.  Something similar also happened in Britain.  Why should a person be charged, particularly when he or she is already paying the bank, for signing a cheque to pay money that they owe to someone else?</p>
          <p eId="para_1576">This week, farmers received letters from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food which stated that under EU legislation they will be obliged to use banks from next year.  The EU should mind its own business.  Regardless of whether people want to use banking services, it is none of the EU's or anyone else's business.  If I want to use the bank, I will do so, but nobody will tell me whether I should use the bank.  The Ceann Comhairle is aware that on a wet day the banks will take away one's umbrella, while on a fine day they will make one a present of it.  I have no sympathy for banks and I have no time for them.  What we have been presented with is a deal reached between the Government and the banks.</p>

          <p eId="para_1578">It is difficult to follow that.  I support the resolution.  Previous speakers referred to the increase in the duty charged in respect of cheques.  However, this matter should be placed in the context in which the Minister for Finance spoke when he introduced significant reductions in other forms of transactions relating to credit cards, ATM cards etc.  The Minister specifically stated that the overall cost to individuals accessing payment systems will be significantly reduced by the combination of measures he outlined.  Unfortunately, the reductions he put forward do not form part of this resolution, which specifically relates to the increase.  It is disingenuous and unfair to consider one in the absence of the other.  The combined measures announced by the Minister will reduce the cost of access to the system, which is very important.</p>

Payment of wages and salaries were directed through bank accounts to encourage more and more workers to use the banking system.

          <p eId="para_1606">It is important to bear in mind that we forced people into using the banking institutions and we are now going to screw them for a further €17 million via stamp duty imposed on the use of cheques.  The consequential downside is that many of these people will be encouraged to find other ways of dealing with their financial affairs.  We are all aware of the difficulties with which one can be faced if one is obliged to handle large sums of money.  These downsides must be spelled out.

On the historical background to this matter, the imposition of stamp duty on cheques, bills of exchange and promissory notes is a long-established practice.  When electronic means of money transfers, such as credit transfers, ATM and debit laser cards were introduced, stamp duty was gradually extended to these products to ensure that the stamp duty receipts from cheques were not eroded.  The duty, therefore, moved from one to all of those means of money transfer over time.  Credit cards first became liable for stamp duty about 25 years ago, ATM cards became liable in 1992 and debit cards became liable in 2003.  The rates of duty and their application have been amended a number of times over the years.  The last major amendment was in the 2003 budget, when the duty on each financial instrument was increased.</p>

          <p eId="para_1614">Yes.  The elderly are making payments by ATM cards.  Cards have been combined so that they can make electronic payments, while they can also extract cash from an ATM.  They can also pay for goods and services with their ATM cards.  Many people are using the An Post service, where they can use one cheque to pay a number of their bills.  Credit unions also provide that service.</p>

          <p eId="para_1615">What about cash cards?  A cash card is a device often used in Europe where people put money from their account on a card so that they can spend it with the card.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_598">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_1616">Some cards are not liable to stamp duty, such as store cards.  The Revenue Commissioners have taken the view that products which are essentially gift vouchers paid for in advance to give a defined spending power to the recipients, often confined to a particular store or stores and usually having a defined life, do not have the characteristics of credit cards or charge cards which offer continuous spending power within agreed limits.  Therefore, cash cards are not included.  Until recently, these items were primarily being issued by way of a paper voucher card, but increasingly they are issued in the form of a plastic card.  However, the underlying purpose has not changed.</p>
          <p eId="para_1617">From next year, financial institutions will be required to make a preliminary payment in December of each year of the stamp duties on financial cards due to be paid in the following year.  The payment will be based on 80% of their stamp duty liability for the previous year and the date on which customers are charged will not be changed.  The combination of the increase in the stamp duty rate applicable to cheques, combined with the reduction in the duties on financial cards and credit card accounts, results in an overall estimated reduction in the yield from these instruments of €22 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_1618">I take the point that there are some elderly people who do not like moving from the old position, but the masses are using the alternative.  We are reducing charges on what the great number of people are doing.  It is costing us €60 million but we are getting back €22 million.  The introduction of the new requirement that financial institutions make a prepayment of stamp duties on financial cards due to be paid in the following year will result in a once-off yield for 2008.  Overall, there will be a reduction in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1619">Some financial institutions are doing away with their bank books in their entirety from 31 December.  They have been running campaigns throughout the year for people to use ATM and laser cards.  Not only are they doing away with their cheques and their promissory notes, but they are doing away with the book.  As I understand it, that has been compulsory with some of the institutions.  It is not a question of people having the option because the banks are opting out of these products.  There were consumer complaints about this issue during the year and people did not like it, but that is the position.</p>

          <p eId="para_1624">Let us go on to the next point.  The issue of security has not been mentioned at all by the Taoiseach.  Security has been put forward as one of the reasons for this move.  I would challenge that because from what I have read, the security for electronic technology has been breached on several occasions in the past few years.  It is particularly sensitive with ATMs.  I do not know why so much store has been set on this proposal in the absence of advanced technology that can beat scammers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625">The other issue concerns what the institutions want, which is fine.  However, it is what the customer wants and what is convenient for the customer that should be the primary issue at all times, not what suits the institutions.  The institutions will promote whatever suits them, which is the use of whatever means require the least level of employment.  From my knowledge of the IT system, I do not think that sufficient fool-proof methods of transmission exist to the extent suggested in the promotion of this idea.</p>

          <p eId="para_1626">The Taoiseach mentioned that banks are doing away with their books and are going down the ATM route.  That is fine.  It is an internal matter for the banks themselves and that is business.  Should the Government be facilitating the banks by forcing people to switch from using cheques to ATM cards if they do not wish to do so?  The Government is effectively doubling the charge to facilitate the banks.  It is as simple as that and the Taoiseach is not comparing like with like.  Should the Government put penal charges on people that can ill afford them, purely to facilitate the banks?</p>

          <p eId="para_1627">There are all kinds of security issues and customers must be wary.  I am not saying that any of these things will resolve all the security problems.  The reality is that there has been a very significant move by the public to use technology in one form or another.  I do not think the charge is penal.  The charge had moved from cheques onto the other methods.  The vast majority of people are using the other methods, so we are making the other methods cheaper.  Most of them were brought in during the past 25 years, so most people up to the age of 50 are almost exclusively using these methods.</p>
          <p eId="para_1628">A great number of elderly people also use these methods, following advertising campaigns by the banks about savings and security.  I am afraid that people have largely voted with their feet on this issue.  The reductions are in the methods that most people use.  This increase has taken back some of the €60 million reduction, but not an enormous amount of it.</p>

          <p eId="para_1629">I must go back to the question to which Deputy Curran referred.  The person with the credit cards who does Internet banking will save money as a result of this.  However, we must remember the older person who maybe did not have a bank account at all for years, who then opens a bank account and gets used to using the cheque book.  Apart from the penalty, the danger is that this will force some people back to using cash and keeping large sums of cash at home, over the shop or wherever they might be, with all the security risks that poses, especially as they advance in years.  Some €17 million is a lot of money to take from people who pay only by cheque.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_1897">(5) It is hereby declared that it is expedient in the public interest that this resolution shall have statutory effect under the provisions of the Provisional Collection of Taxes Act 1927 (No. 7 of 1927).</p>
          <p eId="para_1898">This resolution provides for the amendment of the Finance (Excise Duties) (Vehicles) Act 1952 and the Finance (No. 2) Act 1992, as extended by the Motor Vehicle (Duties and Licenses) Act 2004, with regard to rates of motor tax and fees for trade licence plates.  The most recent increase in motor tax rates was agreed by resolution of this House in November 2003.  It is significant that it has been four years since that increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_1899">The proposed increases are 9.5% for cars below 2.5 litres and 11% for cars above this threshold.  Goods vehicles and all other vehicles will also increase by 9.5% with no increase for electric vehicles.  Trade plate licences will also increase by 9.5%.  The increases in motor tax rates must be viewed against the background that, since 2004, inflation has increased by more than 15%.  The increases provided for in this resolution are clearly well below inflation over the four year intervening period.  The new rates will apply to motor tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 February 2008.</p>
          <p eId="para_1900">In the context of today's budget, it is important to emphasise that the proceeds of motor tax are not paid into the Exchequer.  Rather, they are paid directly into the local government fund.  This fund, which was established under the Local Government Act 1998, is ring-fenced exclusively for local government.  It cannot be used by the Exchequer for any other purpose.  The motor tax paid into the fund is supplemented on an annual basis by an Exchequer contribution.  The fund is used primarily to finance non-national roads and the general purpose needs of local authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_1901">Deputies are aware of the significant role which the local government fund has played in the financing of local government since it was established in 1999.  Total funding for 2007 amounts to approximately €1.5 billion, which represents approximately 30% of local authority current funding.  The fund comprises an Exchequer contribution of €537 million and the proceeds of motor tax, which is projected at €944 million for 2007.</p>
          <p eId="para_1902">The ability of local government to respond to the ever-increasing demands for improved services made on it in recent years demonstrates the success of the local government fund.  These demands have arisen due to an expanding population, unprecedented economic growth and higher customer expectations.  Not only has the fund been successful in delivering resources locally, it has succeeded in limiting the direct financial contribution required of local communities and businesses through rates and charges.</p>

          <p eId="para_1910">The local government fund plays a key role in funding non-national roads.  Regional and local roads, which represent approximately 94% of the country's road network, serve an important economic role.  They also have valuable social and community functions.  While we have experienced increased urbanisation and a move away from agriculture in recent times, the network of non-national roads is still necessary to provide mobility within and between local economies and to provide vital links to the strategic national road network and the ports and airports which are our links with the wider European economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1911">The impact of the non-national road network on regional development takes on an added importance as we move forward with implementation of the national spatial strategy.  Investment in strategic non-national roads is critical to developing our gateways, hubs and other growth centres.  Investment within and between these centres and their hinterlands plays a key role in improving connectivity, circulation and facilitating the development of strategically placed landbanks.  The programme to develop and maintain the non-national road network is not confined to urban centres.  It is vital for rural communities that improvements in transport infrastructure continue to be implemented.  The programme also has an important road safety dimension in the context of increased safety measures.</p>
          <p eId="para_1912">In terms of funding, the national development plan provides that approximately €4.3 billion will be invested by the local government fund and the Exchequer in the non-national road network over the period of the plan.  While responsibility for non-national roads is transferring to the Department of Transport, the fund will continue to provide significant resources towards the development and maintenance of the network.  This year alone, €520 million is being provided from the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1913">In 2007, approximately €948 million in general purpose grants has been provided to local authorities from the local government fund.  These grants are my Department's contribution to local authorities towards the gap between the cost of providing an acceptable level of day-to-day services and the income they obtain from other sources.  The amount provided this year represents a significant increase over that provided in 2006 and is a clear signal of the Government's commitment to the local government sector and a recognition of the importance it attaches to local democracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1914">The new rates set out in the financial resolution will apply to motor tax discs and trade licences taken out for periods beginning on or after 1 February 2008.  Rather than read out the new rates for the long list of vehicles involved, I will highlight for the House the impact of the proposed changes for private cars and goods vehicles which make up 91.5% of the national fleet.</p>
          <p eId="para_1915">For the lowest engine size car of under 1,000 cc, the annual increase is €14, or 27 cent a week.  For cars in the 1,001 cc to 1,400 cc range, the annual increase is between €22 and €28.  For cars in the 1,401 cc to 1,700 cc range, the annual increase is between €30 and €39, representing a weekly increase of between 58 cent and 75 cent.  For cars in the 1,701 cc to 2,500 cc range, the annual increase is between €46 and €78.  The remaining cars over 2,500 cc will attract annual increases of between €106 and €148.  In summary, the extra costs for 95% of the car fleet, namely, those under two litres, will be between 27 cent and 98 cent a week.</p>
          <p eId="para_1916">For goods vehicles, the effect of the 9.5% increase will vary depending on the size, in weight terms, of the vehicle.  However, I emphasise that approximately 87% of goods vehicles are at the lowest level of charge, meaning that they will pay an annual increase of €24, or 46 cent per week.  A 9.5% increase is also proposed for trade licences, or trade plates as they are known.  These are the registration plates used by motor traders on vehicles temporarily in their possession, in lieu of taxing such vehicles.  The increase for a pair of trade plates will be €25.</p>

I find it interesting that the Minister quotes a figure of 15%.  That is 5% per annum, or above the average European inflation rate, and it is the reason we are uncompetitive.  I cannot understand why that figure would even be used.  Everyone uses cars and the Government is collecting €5.6 billion per annum from car owners.  The Green Party has become the mudguard for Fianna Fáil on the environment, just as the Minister for Health and Children is the mudguard on health.  VRT is supposedly a neutral tax but motorists are once again seen as a soft touch and are being penalised by the Government.  The issue has nothing to do with green taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1950">The Minister made the point that no increase has taken place since 2004 but the result is that people will now be faced with a substantial increase.  That will cause hardship, particularly for people on low incomes and big families, who have no option but to drive bigger cars.  Unlike VRT, this tax does not take account of carbon emissions and therefore goes in the opposite direction in terms of environmental incentives.  There is no incentive for more energy efficient cars and the differing increases according to the size of the car, at 9.5% and 11% respectively, leave little incentive for people to drive smaller cars.  It is a tax raising measure intended to make up for the ridiculous 2% increase in the local government fund.</p>
          <p eId="para_1951">The same 9.5% increase is being imposed on youth, community and school buses and other large public service vehicles, so there is no incentive to improve public transport provisions in these areas or to car pool.  The tax will impede efforts to reduce carbon emissions in transport.</p>
          <p eId="para_1952">Just over one third of the transport budget is being spent on public transport but €1.7 billion is being spent on road building, which goes against the promises made by the Green Party before it entered Government.

My grandmother pays the same amount of motor tax as I do, even though she drives less than 4,000 km per year compared to my 50,000 km.  That is fundamentally unjust.  If the Minister is seriously interested in linking taxation and revenue raising to emissions and car usage, it surely makes sense to create a structure that charges people for car usage through motor tax.  The amount of time spent on the road in a car emitting carbon should relate to the amount of money spent on road tax.  Irrespective of whether tax is changed to make it fuel or mileage based, that should be the direction taken in a genuinely reforming green budget.  Unfortunately, we are not doing that.</p>

          <p eId="para_1971">Irish motorists are the most taxed in Europe.  When they leave the garage, they pay more tax than any of their European counterparts on their cars and when they go to the filling station they pay more on a litre of petrol or diesel.  Out of every euro spent, approximately 60 cent goes directly to the Government before anybody else takes a cut.  This is another penalty, albeit a small one, on Irish motorists, especially those living in rural areas.  Farmers with heavy goods vehicles will face increases of 9.5%.  That might not seem a lot but it will mean an increase of €150 for most farmers.  It is another cruel imposition on Irish motorists, who are taxed more than any of their counterparts in Europe.  Notwithstanding the decreasing cost of insurance, it will also be a major blow to young people who have recently acquired a car and are financially stretched by the costs of running it.  While the increase may appear small, it is unjust tax which makes the taxation system even more penal.</p>

          <p eId="para_1972">I fully support the proposed changes, at least in vehicle registration tax and compliment the Minister on this innovative proposal.  We could argue about whether the measure would have been introduced had the Green Party not been in Government but that is beside the point.  It is a welcome step forward which Fine Gael supports because it introduces an emissions based tax, which is, in many ways, a carbon tax.  This is also the case with regard to excise and VAT on petrol.  It is noteworthy, however, that, according to the International Panel on Climate Change, the cost to the environment of motoring and petrol is approximately 9 cent per litre.  Motorists are, therefore, paying more than their fair share to compensate for carbon emissions from private vehicles.</p>
          <p eId="para_1973">I am a little annoyed by the disrespect the Minister has shown the House in spending a considerable part of a short debate outlining changes which will be effective for only six months.

It is unreasonable to expect Parliament to adopt what is essentially a temporary measure lasting for six months without having the courtesy to outline to Deputies the details of the proposed new regime.</p>

          <p eId="para_1976">The Minister should provide the information today.  This is a tax on car ownership.  I am not aware of other assets which are taxed on the basis that people own them.  We tax people for buying goods.  This tax is an attack on business and consumers, as are the proposals on tolls we will discuss at an oral hearing on Wednesday.</p>
          <p eId="para_1977">If the Minister proposes to change motor tax, why not take the radical step and abolish it?  It is difficult to make a case for motor taxation.  We have an emissions based vehicle registration tax and consumption based petrol and diesel taxes.  Why not abolish motor taxation and have a real debate about how we fund local government?  Having local authorities rely on direct funding from the Exchequer, business and motorists is a bad approach to funding local government.  If the Minister is prepared to have a debate on funding local government, my party will be pleased to engage in it.</p>

If the motion before us proposed to introduce a carbon tax from 1 January, I have no doubt it would receive unanimous support in the Chamber.  However, the proposal is, pure and simple, a rip-off of motorists and cannot be described as a rebalancing of motor taxation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1980">Not too long ago, when the Green Party was on this side of the House, I heard several of its Deputies describe the use of this type of phraseology by Ministers as bluff and bluster.  Look where it is coming from now.  Motorists have no option but to use cars as the Minister has frequently pointed out.  Public transport is available in only a small number of narrow streams in the State.  Under such circumstances, it is grossly unfair to penalise motorists to this extent.</p>
          <p eId="para_1981">When one hears the Minister articulate his case, one fully understands the reason he decided to filibuster and waffle to try to prevent Opposition Deputies from making their views heard.  If he wanted to be fair and reasonable, he should have negotiated with his Government colleagues to give the Opposition additional time to debate the issue.  We would then have happily listened to the four-page, slowly delivered diatribe to which we were subjected.  I had better make way for other speakers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1982">The Minister has produced a smokescreen to camouflage the true intention behind his decision to impose penal taxes on motorists.  It is a disgrace for him to propose introducing these taxes when motorists are paying €1.20 and €1.25 per litre for petrol and diesel.  I can buy diesel in Skibbereen for €1.12 but cannot get it for a remotely similar price on the entire journey to Dublin.  With the price of fuel increasing at an astronomical rate, it is time the Government imposed price controls on fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_1983">Recently I read an article in a newspaper about a report which concluded that domestic appliances that are more than ten years old emit more carbon dioxide than cars.  Is the Minister aware of this report?  I would support the proposed measures if they reduced carbon dioxide emissions but their purpose is to collect money.</p>
          <p eId="para_1984">County Cork covers one eighth of the territory of the State but receives the lowest rate per kilometre from the road fund grant.  This is disgraceful.  My constituency of Cork South-West has a large number of secondary roads but not one mile of national primary routes.  It receives only the crumbs which fall from the Department's table as far as road fund grants are concerned.  The Minister should stop penalising motorists because they pay enough in tax and insurance.  Fuel prices have escalated and are now exorbitant.  The Minister would better serve members of the public by controlling the price of fuel rather than imposing additional taxes on beleaguered motorists.</p>

          <p eId="para_1986">The Minister stated the "programme has also an important road safety dimension in the context of increasing road safety measures".  This statement highlights once more how out of touch the Government is, particularly given yesterday's announcement by the National Roads Authority that it is abandoning its proposal to establish rest stations along national routes.  In recent days, an unfortunate tragedy occurred when another vehicle struck the car of a family who had stopped on a national road killing an infant.  The Minister's statement indicates how out of touch he is with the agencies over which he is supposed to have responsibility.  On previous occasions, he has argued he has no responsibility for incineration.  Now, he and his colleague, the Minister for Transport, argue they have no responsibility for road safety.</p>

          <p eId="para_1987">Deputy Kieran O'Donnell referred to the Green Party as the "mudguard" of the Government.  The term "fig leaf" would be a more apt description, given that this proposal attempts to conceal the Government's intentions to squeeze more revenue out of motorists, despite the fact they contribute €5.2 billion per annum to the Exchequer.  Given the Minister's Green credentials, I would not mind if the proposal was to fund public transport and provide car parking spaces at railway stations and bus centres so that people could use alternative transport.  However, not one cent goes in that direction.  The unfortunate Minister is the decoy for the Government.  He is the victim.  He has imposed extra taxation for no reason.  I am sure if one was outside the door of the Department one would hear the officials laughing.  No disrespect to the very good officials in the Department of Finance, but they must have thought Christmas had come early when they heard of this proposal.  Santa Claus no longer comes down the chimney; he comes in with the Minister as far as the Department of Finance is concerned.  It is appalling, given the Minister's Green credentials that he did not say this would go directly towards alleviating the emissions or providing for car parking spaces or encouraging public transport in some shape or form.</p>

The other element is that many families today depend on dual incomes to make ends meet.  Both parents are forced to work and often two cars are required particularly in rural Ireland where there is no public transport.  That is the reality in my constituency.  People have to travel to get to work.  Both husband and wife, or partners, in whatever arrangement, will be doubly levied by this very punitive measure.  The Minister makes a virtue of the fact that there has been no increase over the past four years.  Where are the statistics on the intake on motor tax in each of the past four years?  I warrant that with the increased number of vehicles on our roads there has been a significant increase in the graph which has risen in terms of the intake of motor tax in each of those four years.  This is simply not an acceptable measure.  It is punitive as other Members have described it and it is most unworthy of the Minister and his party.</p>

          <p eId="para_2252">The purpose of the resolution is to keep pace with the changes in interest rates in the market over the past 12 months.  If an employer gives a loan to an employee at 2% below the market rate, this represents a benefit-in-kind and is taxed accordingly.  The purpose of the resolution is to take account of the increase in interest rates and therefore the increase in the benefit to employees during the past 12 months.  It is estimated to raise €3 million next year and €4 million in a full year.</p>

          <p eId="para_2253">It is generally felt that rates are due to fall early in the new year, yet the Minister is providing for increases from 4.5% to 5.5% for home loans, and also from 12% to 13%.  Will this be an annual measure?  Will the Minister clarify this before Fine Gael makes a decision on her position?  Fine Gael feels that if interest rates are falling, there is no need for the measure.  Second, if we are to implement the measure every year, it could become very cumbersome.  We try to oppose increases in respect of benefits-in-kind because people are being taxed enough.</p>

I understand from her that the difference between the preferential rate of interest and the market rate is deemed to be a benefit-in-kind and is therefore taxable.

It does not seem to tie in with the rate currently applicable to home loans, or that applicable to commercial loans, namely, 13%.</p>

          <p eId="para_2256">This is not a new provision; it is an adjustment that takes place annually.  We are making an adjustment in light of the increase in interest rates.  The measure does not apply to a large number of people.  Individuals with the loans in question have, over the past year, enjoyed a very beneficial rate.  We are simply taxing benefits-in-kind at the marginal rate.  Health insurance, cars or holidays provided by one's employer are regarded as benefits-in-kind.  The benefit that a preferential loan represents should be treated in the same way.  The rate is adjusted annually in light of interest rates.  The data come from the Central Bank, which provides the information on the appropriate rates.</p>

If one is on the standard rate of tax, one will pay 20% on the benefit and if one is on the higher rate of tax, one will pay 41% of it.  One will still get 59% of the benefit, or 80% of it.

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2277">The ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) were set up under the National Drugs Strategy in 2003 and their areas of operation correspond with the Health Board areas of that time. This approach was taken given the importance of the health aspects of the Strategy and the general aim of achieving coherence with regard to regional boundaries.</p>
            <p eId="para_2278">Following extensive consultation processes, each RDTF prepared a Strategic Plan and the implementation of these Plans is now progressing.  Having met with all the Local Drugs Task Forces since my appointment, I am now involved in a series of meetings with RDTFs.  Indeed, I met with the South East RDTF in Waterford last week and the North West in Sligo on Monday of this week.  While the rate of progress made has varied, I am satisfied that a real impact is now starting to be made. Expenditure trends bear this out, with approximately €7.5m being spent this year.  This will increase further in 2008 as the RDTFs progress towards the full implementation of their plans, which have a full cost of approx €14m p.a.</p>
            <p eId="para_2279">While one could decide on RDTF boundaries in many ways — for example, based on the number of problem drug users, population or geographic coverage — I feel that the current regional breakdown is operating reasonably well.  I might point out that it is open to RDTFs to organise their work in ways that best suit their needs and some have established a number of sub-committees on a geographic and/or thematic basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_2280">Meanwhile, initial steps are now being taken in my Department in the process that will lead to the development of a new National Drugs Strategy for the period 2009–2016.  This will facilitate the consideration of all aspects of the Strategy, including RDTF boundaries, if this issue is raised as part of the process.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2291">I propose to take Questions Nos. 62, 72 and 87 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2292">There is clear consensus within Comhairle na Tuaithe on a scheme for the development, enhancement and maintenance of agreed walks. In this regard, the Deputies should note that work on the framework of this scheme is progressing, in full consultation with Comhairle members. The scheme will be aimed at farmers and landowners and will be administered by Local Development Integrated Companies (formerly LEADER companies), with the assistance of the Irish Sports Council's National Trails Office and in association with local walking management committees, on behalf of my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2293">It is proposed to begin a phased implementation of the scheme early in 2008, with the aim of rolling it out to all existing National Waymarked Ways and Looped Walking Routes over the following period.  Participation in the scheme will be optional and access is granted by the permission of the landholder.  I hope to announce further details of the scheme in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p eId="para_2294">Arising from my consideration of the National Countryside Recreation Strategy, published by Comhairle na Tuaithe in September 2006, the Deputies should note that I have also taken a number of other initiatives, including the following:</p>
            <p eId="para_2295">Agreement has been reached with Fáilte Ireland for the employment of 11 Rural Recreation Officers (RROs) to promote walking tourism in areas where there are clusters of suitable, accessible walks.  The RRO will act as a contact person for walking tourists and will provide a wide range of support and advice. It is envisaged that they will be in place early next year;</p>
            <p eId="para_2296">Capital funding of the order of €1.2m has been made available by my Department to Fáilte Ireland in 2006 and during 2007 to assist in the development of the national network to a total of 50 trailheads and 75 Loops.  The funding was used to provide directional signs, marker posts, stiles, bridges, map boards and other materials; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2297">I have allocated €90,000 (€30,000 p.a. for the period 2006-2008) to Wicklow Uplands Council and Wicklow Rural Partnership to provide a network of access routes over private lands in areas of high scenic and amenity value in County Wicklow.</p>
            <p eId="para_2298">In addition, my Department is actively pursuing the possibility of using former railway infrastructure as recreational trails for walking, cycling etc. with the Department of Transport and Iarnród Éireann. Discussions are also continuing with Coillte and Bord na Móna regarding the possibility of expanding the use of their lands for recreational purposes and I will continue to progress this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2299">The issue of rural/agri tourism, in the context of the opportunities presented by the development of countryside recreation and walkways, in particular, is one, I believe, which can best be addressed by the active participation and support not just of farmers and walkers, but also the wider rural community.  Rural communities stand to benefit a great deal from the development of activity-based rural tourism, including walking tours.  I see the area of countryside recreation — and pursuits such as walking and cycling in particular — as a central plank for rural development in the future.</p>
            <p eId="para_2300">The Rural Development Programme 2007-2013 provides us with a valuable opportunity to assist with the development of this area.  The new Programme will cover key outside the farm gate measures such as diversification into non-agricultural activities, support for business creation and development, encouragement of tourism activities, basic services for the economy and rural population, village renewal and development and conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2301">Three of my priorities under the Programme will be:</p>
            <p eId="para_2302">The development of recreational tourism including the development of facilities for walking, cycling, angling, pony trekking, bird watching etc and ancillary facilities such as car parking, and other services such as signage, village renewal etc;</p>
            <p eId="para_2303">The complementary development of the broader rural tourism package such as upgraded accommodation, food tourism and other services; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2304">The development of small or regional food sectors to add significantly to the unique experience for our visitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2305">It has always been my view that a consensus approach is the way to progress countryside recreation and my Department will continue to work with the various members of Comhairle na Tuaithe to progress this important issue.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2326">Arising from the joint Ministerial initiative on the review of local and community development structures the Government agreed a series of measures in January 2004 to improve arrangements under which community and local development initiatives are delivered and to improve cohesion and focus across various measures.  This process is informed by the following guiding principles:</p>
            <p eId="para_2327">improving on the ground services</p>
            <p eId="para_2328">streamlining structures so as to avoid overlaps, duplication and undue administrative overheads</p>
            <p eId="para_2329">bringing transparency, co-ordination and improved control to the funding and operation of local and community development measures; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2330">strengthening the democratic accountability of agencies and providers in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2331">The core objective of the process is to simplify and improve local delivery of programmes operated by my Department through the integration and  alignment of local delivery structures.  The intention is that for the future there will be one local development company in any given area and fewer local development companies overall. This will provide full county coverage and eliminate overlaps and previous fragmented arrangements.</p>
            <p eId="para_2332">Following exhaustive consultations with and between the local agencies to develop the most suitable configurations of groups, Government decided on revised areas of coverage for local development companies in March of this year and clarified the arrangements in relation to the membership of the boards of these bodies in late July.  LEADER and Partnership groups have been asked to give effect to these decisions and my Department has provided detailed guidelines to secure this outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_2333">The realignment of local delivery structures will bring the overall number of local development delivery bodies to 55 comprising 38 integrated LEADER/Partnership bodies in rural areas and 17 Partnerships covering urban areas. In most cases, the Government agreed that coverage areas would be aligned with county and city boundaries with the number of structures in a county determined on the basis of population and overall geography.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2335">I have serious concerns over the safety of herbal ecstasy and other such substances.  While I know that many people believe that such products are safe because they can be bought over the counter, there are no guarantees in that regard.  Users of such substances have reported a range of adverse reactions such as vomiting, headache, palpitations, poor appetite, stomach pains/ nausea, anxiety, insomnia, mood swings, confusion, irritability and tremors.</p>
            <p eId="para_2336">The Department of Health &amp; Children has responsibility for keeping the list of scheduled substances under review on an ongoing basis.  In particular, they review any evidence that substances are being abused and are causing significant harm to public health.</p>
            <p eId="para_2337">The issue of BZP (Benzylpiperazine – a synthetic psychotropic substance),  the active ingredient of herbal ecstasy, was raised at meetings of the Inter Departmental Group on Drugs in March and September this year and I also raised the issue briefly with the Minister for Health &amp; Children at a meeting on 27 July last.  It has also been the subject of periodic discussion between officials of our two Departments over the past few months.  These discussions were in the context of EU consideration of the substance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2338">While BZP is currently not a controlled substance under Misuse of Drugs legislation, I understand that Ireland was among the countries that requested the European Council, in March 2007, to conduct a risk assessment procedure on the substance and we advocated tighter controls in this regard.</p>
            <p eId="para_2339">In this context, the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction completed its investigation in June and reported back to the Commission recommending tighter controls.  Arising from this, the Commission decided to ask the Council to place BZP under control, in accordance with the 1971 UN Convention on Psychotropic Substances.</p>
            <p eId="para_2340">The Council will decide over the coming months if BZP is to be placed under such control.  If the decision is to place BZP under control, Member States would then be required to introduce controls in line with national laws no later than one year after the Council's decision.  Responsibility for implementing any such decision rests with the Department of Health &amp; Children.</p>
            <p eId="para_2341">I can assure the Deputy that both my officials and I will continue to raise issues of concern about various drugs, with the relevant authorities, as they arise.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2344">I propose to take Questions Nos. 66 and 89 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2345">As the Deputy will be aware, the Census results with respect to the Irish language were published in October 2007.  The results were positive insofar as a total of 1,656,790 persons in the State aged 3 years of age and over indicated an ability to speak Irish, an increase of 85,896 or 5.46% on 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2346">A range of questions in relation to the Irish language are asked as part of the Census concerning issues such as place of residence, age, ethnic origin, frequency of use, level of education and so forth.</p>
            <p eId="para_2347">For the 2006 Census, a new initiative was introduced whereby the categories for frequency of speaking Irish distinguished "daily within" and "daily without" the education system.  In my view, this was a particularly important innovation, which will help give a more accurate picture in relation to the usage of Irish by the population.</p>
            <p eId="para_2348">I would accept that the level of competency of those 1.6 million people who indicated an ability to speak Irish would range from the fluency of native speakers to persons having a basic knowledge of the language.  However, I know that the Deputy will appreciate that speakers who are not fluent are very important to the preservation and development of the language.  A large part of the audience of TG4, for example, is made up of people who do not speak Irish every day.</p>
            <p eId="para_2349">I note from the Census results that 5,369 Black or Black Irish persons and 4,232 Asian or Asian Irish persons aged 3 years and above indicated an ability to speak Irish.  These included some 1,616 persons aged 20 years or over.  I have no reason to regard these figures as inaccurate, nor, in absolute terms, is there a reason to regard them as particularly remarkable.  In my view, people coming to this country, particularly those with children going to school, tend to be very open to the idea of learning not only English, but Irish as well. They often have a very open attitude towards languages and view Irish in a positive way as a path to integration in our culture.  Many of them are not only bilingual, but are multilingual, when they arrive here. Clearly, if the Irish language is to develop and prosper, it is very important that as many members of the community as possible, including those who have made Ireland their home in recent years, embrace the language.</p>
            <p eId="para_2350">Finally, and in a wider context, it is my view that we can benefit from taking account of data and statistics on minority languages in other jurisdictions.  Of relevance in this regard is the recent establishment by the British-Irish Council Minority Languages Group of a sub-group on Data, Statistics and Research, on which Ireland is represented by an official from the CSO.</p>

In this context, I recently established a Steering Committee comprising representatives from my own Department, Údarás na Gaeltachta and Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann with a view to appointing consultants to carry out a comprehensive study of the cost of living and operating a business on the islands, the results of which will inform my Department's policy in relation to the islands over the coming years.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2368">I propose to take Questions Nos. 69 and 86 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2369">Despite continuing urbanisation, Ireland is still a comparatively rural country.  About 40% of the population continue to live in rural areas and while the rates of population growth over the past decade have been greater in urban than in rural areas, population growth in the regions has still been strong.</p>
            <p eId="para_2370">The Western Development Commission (WDC) has carried out some initial analysis of the results of Census 2006 in relation to rural areas.  They found that the total population of aggregate rural areas has shown an increase of 7.5% in 2006 over 2002, while the total population of aggregate town areas has shown an increase of 8.7% in 2006.  The percentage of the total population living in aggregate rural areas remains almost unchanged at 39.3% — compared with 39.5% in 2002.</p>
            <p eId="para_2371">One of the key goals of my Department is to promote and maintain living and working populations in rural areas by helping to foster sustainable and culturally vibrant communities. Since its establishment in 2002, my Department has been vigorously pursuing policies and programmes that seek to address the changing nature of rural communities, support their development and promote better regional balance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2372">In particular, I would draw the attention of the Deputies to the following schemes and programmes operated by my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_2373">The Rural Social Scheme (RSS) provides resources to maintain and improve local amenities and facilities in rural areas. Communities benefit from the skills and talents of local farmers and fisher persons, while the participants (2,600 in total) are provided with opportunities to improve existing skills, and develop new ones, as they perform valuable work in the community.  Significantly, the RSS has allowed people to supplement their farm income and, yet, remain involved in farming.  In this way, many family farm incomes have remained viable, which I know the Deputies will appreciate, is critical for the vitality of rural communities throughout the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2374">The CLÁR Programme supports physical, economic and social infrastructure, in rural areas that have suffered a population loss, across a variety of measures.  It acts as a lever to elicit money from other sources through funding and co-funding arrangements with other Departments and agencies. Over 4,000 projects have been approved for funding in CLÁR areas from 2002 to date, many of which would not have gone ahead without CLÁR funding. In adding to the infrastructure of rural Ireland, I am sure the Deputies will agree that they have considerably improved the living conditions of rural communities.</p>
            <p eId="para_2375">For the Rural Development Programme for Ireland 2007-2013, I have secured an almost three-fold increase in funding available.  Key outside the farm gate measures will be targeted such as diversification into non-agricultural activities, support for business creation and development, encouragement of tourism activities, services for the economy and rural population, village renewal and development and conservation and upgrading of the rural heritage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2376">Furthermore, I see the area of countryside recreation and pursuits such as walking and cycling, in particular, as offering great potential for rural communities in the future.  The development of countryside recreation will be a key part of the measures to be rolled out under the new Rural Development Programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2377">I would also like to briefly mention some other programmes run by my Department which, I believe, are of relevance:</p>
            <p eId="para_2378">a new pilot night-time rural transport scheme was introduced earlier this year to target to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities – community, sporting and social – that takes place in rural areas in the evening.</p>
            <p eId="para_2379">the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme has a particular focus on supporting people and communities suffering disadvantage and exclusion through a wide spectrum of locally promoted actions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2380">Projects funded under the Community Development Programme provide a focal point for community activity within the local neighbourhoods.</p>
            <p eId="para_2381">while the Community Services Programme is not a rural initiative per se, it aims to support the economic and social regeneration of local communities and to provide employment opportunities for the unemployed or other disadvantaged persons. Over 400 projects throughout the country are being funded.</p>
            <p eId="para_2382">The work being done by the WDC is also of relevance. One of the Commission's initiatives is the ‘Look West' promotion and advertising campaign which positions the West as an appealing place to live and work.  It is aimed at people in and around the greater Dublin area who may consider moving to the West.  The key message of the initiative is the excellent quality of life available in the western counties — typically, people living in the West can enjoy shorter commuting times, lower house prices, more affordable childcare and other services and a rich and varied sporting and cultural life.</p>
            <p eId="para_2383">In addition, in the period 2002-2006, €17m was invested through the Western Investment Fund in 66 enterprises in the western region.  The Fund is managed by the WDC.</p>
            <p eId="para_2384">Looking to the future, I believe that the signs are very encouraging for rural communities. As well as providing continued funding for the programmes operated by my Department, the National Development Plan (NDP) will — within the framework of other national policies and programmes — continue to assist in the social and economic development of rural areas through measures such as rural transport, broadband, non-national roads, rural water services, broadband and agriculture.  Indeed, the Deputies should note that for the first time ever, a dedicated chapter on the development of the rural economy is included in the NDP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2385">The implementation of the National Spatial Strategy over the coming years will, I believe, also have a significant impact on the development of rural communities.</p>

            <p eId="para_2389">Under the National Drugs Strategy, ten Regional Drugs Task Forces (RDTFs) were set up in 2003 to cover all parts of the country not covered by a Local Drugs Task Force, thus achieving full coverage of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2390">Following extensive consultation processes, each RDTF prepared a Strategic Plan to respond to illicit drug use in their areas and the implementation of these Plans is now progressing, with expected expenditure of €7.5m in 2007.  Expenditure will increase further in 2008 as the RDTFs progress towards the full implementation of their Plans, which will have a full cost of approximately €14m per annum.</p>
            <p eId="para_2391">Furthermore, it is now open to RDTFs to seek capital funding under the Premises Initiative and nearly €1m has been allocated for this so far in 2007.  It is expected that allocations under this heading will increase next year.</p>
            <p eId="para_2392">The table below sets out the areas covered by each of the ten RDTFs.</p>

            <p eId="para_2410">At the outset, I wish to express my condolences to the family of Kevin Doyle on their great loss and to again send my good wishes to John Grey and his family.  I hope that he makes a full recovery.</p>
            <p eId="para_2411">Since I became Minister of State with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy, I have repeatedly warned — both in this House and elsewhere — of the dangers of illegal drug use.  In that regard, I have a particular focus on prevention – and believe that if we can avoid people starting a drug habit, we can also help to avoid the heartache, pain and expense that arises as a result.</p>
            <p eId="para_2412">While responsibility for a National Drugs Awareness Campaign rests with the Health Services Executive in the first instance, my Department is involved in developing proposals through the Advisory Group established in that regard.   The up-coming campaign will focus on cocaine.  Its primary aim will be to communicate the dangers of cocaine use, with a particular focus on so called "recreational cocaine users" in the 15-34 age group.  It will utilise appropriate media, such as social network websites, to target this age group.</p>
            <p eId="para_2413">Meanwhile, the Walk Tall (primary level) and SPHE (secondary level) Programmes continue to be the main vehicles through which drug prevention and awareness messages are disseminated in our schools. While much can be achieved under these Programmes, I have asked that the Department of Education &amp; Science to consider what might be done to sharpen the focus on senior cycle students, at second level, in regard to drugs awareness.</p>
            <p eId="para_2414">Meanwhile, a significant level of information in regard to the dangers of illicit drug use is disseminated at Local and Regional Drugs Task Force level through specific projects, drug awareness weeks and other initiatives funded by my Department.  Also, the main aim of projects funded by my Department through the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund is to attract "at risk" young people in disadvantaged areas into facilities and activities and divert them away from the dangers of substance abuse. In that context, it should be noted that, under that Fund, money is also being made available to five National youth organisations to disseminate drug prevention and awareness messages to young people —  both directly, and by upskilling personnel in these organisations.</p>

            <from>Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív)</from>
            <p eId="para_2425">At the outset, I would like to clarify for the Deputy, that while I launched the "Welcome Initiative" jointly with Minister of State, Mary Wallace T. D., on behalf of Coillte and Fáilte Ireland, my Department has no involvement in — or responsibility for — the initiative itself.  The project is funded by Fáilte Ireland (which is the responsibility of the Department of Arts, Sports and Tourism) and administered by Coillte (which is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food).</p>
            <p eId="para_2426">There are two parts to the initiative:</p>
            <p eId="para_2427">1.The new Coillte outdoors website (www.coillteoutdoors.ie) which allows anyone interested in outdoor recreation in Ireland to research and plan activities around the country.  The website provides maps and information on different types of trails which people can visit on Coillte lands, which include eleven forest parks and over 150 recreation sites throughout the country; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2428">2.The second part of the initiative sees the delivery of 250 km of walking, hiking and biking trails at 34 sites across the country. This involves the upgrading of existing trails and construction of new ones.  There will be investment in car parks, way marking and signage installed to increase public awareness of the access to the countryside that Coillte lands provide.</p>
            <p eId="para_2429">While I am not involved in the funding or administration of the programme, the Coillte initiative ties in very closely with initiatives my own Department is rolling out through Comhairle na Tuaithe.  These involve increasing access for recreational users and developing recreational facilities across the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_2430">As the single largest landowner in the State with over 440,000 ha. (1.1 million acres, circa 6% of total land area) of forest and open land and, as a member organisation of Comhairle na Tuaithe, Coillte is playing a key role in both of these areas.  I would like to acknowledge, therefore, their commitment and work to date.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Deputy Pat Carey)</from>
            <p eId="para_2435">I am aware of the dangers that crack cocaine use can pose in terms of the potential harm to individuals, families and communities.  I am also aware of the risk that crack cocaine could potentially spread to increasing numbers of cities and towns here.</p>
            <p eId="para_2436">However, I am informed by the Garda authorities that, while there has been an increase in the number of seizures of crack cocaine over the past two years or so, this represents a small proportion of the total number of cocaine seizures recorded annually.  Also, it is worth noting that in my visits to various Drugs Task Force areas since my appointment in June, the issue of crack cocaine did not arise to any great extent in my discussions with community representatives and others on the nature of the drug problem in their areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2437">At the same time, vigilance is undoubtedly necessary and the Gardaí continue to take a number of measures to address the matter.  In this context, I understand that the Garda National Drugs Unit, as well as local drug units, conduct intelligence gathering on individuals and groups suspected of involvement in the sale and distribution of drugs.  Also, targeted patrolling by uniform and plain-clothes personnel of potential problem areas is undertaken in order to detect and disrupt persons involved in such activity.</p>
            <p eId="para_2438">The 2002/2003 All-Island Drug Prevalence Survey showed that the use of crack cocaine was very low at that time.  However, a second Drug Prevalence Study has recently been carried out and the first report on national prevalence figures and trends is expected in January.  The outcome of this study will give an up-to-date picture of overall problem drug use in Ireland, including figures for crack cocaine use.</p>
            <p eId="para_2439">Also, I understand that a research study into the nature and extent of crack cocaine use in Dublin is currently being undertaken by the Alcohol and Drug Research Unit (ADRU) of the Health Research Board. The study is being funded by the Department of Justice, Equality &amp; Law Reform and it is hoped that the work will be completed in Spring 2008.</p>

            <p eId="para_2443">I propose to take Questions Nos. 79, 187 and 197 together.</p>
            <p eId="para_2444">As the Deputies are aware, in many rural areas, there are no public transport services at night.  While there are, in the more developed rural areas, either hackney or taxi services, these are at the discretion of the providers of these services and do not provide a guaranteed service to rural people.</p>
            <p eId="para_2445">It was against this background, therefore, that earlier this year — following a number of discussions between officials in my Department and the Department of Transport — I introduced a new evening transport service, on a pilot basis. The aim of the service is to allow rural people to fully participate in the various activities — community, sporting and social — that take place in their areas.  The new Scheme also aims to address the market failure that currently exists in this area.</p>
            <p eId="para_2446">The 34 groups currently delivering the Rural Transport Programme — operated by the Department of Transport — were invited by Pobal to submit applications to be considered under my Department's new scheme.  Following the appraisal of the proposals submitted, seven groups were selected to run the pilot Scheme, namely:</p>
            <p eId="para_2447">West Cork Rural Transport;</p>
            <p eId="para_2448">Avondhu Development Group in East Cork;</p>
            <p eId="para_2449">Meath Accessible/Kilnaleck Community Cavan;</p>
            <p eId="para_2450">County Sligo LEADER Partnership;</p>
            <p eId="para_2451">Tumna Shannon Development Company Roscommon;</p>
            <p eId="para_2452">Síob Teoranta Donegal; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2453">Laois Trip.</p>
            <p eId="para_2454">The seven projects were selected having regard to such criteria as:</p>
            <p eId="para_2455">evidence of need;</p>
            <p eId="para_2456">strength of their proposal;</p>
            <p eId="para_2457">capacity of the group;</p>
            <p eId="para_2458">value for money; and</p>
            <p eId="para_2459">geographical spread.</p>
            <p eId="para_2460">The budget for the pilot is €500,000.  The first service commenced in June and service numbers and passenger numbers have increased throughout the Autumn.  Although only in the early stages yet, I understand that the services are being very well received by communities and passengers alike.  In this context, the Deputies should note that during the month of October, there were 154 services with 1,341 passenger journeys.</p>
            <p eId="para_2461">Early indications are that older people, people with a disability and young people are particularly enthusiastic about the new services and new activities are being planned around the availability of services.</p>
            <p eId="para_2462">All services focus on maximising the general community good and I am, of course, conscious of the need to ensure that no displacement takes place of commercially viable existing services as a result of the introduction of the new scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2463">My intention is that the pilot Scheme will be reviewed after a year and decisions in relation to its future will be informed by the outcome of the evaluation.</p>

            <p eId="para_2479">Mar is eol don Teachta, bíonn iarrachtaí leanúnacha ar siúl ag Údarás na Gaeltachta chun deiseanna fostaíochta a chruthú i ngach ceantar Gaeltachta, na hoileáin Ghaeltachta amach ó chósta Dhún na nGall ina measc.</p>
            <p eId="para_2480">Cuireann an tÚdarás deontais reáchtála bliantúla ar fáil le struchtúr forbartha pobail a chinntiú d'Árainn Mhór agus Toraigh agus do Chomharchumann an nOileán Beag Teoranta (Ancaire), eagraíocht forbartha riaracháin do na hoileáin bheaga amach ó chósta Dhún na nGall.  Ar ndóigh, cuidíonn gníomhaíochtaí na gcomharchumann le forbairtí eile a chur chun cinn sna hoileáin.</p>

            <p eId="para_2482">Anuas ar sin, le blianta beaga anuas tá airgead suntasach caite ag mo Roinn ar fhorbairt na gcéanna farantóireachta a fhreastalaíonn ar Árainn Mhór agus Toraigh agus ar na seirbhísí iompair chuig an dá oileán sin, chur chuige a chabhraíonn go díreach agus go hindíreach le fostaíocht a chruthú ar na hoileáin.</p>

            <p eId="para_2487">I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 351 of 20 Samhain 2007 in relation to this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_2488">As I outlined in that reply, funding has been provided by my Department under the Fo-Chiste Gnó of Ciste na Gaeilge to voluntary and business groups to assist in promoting the Irish language among local business communities. In order to qualify for funding, a group must provide a business plan to include specific targets relating to the promotion of Irish and a clear exposition as to how these targets will be met.  Funding from my Department is provided on the basis that matching funding (to a minimum of 25%) is secured by the applicant from the local authority or from the local business community.</p>
            <p eId="para_2489">Four applications for funding to erect Christmas lights in Irish have been received to date this year. Funding has been approved in respect of two of these applications to date — Gaillimh le Gaeilge (€57,750) and Cumann Tráchtála Chlár Chlainne Mhuiris (€45,000). My Department is currently considering the remaining two applications. I should also say that funding of €11,331 was paid to the Dublin City Centre Business Association in 2006 for this purpose.</p>
            <p eId="para_2490">Finally, while the Fo-Chiste Gnó is open to new applications, I should again reiterate that funding is limited and it may not be possible to meet all requests made.</p>

            <p eId="para_2492">Mar a thug mé le fios mar fhreagra ar Cheisteanna sa Teach seo cheana, d'iarr mé ar Bhord Fhoras na Gaeilge moltaí sonracha a dhéanamh maidir leis na céimeanna a bheadh riachtanach chun poist a lonnú i nGaoth Dobhair, chomh maith leis na rannóga agus na feidhmeanna a bheadh i gceist. Ina dhiaidh sin, tíolacadh aighneacht do mo Roinn féin agus don Roinn Cultúir, Ealaíon agus Fóillíochta sa Tuaisceart maidir le postanna a líonadh i réimsí éagsúla san eagraíocht. Leasaíodh an aighneacht — ina bhfuil poist ar leith luaite le Gaoth Dobhair — mar thoradh ar chomhráití idir an Foras agus an dá Roinn urraíochta.</p>
            <p eId="para_2493">Ag cruinniú den Chomhairle Aireachta Thuaidh/Theas (Formáid Teanga), a tionóladh in Iúr Cinn Trá ar 26 Deireadh Fómhair 2007, aontaíodh go mbunófaí grúpa oibre ar a mbeadh ionadaithe ó Fhoras na Gaeilge agus ó na Ranna urraíochta chun scrúdú a dhéanamh ar an aighneacht ina hiomláine, na poist atá le lonnú i nGaoth Dobhair san áireamh, agus go háirithe chun cáinníochtú a dhéanamh ar na himpleachtaí airgeadais don bhliain 2008 agus sa todhchaí.</p>
            <p eId="para_2494">Tugadh treoir don ghrúpa oibre na heochair-phostanna san aighneacht — postanna le haghaidh Ghaoth Dobhair san áireamh — a aithint mar ábhar práinne agus cead a lorg ó na Ranna Airgeadais thuaidh agus theas chun an méid a d'fhéadfaí de na poist sin a líonadh gan an buiséad reatha a shárú. Tá an próiseas sin á chur chun cinn i láthair na huaire. Mar chuid den scrúdú, aithníodh cúig phost a d'fhéadfaí a líonadh mar chéad chéim den dílárú go Gaoth Dobhair. Tá súil agam go mbeifear in ann na poist sin a cheadú go luath agus go líonfar iad i 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_2495">Ní miste a lua freisin go bhfuil comhráití ar bun ag mo Roinn féin le hÚdarás na Gaeltachta maidir le cóiríocht oifige i bPáirc Ghnó Ghaoth Dobhair a d'fhéadfadh a bheith fóirsteanach do riachtanais an Fhorais chomh maith.</p>

            <p eId="para_2506">When they were first established, the fourteen Local Drugs Task Forces (LDTFs) were charged with assessing the nature and extent of the illicit drug problems in their areas of operation and with developing action plans for a co-ordinated response to those problems.  Following extensive consultation, such plans were produced for all LDTF areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_2507">Specific projects to deliver on the priorities identified in the action plans were proposed through the LDTFs to the National Drugs Strategy Team (NDST) for consideration. Proposals were subsequently approved, if considered appropriate, by the then Minister with responsibility for the National Drugs Strategy and signed off by the Cabinet Committee on Social Inclusion.</p>
            <p eId="para_2508">In this context, the Deputy should note that the LDTFs oversee and monitor the implementation of the approved projects.  The NDST, in turn, oversees and monitors the on-going work of the LDTFs and provides regular updates to the Interdepartmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.</p>
            <p eId="para_2509">In 2005, an Emerging Needs Fund was established to provide funding to LDTFs to enable them to respond in a flexible way to emerging drugs issues in their areas.  Applications, endorsed by the Task Forces, were submitted to the NDST for consideration and, thereafter, for recommendation to the Minister who made the final decisions.  A total of 67 projects were approved under this Fund at a cost of €4m.</p>
            <p eId="para_2510">LDTFs also allocate small amounts of once-off funding to community-based projects under a "Small Grants Scheme".   Initiatives involved include summer projects, local drug awareness campaigns and prevention and education programmes.  The Task Forces make the final decisions on the applications for funding under this scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_2511">As regards capital, project promoters can apply for funding under the Premises Initiative.  This is done through the relevant LDTF, and then on to the NDST, with the final approval being a matter for myself, as the Minister responsible for the Drugs Strategy.</p>

            <p eId="para_2549">Other than confidential waste, the weight of general and recyclable waste generated by my Department is not recorded.  Since there are different methods of disposing of waste it is not possible to quantify recycled waste as a percentage of all waste.

For the calendar year 2005 and for the first six months of 2006 this consisted of four 1100 litre bins collected five times per week.

            <p eId="para_2584">The NCIP came into effect from 1 January 2006, with an allocation of €575 million for the 5 year period of 2006 to 2010, some €357 million is earmarked for capital investment.  The NCIP is a key element of the National Childcare Strategy 2006-2010, the aim of which is to deliver a more comprehensive approach to early years care and education.  The NCIP is designed to deliver 50,000 additional childcare places, with a greater focus on pre-school places for 3 to 4 year olds and school age childcare.  Childcare places are provided either through community based/not for profit childcare groups or by private providers.  Capital grant applications under the NCIP are assessed under a number of criteria; chiefly the nature and extent of the need locally for the service proposed, the applicant's capacity to deliver the project proposed and value for money.  All proposals are expected to demonstrate how they will increase the supply of quality childcare, and furthermore, community projects are expected to have a focus on disadvantage.</p>
            <p eId="para_2585">Following a review of the operation of the EOCP, revised Guidelines for the assessment of NCIP capital grant applications were introduced in April this year.  One strand of the Programme focuses on private providers, with a maximum capital grant of €100,000 per facility (subject to a maximum of 75% of the total cost).  There is also a maximum of €1.2 million available per facility for community based/not for profit providers.  The new Guidelines improved the maximum grant aid per childcare place for community projects, from a benchmark of €20,000 under the EOCP to €24,000 under the NCIP.</p>

            <p eId="para_2591">The Hepatitis C Compensation Tribunal (Amendment) Act  2006 provides for a scheme to allow persons infected with Hepatitis C and HIV, through the administration within the State of blood and blood products, to purchase mortgage protection and life assurance.  The scheme is administered by the Health Service Executive (HSE).</p>
            <p eId="para_2592">Regulations made under the Act require that the Administrator must "determine the eligibility of Claimants and to advise them accordingly" and also "determine procedures to be adopted in the operation, administration and supervision of the Scheme."</p>
            <p eId="para_2593">In respect of a small number of claimants who are requesting life assurance cover in excess of €420,000, the four support groups (Transfusion Positive, Positive Action, the Irish Kidney Association and the Irish Haemophilia Society) do not agree with the procedures adopted by the HSE. I understand that, in setting its procedures, the HSE has been guided by expert legal and financial advice.</p>
            <p eId="para_2594">Every effort is being made by the HSE to resolve the matter in a manner which is satisfactory to the groups, but which also meets appropriate accountability standards.  The HSE informed my officials yesterday that the first proposal for the maximum sum of €525,000 had been approved.  To date, 54 proposals totalling over €12 million have been approved and sent to the insurance company which is participating in the scheme.</p>

            <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Finance (Deputy Brian Cowen)</from>
            <p eId="para_2598">Last June I approved National Quality Assurance Standards for Symptomatic Breast Disease Services under the Health Act 2007.  The aim of the Standards is to ensure that every woman in Ireland who develops breast cancer has an equal opportunity to be managed in a centre which is capable of delivering the best possible outcome.  Based on the Standards, and the fact that the BreastCheck screening programme will reduce significantly the number of symptomatic breast cancer presentations, the Health Service Executive (HSE) determined that we require a total of eight specialist breast cancer centres nationally.</p>
            <p eId="para_2599">In order to comply with the Standards, the HSE has directed a number of hospitals with very low case volumes to cease breast cancer services.  The National Hospitals Office has already planned the redirection of this symptomatic caseload.  Further staged reductions in the number of hospitals providing breast cancer services will occur over the next two years in line with the development of quality assured capacity in the eight designated centres. The Standards were mandated by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA).  HIQA is planning to roll out a review of breast disease services shortly and as part of this will be reviewing the eight designated centres against the Standards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2600">The HSE is conducting a fundamental review of how transport services are provided which will take into account the decisions made in relation to the designation of cancer centres.  The HSE is also putting in place a structured programme of quality assurance, support and information services to underpin the re-organisation of services so as to ensure that cancer patients will receive quality services as close to home as possible.</p>
            <p eId="para_2601">To ensure that we improve our planning and evaluation of cancer needs, my Department has asked the HSE to prepare a robust needs assessment for cancer control for the period to 2012 to reflect priorities in cancer control, equitable distribution and priority setting that maximises efficiency and reduces dependency on hospital in-patient care.  Prof. Keane, National Cancer Control Director, and the HSE have emphasised the importance of mobilising existing resources and redirecting them to achieve the National Cancer Control Programme objectives.  I understand that the HSE is putting arrangements in place to enable Prof. Keane to take control of all new cancer developments from 1 January 2008 and progressively all existing cancer services and related funding and staffing.  An additional €20.5m was allocated to the HSE this year for cancer control.  Further investment in cancer control will be based on the reform programme now being implemented by the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_2641">At present, medical cards are granted primarily on the basis of means and individual circumstances.  Under the Health Act, 2004, determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the Health Service Executive.  Persons aged seventy years and over are automatically entitled to a medical card, irrespective of means.  The HSE has discretion, in cases of exceptional need, to provide assistance to individuals where undue hardship would otherwise be caused.</p>
            <p eId="para_2642">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services. In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on lower incomes who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.  In June 2006 I agreed with the HSE to raise the assessment guidelines for GP visit cards and these are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.  For Medical Card and GP Visit Card applications, the HSE now considers an applicant's income after tax and PRSI are deducted, rather than total income.  Allowances are also made for expenses on childcare, rent and mortgage costs and the cost of travel to work.</p>
            <p eId="para_2643">I have no plans to provide for the granting of medical cards to any particular group as a whole.  However, my Department is currently reviewing all legislation relating to eligibility for health and personal social services with a view to making the system as fair and transparent as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_2652">Visiting patients in hospital is an integral part of every day health service life and is something that can be beneficial to the patients, their families and friends.  However, the growing threat of hospital infections, from MRSA or vomiting bugs, has necessitated the drawing up of more restrictive visiting guidelines.</p>
            <p eId="para_2653">It is difficult to find evidence of the clinical effectiveness of any single strategy such as imposing visiting restrictions on the prevention and control of healthcare associated infections as most programmes implement a number of interventions simultaneously.  Other interventions such as surveillance, good hand hygiene, antibiotic stewardship programmes, isolation or cohorting of patients with infections play a greater role in prevention than do visiting restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2654">It is further recognised that members of the public have a role to play in preventing healthcare associated infection.  Visitors may be sources of infection.  Visitors are encouraged to use the alcohol hand rub when entering and leaving the clinical areas.  Certain areas require stricter controls because of the greater hazards from infection such as burn or intensive care units.</p>
            <p eId="para_2655">The HSE issued National Visiting Guidance to hospitals in September 2006.  The Guidance reflects a balance between the needs of patients, their visitors, hospital staff and hospital procedures.  The guidelines state that the welfare of the patient must always be taken into consideration.  The need for privacy and the potential for the spread of infection means that continuous visiting hours are not in the patients' interests.</p>
            <p eId="para_2656">More rigorous restrictions may be introduced in the event of an outbreak of infectious disease as occurred in relation to norovirus (winter vomiting) outbreaks in recent years.  The Health Protection Surveillance Centre has produced the National Guidelines on the Management of Norovirus Infection in Healthcare Settings for such a situation.  These guidelines state that during an outbreak of the winter vomiting bug all visiting should be minimised, children (where possible) should not visit and visitors with a history of vomiting or diarrhoea at home should not visit until at least 48 hours after their last episode.</p>

            <p eId="para_2688">The consensus of scientific opinion to date regarding possible adverse health effects from electromagnetic fields (EMF) exposure is that there is no evidence of a causal relationship between such exposure and ill health.  The World Health Organisation (WHO) has assessed the many reviews carried out in this area and has indicated that exposures below the limits recommended by the International Commission on Non-Ionising Radiation Protection (ICNIRP) in their 1998 Guidelines do not produce any known adverse health effects.  These guidelines are based on a careful analysis of all peer-reviewed scientific literature and include thermal and non-thermal effects.</p>
            <p eId="para_2689">In 1999, the European Community introduced recommendations on the limitation of exposure of the general public to electromagnetic fields, based on the ICNIRP guidelines.  Ireland complies with these recommendations.  The Commission for Communication Regulations (ComReg) monitors compliance with regard to telecommunication masts.</p>
            <p eId="para_2690">Research is ongoing in relation to this issue and my Department will continue to monitor developments concerning the possible health effects of exposure to electromagnetic fields.</p>

            <p eId="para_2693">Medical cards are made available to persons and their dependants who would otherwise experience undue hardship in meeting the cost of General Practitioner (GP) services.  In 2005 the GP visit card was introduced as a graduated benefit so that people on moderate and lower incomes, particularly parents of young children, who do not qualify for a medical card would not be deterred on cost grounds from visiting their GP.</p>
            <p eId="para_2694">Since the beginning of 2005 substantial changes have been made to the way in which people's eligibility for a medical card is assessed and these apply equally to the assessment process for a GP visit card.  The income guidelines have been increased by a cumulative 29% and in addition allowance is now made for reasonable expenses incurred in respect of mortgage/rent, child care and travel to work costs.  In June 2006 I agreed a further adjustment to the income guidelines for GP visit cards.  These are now 50% higher than those in respect of medical cards.</p>
            <p eId="para_2695">As the Health Service Executive has the operational and funding responsibility for these benefits, it is the appropriate body to consider the particular case raised by the Deputy.  My Department has therefore requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to address this matter and to have a reply issued directly to the Deputy.</p>

Motor insurance is provided in an open and competitive market where both youth and consumer interests can exert their influence by seeking several quotes and comparing costs, before purchasing.

            <p eId="para_2744">Limerick/Shannon is identified as a Gateway in the National Spatial Strategy, and Shannon Airport has a vital role to play in sustaining and developing the region.  My Department has long recognised the importance of improving access to Shannon.</p>
            <p eId="para_2745">Access to Shannon Airport is by road, with a direct spur to the N18 Limerick–Galway road.  The N18 is currently being upgraded to give a dual carriageway link throughout. Other roads which serve the Shannon/Limerick region are the N7 Limerick–Nenagh, N20 Limerick-Cork and the N21 Adare–Limerick, and significant upgrade works are underway on these roads.  Phase 1 of the Ennis Bypass was officially opened last January and Phase 2 is due to be completed within the next couple of months.  Shannon Airport will also benefit from the major works planned on the Atlantic Road Corridor.</p>
            <p eId="para_2746">A new tunnel under the Shannon at Limerick will open in 2010, which will considerably relieve traffic congestion in the region.  Approximately €2 billion has been committed in total to road projects in the Shannon region which are already in construction or at an advanced stage in planning.  Limerick County Council has this year completed a section of bus lane on the Ennis Road, with funding from my Department.  Progress in developing Green Routes in the City Council area has been slower than planned because of local concerns.</p>
            <p eId="para_2747">Bus Services to Shannon have been increased, with all Bus Éireann services on the Cork-Limerick-Galway route now stopping at the airport.  There are direct services linking the airport to Limerick and Ennis, with the possibility of linking from there to other services.  I have also this year ended restrictions on Bus Éireann services, which had meant that some services were permitted to set down only but not pick up passengers at the airport.  In addition my Department has granted licences to private bus operators in respect of services connecting Shannon Airport to Galway and Dublin Airport.</p>

            <p eId="para_2749">From 30 March next year, the U.S. transatlantic aviation market will be fully liberalised.  From that date U.S. and European airlines will be free to develop and operate transatlantic services on a fully commercial basis, without national restrictions.</p>
            <p eId="para_2750">Experience has shown that the liberalisation of aviation markets results in a greater level of competition among airlines, lower fares and the development of a wider range of services.  I understand that several studies have projected that the Open Skies agreement will lead to considerable economic benefits for Ireland and in particular for the business and tourism sectors, and for the air transport industry in general for which new possibilities will open up.</p>
            <p eId="para_2751">I understand that Shannon Airport is making every commercial effort to ensure that year-round transatlantic services are maintained.  I should add that currently three transatlantic carriers are committed to operating transatlantic services, two of which are year round.</p>
            <p eId="para_2752">I am confident that the Shannon Airport Authority, with the continued support of business and tourism interests in the region, will respond to the challenges and opportunities presented by Open Skies.</p>
            <p eId="para_2753">The new direct gateway services by Aer Lingus from Washington, San Francisco and Orlando, and the potential for additional services by other carriers, provide the opportunity to substantially increase U.S. traffic to Ireland.  Traditional travel patterns and the attractiveness of the tourism product in the West, suggest that over 50% of such incremental business will involve visits to Ireland's Western regions.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Deputy Billy Kelleher)</from>
            <p eId="para_2923">P.S.K. Construction Ltd (PSK) went into voluntary liquidation on 16 March 2006 and Mr Tom Kavanagh of Kavanagh Fennell was appointed liquidator.  Claims for arrears of wages, holiday pay and minimum notice under the Insolvency Payments Scheme were received on behalf of one hundred and forty-six employees from the liquidator during May and June 2006.  (In addition, twenty-two claims were received for redundancy lump sum payments).</p>
            <p eId="para_2924">In the course of processing the claims, as the apparent circumstances of the insolvency gave rise to a doubt as to whether these were debts that should be paid under the Insolvency Payments Scheme, the question was referred to the Employment Appeals Tribunal in June 2006 under Section 9(3) of the Protection of Employees (Employers' Insolvency) Act 1984 for a decision in the matter.  The issue concerned the question of whether a transfer of undertakings under the European Communities (Protection of Employees on Transfer of Undertakings) Regulations 2003 might have taken place between P.S.K. Construction Ltd (PSK) and P.L.K. Plant &amp; Equipment Hire Ltd (PLK) — the employees' new employer.</p>
            <p eId="para_2925">The Tribunal's decision of 24 October 2007 is that the employee claims are not allowable as there was a transfer of undertakings from PSK to PLK.  The liability for the employees' unpaid entitlements therefore transferred to PLK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2926">The Department wrote to the liquidator formally refusing the claims and advising that the employees pursue their claims against PLK.</p>
            <p eId="para_2927">Payment of Statutory Redundancy is a matter in the first instance for the employer.  In this case, the Employment Appeals Tribunal found that there was a transfer of undertakings from PSK to PLK and, accordingly, any statutory redundancy payments are the responsibility of PLK, and the liquidator has been so informed.</p>

            <p eId="para_2990">Supporting and recognising carers in our society is, and has been, a priority of the Government since 1997. Over that period, weekly payment rates to carers have greatly increased, qualifying conditions for carer's allowance have significantly eased, coverage of the scheme has been extended and new schemes such as carer's benefit and the respite care grant have been introduced and extended.</p>
            <p eId="para_2991">Carer's allowance, in line with other social assistance schemes, is means tested.  This ensures scarce resources are directed at those in greatest need.    The primary objective of the carer's allowance is to provide income support to low income carers.</p>
            <p eId="para_2992">The carer's allowance means test is one of the more flexible tests in terms of the assessment of household incomes.  The means test has been significantly eased over the years, most notably with regard to spouse's earnings.  Budget 2007 provided for an income disregard for a couple of €640 per week.  This ensures a couple can earn in the region of €36,000 per annum and still receive the maximum rate of carer's allowance and the associated free travel and household benefits.  This measure surpasses the Towards 2016 commitment to ensure those on average industrial earnings continue to qualify for a full carer's allowance.</p>
            <p eId="para_2993">As with other social assistance payments, in calculating a person's means account is taken of the weekly value of property belonging to the person, where such property is not being used or enjoyed by the person or is not a farm of land leased by him or her.</p>
            <p eId="para_2994">The value of such property is calculated as follows:</p>
            <p eId="para_2995">The first €20,000 of the capital value is excluded</p>
            <p eId="para_2996">The weekly value of capital of between €20,000 and €30,000 is assessed at €1 per €1,000</p>
            <p eId="para_2997">The weekly value of capital of between €30,000 and €40,000 is assessed at €3 per €1,000</p>
            <p eId="para_2998">The weekly value of capital of over €40,000 is assessed at €4 per €1,000</p>
            <p eId="para_2999">Carer's benefit, eligibility for which is based on social insurance contributions, is available as an alternative to carer's allowance for people who are providing someone with full time care and attention but who do not qualify for carer's allowance due to the level of their means.</p>
            <p eId="para_3000">In June 2005, the respite care grant was extended to all people providing full time care and attention regardless of their means or social insurance contributions.  Since then, the grant has also been paid in respect of each care recipient.  Budget 2007 increased the level of the grant by €300 from €1,200 to €1,500 per year in respect of each care recipient.</p>
            <p eId="para_3001">I will keep the supports for carers available from my Department under review in order to continue to improve the schemes and ensure commitments on income support are delivered.</p>

The only exceptions to this decision are a postgraduate course leading to a Higher Diploma (H.Dip) qualification in any discipline or a Post Graduate diploma in Education (Primary). Other types of postgraduate qualifications including a PhD are not recognised for participation in the scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3005">It is important to ensure that supports are directed at those with the most pressing needs and that limited resources continue to be aimed at those who are most marginalised and who are most distant from the labour market.

            <p eId="para_3045">The bulk of the money disbursed by my Department for LDTF projects is channelled through a number of statutory bodies, including Departments, Agencies and Local Authorities.  These bodies act as "channels of funding" for the various projects, depending on the nature of the work being undertaken, and they direct the funding as approved by my Department to the individual projects.</p>
            <p eId="para_3046">The "channels of funding" are aware of their obligations in relation to public financial procedures and, indeed, personnel in my Department remind them of these responsibilities periodically.  Payments to the statutory bodies are made on receipt of applications outlining the funding required on a project basis.  It is usual for payments to be made on a staged basis, with at least two payments per year.  Individual projects are financially accountable to the State Agency through which its funding is channelled.</p>
            <p eId="para_3047">In this context, the Deputy should also note that the Local Drugs Task Forces Handbook sets out the responsibilities of the various parties involved.  In particular, the Handbook outlines the responsibility of:</p>
            <p eId="para_3048">The Task Forces to oversee and monitor the implementation of approved projects; and</p>
            <p eId="para_3049">The project promoter to satisfy the LDTF that appropriate management and personnel arrangements are in place and that they comply with the processes of the State Agency through which funding is being channelled.</p>
            <p eId="para_3050">The representatives of the statutory bodies on each LDTF also have a responsibility to monitor the situation in relation to projects being funded through their Departments or Agencies and to ensure that any emerging problems are highlighted at LDTF level.  The capacity of the LDTFs to provide supports to projects has been greatly enhanced since the approval of a package of operational supports (administrative and development workers) for each Task Force in 2005.  Finally, the Deputy should note that the National Drugs Strategy Team has responsibility for overseeing and monitoring the ongoing work of the LDTFs and it provides regular updates to the Interdepartmental Group on Drugs, which I chair.</p>

            <p eId="para_3205">The majority of current expenditure allocated to community based groups through my Department for drugs initiatives is channelled through the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces and the Young People's Facilities and Services Fund.  The combined current expenditure under these headings this year will exceed €40m, a substantial increase on the amount spent in 2006.  A further €8m is being provided for capital projects.  Approximately 350 LDTF projects, including those under the Emerging Needs Fund, are receiving interim funding from my Department this year, with a further 90 approximately operating in RDTF areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3206">With regard to Co. Kildare, an allocation of €203,000 has been made to the Community Drug Team for Kildare and West Wicklow following an application from the South West RDTF and this funding will continue next year.  Some of the other funding provided to that Drugs Task Force also provides benefit broadly across their region of operation, including Co. Kildare.  On top of this, a sum in the region of €170,000 has been made available to Teen Challenge, a rehabilitation project at Shechem House, Richardstown, Co. Kildare, arising from applications through the South Inner City LDTF in Dublin.</p>
            <p eId="para_3207">Meanwhile, as regards capital funding, €22,354 was approved to Newbridge Family Resource Centre in June 2007 under the Premises Initiative.  This is in respect of the purchase and installation of a semi-permanent structure for the Centre to provide a dedicated drop-in facility for "at risk" youth.</p>

            <p eId="para_3275">The RAPID Programme operates in 46 designated disadvantaged urban areas and the CLÁR Programme is available across 23 counties that have suffered significant levels of depopulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_3276">As I have indicated to the House on a number of occasions, it is a matter for individual Departments to report progress under the RAPID programme.  In support, Pobal collects data from each RAPID area in respect of funding allocations received by projects from Government Departments and local state agencies.  The latest data in respect of the programme is available on Pobal's website under the RAPID section (http://www.pobal.ie/live/RAPID). The Deputy may find it helpful to access this information. I understand that full data in respect of the year 2007 will not be collected until early 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3277">I initiated the leverage schemes in 2004 in order to support small-scale projects identified locally by the Area Implementation Teams in each of the RAPID areas.  These schemes are co-funded by the relevant agencies and fund projects that focus on estate enhancement, graffiti removal, traffic calming, CCTV, health and sports facilities, and the provision of playgrounds.  Earlier this year I agreed to co-fund the provision of facilities in schools located in, or mainly servicing children from, RAPID areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3278">Expenditure to date in 2007 on the RAPID Leverage schemes is some €3million in Leinster and on the CLÁR programme is some €1.1 million.  The level of funding for CLÁR and RAPID Leverage Schemes in 2008 will be dealt with in the context of the Budget.</p>

            <p eId="para_3280">The National Spatial Strategy (NSS) addresses many of my concerns on issues such as rural housing. The rural settlement policy framework contained in the NSS, which represents overall Government policy on rural housing, aims to sustain and renew established rural communities while strengthening the structure of villages and smaller settlements to support local economies. In this way it seeks to ensure key assets in rural areas are protected to support quality of life and that rural settlement policies are responsive to the local circumstances of different areas.</p>
            <p eId="para_3281">The guidelines for planning authorities on sustainable rural housing published by Dick Roche T.D., former Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, provide a detailed framework for planners, based on the approach set out in the NSS regarding rural housing policy. The guidelines reflect my own view that rural housing within the confines of good planning practice is appropriate. These guidelines are important in ensuring clarity and consistency in the implementation by planning authorities of Government policy on rural housing.</p>

            <p eId="para_3308">The escalation of fuel costs, as a result of global economic and political conditions, remains a matter of concern for all sectors of industry.</p>
            <p eId="para_3309">It is important to note that the fishing industry in Ireland already receives favourable treatment in the form of a full rebate on excise and VAT on marine fuel, if the enterprise concerned is registered for VAT.</p>
            <p eId="para_3310">Fuel subsidies, in terms of operating aid for fishing vessels, are not permitted under EU State Aid rules and any such measures introduced by EU Member States would be in breach of EU law and subject to Infringement proceedings in the European Court of Justice.</p>
            <p eId="para_3311">I believe that the most critical element in addressing the impact of high fuel prices is to make the fleet more profitable.  The planned reduction in the size of the fishing fleet, through a decommissioning scheme which I intend to launch shortly, will increase the profitability of the vessels that continue to fish because they will be permitted to land higher quantities of quota stocks.</p>
            <p eId="para_3312">I also consider that considerable research activity is required in order to identify the most fuel efficient equipment and practices and I will be pushing strongly for this area to be prioritised under the EU's Seventh Framework Programme for Research (2007-2013).  At present, Bord Iascaigh Mhara is making grant aid available to improve fuel efficiency on board fishing vessels.  I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it covers best practice in the context of available research in the area.</p>

However, where the holding of an applicant is identified as potentially not meeting this minimum stocking density requirement, the applicant is invited to submit evidence of satisfactory stocking i.e. Flock Register, Horse Passports.

In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance.  Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school.  School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies.

            <p eId="para_3346">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007.  This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area.  The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3347">The reasons for non attendance are many and complex and included parents who failed to enrol their child in a school or to ensure that their child attended school regularly. I have been advised by the NEWB that legal action for non attendance at school is only taken when all other steps have failed and following consultation with the school and other services.  Court action must ultimately be in the best interests of the child.  A School Attendance Notice (SAN) is the first step in enforcing the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3348">The first legal notices, School Attendance Notices, under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 were issued in 2005.  A total of 36 SANs were issued in 2005.  In 2006, 196 School Attendance Notices in respect of 137 children were issued by Educational Welfare Officers to parents of children who are not attending school regularly.  To date in 2007, 204 SANs have been issued in relation to 146 children.</p>
            <p eId="para_3349">When a school attendance notice is issued, the situation is monitored and the parent is given every opportunity to address the underlying issues.  Occasionally, the involvement of other services with the family may be sufficient to bring about change, in exceptional cases, where there is no change and the child remains out of school, the Board will consider taking a prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3350">Where legal proceedings are served on a family, the cases are heard in the local District Court.  The first cases for non attendance at school under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 were heard in 2006.  During 2006, 34 legal proceedings were initiated against the parents of 17 children with the following outcomes: (one set of parents were prosecuted twice); 5 sets of parents (10 in total) of 5 children were fined; and 9 cases (relating to 5 children) currently stand adjourned. Proceedings against 13 parents (relating to 6 children) were withdrawn following enrolment of the children in school or an improvement in attendance.  Proceedings against one set of parents was withdrawn as the family no longer reside in the State.  12 children were back in school at the end of 2006 because legal action was taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3351">Seven cases involving 12 parents were brought forward into 2007, of these seven cases, 5 were struck out.  In the case of the other two brought forward into 2007, one parent was fined and the child is back in school, the other case is still ongoing and again the child is back in school.  In relation to new summons issued in 2007, up to the end of October 2007, 41 summons have been issued against the parents of 28 children. The outcomes of these prosecutions is currently being analysed and a report for 2007 will be available shortly.</p>

            <from>Minister for Education and Science (Deputy Mary Hanafin)</from>
            <p eId="para_3355">All primary and post primary schools have access to psychological assessments either directly through my Department's National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA) that is administered by NEPS and full details of which are available on my Department's website.</p>
            <p eId="para_3356">NEPS does not keep waiting lists for assessments of children but in common with other psychological services encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist.  Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment.  This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually.</p>
            <p eId="para_3357">With the introduction of the General Allocation Model to primary schools in 2005, schools have an allocation of additional teaching time in order to assess and intervene where necessary with pupils with reading difficulties and/or dyslexia without the need for a psychological educational assessment.  In cases where a pupil continues to present with significant difficulties after a number of interventions and reviews, the principal of the pupil's school can prioritise him/her for psychological assessment with the school's allocated NEPS psychologist.  Parents of pupils with particular issues in this regard should make contact, in the first instance, with the Principal of the relevant school.</p>
            <p eId="para_3358">Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA under which the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved by NEPS and NEPS will pay the psychologist the fees for this assessment directly.  The prioritisation of urgent cases for assessment is a matter for the school principal of the school in the first instance.</p>
            <p eId="para_3359">I can inform the Deputy that this Government is committed to expanding the number of NEPS psychologists, so that more schools can receive a direct service.  As part of this expansion, funding was made available earlier this year for 31 extra psychologists to be appointed to NEPS in 2007.  The number of NEPS psychologists has increased from a total of 128 in April to a current level of 134. In all 9 psychologists have been recruited in this period but due to the normal effect of resignations and retirement the net increase is 6. In addition my Department has recently contracted a further 5 psychologists with 4 due to take up duty before years end.  A further psychologist will take up duty in early January 2008.</p>
            <p eId="para_3360">The recruitment panel concerned is now exhausted and the Public Appointments Service has recently announced the commencement of a competition from which a new panel will be drawn to continue the recruitment process.  The competition has been focussed on the appointment of psychologists outside the Dublin region.  The deadline for receipt of applications in this regard has now passed and work is proceeding on the short-listing of candidates for interview.  It is envisaged that the process will be completed and panels formed early in the new year allowing recruitment to re-commence soon after.</p>

            <p eId="para_3479">DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools), the new action plan for educational inclusion provides for a standardised system for identifying levels of disadvantage and a new integrated School Support Programme (SSP).  The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</p>
            <p eId="para_3480">The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices and the Inspectorate.  A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the programme.  The review process operated under the direction of an independent person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.  As a result of the identification and review processes, 673 primary and 203 second-level schools were invited to participate in the programme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3481">The school referred to by the Deputy was not identified for inclusion in the programme nor did it make an application for a review.  The DEIS plan states that as well as provision being made for schools with a concentrated level of disadvantage, financial support will also continue to be provided for other primary schools, not identified for inclusion in the SSP under DEIS, where the level of disadvantage is more dispersed.</p>

My Department will continue to maintain contact with these schools in order to ensure that all projects and in particular those that provide additional school places, are delivered within the earliest possible timeframe.</p>

The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.</p>

In this regard, extra supports targeted at young people in disadvantaged areas include both educational initiatives such as intensive literacy programmes and the provision of breakfast and homework clubs. In fact, in addition to the NEWB, there are currently in excess of 600 staff within the education sector with a role in school attendance. Home School Community Liaison Coordinators, in working with parents, promote school attendance and its importance for success in school. School attendance is a central objective of School Completion Programme with attendance tracking a core feature and one of its preventative strategies. Access to these services is being increased with the continued rollout of services under DEIS the Action Plan for tackling educational disadvantage.</p>

In addition, the Board follows up on urgent cases nationally where children are not currently receiving an education. Educational Welfare Officers play a pivotal role in implementing the service provided by the NEWB through monitoring school attendance and working to improve it. The EWOs also help parents that are experiencing a difficulty with getting a school place for their child.  Since January 2004, 20,000 cases involving students with reported school attendance difficulties have been resolved by the Board. The NEWB has also issued an Information Leaflet to every family with children of school going age advising them of their rights and responsibilities in relation to education and school attendance and where they can get help.</p>
            <p eId="para_3501">The first national data on school attendance has been collected and is being used to inform the Board's work.

            <p eId="para_3511">The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 established the National Educational Welfare Board (NEWB) as the single national body with responsibility for school attendance. The Act provides a comprehensive framework promoting regular school attendance and tackling the problems of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the Board are to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  An additional 15 staff have been allocated to the NEWB in 2007. This brings the current authorised staffing of the Board to 109 posts of which 90 are allocated to working directly in the service delivery area. The staffing complement is comprised of 19 HQ and support staff, 5 regional managers, 13 Senior EWOs and 72 EWOs.</p>
            <p eId="para_3512">The reasons for non attendance are many and complex and included parents who failed to enrol their child in a school or to ensure that their child attended school regularly.  I have been advised by the NEWB that legal action for non attendance at school is only taken when all other steps have failed and following consultation with the school and other services. Court action must ultimately be in the best interests of the child. A School Attendance Notice (SAN) is the first step in enforcing the law.</p>
            <p eId="para_3513">The first legal notices, School Attendance Notices, under the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000 were issued in 2005. A total of 36 SANs were issued in 2005. In 2006, 196 School Attendance Notices in respect of 137 children were issued by Educational Welfare Officers to parents of children who are not attending school regularly.  To date in 2007, 204 SANs have been issued in relation to 146 children.  When a school attendance notice is issued, the situation is monitored and the parent is given every opportunity to address the underlying issues.  Occasionally, the involvement of other services with the family may be sufficient to bring about change. In exceptional cases, where there is no change and the child remains out of school, the Board will consider taking a prosecution.</p>
            <p eId="para_3514">Where legal proceedings are served on a family, the cases are heard in the local District Court.  The first cases for non attendance at school under the Education (Welfare) Act 2000 were heard in 2006. During 2006, 34 legal proceedings were initiated against the parents of 17 children with the following outcomes: (one set of parents were prosecuted twice).5 sets of parents (10 in total) of 5 children were fined. 9 cases (relating to 5 children) currently stand adjourned. Proceedings against 13 parents (relating to 6 children) were withdrawn following enrolment of the children in school or an improvement in attendance.  Proceedings against one set of parents was withdrawn as the family no longer reside in the State.  12 children were back in school at the end of 2006 because legal action was taken.</p>
            <p eId="para_3515">Seven cases involving 12 parents were brought forward into 2007, of these seven cases, 5  were struck out.  In the case of the other two brought forward into 2007, one parent was fined and the child is back in school, the other case is still ongoing  and again the child is back in school.  In relation to new summons issued in 2007, up to the end of October 2007, 41 summons have been issued against the parents of 28 children.  The outcomes of these prosecutions is currently being analysed and a report for 2007 will be available shortly.</p>

            <p eId="para_3574">The Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, which was introduced on 1 November 2007, amalgamates the provisions of the old Essential Repairs Grant Scheme and the existing Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, with the aim of assisting older people in carrying out necessary repairs and improvements to their homes.</p>
            <p eId="para_3575">The Essential Repairs Grant Scheme ceased on 31 October 2007 and the relevant funding, which was allocated to local authorities for the administration of this Scheme in 2007, has been re-directed to fund the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme, from 1 November to the end of this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_3576">In the case of the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme, it has been agreed with the Health Service Executive that, in order to facilitate transitional arrangements, the scheme will continue to operate and be administered by the Health Service Executive until 31 March 2008.  All applications received up to this date will be processed by the Health Service Executive under the existing terms and conditions governing the scheme.  From 1 April 2008, the Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Scheme will cease operation and all future applications for grant aid will be processed by the local authorities under the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme.</p>
            <p eId="para_3577">In 2008, the Housing Aid for Older People Scheme will be funded from monies previously allocated to the Essential Repairs and Special Housing Aid for the Elderly Grant Schemes.  Local authorities will be notified of individual allocations following the publication of the Revised Estimates for Public Services 2008.</p>

         his plans to reduce the waste tonnage for members of Repak to ten tonnes to ensure more major producers could comply with Repak in view of the fact that to be a member of Repak a major producer must have an annual turnover of €1 million and produce in excess of 24 tonnes of waste; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

            <p eId="para_3579">A producer responsibility initiative operates in Ireland in relation to packaging waste, underpinned by the Waste Management (Packaging) Regulations 2003, as amended, which replaced earlier regulations introduced in 1997.  Under the regulations, producers who place substantial amounts of packaging on the market — major producers — are required to take steps to recover packaging waste or alternatively to contribute to, and participate in, compliance schemes set up to recover packaging waste.  I have recently publicly announced that I consider that the cost of recycling should be more equitably shared among more of the producers engaged in supplying packaging.  I will shortly sign new consolidated Packaging Regulations to give effect to this and other proposed changes to the packaging waste recovery regime including a reduction in the tonnage threshold for compliance with the Packaging Regulations.</p>

            <p eId="para_3581">The Report on Seanad Reform by the Seanad Sub-Committee on Seanad Reform, published in April 2004, sets out comprehensive recommendations for further consideration and action concerning the composition, functions and future role of Seanad Éireann.  The Report recommends significant reform of the Seanad electoral system, including the introduction of a 6 seat, directly elected higher education constituency to include all graduates of institutions of higher education in the State holding a primary degree or an equivalent award at level 7 in the National Framework of Qualifications.</p>
            <p eId="para_3582">The Government's Programme contains a commitment to determine the extent of cross-party agreement on the recommendations of the 2004 Report to advance proposals for implementation.  This would include consideration of the widening of the franchise for the higher education constituency in Seanad Éireann.</p>
            <p eId="para_3583">I consider that Seanad reform should be advanced on the basis of an All-Party, consensus approach, insofar as possible and will write to the party leaders soon, asking for their nominations to an All-Party Group.

In this context, it is intended to introduce a Biofuels Obligation in 2009, which will require all fuel suppliers to ensure that biofuels represent a certain percentage of their annual fuel sales.  The design and implementation of the obligation will be the subject of detailed consultation over coming months and will require legislative underpinning.</p>

While the individual amounts of biofuel produced by the companies concerned, is commercially sensitive information, I can advise the Deputy that, to the end of May 2007, there was over 9m litres of biofuel produced under the MOT Relief Schemes.

            <p eId="para_3675">My Department's policy in this area has the aim of maximising the benefits to Ireland from exploration for, and production of, our indigenous oil and gas resources, while ensuring that these activities are conducted safely and with due regard to their impact on the environment and other land or sea users.</p>
            <p eId="para_3676">Earlier this year I announced revised terms for oil and gas exploration and production.  The new terms are designed to encourage exploration activity in Ireland whilst ensuring a greater return to the State from our natural resources.  The licensing terms apply in the same way to all companies, both national and international.  It is a condition attaching to all exploration licences that the licence holders must be subject to taxation within this State.  When considering licence applications the key consideration is the work programme to be agreed with the applicant and whether or not the applicant has the necessary technical and financial capacity to deliver that work programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_3678">The provision of broadband services is, in the first instance, a matter for the private sector.  Broadband service providers operate in a fully liberalised market, regulated by the independent Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg).</p>
            <p eId="para_3679">The widespread provision of broadband services continues to be a priority for the Government.  There are still some parts of the country where the private sector will be unable to justify the commercial provision of broadband services.  In order to address this issue the procurement process for a National Broadband Scheme (NBS) is currently under way.  The NBS will provide broadband services to areas that are currently unserved and will ensure that all reasonable requests for broadband in unserved areas are met.</p>
            <p eId="para_3680">The procurement process is being undertaken pursuant to the European Communities (Award of Public Authorities' Contracts) Regulations 2006 using a competitive dialogue procurement process.</p>

            <p eId="para_3684">The Government believes that nuclear power is neither sustainable nor the answer to Ireland's energy needs.  The use of nuclear fission for the generation of electricity in Ireland is statutorily prohibited under Section 18(6) of the Electricity Regulation Act 1999.  Furthermore, Section 3 of the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 states that "Nothing in this Act shall be construed as enabling the authorisation of development consisting of an installation for the generation of electricity by nuclear fission".</p>
            <p eId="para_3685">The Energy Policy Framework and the Programme for Government make it clear that the Government fully intends to maintain the statutory prohibition on nuclear generation in Ireland.  In these circumstances the Department will not be undertaking a feasibility study on the construction of a nuclear reactor.</p>
