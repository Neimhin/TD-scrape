The Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, has pencilled in a saving of €45 million in a full year through a change in the rules of eligibility for the State pension.  Based on her figures, this could affect over 50,000 people, 90% of whom are women, from September 2012.  Put simply, anyone who during a normal working life took time out to rear children or care for elderly relatives will see their pension entitlements decrease by €30 per week——

We are in very difficult times and everybody understands that.  This Government succeeded in bringing in a budget that does not increase tax on working people and does not, contrary to what Deputy Ó Cuív implies, cut basic social welfare rates or protect the rich at the expense of the poor.No measures are targeted at women.  Any of the reforms proposed in the budget, such as those pertaining to pensions, apply to men and women.  There are no specific measures in respect of pensions which apply to women.  In respect of the changes which are proposed with regard to eligibility for pensions, namely the number of qualifying contributions which are required, they can be made up by looking at the contributions of either partner where a couple is married.The budget and measures contained in it are balanced.  The Government has made clear that where some measures have had unforeseen consequences it has been prepared to look at them on their merits and make adjustments where necessary.

The Tánaiste said the measure applies to men and women equally which is totally disingenuous.  Everybody knows that the proportion of women who start work, leave it for a period, and then return to work is much higher than men.  The cut does not involve the total number of contributions.  The Tánaiste is showing an abysmal lack of knowledge of the social welfare system.  If a person started working at 55 years of age and worked for ten years until the age of 65——

However, under the arrangements of the Minister, Deputy Burton, if one works from the age of 25 to 35, leaves work from the age of 35 to 55, and then works from the age of 55 to 65 one will lose €29.80 in pension entitlements.

The rates of pensions are the same after this budget as they were before it.  It is the first time in more than three years that we have not had cuts in social welfare rates.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I have raised this matter with the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, and it was also raised with the Taoiseach yesterday.  I hope it will be a case of third time lucky today.  The Tánaiste claims wrongly that the budget was balanced, that it does not have negative consequences for women and children, in particular, and that the pupil-teacher ratio is left untouched.  However, when one drills down into the detail of this nasty budget, one discovers that 428 teaching posts, in the most disadvantaged schools in the most disadvantaged communities across the State, are to be cut.I understand the Minister, Deputy Quinn, has explained this away with the rationale that he does not have a magic wand.  The Tánaiste has said that where measures have unforeseen consequences, the Government has shown willingness to reconsider them.  This vicious cut has foreseen, predictable consequences for children living in the inner city of Dublin, in Cork, Inishowen, Limerick, Waterford — places the Tánaiste knows full well have suffered the consequences of intergenerational poverty, unemployment and a plague of drug misuse.

I ask him, as leader of a party which I understood was wedded to a notion of equality, as leader of a party which has elected representatives in many of the constituencies and communities that will be devastated by this cut, to tell the Dail that he will reconsider this measure, not by offering alleviation measures but by actually reversing the cut.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	59	The pupil-teacher ratio has not been changed in the budget.  What the Deputy is referring to is a situation of legacy posts in a number of schools.  The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Quinn, is very well aware that some schools will be particularly impacted by the withdrawal of legacy disadvantaged posts.  For that reason, he met with a group of school principals on Tuesday in order to hear their concerns directly about the impact of this measure on their schools.  He has confirmed that a number of posts will be made available for alleviation measures for the schools most affected by the changes set out in the budget announcement.The Minister has undertaken, as part of the existing alleviation measures, to ensure that DEIS band one junior schools will be placed on a staffing schedule based on an average of one teacher for 20 pupils.  This will enable them to continue to have smaller class sizes for the youngest children starting school.  Thirty-two schools that have legacy posts which provide for one teacher for every 15 pupils in junior classes only will now have a staffing schedule that operates on the basis of an average of one teacher per 18 junior pupils.  The special position of DEIS schools will also be recognised in an adjustment to the general allocation model which is used to allocate learning and language support teaching posts to schools.All schools will be notified in January 2012, three months earlier than normal, of their staffing entitlements under the new arrangement, including any alleviation measures that may apply.  This will allow schools to plan for the school year beginning in September next year.  The removal of the legacy posts, which will be managed as sensitively as possible given current constraints, means the resources available for DEIS schools can be spread evenly so that all children in these schools are treated equally and equitably.  The Government's protection of disadvantaged schools is underlined by the maintenance of €13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools and €2 million in school book funding for those schools.  All of these areas have been protected from reductions in expenditure for 2012.  In addition, €26 million is being provided for the home-school community liaison scheme.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	60	The Tánaiste accused me of making things up.  I wonder whether, when the principals came to meet his colleague, the latter equally told them that they were making things up when they set out in graphic detail, I am sure, the consequences of moving a pupil-teacher ratio of 15:1 to one of 22:1 as was then envisaged.  Even the response the Tánaiste has just given indicates that teaching posts will be lost and that children who rely, in the first instance at primary school level, on direct intervention and small class size to have a chance, not just in educational terms but in social and life terms, will be compromised by his Government.

In this case that is a capacity that the Government and, in particular, the Minister for Education and Skills, exercised.  When the issue of the way in which the reduction in teacher numbers in disadvantaged schools was going to have an impact was raised with him, he met directly with the principals of the schools and he heard directly from them what the impact would be in their individual schools and he asked for that to be set out in greater detail.  In response, he has made it clear, as I have said, not that the pupil-teacher ratio in schools will be 22:1, as Deputy McDonald has asserted; he has made it clear that he will ensure that the DEIS band one junior schools will be placed on a staffing schedule based on an average of one teacher per 20 pupils.  He has made it clear that in the case of the 32 schools where there are legacy posts for less than that at the moment, that measures will be taken to ensure the pupil-teacher ratio will be less than that.  He has made it clear that the special position of DEIS schools will be recognised in the adjustments of the general allocation model which is the method used in his Department to allocate teachers to schools, to reflect the disadvantaged nature of some schools.  In order to avoid practical problems, he intends that the allocations will be made in January 2012 which is much earlier than is usually the case so that any difficulties identified in individual schools as regards the allocation of teachers, there will be plenty of time before these come into effect in September.Neither I nor the Labour Party need any lecture from Deputy McDonald about the protection of pupils and the protection of the pupil-teacher ratio, either generally in the primary education sector or particularly in the area of disadvantaged schools——

#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I wish to address a budget-related matter.  In the past week we have seen indications that some of the Government's quangos are showing signs of going walkabout.  I applaud the Minister for Health's attempts to keep the VHI in check and to attempt to bring down the proposed premium increase of 50%.  However, a more dangerous development is arising of which we are unaware as yet because of the budget.  On 5 December, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, announced a cut of €21 million in the subsidy to CIE.  This was obviously an attempt by the Government to raise money and to increase efficiencies in this quango.  On 9 December, four days later, all three companies in CIE were given a price increase in fares.  One of those increases which is to come into effect in January, is a 15% increase in the price of fares in Dublin.  This was granted by another Government quango, the National Transport Authority, with uncharacteristic speed in four days.How can a cut of this sort be allowed to be passed on immediately to the consumer?  Yesterday, to our shame, this House introduced a property tax of €100 a year.  If this fare increase is introduced in January, it will cost those people spending less than €20 a week on their bus fares or other transport fares, more than the property tax.  I ask the Tánaiste to instruct the National Transport Authority to reverse this decision and to tell CIE, which is the most wasteful of all Government quangos, to keep its prices the same and to make its company more efficient and reduce the malpractices which have been rife for years.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	104	The issue of fare increases is discussed between CIE and the National Transport Authority.  I do not think it is an accurate presentation of the position to say this was done only over a four-day period as this issue is discussed over a longer period of time.  I notice that Deputy Ross made no mention of the fact that the Minister of State with responsibility for transport this week announced the introduction of the long-awaited integrated ticket, a process that has been going on for a very long time and which will enable passengers on the different public transport systems in Dublin to use a single ticket across all areas of transport.  This will enable commuters and public transport users to reduce the cost of their journeys.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	105	By €50 million.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	106	A commuter using the public transport system on a regular basis will be able to make savings.  Deputy Ross is aware that savings have to be made across all Departments and the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, is no different.  I agree with the Deputy that CIE and its companies have to be managed efficiently and this is what the Government expects of the companies.  The issue of the fare increase is a matter which was the subject of discussion between CIE and the National Transport Authority.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	107	I do not accept that the Government can wash its hands of this.  The National Transport Authority is an agency with Government appointees on the board.  CIE is a semi-State company and also with Government appointees on the board.  Both companies are controlled by the Government.  They are doing a nice little friendly tick-tack between each other and the Government says it has nothing to do with this 15% fare increase.  This is the way the quangos work.  God knows, CIE has had problems.  How much has the leap system cost?  I think it cost more than €40 million to introduce it.  This is the company that spent €500,000 on a secret report which it would not even tell the previous Minister about.  It is in dire, critical need of reform and there is no reason for giving a 15% increase to a company which is run like this.Does the Government accept any responsibility for the 15% timebomb which will come up and bite it next month after the property tax has been introduced?  It will be a worse problem for the Government than the latter as soon as people realise next month what fares they must pay on the buses.

Deputy Ross is right that the process lasted far too long and cost far too much.  The Minister of State, Deputy Alan Kelly, managed to have the ticket introduced in a short number of months, which is something the previous Government failed to do for a decade.

One Bill, the temporary agency workers Bill, has been approved at Cabinet and awaits publication.  A further three Bills which were not on the A list of the autumn legislation programme have been published.

The Tánaiste was present for the debate we had with the Taoiseach on the outcome of the European summit.  Things have moved on and the Minister for Finance has made an inaccurate and scaremongering comment that a potential referendum would be a straight call as to whether the State is in or out of the euro.  Will the Tánaiste indicate when he envisages the debate on this issue will resume in the House?  At what stage will the Minister, Deputy Noonan, come into this Chamber to explain that commentary?  It seems to suggest he has advance knowledge of the content of the referendum question.  I am glad he has conceded there will be a referendum.  I am concerned he has struck a scaremongering note as the Government's initial pitch in a potential campaign.  I have to say such a note has been struck consistently.  In fairness, it has been struck by Fianna Fáil, as well as by the Labour Party and Fine Gael, when it comes to European matters.

It will address two matters.  First, it will tidy up the issue of the number of Members of the European Parliament, in the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty.  Second, it will enable further legislation to be introduced by the Minister for Finance with regard to the European Stability Mechanism.  The Minister will introduce a separate Bill in relation to the mechanism.  As I have said previously, work is under way to draft an international agreement on foot of the outcome of last week's summit.  When that work has been completed, the Government will have to consider how the agreement will be dealt with.  It will be impossible to address that until the work on the completion of the international agreement comes to a conclusion.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	204	Members will be aware that this legislation amends the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2010, which reduced public service pensions in payment and for those who retire before the end of the so-called "grace period".  I told the Dáil on Committee Stage that I would introduce an amendment in the Seanad to impose a higher reduction rate of 20% on public service pension amounts above €100,000.  Pension amounts in excess of €60,000 are currently being reduced by 12%.  An additional 8% reduction is being imposed on pensions above €100,000.  It is estimated that the proposed higher reduction rate of 20% on public service pensions above €100,000 will affect pensioners who previously held office, including former Presidents, taoisigh, senior members of the Judiciary including chief justices and members of the High Court and Supreme Court, heads of universities, Civil Service Secretaries General, chief executives of non-commercial State bodies, some hospital consultants, Garda Commissioners and Chiefs of Staff of the Defence Forces.I told the House previously that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform initially estimated that this change would lead to a relatively modest saving of €400,000 in a full year.  I can give some examples of how it might affect particular individuals.  A person on an annual pension of €125,000 will see a total reduction in his or her pension, attributable to the public service pension reduction, of €13,760 or 11%.  Someone on a very high pension of €150,000 will see a corresponding fall of approximately €18,760 or 12.5%.  Of course that is on top of all the usual array of charges.  My estimate is that for pensioners now earning more than €100,000 total deductions are in the order of 68%, the marginal rate.My Department provided an estimate of the net income of a public service pensioner whose gross pension before tax or the public service pension reduction is €125,000.  Under the amendment, the net income of a single pensioner over the age of 70 would be reduced to a net take-home amount of €71,000.  I do not suggest this amount is not a substantial income, particularly when one considers that such individuals are unlikely to be obliged to shoulder the same costs as younger counterparts.  However, the reduction in pension attributable to this amendment is significant.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I move amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 1:
In the sixth row of column two of the table to delete "20 per cent" and substitute "100 per cent"We have debated this matter before.  There is an air of unreality in the way the Minister is dealing with the whole issue.  The average public sector pension is in the region of €20,000 to €30,000 per annum.  We must get back to first principles.  Nobody should be on a pension of €125,000, much less €150,000.  In previous discussions the Minister offered a rationale in terms of property rights and earnings and stated it was for that reason he could not introduce retrospection aimed at stopping such payment.In my amendment to the Minister's amendment, I suggest the Minister simply claws back the excess, levying any amount greater than €100,000 at 100%, claiming it back for the public purse.The Minister has made much of his willingness and urgency to deal with all matters relating to the public service.  He has taken on a new Department and a new role.  I take him on his word that he is anxious to get on with this.  However, if it is to be successful it will mean breaking some delph, if I may use that term.  I do not fancy the Minister's chances of delivery if he is going to be so timid in dealing with what are clearly insane and indefensible pensions.  I see the matter as that simple.  If I were sitting in the Minister's seat I would be looking at these issues in a much more radical way than I suggest in my amendment.  It is entirely reasonable, however, in a time of crisis, where the State is insolvent and these emergency measures are in the public interest, for the Minister to claw back the excess of €100,000 in total.  If the Minister was really serious about getting the job done that is what he would set out to do.  He has not dealt in any way that is convincing, not only to the likes of me in this Chamber, but publicly, to citizens who listened to him read out his cuts of billions of euro in his budget speech, when he stated we are all in this together.  He has not shown in any measurable sense fairness at play.  No public sector or Civil Service person should be on a pension of €125,000, full stop.  Even €100,000 is an excessively generous level but we are where we are, as that awful saying goes.I appeal to the Minister to adopt the measure proposed in my amendment and claw back for the Exchequer and the State any amount in excess of €100,000.  In so proposing, I accept the savings from this measure would be modest in relative terms.  That is a fact and the Minister has correctly stated so.  However, it sends out a very important message to the general public and, dare I say it, to the high-rollers in the Civil Service and the public service, that they are not exempt from the emergency or the very harsh measures that the fairness agenda of which the Minister speaks demands.  Therefore, I recommend the amendment to him.

He referred to it on the last occasion, before the Bill went to and returned from the Seanad.

#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	215	The Minister has gone a long way towards making a deduction of 100%.I do not oppose his amendment.  In our pre-budget submission the Fianna Fáil Party proposed deductions to kick in at a lower level for those earning €75,000.  However, we will deal with the budget the Minister presented rather than what we suggested three weeks ago.  From that point of view I will not oppose the measure.The essence of the Minister's proposal is that if a person has a pension of more than €100,000, 70% of that excess will be clawed back directly to the Exchequer, leaving 30% for the person.  That was what I wished to check.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	216	I acknowledge the Minister's intent in this proposal.  In many ways what is before us is welcome, as is the fact the Minister has taken a decision to tackle the obscene pensions that exist, and that a message is being sent out.  However, the message is too late and too little.In her amendment, Deputy McDonald proposes a greater message to be sent out to the public.  Earlier the Minister attended a committee where part of the discussion concerned how to regain some of the crust on top of society.  Given what has happened in the Chamber in the past two weeks in regard to the budget, the public has looked for leadership and for decisions to be taken that would tackle the level of obscene pensions that we see in this State, those for people at the highest level in the public service and the Civil Service.I reiterate my acknowledgment that the Minister is moving in the right direction but I do not believe he has gone far enough.  A levy of 100% on those with pensions of more than €100,000 would be fair given the financial constraints we, as a society, face.  If the pre-budget submissions my party made concerning wage scales of public servants or of those paid from the public purse were followed, society would begin to regain trust in the public service and in politicians in general.  The message would go out that those who are richer and richest in society would take some of the burden.  We do not claim these people are not entitled to a pension but a pension of €100,000 is a substantial amount.  Being taxed on that level would still place them well above the great majority of Irish citizens who are on an average industrial wage of €30,000 to €35,000.  A considerable number of people are not even on a wage and survive on social welfare payments.I urge the Minister, even at this late stage, to reconsider this.  Savings can be made even if, as Deputy McDonald noted, these are modest.  There are other steps, however, that could be taken.  For instance, we suggested hospital consultants' pay should be examined.  It can be claimed it has been addressed but only in a small way.  A reduction of up to €150,000 would save the State €100 million.  A further reduction of €100,000 would make an even greater saving.  These are the type of measures we as a society need to take when addressing public and civil servants' pay at the highest level.  It would send out the message that those on this type of salary would be hit with greater amounts than those dependent on social welfare or on low pay.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	217	I thank Deputies for their support for the measure.The 100% levy rate for every euro over €100,000 in a public service pension, as proposed by Deputy McDonald, is tantamount to confiscation.  There may be a rationale to that as we are in a desperate state and it should be debated as to whether it is an appropriate step.  The advice from the Office of the Attorney General is extremely important.  It states preserved pensions are vested property rights which have been earned and are constitutionally protected.In the context of such advice, a levy of 100% on every euro over €100,000 would be clearly excessive.  It puts at risk the entire FEMPI, financial emergency measures in the public interest, architecture.  Introducing such a rate would give a clear path for someone to attack the FEMPI legislation on the basis that it is disproportionate and confiscatory of a property right people had earned and expected.Deputy Ó Snodaigh spoke about regaining trust which is important.  There is also a balance to be struck.  Take, for example, a retired senior consultant who decided 40 years ago to practice exclusively in the public system at the cutting edge of medicine.  Should we attack his pension instead of the consultant who decided to work exclusively in the private system and who may have a significant pension pot which was allowed 100% tax breaks for up to €5 million a time?  Many public servants stayed in the public service when they could have earned more outside but the attraction was they got a decent pension at the end.The quantum of pension at the top, in my judgment, is too great.  That is why the Government has addressed this from the start.  I have changed the TLAC, top level appointments committee, terms.  It must be remembered this did not grow up in the past couple of years.  The TLAC terms which apply to Secretaries General were in place from 1987.  Many long-serving Members were unaware of the value of these terms to retiring senior public servants.  I have changed them for all new incumbents.We have gone as far as we can go without putting at risk the fundamental FEMPI architecture which is essential for our national survival.  FEMPI is a critical part of the architecture of getting resources to the State to maintain essential public services.  I am not minded to put any of that at risk.Deputy McDonald said I am timid.  I have been accused of many things but never timidity.  I will be prudent with this legislation's provisions, not foolhardy.  Neither, as I have said before, will I grandstand.  If I have been given clear advices that to introduce this 100% rate would be unconstitutional and risk pulling down not only this but the broader FEMPI provisions, I will not introduce it.The end result of imposing such a levy would not be enormous.  The justification for the financial emergency measures in the public interest legislation is the reality of the emergency that exists with public spending.  The burden to be levied has to be proportionate and cannot be sector specific.  That is why we were very careful in the way we constructed the amendment on judges' pay, for example.  Any imposition on them had to be proportionate and in line with what is happening to analogous groups in the public service.  This is a careful and balanced set of measures to bring about fairness as best we can without putting greater elements at risk.  I do not want to make the legislation vulnerable to attack.Deputy Sean Fleming made the point that the level of marginal tax on amounts above €100,000 is of the order of 69%.  Once upon a time, such a rate would be described as a 1960s-type extortionate tax.  It is fair and needed for that contribution to be made in the interest of our national recovery.

He claims a levy has to be proportionate.  Accordingly, he considers a 20% levy on pensions over €100,000 proportionate, fair and defensible.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I have pursued this matter with the Minister for months on end.When I suggested to him in respect of the big pension pay-outs that he claw them back or even not pay them, the Minister told me initially the Attorney General's advice was it could not be done.  However, he clearly can impose levies because he has set out such a scheme of levies in this legislation.  Again, however, the Attorney General claims a 100% levy on every euro over €100,000 cannot be done either.  These big pension pots cannot be really touched, bar in a light-handed way.  I find that utterly unacceptable.I am mindful that it is only a small number of people with these types of pensions.  Earlier this morning, I had an exchange with the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade — the Minister's party leader — on Leaders' Questions on the fair and balanced appropriation of teachers to disadvantaged schools.  What the Government is proposing for DEIS schools is confiscatory and deeply damaging to a set of people's rights.  It can be done, however.  We are told it has to be done because we are in a state of emergency.In asking the Minister to accept my amendment, I am doing nothing other than asking him to live up to his word.  If one proposes to take a radical action, one will always find the advice that it cannot be done because people will beat a path to the High Court.  If this is how the Minister is going to base his decisions on how to deal with runaway pay in the public and Civil Service, he will never deal with it.The reason we are discussing the public sector is the Bill specifically refers to this sector.  At no stage have I said that those on massive wages or who have massive wealth in the private sector should be let off the hook either in this time of crisis when we need measures in the public interest.  It seems that, politically, the Minister understands that something needs to be done about these pensions because I am sure, no more than anybody else, he has gauged public opinion on this matter.  The woman or man on the street does not think that a public or civil servant, however brilliant or accomplished, should be on a pension of €125,000 per annum.  The Minister knows he needs to do something and he is doing the minimum.  His action is timid.My amendment stands.  If fairness meant something and a fair distribution of the burden of the crisis meant something, I would not have had to table the amendment because it would have been tabled by the Minister.  However, there is one rule for the very well off and an entirely different rule book applies to the average woman, man or child in this State.

A number of Ministers, including him, were in government between 1992 and 1997 and several Secretaries General were appointed during that time.  The Taoiseach, the Minister, who served in both the Departments of Health and Environment, and the Ministers for Finance and Education and Skills were in that Cabinet.  I am surprised——
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	224	The Deputy is right.  It is surprising.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	225	It was one of these well kept secrets in the bowels of the Civil Service, which never worked its way up to the Minister.  I am surprised it flew so well under the radar and it never came across the desk of those Ministers during that period.During the passage of the legislation, various amendments to cut the pay of senior officials in the public service and semi-State companies were voted down by the Government.  We wanted to set an upper limit of €200,000 for public servants.  The Minister gave us various explanations as to why he could not do this.  He said it could be subject to legal challenge and he could not isolate a small group of people, yet he is doing just that in this legislation, although he is not going as far as Deputy McDonald wishes.  He is well able to isolate a few people in this amendment.With regard to fairness, which was a theme of Deputy McDonald's contribution, why can the Minister not pass a law to rule out high salaries for the handful of chief executive officers in semi-State companies and to limit the highest salary in the public service at €200,000?  This would affect a few hundred public servants, of whom 99 work in the education sector alone.  The Minister would do a tremendous service to the people and the political system if he could explain why he will not do that.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	226	We are dealing with a particular amendment.  That is an entirely different matter.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	227	As the Ceann Comhairle rightly said, the Deputy is straying back to the debate we had on the substance of the Bill.  However, I grapple every day with people who have contractual rights that I am trying to undo and they are making it perfectly clear to me that they will go to the High Court.  The advice I am getting is that I cannot undo them.We are only nine or ten months in office and we have fundamentally altered the pay rates for everybody in the public service.  No civil servant earns more than €200,000, which is the rate we established for the Taoiseach on the day we came into office.  That is a great deal of money but every other salary is below that now.  The pay rate for a Secretary General was €285,000 and €85,000 is a big drop in income.  New pay rates have been set for the future.With regard to the commercial semi-States, by and large, the pay ceiling should be €250,000 per annum.  We looked at modifying the Hay rate by applying all the deductions in the FEMPI legislation and implementing a further 10% reduction, which we are applying to all new appointments, to get a new Hay rate.  The only person earning an amount in excess of €250,000 annually is the chief executive officer of the ESB and that salary is less than half what it was 12 months ago, which means a greater than 50% reduction.  We are putting extraordinary changes to top level pay in place.  These are fluid positions and we are making new appointments and so on.The concern I have is whether we will get people of the calibre we need to apply for some of the positions in future.  The more I read in the newspapers about this, there seems to be a growing view that we want a dumbed down Civil Service and public service; we can buy in expertise from the private sector and pay those individuals private sector rates; we should squeeze downwards all salaries in the public service; and, we do not want a public service of expertise.  That runs counter to all the analysis done by Nyberg and others regarding the fundamental failures of oversight in this economy and in this State over the past number of years but that is a debate for another day.Deputy McDonald readily ascribes glibly based motives to me.  She said I am doing this because I am somehow attuned to a public view that something must be done and I have done the minimum, as if I could go further.  I tell the truth to this House.  My advice is that if I was to accept her amendment, it would be put at risk the fundamental architecture of FEMPI.

I suggest she asks any lawyer for advice and she will get something similar.She used the word "proportionate".  The action relating to the  public service in terms of the volume of levy has to be proportionate to that across society in general.  We cannot have a confiscatory amount for one narrow group and that is the advice.  The Deputy's characterisation of an effective rate of taxation of 70% as meaning these people cannot be touched is grandstanding and is trying to pander to populism.  A rate of 70% touches salaries significantly.  I acknowledge that often gross figures are given out but the net impact is what is important and I ask Members to remember that in their commentary.  I am minded for the reasons outlined not to accept the amendment.

These amendments are for clarification on this matter.Amendment No. 3 clarifies what criteria can be used for assessing applications for registration.  It provides that criteria can include qualifications, education and training, and relevant competencies for registration, possession of sufficient knowledge of language or languages necessary to practice as a nurse or midwife in the State, requirements for relevant post-registration experience or clinical experience, and any other matters in relation to the setting of criteria that is necessary or desirable for the protection of the public.  It is important that this is clarified, in particular, in relation to language proficiency.Amendment No. 4 sets out proposed amendments to section 13(2)(l) and (m) which provide for the setting of criteria on education and training rules and also the setting of criteria on nurses who have not practised for a time.  The amendment clarifies that the criteria in the rules regarding education and training relate to persons seeking admission to education and training programmes, bodies which may deliver education and training programmes, and any other matters in the setting of criteria necessary for the protection of the public.This amendment also sets out the board's power to set criteria and conditions for persons wishing to return to practise nursing or midwifery after not having practised for a period, which the board specifies in rules.  The criteria or conditions will include the education and training of those persons, possession of sufficient knowledge of language or languages necessary to practise as a nurse or midwife in the State, the manner of verifying that the person possesses the relevant competencies, and any other matters on the setting of criteria that is necessary or desirable for the protection of the public.

This is the last Stage in the passage of this Bill.  It is important to offer additional clarification on the position my colleague Senator Cullinane took in the Seanad.  The Minister of State, Deputy Shortall, will be familiar with his arguments and with those I pursued on Committee and Report Stages in this House.The concerns of many midwives have not been addressed adequately, as I have stated time after time.  The Community Midwives Association made it clear that it felt there was too much scope for misuse and misunderstanding under the Bill, as currently worded, and a recognised lack of consensus among all those involved which was far from reassuring.  I re-emphasise that at no point did midwives wish to be uninsured and to leave mothers and themselves open to the consequences.  Any suggestion to the contrary is without foundation and false.It is important to bear in mind that the issue at stake is not about whether one is insured or indemnified but about the current wording and its interpretation.  The very real fear is that the insurer, the State, will attach such conditions that will make it impossible for midwives to provide the services they provide today.  This is not idle speculation but a real concern.  Those with whom I have engaged, who represent the profession of midwifery, are not imagining this.  It is very real for them and their profession.I urge the Minister of State, her officials and the Minister for Health to continue dialogue with midwives and, despite the negative aspects of this Bill, to seek to maximise rather than restrict the role of midwives as key providers of care to expectant women.  That is a very reasonable position for the accountable elected representatives associated with the Department of Health to take.Accepting that amendments Nos. 3 and 4 are, in real terms, adding further detail and are specific to a range of various aspects of both the nursing and midwifery professions, I do not object to either of them.

It does not fall within the scope of any of the amendments today and, therefore, I understand it is not in order to have a discussion thereon.  The HSE and the Department will continue to engage with midwives.  They are part of the new set-up.  This is ground-breaking legislation and puts nurses and midwives on a new footing in terms of the recognition of both professions.  There will continue to be ongoing engagement with them in regard to their vital role in the health service.

This is reflected in Seanad amendment No. 8.

Not wishing to be mischievous, I ask why Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas or MEPs are not also included.  Why only members of local authorities?

This issue relates to a prohibition that existed in regard to the involvement of members of local authorities.  There is no reason whatsoever they should not be involved with bodies such as those in question.  They perform a very important public role and devote a considerable part of their lives to public service.

Clearly another member of the board would have to take on the functions of the CEO in such circumstances.  The amendment enables the board to continue functioning.  It might transpire that a CEO dies in office and until such time as the position is advertised and filled, the board would be unable to meet unless another member of the board could be nominated to step into the role in the interim period.  It is a temporary arrangement.

Either the Minister of State was correct when she stated that another member of the board would fill the position or it will be, as the amendment states, an employee of the board.  These are very different roles.  Perhaps the Minister of State can clarify the matter in light of the conflicting information.

Is it open ended and how long can an employee continue as acting CEO?  A CEO could be absent for two months or six months.  It would be appropriate to set out a mandatory timeframe for appointing a new CEO.  It is not good governance to allow an employee of the organisation to act as CEO for an indefinite period.

It is a question of good governance.  The amendment provides for the replacement of a CEO on a temporary basis while he or she is absent, for example, on sick leave.  If the CEO was absent for an extended period, the board would presumably address the governance issues arising.  I am not sure we can set out in legislation the acceptable period for a person to be out sick from a particular role.  That would have to be judged by the board.

However, if we can determine when a vacant seat must be filled, we can certainly set out when a position of this importance should be filled in the event of a vacancy that is not temporary in nature.  The amendment clearly indicates this is not a question of a temporary hiccup.  We certainly can set out a clear direction that the position should be filled within a reasonable timeframe determined by the Minister of State and her team.  The amendment is flawed in that respect and we are bound as Opposition Members to point out what we believe to be an inadequate measure.

It is not appropriate to set a time limit on the length that somebody could be absent on sick leave or for another reason.  If the CEO is absent from his or her post for an inordinate length of time, thereby causing difficulties for the board, it is the latter's responsibility to take action where it believes the period of absence is unacceptable.  If, for some reason, the board failed to act it is open to the Minister for Health to instruct to replace the person who is absent.  If the post falls vacant, it is the board's responsibility to advertise for a new CEO.  If the board is not performing its duty satisfactorily it is open to the Minister to instruct it to advertise the post and fill it in the normal course.  Safeguards have been put in place in that regard.The only purpose of this amendment is to ensure that the board can appoint another person in the event of the CEO not being available to perform his or her functions.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	278	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."The Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) Bill 2011, which was enacted earlier this year, provided for acceptance by the State of amendments to the IMF articles of agreement which were approved by the IMF board of governors in 2008.  The current Bill is a continuation of this process, which relates to the ongoing reform of IMF governance.  The Bill is needed to allow the State to accept a further amendment to the IMF articles of agreement which was approved by the board of governors in December 2010.  The acceptance of the amendment by Ireland will contribute to the process of bringing it into force.The amendment, which is known as the amendment on the reform of the executive board, was approved by the IMF board of governors as part of the 2010 governance reforms agreed by the IMF.  These reforms are aimed at improving the fund's legitimacy, credibility and effectiveness in the modern world.  It is worth recalling that under the 2008 reforms, it was agreed to realign voting power in the IMF to reflect changes in the global economy and increase the voting power and participation of low-income countries.Under the 2010 reforms, it was agreed to enhance the representation of developing countries and to modernise the arrangements for establishing the executive board of the IMF.  The substance of the amendment is that, in future, the executive board of the IMF will be an all-elected body.  At present, the articles provide that the five largest members are entitled to appoint directors to the board, and this provision is considered by many to be an anachronism in the modern world.  The amendment will remove the category of appointed directors and thus facilitate restructuring of the board on a more representative basis.As was the case with the 2008 reforms, the 2010 reforms adjust the IMF quota shares of members to better reflect their relative weights and roles in the global economy and to strengthen the position of emerging markets and developing countries.  The quota of a country is a measure of its voting power and representation at the IMF, and is broadly based on its relative size in the world economy.  It determines the member's maximum financial commitment to the IMF and also has a bearing on its access to IMF financing and the terms of such financing, including the interest rate.  However, current quotas have not kept up with changing economic realities, especially the increased economic weight of major emerging countries in the world economy.  While the quota adjustments will benefit emerging market economies in the main, a number of advanced countries that have been significantly under-represented in the past, including Ireland, will also receive a quota increase.  An increase in quota has the effect of lowering the borrowing cost of assistance from the fund.  The increase in Ireland's quota share, when it becomes effective, will result in a significant reduction in the interest rate payable on moneys borrowed by Ireland from the fund.  Taking into account the 2008 quota change, which became effective in March 2011, and this quota change, it is currently estimated that on a weighted-average basis, a saving of about 100 basis points on the interest rate could be achieved.  It should be noted, however, that these expected savings may change either upwards or downwards in light of future quota revisions.The amendment on reform of the executive board is, by resolution of the IMF board of governors, required to have entered into force before the quota increases can become effective.  This requires acceptance of the amendment by a voting threshold of three fifths of members, with 85% of total voting power.  While it is not possible to be definitive about the timeline for the implementation of the 2010 quota changes, by resolution of the board, each member has committed to use its best efforts to complete the necessary steps for acceptance before the annual meetings in October 2012.The Bill is essentially a technical Bill which provides for acceptance of the amendment, which is the seventh amendment to the IMF articles of agreement.  The articles currently establish two categories of executive director: those who are appointed, and those who are elected.  The amendment eliminates the category of appointed executive directors and requires that all executive directors be elected.Section 1 of the Bill sets out the definitions of terms used in the Bill.  Section 2 provides for approval of acceptance of the amendment of the IMF articles by the Government.  Section 3 contains the provisions relating to the short title, construction and collective citation.The amendment on the reform of the executive board is set out in the Schedule to the Bill and has 15 sections.  The first section provides that the executive board shall consist of 20 executive directors, elected by the members, with the managing director as chairman.  This replaces the provision whereby five of the executive directors are appointed by the five largest members and provides for an all-elected board.  The second section provides that, for the purpose of each regular election of executive directors, the board of governors, by an 85% majority of the total voting power, may increase or decrease the number of executive directors.  The effect of this provision is that the existing possibility of adjusting the size of the board will continue to apply to the restructured board.  The third section provides that elections to the all-elected executive board will continue to be at intervals of two years and in accordance with regulations adopted by the board.  The remaining sections, 4 to 15, delete or amend existing provisions that refer to the category of appointed executive directors and include transitional provisions to govern the period between the entry into force of the amendment and the first election following such entry into force.  These sections do not provide for any changes to the existing provisions beyond those resulting from the elimination of the category of appointed executive directors.As I said at the outset, the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill is a technical Bill designed to give effect to IMF reforms which were approved in 2010 by the IMF's board of governors, including the then Irish Minister for Finance.  These changes relate to the governance framework of the IMF and are part of the ongoing process of modernising the fund aimed at enhancing its legitimacy in today's world.  Ireland's acceptance of this amendment will contribute to the ratification process to enable the amendment to come into effect, the target date being the next IMF annual meeting in October 2012.  The implementation of the amendment when it becomes effective will trigger the related quota increases and lead to a significant reduction of the interest rate on our IMF borrowings as the interest rate is related to a member's quota.  It is thus in Ireland's interest and in the interest of the IMF membership generally that this Bill be enacted.I commend the Bill to the House.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	279	I thank the Minister for introducing this Bill, which we will be supporting.  As the Minister confirmed, it is a technical Bill that ratifies changes to the articles of agreement of the IMF, particularly relating to the appointment of the executive board.  The Bill is Ireland's part of the ratification process which will bring into effect the changes approved by the executive board of the IMF on 15 December 2010.  It builds on a series of earlier reforms which date back to 2008.  This is the second legislative measure in 2011 which, in effect, gives the Irish seal of approval to those reforms.The key issue for us is what the implications are, if any, for Ireland.  The Minister has outlined that the proposals we will hopefully approve today, taken in conjunction with the reforms enacted earlier this year, will yield a reduction on a weighted average basis of approximately 100 basis points to the interest rate Ireland is being charged by the IMF in respect of the funds being drawn down under the programme of assistance.  There has already been a significant reduction so I suspect that most of the 100 basis points reduction is already factored in and has already taken place.According to the National Treasury Management Agency's, NTMA, technical note, when the programme was negotiated in December 2010 the NTMA estimated at that time that the interest rate being charged by the IMF was 5.7% per annum.  However, in a reply to a recent parliamentary question, the Minister confirmed that the estimated euro equivalent rate on credit outstanding is 4.79%.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	282	It will be 1% lower than the present rate.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	283	The present rate is about 4.8% so it will reduce to approximately 3.8%, which is a very welcome improvement in the interest rate being charged by the IMF.  I am sure that saving has been factored into the numbers for 2012 and 2013.  This will come into effect in October 2012 so the impact in that year will only be marginal as it will only apply to a quarter of the year.  Nonetheless, it will be a significant improvement.  As the Minister indicated, it does not form part of the €875 million saving predicted for 2012 which is substantially based on the European facility.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	284	It will be approximately €25 million.
#MichaelMcGrath	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-party	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	285	That is modest but it is welcome.  It will be of greater benefit in 2013 when it will take full effect and brings the IMF interest rate down to a far more reasonable level.  In that respect, the changes being made are welcome.  Increasing Ireland's quota will have the effect of reducing the interest rate being charged.It would be remiss of us not to acknowledge the important role the IMF has played as a key partner for Ireland as the country goes through significant economic difficulties.  When one considers the negotiation of the programme of assistance last November and the changes the Government has secured since then, it is clear the IMF has been an important ally of Ireland in seeking to bring about those changes.  When the previous Government sought to have burden sharing with senior bondholders included in the deal last November it is known that the IMF was supportive of the Government's position, but it was vetoed by the European Central Bank.  When the current Government sought to achieve the same objective, the support of the IMF was again forthcoming.  However, the result was not achieved, again because of the intransigence of the European Central Bank.The IMF is making €22.5 billion available to Ireland, which is one third of the external funding being provided to Ireland under the EU-IMF programme of assistance.  As the Taoiseach correctly pointed out in his letter to President Van Rompuy prior to last week's important European Council summit meeting, the Irish people and the State have paid a very high price for recapitalising our banks.  At a cost of €63 billion, it was done at a time when there was no European fund available for Ireland or, indeed, any other eurozone country for recapitalising their banks.  Since the decision of the European Council summit last July, the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, can now potentially be used as a source of funding to recapitalise European banks.  We support the efforts of the Government in seeking to have the recapitalisation costs incurred by Ireland, particularly the promissory notes structure, renegotiated in that context, given that there is now a fund for the recapitalisation of banks at far more reasonable interest rates.  The banks in Ireland were recapitalised in the absence of that fund and against the backdrop of the insistence by the European Central Bank that no bank in the eurozone should be allowed to fail and that no burden sharing could be imposed on senior bondholders.  The debate must be seen in that context.Clearly the measures in the reform package that commenced in 2008, which were partially enacted by the House earlier this year and we are completing that process today, result in an increase in Ireland's influence with the IMF.  That is most welcome.  The IMF has been an important partner for Ireland as we seek to implement successfully the programme of assistance negotiated with the EU and the IMF.  The Bill is quite short.  A small number of sections deal with technical issues.  There is a reduction in the number of executive directors from 24 to 20, with a provision that all of them will now be elected.  This replaces the situation whereby hitherto the five largest members got to appoint their own executive director.  That is now discontinued.  There is also a provision whereby, with an 85% majority of the total voting power, the governors may increase or decrease the number of executive directors.  The elections to the board will be conducted at two yearly intervals.These build on the earlier reforms which have been approved.  It is appropriate that Ireland play its part in completing the ratification process efficiently and, hopefully, with the full support of all sides of the House.  It should be acknowledged that the IMF has approved Ireland's drawdown of a further €3.9 billion under the programme of assistance.  This will bring the total for 2011 to approximately €13 billion of the total amount of approximately €22.5 billion being made available.This is being debated against the backdrop of an ongoing crisis in Europe.  I am not going to go into the details because it stretches the test of relevancy to the limit.There have been developments, even in the past 24 hours, such as the fact that the Italian ten-year bond spreads have again breached the 7% mark.  The ratings agencies are expected to make announcements over the next number of days which may well have an impact on the credit ratings of many European countries.  Ernst & Young issued a report today predicting growth in the eurozone economy next year to be 0.1%.  Clearly, the country and Government continues to face enormous challenges in achieving the fiscal targets for 2012.The budget has been announced and will be put into effect.  The targets are based on a growth level of 1.3% which may be over optimistic but only time will tell.  We hope the targets can be achieved and, more importantly, that a level of confidence can come back into the economy which will filter down to consumers and businesses which are trying to bring the country out of very severe economic difficulties.The reaction of the markets to last week's summit has been underwhelming.  The view of our party is well known on that issue.  While the fiscal compact was agreed last week, the details of which have yet to be worked out, the issue has to be addressed.  It will not address in any way the short-term funding difficulties of the eurozone economies such as Italy and Spain which will have significant refinancing challenges over the next number of weeks.  Given the interest rates the markets are currently imposing on those countries, the funding cliff which is clearly evident will pose enormous difficulties for them and the entire eurozone.I suspect we may well have another round of crisis summit meetings, building on the outcome of last week's summit.  It is to be hoped they will agree more short-term measures that can inject some confidence into the market and result in the role of the European Central Bank being clarified and improved in order that it can act as a normal central bank, become a lender of last resort and give the market some confidence that Europe can work its way out of these difficulties.We are in support of the Bill.  It is an important step forward in the reform of the IMF.  It brings benefits for Ireland in terms of the increase in the Irish quota in the IMF which will directly result in a further reduction in the interest rate being charged on the loans made available to us.  It is to be hoped if all of the other countries can ratify these measures the interest rate reduction will come into effect in October 2012 and will result in significant savings, particularly in 2013 and for the remainder of the programme.
#PadraigMacLochlainn	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-party	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-dob	unknown-#PadraigMacLochlainn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	286	The brief proposal before us today is straightforward and Sinn Féin will not oppose it.  However, when the Dáil last discussed the most recent round of IMF reforms in January of this year, Sinn Féin raised serious concerns about the continued domination of the IMF by the overdeveloped world.  Wealthy countries represent 15% of the membership of the IMF.  Even after the recent reforms we still control 60% of the voting rights.  If Germany or France proposed such a voting arrangement in the European Union, no party in this House would support it.The IMF is in urgent need of real reform and central to it is giving the developing world an equal say in how it is run.  There is an argument that those countries most affected by IMF policies should have a greater say in how it operates.  There is also a need for the IMF to abandon the use of policy conditionality attached to its loans.  Clearly there is a need for a lender of last resort on the international stage and the IMF is an appropriate body to fulfil this function.However, it should lend money solely on the basis that it has a reasonable expectation of the money being repaid.  It should not be in the business of imposing any particular economic philosophy or democratically-elected governments in return for loans.  The impact of so-called structural adjustment programmes in Africa and Latin America in the 1980s and 1990s has been devastating.  Country after country has seen poverty rates increase, expenditure on education and social services fall and democracy undermined.  Meanwhile, international corporations and local elites profit off the back of widespread misery and social dislocation.Mali is a case in point.  It is one of the poorest countries in the world in that 90% of its population lives on less than $2 a day.  The consequences of the IMF's most recent involvement in it are stark.  Utility prices rose dramatically following privatisation, cotton prices dropped heavily following trade liberalisation and development aid from the World Bank to the value of $72 million was blocked.  All of this made the poor majority of the country even poorer.  It is hardly a record to be proud of.There is also a need for the IMF to seriously consider the amount of money it pays its senior management and staff.  Dominique Strauss-Kahn received a salary $441,980 in 2010, more than the Presidents of France or the US receive.  As if this were not enough, the former IMF chief also received an annual expense allowance of $79,120.  To cap it off, his IMF income was tax-free.  It is nice arrangement.Considering the level of financial hardship imposed on ordinary people living in those countries who borrow from the IMF, these kind of excessive salaries, allowances and tax breaks are not only wrong, but undermine public confidence in the fund.  As we know from our experience of IMF involvement in Irish affairs, the cost of borrowing money is crippling austerity and repeated bailouts for the banks.  I take this opportunity to remind the House of the impact of the IMF austerity programme on ordinary citizens in this State.It was not long ago that the parties now in government joined Sinn Féin in opposition to the actions of Fianna Fáil.  There was a time when we were all in this together, standing up for the rights and welfare of ordinary citizens.  The Fine Gael and Labour parties opposed the IMF-EU deal.  Both parties campaigned aggressively during the general election campaign for a renegotiation of the agreement.  They promised if elected to break with the failed policies of austerity and bank bailouts that were preceded by the previous Government.  Yet, less than 12 months since the Fine Gael Party and the Labour Party took office the very same politicians who once opposed the actions of the IMF and Ireland have become its biggest cheerleaders.If anyone is in any doubt, he or she should look at the issues that have dominated the Dáil this week.  A Labour Party Minister for Social Protection cut 15 separate social welfare payments and funding for community employment schemes.  A Labour Party Minister for Education and Skills cut funds for disadvantaged schools.  A Fine Gael Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government imposed a flat rate household charge and a punitive septic tank charge.  A Fine Gael Minister for Finance increased VAT by 2% and a Labour Party Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform slashed 6,000 public sector jobs in a single year.These are the policies once pursued by the previous Government but now enthusiastically promoted by Fine Gael and the Labour Party, all under the watchful eye of the troika.  Behind the political rhetoric are the real human stories of hardship and misery.  The hodgepodge arrangement the delegates at the summit came up with is no solution to the crisis in Europe and the Minister knows that.No solution that condemns people in Ireland and other countries in Europe to a lost decade of austerity and limited economic growth will work.  Even the proposition to involve the IMF in this arrangement is already facing criticism in Estonia and the Czech Republic from the German Central Bank, Canada and Japan.  They are not comfortable with the so-called solution that has been cobbled together.The comments made yesterday to the effect that this is a referendum on Ireland's future in terms of the euro demean the office of the Minister.  That type of approach is outrageous scaremongering.Above all, it is inaccurate.  At a time when people are weary and in despair and businesses are seeking a ray of hope, they do not need that type of irresponsible rhetoric from the Minister in charge of the most important portfolio in Government excepting that of the Taoiseach.  I urge the Minister to reflect on that.Where is the solution for the banking crisis, debt crisis and investment crisis — the three profound elements to this crisis?  In regard to the first element, we know that many of the banks in the core European states are in serious trouble.  Yet there has been no comprehensive stress testing of those banks, without which we cannot know the extent of their capitalisation requirements.  On the second issue, we have no sense of how we can deal with the sovereign debt crisis faced by this country, Greece and others in a fair way that allows growth to take place.  Worst of all, perhaps, we have no grounds for hope in respect of the third element of the crisis, because there is no strategy in regard to investment.  We are not deploying the immense capacity of the European Investment Bank, together with the member states, to put in place a programme of regeneration.This proposed technical reform of the IMF and the various botched solutions on offer are being presented to the Irish people in the context of our future in Europe and with a warning that failure to fall into line will lead to Armageddon.  It reminds one of the announcement of a movie sequel, "If you thought the last one was bad, wait until you see the next one".  That approach is simply irresponsible.  I hope the Minister will focus henceforth on defending the interests of the Irish people, not by writing letters to Herman Van Rompuy but by raising these issues directly with our European colleagues in an effort to find a solution to this country's difficulty and the difficulties of people throughout Europe.  Our focus must be on a collective resolution to the economic crisis that is devastating the people of Ireland and of Europe, and it must be done in a sensible and measured fashion.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	287	My contribution may be somewhat disjointed because I have been running around dealing with the consequences of IMF-inspired austerity in the form of the household charge.  The bottom line — the point I wish to emphasise above all else — is that we must resist the IMF.  This legislation must not be supported because it is a cosmetic attempt to make the IMF look like a benign entity rather than the vulture it really is, a vulture acting on behalf of the very corporate elites and financial speculators which wrecked the European economy and the Irish economy.  The IMF represents the forces which did the same to other parts of the world in the past.  Now it has moved on to the peripheral countries of Europe and will no doubt move on to the rest of the Continent in due course.It does not at all surprise me that our Government should support the IMF and consent to do deals with it, which is essentially what the Minister's argument seems to be.  If we do a little deal by supporting these so-called reforms, we will in return be thrown a few crumbs from the table in the form of small interest rate reductions.  I argue strongly that we should not be doing deals with the IMF.  It is not helping us and we should not be begging for crumbs from its table.  The devastation to our economy is a consequence of the constraints imposed on us by the IMF and the ECB, at the behest of the private financial system, that is, the bankers and bondholders.  These entities are determined to protect the people who caused the economic crisis and to unload the cost of it onto our backs.  They are forcing the so-called bailout programme down our throats in order to gain control of our economy and hereafter dictate the economic policy of this State.The pattern of IMF intervention over the years has been appalling in the extreme.  It is not an exaggeration to say it has wreaked devastation across the world in every location in which it has intervened.  It is not unlike a drug pusher in this regard.  Its approach is to offer loans to countries in crisis at exorbitant interest rates while imposing austerity to such a severe degree that the society is devastated and its people endure severe suffering.  Ultimately, these countries are placed in a position where they cannot ever repay their loans and are therefore forced perpetually to seek new loans.  It is a downward debt spiral where the only winners are the IMF and the financial interests it champions and represents, namely, the banks and bondholders.The IMF did this in Africa in the 1980s, causing utter devastation to dozens of African countries.  There is always a pattern to its policies, the same policies that are now being unleashed in this country.  The intent is to protect the banks at all costs by ensuring they are repaid, privatising as many state assets as possible, ratcheting down public expenditure, lowering taxes on big business and on wealth, and introducing user charges for public services.  The latter inevitably leads to a devastation of those services and excludes huge sections of the population from accessing them.  This process of introducing user charges opens the way to the privatisation of public services, public enterprises and public assets, which is the real prize.  The IMF sets out to grab resources, create labour market pools and feed assets back to the vultures in the western corporate and financial sector.  After devastating Africa, the IMF repeated that achievement in Asia following the crisis there at the end of the 1990s.  It then intervened in Brazil and elsewhere, imposing the same conditionalities in return for so-called bailouts and thus imposing the same extraordinary damage on those economies.People need to understand that the proposed changes are utterly cosmetic and that the large economic powers will remain absolutely in control of the IMF.  Oxfam has roundly condemned the proposals for so-called reform as absolutely inadequate and as leaving the poorest countries in the world, including those in sub-Saharan Africa — all of the countries which have been victims of the IMF — with virtually no representation of any significance within the organisation and no opportunity to influence its policies.  All that is being done is to increase very slightly the voting strength of the so-called BRIC countries.  It is indicative of the notion of democracy in institutions such as the IMF and also indicative of a capitalist notion of democracy generally.  Democracy to most of us means everyone having an equal vote and an equal say.  This is not how it works in the IMF.  It works like the democracy of a private corporation whereby those with the most shares have the most say.  It is not that every voter has an equal weight but rather those with the most money have the most voting power.  This shift in the structure of the board simply recognises that Brazil, China, Russia, India and South Africa, are now major players in the global economy and emerging global powers.  Their economic strength has to be reflected by them being brought into the club of dominant powers within the IMF, in order to then dictate and ram down the throats of everybody else in the world the economic policies which suit their interests and which subscribe to a particular ideological doctrine which I have described, one of privatisation, the slashing of public services, smashing up protections for workers and for the environment.  This is the agenda.  Even that cosmetic change, which is certainly not a move towards any notion of real democracy or international co-operation or solidarity, has been forced on them.  The reason it has been forced on them was that in the aftermath of the Asian crisis, Asian countries and places like Brazil, which had been devastated by IMF policies, started to pull out of the IMF.  They refused to give it money, to the point that the IMF had to start selling gold in order to replenish its funds and, interestingly, move into the bond market.  This is where it gets really interesting.  In 2008, Dominique Strauss-Kahn talked about the IMF diversifying into investment into corporate bonds and state bonds.  We do not know who are the bondholders but one has to wonder if the IMF moved into bonds in 2008, whether the IMF bondholders are in the Irish banks, in Anglo, and whether they are the ones we are repaying.  The judgment of people who know a lot about the IMF is not one that gives much reason for optimism.For example, in October, the Brazilian President Dilma Rousseff, said that Brazil would put more money into the fund in exchange for more voting rights but then she went on to criticise IMF conditionality.  She said: "We will never accept, as participants of the IMF, that certain conditions that were imposed on us be imposed on other countries."  He pointed to and understood the way the IMF works——

Yes, but wait until the Minister feels the effects.  He should look at what the IMF did to other countries.Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel prize-winning economist who worked closely with the IMF for ten years until he became a whistleblower on the reality of the IMF, was damning in his description of the IMF.  He said:When the IMF arrives in a country, they are interested in only one thing: how do we make sure the banks and financial institutions are paid.  It is the IMF that keeps the financial speculators in business.  They are not interested in development or what helps to get a country out of poverty.This is the view of an insider who knows and whose economic credentials are unquestioned.  This is who we are huddling up to and for whom we are doing favours.  This is the body we are helping to re-legitimise in order to get a few crumbs off its table.  I warn the Minister however cute he may imagine he is being, in the nod and a wink politics of doing it a little favour and it will do us a favour in return, the IMF is playing him.  It is playing him like it has played every other country in which it has ever intervened.  As Joseph Stiglitz said, all it is interested in is giving the money back to the banks and the financial institutions and the speculators and it does not care about poverty, economic recovery or anything else.  The IMF has admitted to these motives.The issue of jobs is one of the most important issues facing this country.  I ask what is the IMF attitude towards job creation.  I refer to the IMF website where it is stated that the IMF admits that its support to countries is not structured with the centrality of jobs in mind.  That is for sure.  In fact, what the IMF demands of countries is the massacre of jobs in the public sector. The IMF programme has a policy to keep slashing jobs.On the question of who benefits, I will draw the attention of the Minister to recent replies to parliamentary questions.  They provide some indication of who benefits from the massacre of jobs in the public sector.  I have not received all the replies from Departments as most of them are stonewalling me about supplying detailed answers.  The replies provide all the narrative of attacking the public sector which is being reinforced by the IMF.  It is the policy to make savings by axing public sector jobs.  An audit of this practice is required across the board.  One small State agency under the Minister's auspices, the National Sports Council, has eight agency staff employed through employment agencies, Orange, Hays and Calix.  Six of those staff cost €264,000 a year.  If those were directly employed, those staff would cost €203,000, a difference of €51,000.  This is the cost of outsourcing to a private agency, Orange.  This difference of €51,000 is profit for those employment agencies paid for from public moneys.  Another worker could be employed for that amount or a saving could be made.  The Hays agency earned €76,000 for the provision of one staff member and if that individual were to be employed directly it would cost the State €51,000.  Calix provides one employee at a cost of €83,000 and if employed directly this employee would cost the State €51,000.  If this is repeated across the public sector, local authorities and State agencies, it amounts to a loss to the Exchequer, apart from anything else, of millions and millions of euro.  It could be tens of millions of euro or possibly hundreds of millions of euro.My own local authority, Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, has a budget of €220 million and €140 million was spent on outsourcing to private contractors.  I could not get any answers as to how much was being paid to private contractors and whether it was value for money.  The private contractors, the consultants, benefit.  This is what the IMF forces on us.  We are told to do away with decent and secure jobs, well-paid jobs and jobs that are good value for money for the public and to replace them with agency staff who have fewer rights but the private operator makes a nice fat profit.Will we do anything about this?  We will probably do nothing because the IMF's ideological position is that we must privatise and cut jobs, which is what it demands in its stability programme.The other thing about the IMF that should worry us is just how bad it is at predicting the impact of its own economic and structural adjustments — the so-called programmes.  It admits on its website that it fails to predict growth in economies, confirming that its "GDP growth forecasts showed a tendency to systematically exceed outcomes."  "This phenomenon", it noted, "was particularly prevalent in countries with an IMF-supported program."  It is important to note this failure when considering our prospects as we reel under the impact of IMF austerity, cutbacks, privatisations and the sale of State assets.  If there is any justification for these measures, it must be that somehow — magically — they will produce economic growth.  The IMF admits, however, that it has been proven wrong in all countries where it has imposed its programmes telling them they may feel a little pain for a while but will eventually recover.  Its programmes have not produced growth and employment but the opposite, namely, stagnation and recession.  The banks and corporations which were moving in on the state assets and natural resources of the countries in question got their money, however.  That is the real agenda of the IMF.While the Minister may not be remotely interested in my next point, it may be of some interest to members of the public.  The reason the IMF was under pressure to make changes and the reason organisations such as Oxfam commented on the role of the institution was that by the end of the 1990s people had grown sick and tired of what it was doing to the world.  This led to massive protests in Seattle, Genoa, Prague and elsewhere which became known as the anti-globalisation movement.  The protests rounded on the IMF and World Bank for the way they had ravaged countries with their neoliberal wrecking doctrine which had caused massive poverty, major increases in child mortality, the destruction of infrastructure and the rape of the assets and natural resources of developing countries.  Such was the scale of the anti-globalisation movement, which reached its high point when millions of people — peasant groups, community groups, trade unions and others — took to the streets of cities around the world to say the IMF had wrecked their societies, caused immense poverty and accelerated growth in the gap between rich and poor, that the institution found itself in serious trouble and its future in question.  As a result, it was forced to start to make what appeared to be concessions but which were simply efforts to bolster the real character of the institution.  As we know, the true nature of the IMF and World Bank is to act as the bootboys of global capitalism.  They are modelled on a corporate structure in which those who have money call the shots.  We should not be taken in for a moment by the suggestion that we will somehow gain something out of the IMF-ECB programme.  By saddling us with the debts of bondholders, the IMF and ECB will cripple growth and the economy.  The programme will be used as an excuse to ram down our throats the neoliberal dogma that has wrecked Africa and Asia and done extreme damage to Latin America.When the Government develops its policy of essentially sucking up to the ECB, IMF and other institutions I wonder if it has any sense of history or knows anything about what the IMF has done elsewhere in the world.  Does it listen to experts such as Joseph Stiglitz or Paul Krugman?  Who does it listen to and from whom does it take advice on how to deal with these matters?  I was given a little insight in this regard yesterday in a response to a parliamentary question I had submitted to the Department of Finance.  This shocking information I received may or may not be in the public domain.  The reply stated that in 2010 the National Treasury Management Agency paid out €6.2 million to the Rothschild Group for advice on how to deal with the banking crisis.  While the payment was made under the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, I ask the Minister if he will indicate whether the Department continues to take advice from this company and if the Government was taking advice from it at the time of the bank guarantee.  Notwithstanding how the Minister may answer those questions, the Department was taking advice from the Rothschild Group at the end of 2010 when we were deciding whether to sign up to the EU-IMF programme.Rothschild is a bond trading company which represents the global super-rich, the multimillionaires and multibillionaires who hold our bonds.  Let us get this straight.  The Department, under the Minister's predecessor, paid €6.2 million to ask the representatives of the bondholders if we should repay their clients.  Not surprisingly, the Rothschild Group advised that the bondholders should be repaid.  The decision to follow its advice has sunk the country.  While the Minister has become more muted on this issue, at the time he was critical of the decision to repay the bondholders, describing it as morally wrong and economically unsustainable to ransom the country to protect the interests of bankers and bondholders.  He made a statement to this effect in February of this year.  Given that bondholders would benefit from the advice that we should sacrifice the economy and impose brutal austerity on citizens, one would expect Rothschild to offer it free of charge.  Instead, it charged us €6.2 million for doing so, which is amazing.  Talk about golden circles; not only do such circles operate at the crony level of this country but we are now linked into the golden circles of the IMF, the Rothschild Group and bondholders, with the ECB dictating policy.  It beggars belief that this company is advising us.Rather than trying to prop up a vulture institution such as the IMF or give it any legitimacy, we should tell it and the bondholders to get lost.  We should address our problems rather than become the victims of what are essentially drug pushers who are pressing us to take on the debt and austerity that will cripple our society and economy.  This is what the IMF has done everywhere else.I make the following point due to sheer frustration.  At a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform I asked members of the Fiscal Advisory Council,  which monitors the Government's macroeconomic policy, about the council's growth projections.  Irish growth projections have been already been downgraded and, as I noted, the IMF admits it always gets its projections wrong.  Various reports, experts, media articles and so on which projected a return to growth in 2012 or 2013 have subsequently been revised as the authors realised closer to the relevant time that we would not achieve growth.  In light of the downgrading of Ireland's projected rate of growth for next year, I pointed out to the Fiscal Advisory Council that its charts showing an upward curve from 2013 onwards indicate that it predicts austerity will produce growth from 2013 onwards.They have also admitted that their initial growth projection for 2012 was wrong.  They are continuing to say there will be increased growth in 2013 and 2014.  I asked them to outline the evidence that those growth projections are accurate in any way.  They could not answer.  Their projections are collations of the growth projections of the IMF, the Central Bank and the ECB etc.  Where is the evidence for what they are all projecting?  In some cases, they are projecting on the basis of each other's projections.  When an organisation learns of the IMF's projection, it amends its own growth projection by a couple of points.  When I sought hard evidence and mentioned the concrete evidence before us that austerity is crippling the economy and strangling growth, I was eventually told that historical models form the basis for the growth projections.  That is alarming.What historical models are being used?  Is consideration being given to the history of the IMF everywhere it has gone?  I suggest we would be better off to look at the historical model of what happened in the 1920s and 1930s, when there was a crisis of the same sort.  The same policies of austerity were imposed and the result was the Great Depression.  That is where we are heading now.  The IMF is leading us down the track towards a depression.  We should tell it to get stuffed.

I would like to make a few points in response to Deputy Boyd Barrett, who spoke as usual with great passion.  I disagreed with virtually everything he said.  He made the point that no concrete evidence was produced when he asked people about our growth projection figures for 2013 and beyond.  Perhaps his mind is so clouded with conspiracy theories that he fails to realise one cannot have concrete evidence of predictions for growth two or three years into the future.  Concrete evidence does not exist in those circumstances.  A prediction is a prediction.  Economists are often wrong.  In this country, economists in the Department of Finance and elsewhere have been wrong over the years.  Similarly, economists in the IMF and in other countries in Europe and across the world have been wrong.

One cannot have concrete evidence in support of that.  I do not understand why the Deputy spoke so passionately about this legislation.  Although it is modest in its content, it is quite progressive.  It will bring an end to the system whereby the largest IMF member states are allowed to appoint members to the board of the IMF.  Instead, all future members of the board will be elected.  I would have thought the Deputy would be in favour of that.  It is certainly positive from an Irish point of view.

Some 53% of our borrowings from the IMF will now attract the lower rate of interest.  That is positive for Irish citizens and taxpayers.  The 2008 quota reform had a smaller effect.  It increased our quota from 0.392% to 0.528% and just 19.3% of our borrowings from the IMF attracted the lower interest rate.I am always struck by those Members and people outside the House who decry the role of the IMF in this country.  I would certainly prefer it if the IMF was not here and the Government's objective is to ensure it is out of here as soon as possible.  Like Deputy Boyd Barrett, I support the public sector.  The reality is that if the IMF was not here now, the public sector would be decimated because we would have to correct our budget deficit in one go.  The €3.8 billion adjustment that the Ministers, Deputies Noonan and Howlin, had to make last week through cuts and tax increases would be an €18 billion adjustment in the absence of the IMF, and it would have to be made in one go.

They are protecting our public sector and our economy.  We have to ensure they are out of here as soon as possible.  Deputy Boyd Barrett gave examples of countries where, according to him, the IMF has played a less than positive role.  For this country, the most immediate example of a country that received IMF assistance is Britain.  The IMF spent two years in Britain in the early 1970s.  The British economy grew and went from strength to strength after the IMF left.  I accept that Deputy Boyd Barrett might have understandable misgivings about later decisions that were made, in the 1980s.  The early 1970s was a desperate time in Britain, which is our closest neighbour.  The experience in Britain is the best example to use when we speak about the removal of the IMF from our economy, which we hope will happen over the next few years.  The intervention of the IMF worked successfully there.  I hope it will work successfully here too.

The Deputy is entitled to his views on the person in question.Other issues were raised by other Members.  Deputy Mac Lochlainn spoke about the Government's promises.  He said that prior to the last election, there was solidarity among all parties other then those in government at the time.  He said the current Government promised to renegotiate the IMF deal.  Not only did we make such a promise, but we have secured the renegotiation of the IMF deal.  As a result, the lowest paid workers in the economy have benefited from the restoration of the minimum wage to the level it was before it was cut by Fianna Fáil and the Green Party, in agreement with the IMF, before this year's general election.  It was restored by this Government.  We also managed to negotiate a significant reduction in the interest rates we will have to pay in the future.  Patently, it is a lie to say in this Chamber that the Government has not renegotiated the deal.  It might not be the type of renegotiation that Deputy Mac Lochlainn and others might have wished for, but it has happened nonetheless.  There is room for further renegotiation in the future.Deputy Mac Lochlainn made a blanket statement to the effect that Fine Gael and the Labour Party promised not to pay bank debt if they were elected.  No such promise was made.  In advance of the general election, members of my party said that extra taxpayers' money should not be invested in the bank formerly known as Anglo Irish Bank.  We have not put any extra taxpayers' money into that bank since the election.  Contrary to what Deputy Boyd Barrett said, the current Government has secured a reduction of almost €7 billion in payments to bondholders in Anglo Irish Bank.  That has been done by means of agreed haircuts, to use that awful term, since Deputy Noonan became Minister for Finance.  Contrary to the view that bondholders are being repaid in full, with agreement, I assure the House that Anglo Irish Bank bondholders have not been repaid in full by this Government.

If it did not have a presence in this country, we would be paying extortionate amounts to borrow money on the markets.  The reality is that if we were not receiving the support of the IMF, the public sector would be decimated.  Perhaps Deputy Boyd Barrett can outline his understanding of the nature of banks and financial institutions.  I do not think they consist solely of those who run them — chairman and board members, etc.  Banks essentially comprise the deposit holders who put money into them, either individually or as part of businesses.  It makes no sense to create the notion that if we unilaterally burn bondholders across the board it will have no effect.  Numerous media reports in recent months, indeed in recent days, point out that the burning of bondholders would have a very significant effect on credit unions in this country because they are significant investors in banks.  The financial institutions of Ireland and the world are intertwined in a very complicated and messy way.  It is not as simple as saying that any unilateral decision by the Government would not have a direct effect, in this case on ordinary credit union members throughout the country.  For the most part, these are working people who are just trying to put some euro by or get a small loan when they need to get some work done on their house, for their family or in their business.

I remember in secondary school — which was not all that long ago — reading about the Bretton Woods agreement.  Thanks to the Oireachtas Library and Information Service I have had the chance to read some more about the agreement in recent days in preparation for speaking in the Chamber.The Bretton Woods agreement was established at the end of the Second World War, following a conference in New Hampshire in the United States at which 44 allied countries came together to examine the crisis that emerged in Europe prior to that war and at what emerged in the United States in the context of the Great Depression.  They wanted to look at the difficulties that arose during that conflict and to try to plan an economic future for the world in the post-war situation.At the time it was decided that all international currencies would be more or less linked to the dollar which, in turn, would be linked to the gold standard.  That situation survived until 1971 or 1972, when the link between the gold standard and the dollar was broken.  The Bretton Woods agreement also established the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, the latter focusing primarily on investing in underdeveloped countries throughout the world while the function of the IMF was to ensure the operation of the global economy into the future.  By and large, that criterion, the challenge established at the end of the Second World War, has been fulfilled.This Bill goes some of the way towards ensuring that the IMF is more representative of the world as it now stands, and of the new strengths of economies and societies across that world.  It also ensures a fully democratic election of the people who run the IMF into the future.  I do not understand how anybody could do other than support that.
#SeanFleming	unknown-#SeanFleming-party	unknown-#SeanFleming-dob	unknown-#SeanFleming-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this legislation, the Bretton Woods Agreements (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill 2011.  This amending legislation specifically eliminates the category of appointed executive directors and requires them to be elected.  This measure forms part of the ongoing governance reforms at the International Monetary Fund, which we welcome.  It is an improvement, a point well made by previous speakers.People have an idea what the IMF is about.  I wish to mention some particular points about its operation and our role.  We are part of the IMF.  Some people believe it is some kind of enemy, just as some people in this House believe the EU is the enemy on the mainland while Ireland is out in the mid-Atlantic.  We are part of the EU.  These people are not just semi-detached Members, they are completely detached from some of the financial realities.Our subscription and voting power in the IMF are a central component of that organisation's financial resources.  Each member country — we are one such — is assigned a quota based broadly on its relative position in the world economy.  A member country's quota determines its maximum financial contribution and its voting power and has a bearing on its access to IMF financing.  Normally, a member state can borrow up to 200% of its quota annually, and up to 600% cumulatively.  Higher amounts can be borrowed in exceptional circumstances.  Deputy Phelan mentioned that when a country borrows within its agreed limits it receives a preferable rate but if it borrows above that rate it will get a different interest rate, also preferable relative to what is available on the international market but not as good as the first kind.  Some people might disagree with that description.As to access to financing, the amount a member can obtain from the IMF is based on its quota.  For example, under the stand-by and extended arrangements a member can borrow up to 600% cumulatively, over a period.  There is a fancy term for this — "special drawing rights".  It is a little like the green pound that used to exist in the EU.  It took me a long time to get my head around that one.  There was the green pound and there was the euro.  Who had the green pound?  I never saw one.  It was a fictional mathematical construct, if I may so describe it.  It was not actually a currency but a figure on which people based transactions.  A special drawing right is a little bit like that.  These rights are allocated to member countries by the IMF.  A country's IMF quota, the maximum amount of financial resources it is obligated to contribute to the fund, determines its allocation or allotment of special drawing rights.  I reiterate, special drawing rights are not a currency but represent a claim to a currency held by a IMF member countries for which they may be exchanged.  They can be exchanged in the main currencies: euro, Japanese yen, UK pounds, US dollars, and their value is determined by a basket of these currencies.  We are in the territory of a nebulous concept.  However, countries can translate this back into their home currencies even if those were not the starting currency.  That is the bottom line.I wish to mention some points about the IMF.  First, people must recognise it is the lender of last resort to countries in financial trouble.  The chief responsibility is to ensure stability of the international monetary system.  This began with the gold standard after the world war.   The dollar then took over as the base currency in the world.  If we do not have an international monetary system we cannot buy and sell abroad, or complete transactions.  Ireland would be one of the countries that would have the most difficulty if there were ever a problem in that regard because ours is one of the most open economies.  That has major advantages and disadvantages.  If there is a downturn worldwide we suffer but there is also maximum advantage in that if there is a bit of a pick-up, because we are so open, as a small country we can hop in very quickly and benefit from being an open economy.International Monetary Fund financing provides member countries with the breathing space and room they need to correct problems in their balance of payments.  Often there is criticism of the IMF, as we heard a short time ago.  I will touch on some aspects that were mentioned in the Chamber.  It is fair to state that the basic problem with the IMF model was that the latest financial crisis had its origin in the private sector.  Basically, the IMF is there to bail out countries but much of the problem worldwide was due, in part, to governments overspending.  I am one of those who believe that deficits in Europe and the United States are contributory causes to some of the overall instability.  China and other nations had to issue warnings.  We are all living beyond our means.  In western democracies we expect others to continue to provide loans then we complain when there is a drying up of liquidity.  The point is, if one is living within one's means one does not need to borrow.  There is a very simple way not to become involved in this problem — live within one's means and operate a balanced budget.  That point keeps getting lost in this debate.  Banks and private investors lent too much money under too little supervision to fast-growing developing countries, including to Ireland.  They pulled the money when the liquidity squeeze happened.  it is important to recognise that.I do not know how Ireland was ranked after the Second World War.  Now, however, I am sure there are corporations throughout the world besides the big multinationals we all know, the pharmaceutical and IT companies, oil exploration and construction businesses, that could be ranked in this way.  Ireland would be a very small player.  Even some of the biggest countries in Europe would not match in size and scale the turnover of some of the biggest corporations in the world.  Their role in the world economy is far greater than the role of the overwhelming majority of governments.  The IMF has not yet come to terms with that.  The next review of its activities will have to deal with the issue of international business separate from government business.  I understand how 60 years ago when the IMF was established government business was the world's main activity and there was not as much international trade as there is now.  For example, last week's budget had to make an adjustment of €3.8 billion.  Recently, I read Ryanair actually has the same amount in bank deposits.  While I am not suggesting there is a link between the two, it shows how large the scale of activity of some private companies can be.  Ryanair, while one of Ireland's larger companies, it is not up there with the Dells and Microsofts which could buy and sell Ireland before breakfast if they wanted to.The difficulties with Lehman Brothers and others were brought about partly by the private sector, not wholly by governmental decisions.  The IMF has no mechanism to deal with these types of issues.  I am probably in a minority in the House when I say I prefer the American to the European system.  When an American financial institution goes bankrupt, it is let go bust just like Lehman Brothers.  Europe has a different approach which has more to do with the social democracy view people have and how they are afraid of the consequences.  We had Anglo Irish Bank which was bankrupt but Europe would not let it go bust.  Europe needs to cross the Rubicon and allow companies go bust.  It is a sign of weakness of the EU that it cannot face up to these situations the way the Americans did.  Life goes on and, believe it or not, people forget about these events in a few years.The other night on radio I made it clear I do not like all these EU summits with Heads of State because there is too much politics and ego.  Several of the current European leaders have large egos and like to see themselves strutting around the place.  I have said before that I would prefer if these matters were solved by the finance Ministers.  Taking the egos, the big politics and prime ministers out of the equation will mean far more progress could be made.  At every summit, all one sees are politicians putting a political solution to what is inherently a financial problem.  While any deal must be presented to member state parliaments and be saleable to their people, it must be started by and worked on by the Ministers with responsibility for financial measures.  I suspect they would get to the brass tacks of the problem much quicker than their prime ministers.Some claim the IMF destroyed Ireland.  It must be recognised it is only providing one quarter of the programme funding.  The rest is provided by the National Pensions Reserve Fund, the European Central Bank and the European Union.  People love to have someone to blame and it is understandable if its suits some to blame the IMF for our economic problems.I would like if Deputy Boyd Barrett followed his thinking through with his claim the IMF has no role in employment creation.  Is he asking the IMF to run the country for us?  My approach is to request a loan from the IMF, pay it back in time and let the IMF butt out.  Instead, the socialist Deputy spent half an hour in a tirade giving out about the IMF and then complained it is not creating employment or stimulating economic growth.  Does he want the IMF to supplant the democratically elected Government?  We may need some financial assistance by way of borrowing but we do not need any IMF assistance in running the country or deciding our priorities of expenditure in employment creation, health and education.  I am surprised Deputy Boyd Barrett went down that particular route.  While the IMF may have much evolving to do with its approach to private sector industry, as I outlined earlier, its main role is to protect countries in financial trouble and ensure the stability of the international monetary system.I thank the Minister for Finance for facilitating meetings between Opposition spokespersons and the troika members when in Dublin in July and October.  While probably not a popular thing to say, A. J. Chopra is one of the most reasonable men I ever met.  When he arrived in October, he said the budgetary adjustment must be €3.8 billion but it was up to the democratically elected Government to make the decisions as to how it would reach those targets.  Some Ministers recognise they have the scope to make decisions once it is within the financial basket allowed.  Weaker Ministers, however, blame all their decisions on the EU-IMF deal we signed.  Regardless of whether an EU or IMF official had to come to Ireland, for our own good we needed to stop spending €15 billion more than we were taking in taxation.  It reminds me of those towns and villages which say they must do up their streets and buildings to make them look nice for the tourists.  We should be making it nice for ourselves in the first place.  Likewise, we should be correcting our own finances for our own good, not for the EU-ECB-IMF.As an accountant I tend to have a black-and-white view of issues, leaving aside the politics and concentrating on their financial brass tacks.  It may come as a surprise to some but I recall telling several journalists I always believed the IMF would be in Ireland during the course of last year.  In fact, before it arrived in November 2010 and when Ireland was trying to raise funds on the markets, I warned senior colleagues at a parliamentary meeting that Ireland was swimming in waters infested by financial sharks trying to destroy us.  All they wanted was to make a quick buck on Ireland and did not care what yield they charged once they could make that killing.  I recommended Ireland should get out of those waters and find a safe port of call, namely the EU and the IMF.It was in that context that I said that at a parliamentary party meeting.  In September last year, I had a detailed conversation with my deceased colleague, Brian Lenihan, who was Minister for Finance at the time, about the IMF coming into the Ireland in the near future.  He could not confirm that would happen but it was always a possibility.  He had been in contact with the IMF over the summer and the fund was satisfied Ireland was making the necessary adjustments at that stage.  My message to him and to several other Ministers at the time was that we should not build the IMF up as the big bad wolf because it might be our saviour.  Language like that was being used to put that image in the minds of the people.That is why I do not follow the fixation most people have with Ireland returning to the bond market.  I said at the time that the IMF had to be involved in a financing arrangement.  The fund provides a loan, the same as the international financial sharks wanted to do at an exorbitant rate, that we repay and it does not run the country.  We are better off dealing with the ECB, EU and eurozone and the international organisations of which we are a member.  I would be happier if Ireland and other countries had their finances on an even keel long term instead of having to listen every morning to what is happening to Portuguese, Italian or French bond yields.  The bond ratings of European countries will be revised downward by the rating agencies because we crossed the Rubicon when some Greek debt was written off.  The US had its rating downgraded recently and there is no reason to believe this will not happen in Europe.  Let us not get too excited about this.  Once we have a proper system in place at EU-IMF level and we get our deficit under control, thereby reducing the amount we have to borrow, Ireland will work well.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I am glad to have an opportunity to contribute to the debate.  I compliment Deputy Fleming on his remark that the appearance of the IMF does not mean an evil doer has appeared whose determination is to undermine the economy.  The IMF is an entity that has come at our hour of need to offer assistance and it is not a free benefactor.  Financial assistance is not offered to any country without a price tag.  I compliment the Minister for Finance and the Government on their success to date in achieving a number of amendments that resulted in a considerable reduction in the debt facing the country.Deputy Fleming referred to the atmosphere that prevailed a year or more ago.  The problem was that the country had been fed a diet of reassurance during the previous three years.  From 2007 onwards, we were told morning, noon and night that the economy would experience a soft landing and everybody would be okay.  These commentators were wrong and there was a crash landing.  On top of that, there was an urgent necessity to seek a means whereby we could work our way out of it.Over the past number of months, a succession of Members has told the House we should get more money from the banks and spend more while not paying the banks back and burning the bondholders.  What a sequence of events to resolve an economic crisis.  Over the past few days, a succession of Members has told the people not to pay a local tax, for example.  They said they will resist it and they will advise others to resist it and they will not pay.  Do they not realise our debt is a massive problem, which must be repaid?  If we do not do so, we will be ridiculed and isolated by those who have the ability to assist us.It is a long time since I was involved in a small business.  I cannot understand why it has become accepted practice in the House and among experts outside the House to proclaim the notion that we should burn bondholders even though we want money off them next year and we should then burn them next year even though we will not have enough money for the year after to run our own affairs.  I have never experienced anything like this in my life and I do not know where this has come from.  However, it has become an accepted political ideology.  Deputy Fleming blamed socialists but this is not a socialist notion.  There are plenty of socialists and Members with a social conscience on this side of the House who are equally conscious of the needs of people as those who proclaim to have the answer to all their problems.  It is not an ideology of the left or right; it is an ideology of irresponsibility.  They are feeding the fears of people and telling them that if they follow their recipe, they will end up in a better position.  However, we will end up in a worse position as a country and as an economy.  The late Minister for Finance, Brian Lenihan, made difficult decisions.  What a pity his party had not made them eight or ten years previously.  Fortunately, the people decided that the incoming Government would have to do the same thing.I refer to Ireland's position in comparison to other member states in the emerging European scene.  We have a useful role to play, as we can be seen as the country that achieved spectacular success over a short period, provided we meet our targets.  The only problem in comparison to the recession in the 1980s is that property prices are still inflated.  Those who were Members in the 1980s will recall that anybody who had a job could borrow to buy a home but that does not apply anymore because property prices are still too inflated and out of the reach of ordinary people.  People are applying for and being refused mortgages.  Many people write and e-mail us to tell us how well paid we are and how much more should be taken off us.

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	310	As does the Deputy.I could not afford the mortgages that most of my constituents have been given.  Given that their properties are in negative equity, I cannot understand how in the current climate we can deal with this issue unless there is a dramatic reduction in the value of residential property.  The economy was based on a standard equivalent to the discovery of an unlimited supply of oil except the currency was cement and concrete.  At that time, some Deputies criticised this and said no houses should be built on the land that has been zoned for housing.  Everybody forgot that the houses could not be built unless the land had been zoned in the first place.The IMF has been reasonably fair to us and it is up to us to make the programme work.  If we cannot do so, then we must admit that we are not capable of being at the table.  This is about our economic space and whether we can stand up and be counted in the global economy is a matter for ourselves.  We can burn all the bondholders we want, we can refuse to pay all the taxes we want and we can encourage others not to pay the taxes that are being levied.We compare that with all other economies throughout Europe and ask ourselves are we really serious in what we are about.  The answer is this.  If we continue the way we did in the last 15 years or so, we will go nowhere fast.  The first thing we must do is recognise the full extent of our problems, deal with them as best we can and try to work our way out of them.The Acting Chairman will remember people saying in recent months that we must get the same deal the Greeks got.  Do we remember that?  What did they get?  It is a serious problem.  The same applies to every other country, both inside and outside the European Union.  If we do not stand up and accept our responsibilities, or if we run away, there are consequences.There is another part of this in terms of running away.  We are in a very hostile and volatile economic and speculative situation in terms of money markets worldwide.  The modern technology that has been developed and is now available throughout the world is a huge asset to those who want to speculate.  If there had been modern technology during the depression of the 1930s, people would have been able to act much more quickly, but it is now in place.  In the time since the Acting Chairman took the Chair, billions have been moved by market speculators all over the world.  It is a sobering thought, but it is happening all the time.  The only hope we have is to be within a regime that carries some weight and clout.  That includes the EMU and all that goes with it.Another question has been speculated about for the past year or two, namely, "What should I invest my money in?"  Obviously, speculators are asking the same thing and deciding accordingly.  We have not fully thought this out.  A scenario put forward by many is to go back to our own punt and be masters in our own house or find some means of getting on board the pound sterling.  We are forgetting reality.  The fact is the world has changed in terms of monetary order, regulation and speculation.  A rapid speed has taken over.  The one point we must recognise is that whatever breakdown takes place, although we sincerely hope it does not, we must hope the euro prevails.  The euro is the single biggest currency block we have known in our time.  It is still a strong currency.  For those who speculate otherwise, it is merely an attempt to undermine it.  However, if it is undermined by those who want to do that, the consequences for all, including those who undermine it, will be great.  That will be felt in due course.  We do not live in a bubble.  As John Donne put it, we are not an island anymore.  We are part and parcel of the global economy.  When we are in that arena, we have to soldier up, put our shoulder to the wheel, take our responsibilities seriously, act responsibly and be seen to do so.  All that together will create at least some indication that we intend to go about our business in a proper fashion.I raised an issue some years ago in the House when it became evident that the Bretton Woods agreement would be called into focus once again.  The issue concerns the degree of speculation and hoarding and the flight of capital from one jurisdiction to another.  The British and German governments a few years ago attempted to gain access to deposit accounts and account numbers in another country outside the EU but sufficiently close to it to have common arrangements.  I know they achieved a certain degree of success.  The reason they went after those accounts is that they were worried about the level of hiding of capital that had flown from some jurisdictions to others, which, of course, cannot be allowed as it would have serious negative consequences for all.  This amendment means that among our Government and across the EU there is a recognition that times have changed and the degree of commitment and liability by various member states throughout the EU, and the degree to which they can impact on the IMF, has changed dramatically.  Ours is a case in point.The potential for invisible savings to accrue to a member state, as is the case here, is immeasurable.  It is of huge importance and an issue on which we want to compliment the Government and the Minister.  I wish them well in their future endeavours in this regard.There was a slogan some years ago which went "They never said it would be easy" — the Acting Chairman should recognise it coming from his constituency.  For those who pretend it is likely to become easy in the next three or four years, not only are they codding themselves but they are trying to cod the rest of us as well.  I have no doubt but that prudent management and careful economic planning, as already embarked upon by the Government, will result ultimately in the benefits to this country and its people that will be in line with projections.  That is something to which we should all aspire.

It is a difficult issue to speak on as it is not well known to the public, having been set up in 1944 and named after the place where the agreement was agreed and signed.  It has more relevance today than we would like to believe, however, and is a serious issue in terms of the IMF and so on.A previous speaker, Deputy Sean Fleming, was very hard on some of the views of the Technical Group.  I do not know why, but he is right to say what he wants to say.  He pointed out that it was not an evil.  I do not think anybody described the IMF's arrival in Ireland as evil.  Deputy Fleming went on to say at great length that he had raised this at the Fianna Fáil parliamentary party at the time.  Although I was excluded from it at that stage, I certainly did not hear anyone discussing it while I was there.  It does not tally well with the statements that were made by two Ministers of the day, now retired, former Deputies Noel Dempsey and Dermot Ahern.  When they were asked on a public platform about the IMF, they looked as if it was Santa Claus who was coming — they were in total disbelief.  I do not know if it was different at parliamentary party meetings, but that is what the Deputy stated so I take him at his word because he is not a man who ever tells fibs.  He is a serious politician and fairly responsible around financial issues as well, because he is qualified in that area also.Deputy Durkan referred to the socialists in Fine Gael.  I am glad to hear there are socialists in Fine Gael.  The Acting Chairman shares a constituency with me, and we are all socialists in a way, but I do not know where they were when——
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	314	Let us not worry about the constituency.  We should stick to the business.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	315	It is relevant to our constituency as well.  Did we not have a jibe from Deputy Durkan about sharing a tough constituency?  Every constituency is tough but I wonder where the socialists were when the budget was being formed.  I do not see many of them here today either.We are in serious economic times.  I can proudly say I voted against the EU-IMF agreement, not because I did not want them in here, as I honestly believe they should have been in here a year before they came — I fully agree with that — but because I disagree with their terms, their interference and the cover they provided for the last Government.Now the mantra has been adopted by this Government on every issue, whether it is a rise of tuppence on a gallon of petrol or a rise in the price of cigarettes.  The Government did not blame the IMF for the rise in the price of cigarettes, but my colleague coming in now, Deputy Finian McGrath, who voted for it too, likes cigarettes.  The Government blames the IMF and the EU for everything it does.  The public is sick and tired of this mantra because these bodies have nothing to do with it.  There is an agreement on loans we got from the IMF and EU and I was appalled at the interest rates imposed not so much by the IMF, but by the EU.  The package is certainly expensive.Within the Department, the Government and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, can do what they like.  There is plenty of scope for being fair and reasonable and spreading the load, and the load must be spread.  For some reason or other, which I do not know and which I cannot crack, and it was the same with the previous Government, there is an unwillingness — I am not shouting for a wealth tax — to spread the load among those who can afford it.  Child benefit is a case in point.  We are being told this mantra year in, year out that the Government cannot means test it — the officials are too busy and it would take too long.  The previous speaker spoke also about how we should be able to deal with issues now with modern technology.  It beggars belief that millionaires will state publicly in the media that they do not need the children's allowance, yet they get it.  There is an unwillingness to tackle such benefits, which are totally unfair and should be means tested so that only those who need it get it.It is a pity the IMF did not have more say in some issues in the budget two years ago when the previous Government brought in the pension levy which affected the lowest paid.  The levy has had a fairly serious effect.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes, will be aware, as I am, that in my county the council officials — low-paid ordinary workmen on the ground and male and female clerical workers — paid the pension levy.  What happened was that late one night before Christmas, a note or memo was passed to the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, for whom I have great regard, and the Government went back on imposing the pension levy on the fat cats.  It is a pity the IMF did not insist on it remaining.  It is a pity the IMF was not more forensic in dealing with where the waste and the unfairness really lie.  I note this amending legislation will ensure there will be more elected persons on the board of the IMF because there are too many bureaucrats — Mr. A. J. Chopra was mentioned — making decisions.There are also too many bureaucrats making decisions in this country.  There has been a succession of weak Ministers and weak taoisigh who not only allowed them but rewarded, appointed and promoted them, and brought in more of them.  Unfortunately, the Government has taken on the mantra of bringing in special advisers and breaking its own guidelines.  Apart from breaking the guidelines, it sends a rotten message to the public.  The public is taking serious doses of austerity, yet the Government seems to think that, within the number of streets where Government buildings are located, it can have a different law and do what it likes.  That sends out the wrong message.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, knows that as well as I do.  He was not happy about approving some of them, but it happened with the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Burton, and many others.  The other day the Taoiseach lectured Deputy Adams that he had bad advisers but, as I said to him, the Deputy does not have the same pot available to the Taoiseach to appoint special advisers.  I refer to unelected faceless bureaucrats who are good for spin and more spin.  It is such spin the Government does not know where to stop.  It is in a continuous spin.  The Government could fall off it some day, and that is what will happen because the public are sick and tired of it.They are also sick and tired of being lectured about austerity.  Deputy Durkan tells us about the socialists in the Fine Gael Party, but I do not know where they are.  Was it Brendan Grace who sung of "scuts in Fianna Fáil"?

I will promote his CD for Christmas if I can.  Certainly, we all should phone a friend and try to move them on.Deputy Durkan also stated that one learns something every day.  We certainly do, and it has been a steep learning curve since the IMF came in.  I believe it should have been in at least a year before it arrived.Regarding what Deputy Durkan stated, there were budgets over the past four years when I was sitting here as a backbencher.  The first two were fairly generous, but all the time the Members sitting opposite got up and complained it was not enough.  They said we did not give enough of an increase — we did not give enough of this or enough of that.  Collectively, Deputies on all sides of this House are responsible, as are the previous ones, many of whom are gone off into the sunset with their big pensions.  I might say a word about that too, if I am allowed, with the indulgence of my colleague and good friend in the Chair.The Opposition looked for more all the time and that is what happened.  It was auction politics.  Someone referred to the use of easy-auction politics and someone else referred yesterday to the car tax being removed in 1977.  Fianna Fáil removed it but Fine Gael was going to halve it, and I was only a buachaill óg.  I was out putting up posters.  We were delighted.  I only had a Honda 50 on which the tax was low anyway.  A Honda 50 gets you around.  I never thought I would get as far as I am now, but it could go back very fast too and it could be that I will never again be here.  While I am here, I will say what I want to say.Auction politics were very serious, and it continued repeatedly.  The Minister for Economic Planning and Development, Mr. Martin O'Donoghue, and others built castles in the sky and everything else, but we never thought of the rainy day.  We forgot about the rainy day, certainly in the past seven or eight years.  Many people out there did not, though, and they are the ones I meet now —  Deputy Durkan referred to them also — who have a few bob.  They do not have a great deal, enough to bury themselves and be comfortable if something happens to them or they become ill because one cannot get into hospital unless one has some money.  They want to know if their money is safe in the post office, the bank or wherever.  I cannot advise them because we are at the behest of the predatory sharks of the money markets.As for our own banks, we never hear of bank robberies now because all the robberies are going on inside in the banks.  They robbed the people blue.  I spoke to a lady only half an hour ago.  She is a business person, along with her husband, and was on her way to the bank this morning with a €500 cheque in an envelope to drop into the quick lodge.  She got a fairly nasty telephone call on the way, from a person doing his or her job, stating that she was €200 overdrawn since midnight owing to whatever cheques had not gone through.  Imagine it.  These are the banks that we insisted lend €3 billion each last year and the year before they had half the €3 billion each.  We call them the two pillar banks.  I do not know what I would call them.  They are not pillar banks anyway, and they have not a shred of decency among them.  I refer not to the ordinary staff, but to the boys in control.That is the kind of harassment that is going on of those who are trying to make a living, trying to stay in business and trying to keep afloat.  As the Minister will be aware, that is the kind of intimidation that is going on.

#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	336	I am.  The Acting Chairman could not be hard on me, a fellow Tipperary man.I have lost my train of thought.  I was speaking about the banks, and the treatment they are giving ordinary householders and small business.  Big businesses, as we saw, owe them €20 million, €30 million and €40 million and the banks cannot touch them, but if one goes €200 in the red, the banks will bounce one's cheques, charge referral fees and everything else.  What is happening is a disgrace.  The IMF does not have anything to do with that, but it has given us the loan.  We put the people's money into the banks and the banks are not playing fair.  It is unbelievable.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, heard — I spoke privately to him last week — about what another banking institution, Bank of Ireland Finance, did to a family in Tipperary.  I described it as worse than the Black and Tans, and it is.  They are terrorising the people.  A meeting was held in Abbeyleix last Monday night attended by 300 people, all of whom have horror stories about their treatment by financial institutions.  It is simply disgraceful and should not be tolerated.  This problem occurred under the last Government and is occurring under the watch of the current Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  While I know he is doing his best and cannot click his fingers to solve the problem over night, it is nothing short of outrageous.We are bailing out gangster banks.  I call them that because that is what they are.  I have been dealing with them since 1982, when I set up my own business, and I know what they are like.  Thank God, I am on the right side of them.  If I were not, they would have no mercy.  They are not assisting with any stimulation of the economy.  They are really clamping down on people and killing off initiative.A friend of mine, a small businessman from Clonmel, on having been visited by the Revenue Commissioners, which was demanding money with menaces, ended his own life — God help us — and left his family with the tragic consequences.  The county coroner in Tipperary, known by the Acting Chairman, Deputy Tom Hayes, stated publicly at the inquest into the death that what occurred was State terrorism.  These are not my words but the coroner's.  We have large numbers of shares in Allied Irish Banks and some in Bank of Ireland so the banks should be acting decently.It is not the ordinary men and women behind the counter or the front desk who are at fault but the whizz kids.  In fairness, there were bank managers who tried to hold the line and stop people from being given too much money, 100% loans, cars and holidays but they were laughed at and moved sideways to accommodate the whizz kids.  The more the latter gave out, the more commission they got.  Where are they now?  They are hiding like cowards from the people.  With their fat profits, they have moved to different locations in the country and do not have to deal with the misery they created.It is not the ordinary man and woman behind the counter or the front desk who are at fault but the whizz kids.

With their fat profits, they have moved to different locations in the country and do not have to deal with the misery they created.We have a lot to do.  I am probably straying a little from the Bretton Woods agreement but my remarks are all relevant to IMF funding of this country.  The IMF should have been here long before it came.  It did not come on time.  Nobody is running away from this problem and we must all deal with it daily.  Every family, both here and abroad, must do so, yet we are trying to tax them time and again.Other speakers stated we should not be advocating the non-payment of charges.  I never did that in my life but I am now.  When I see a measure that is totally unfair and discriminates against rural dwellers, I will put up my hand and object.  Of course I will because all law must be fair.I agree with the amendments requiring that one be elected.  Too many unelected people are making decisions that affect our lives.  They are telling us what we can and cannot do.  Hey presto, a fines Bill is to be introduced shortly.  It is promised legislation and I must ask the Ceann Comhairle about it tomorrow if I get a chance.  The fines Bill will allow the State to take fines from one's wages or social welfare payments.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	337	We will speak to this Bill today.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	338	Yes, but this is all part of the Bill.  There are many Bills we do not like but we must pay the charges.  Where are we going to stop?  If we do not stop, there will be anarchy in this country.  The laws are in existence to protect the vultures.  Those who borrowed recklessly and owe millions to the banks cannot be touched.  Seánie got a telephone call from the gardaí asking him to come down to see them, whereas if one of us were involved, they would send out a paddy-wagon and bring us in.  What is wrong?  Why the silk gloves?  There is a cartel that extends right to the top.The Government sent its man to Europe and has got him over the ditch now.  He was on the ditch for a while but the Government pushed him over; he has gone in.  I refer to Mr. Cardiff.  Will we call that the Cardiff agreement?  Irrespective of what we call it, it is despicable.  If the Minister, Taoiseach and Tánaiste had spent more time in recent weeks visiting other European countries to achieve some kind of half-decent deal last weekend, with a view to not falling out with our nearest neighbour, Britain, it would have been beneficial.  While I appreciate that they were on the telephone talking to the relevant UK authorities, I contend that we need our nearest neighbour as our trading partner.  Trade with the United Kingdom is considerable and must be maintained.If there had been more readiness, research and side meetings with a view to achieving a proper agreement last week, and if the Taoiseach and the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, had worn the green jersey rather than lobbying European colleagues to ensure Mr. Cardiff would get over the line, it would have been better.  I accept that the Government wanted to get rid of him because he knew too much about what went on.  He was at the very heart of proceedings on the night of the bank guarantee and now the Government has got rid of him.  What credibility have we in Europe, in the name of God?  What credibility do we have, having done so much canvassing and lobbying to get Mr. Cardiff into his new job?  Will the IMF ever leave us if it sees the kind of reckless behaviour that resulted in the incorrect invoicing or the failure to account for €3.6 billion?

I am referring to what occurred over the past ten years, during which time Mr. Cardiff was in office.  If he is so inept at his job here, why do we now shove him out to Europe?  The Government canvassed the various parties and groupings in the European Parliament — I cannot think of their names — and changed the mind of Mr. Seán Kelly, MEP, and others.

I will have to have overtime as a consequence.  I have the same right to time to speak as anybody else.I have identified the culture of greed over ten years, the pain, the position on two former taoisigh and the various agreements.  I stated some nights ago I am against the Croke Park agreement because it is untenable and unviable.  It will not last because it results in increments totalling a couple of hundred million euro not for the ordinary person on the ground or staff in the offices, but for the staff on top.  They got away without paying the pension levy.  I could not understand why the IMF did not go through such issues forensically and target the waste.  The waste is continuing.  The Taoiseach may have stated on television he will do away with the Seanad.  He had red ears yesterday evening at the parliamentary party meeting and he had red ears from the Labour Party.  There was a dawn meeting, a dawn raid, at 7 a.m. this morning and the Taoiseach was hoping many Members would not be up after the party last night.  He is only talking——

Consider the idea of anarchy breaking out.

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	390	I apologise if I provoked Deputy Mattie McGrath but I will make my argument regardless of how often he tries to interrupt me.  I clearly heard somebody exhort people to break the law and predict that blood would run down the streets of this country.  As somebody who is clearly aware of the challenges we face, I believe we have to offer more than that to people who are hurting badly.  The Deputy is entitled to disagree with the Bill or the Government's policies but he should offer more in terms of the prospects that await the country.We are facing the stark reality that our country is an unwilling party to an external aid programme for which the rest of the world does not want to pay.  We are caught in the middle of ferocious tension between countries which do not want to participate in these arrangements and countries which do not want to pay for them.  This creates a grave challenge for countries like Ireland and the consequences could become apparent early in the new year.  As an example of this tension, the rate of interest we are offered under this Bill is lower than the rate available to the countries which fund our programme of borrowing.  Several of the larger countries that fund the programme are not able to borrow or are paying higher interest rates than the rates we pay on the money they lend to us.  What we have in common with these countries is our inability to borrow from financial markets at an affordable rate.We need to exit the programme at the earliest opportunity.  I understand that the European Commission recommended Ireland return to the financial markets quickly but that would be a foolhardy move in the current environment.  However, despite the terrible mistakes that the financial markets have made, it is infinitely preferable to borrow from them than to be in this programme.  Every two weeks our balance sheet is scrutinised by somebody else.  That is the ultimate example of the loss of our economic sovereignty.Our current challenge is to make the arrangements more sustainable.  The original interest rates charged for our funding were prohibitive but substantial progress has since been made.  We must address the question of how our banks are funded.  Drawing down money on a short-term basis created instability in the banking system because banks had to renew their funding arrangements every week or month.  Thanks to the agreement reached over the weekend, our banks will now be able to access money based on commitment periods of between two and three years.  This will be valuable for our banking system.Issues also arise with some of banking debt, such as the Anglo Irish Bank promissory notes.  I differ from many of the Members opposite regarding the way in which our total debt should be managed.  I do not believe we should seek to write down or default on sovereign debt because even the short-term consequences could be catastrophic.  I do not agree with the claim that our difficulties were caused by the near collapse of our banking system.  The cost of bailing out our banking system is only a portion of the national debt.  The remainder arises from the huge difference between what we took in taxes and what we were spending.  We are trying to deal with the terrible mistakes made by previous Governments.  However, we must review the rate of interest charged on the promissory notes for Anglo Irish Bank's debts.  The manner in which the rate of interest was negotiated and structured to protect that bank has caused major difficulties for the State and the country.  The only way we can address this issue, however, is by means of multilateral negotiations.We must work with the people who are providing this money.  We have to fund a budget of €17 billion every year and our core banks need €110 billion in liquidity funding.  Rather than contemplate reneging on a portion of Anglo Irish Bank's debts, we must continue to negotiate an agreement that would reduce the rate of interest.  Such a strategy will bring us significantly closer to exiting the programme.
#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	391	The Minister for Finance described this as a technical Bill but it is important none the less.  Irrespective of whether we agree on what Europe should be doing, we should not engage in the type of rhetoric we heard from Deputy Mattie McGrath this afternoon.  Speaking about blood being spilled on the streets does not do anything for democracy or stability and it certainly does not help our image at home or abroad.  It is important for the sake of the economic fortunes of citizens across the EU that Europe remains open for business.  Last week's agreement will require political leadership, courage and honesty.  We must move away from the self-serving opportunism of political parties in their own lands.We are, as Deputy Donohoe said, involved with the EU, IMF and ECB.  We need to work with the troika, because if we did not have the troika, where would we be today?  That is a question that is not asked very often.  We could not go out into the international markets and we could not borrow money.  I am wary of any mad rush to return to the markets unless we have the required foundation, structure and stability.  It would be catastrophic for us to go back to the markets only to discover that we were not ready and should not have been open for business at all.We have a public service that requires Exchequer funding to pay for those who work and the services that are provided to our people.  The two key words are "public" and "service".  If we did not have the availability of the loan fund that we have now, that would be severely undermined.  There is an implication, which we will hear from the other side, regarding the agreement that was signed initially and that has been continued, albeit in a different form, by the current Government.  The Members opposite, many of whom I respect and admire, should not come into this House and tell the stories of friends, families and fellow citizens who are paying an inordinate price for the recklessness of a decade and a half of misgovernance, bad regulation and poorly run banks.  That is the unfortunate thing.  I really feel sorry for the people who have no jobs, who are in negative equity, or who are struggling; these include many of my own friends and family members.  Let us put that in the context of where we are today.The Minister used the word "stability" in his speech this morning.  It is important that we, as a Government and as a member of the wider European Union, bring stability to the European economy, to our own banking system and to our people.  If we cast our minds back to 12 months ago or 24 months ago, we can see the stability this Government has brought to the affairs of our nation and to our people.I challenge the Members opposite to put aside their attempts to gain cheap political points by saying in the media that they will go to jail for not paying a tax, and look at the implications of what they are saying.  The easy thing to do is to go on the airwaves and say, "I will not pay the €100 tax", but we cannot do that.  With election to this House comes responsibility.  That means we must lead by example, and if we disagree with legislation, we must use the method we have available to us, which is to vote against it or table amendments to it.  Let us put the wider interests of our nation and our people first rather than these cheap, self-serving vote-getting exercises in which we all engage from time to time.  This is far too serious.  I do not have the answers about where we are going, but neither does anyone else.  We all have a viewpoint and a thesis that we think is the best, and that is fine.  We are entitled to our opinions.  However, our country requires us to show leadership, and it also requires President Sarkozy, Chancellor Merkel and Prime Minister Cameron to show leadership.Let us go back to when the Bretton Woods agreement was originally signed and consider the original European Union concept.  Are we saying today, in a 27-member Union, that we can stray away from this?  Is that what we are really saying — that our political differences are so wide that we cannot agree, and that we cannot put aside internal political advancement for the sake of a better Union for all our citizens, no matter how imperfect?  Look at how things have gone in America.  On "CBS Evening News" last night there was a report on Slab City in California, where people are living in trailer parks out in the middle of the desert, trying to rear their families.  Coming back to home, we must ask ourselves: without Europe, where would we be as a nation?  We are a peripheral island country that requires strong trading partners.  Yes, we need links with Britain, Asia and America, but mostly we need links with the European Union.Let us put aside the pantomime season and be realistic, despite our political differences.  I do not mind political differences, but our common aim must be to do what is best for our country and for our people.  We should not be going out onto the plinth and allowing ourselves to be hostages to the media for a cheap soundbite.  It behoves all of us — Government and Opposition — to remember this.

#JerryButtimer	unknown-#JerryButtimer-party	unknown-#JerryButtimer-dob	unknown-#JerryButtimer-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Sorry, a Cheann Comhairle.The Minister used the word "reform" in his speech, and he was right.  Political reform in Europe is necessary and that is why it is important that we are playing a central role within Europe.  I commend the Taoiseach, the Minister of State, Deputy Creighton, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Gilmore, on the role they have played in Europe in the past couple of months.  Stability, a Common Market, and unity are what this Bill is about, and what Europe should be about.  Deputy Donohoe talked about the law being passed.  We have an obligation to obey the law.  We cannot just break the law, and we cannot just walk away from our responsibilities.  Those who attempt to do that are not serving Europe or Ireland well.The other important point from the Minister's speech was about the reduction in interest on our loans from the IMF, which is important.  We are seeking to return to the markets, although we require assistance now.  The global economy is in a state of peril, which has implications for us.  There is an analogy to be made with the board of governors.  We must adhere to regulations.  The Members opposite wear seatbelts in cars, as we do over here.  They do not break the speed limit or drink and drive.  Equally, when it comes to our affairs in Europe, we should adhere to regulations.  I welcome the Minister's comments.  We have an obligation to pay our debts.  There is a good debate going on about the issue of sovereign debt and other debt, but as a nation, we should pay our sovereign debt.  In saying that, I must say that the initial interest payment was too high, and I commend the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on reducing that through negotiation with the troika.

We need to get back to a position in which we can return to the markets, but we also need to find commonality with Europe so that we can return to trading and show the rest of the world, as we have been doing, that we are open for business and that we are a good nation in which to trade and work.

#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	404	——that it is not easy to take the stance we have taken, but we are standing by the people who elected us.The Bill before us is relatively straightforward.  Its purpose is to ratify changes to the IMF articles of agreement.  However, we must first step back and examine the role of the IMF.  It is clear that the IMF is not a neutral international economic advisory committee.  The allocation of quotas and voting rights in the IMF, far from being about democracy, are structured in a manner to preserve a totally unjust economic system and to prevent any attempt by the majority of the world's population to share in the wealth they create and to end poverty and hunger.I was astounded by the remarks of one of the Fine Gael Deputies — I believe it was Deputy John Paul Phelan.  He said that this legislation is about bringing fully democratic elections into the IMF.  In his opinion, the role of the IMF was to secure the safe operation of the world economy and it had basically done a good job.  I do not know what planet this man is living on but he clearly has no relationship with planet Earth as it is at present.  The IMF is a totally undemocratic institution, designed in 1944 to enable the imperialist powers to maintain their control of the world's resources.  In the agreement there is an inbuilt domination by the US, Japan and the EU which is utterly disproportionate to their share of the world's population.The proposed changes do not in any way loosen the stranglehold of those main economic powers.  While China and India have more than 40% of the world's population between them, they have 6.01% of the voting rights in the IMF.  Under this proposal China will take a great leap forward and go from 3.66% to 3.81% of the IMF voting rights, even though it has a population of 1,500 million people.  A group of 24 sub-Saharan African countries with a population of 225 million is represented on the IMF executive board by Rwanda, which has a total of 1.39% of IMF voting rights.  How any Deputy could claim that this is a democratic institution is beyond me.The Bretton Woods institutions, the World Bank and the IMF are designed in a deliberate manner to ensure that the US retains control.  A look at the figures proves that.  The US effectively rules the IMF on behalf of the advanced capitalist countries.  No country other than the United States has more than 15% of the voting rights.  It will be 16.76% after these proposed changes.  What that means is that the US has a blocking minority vote against any changes which require 85% of the votes.  It can effectively block anything.  This is a terrible embarrassment for the Labour Party in particular.  It clearly supports the IMF and the troika and would have us believe that the IMF is an objective, technical economic advisory body.  Its attitude is that if we just listen to the IMF, take the hits and make all the sacrifices, we will be on the yellow brick road to economic recovery.  That is total nonsense.The Labour Party would point to the fact that the missions of the IMF are defined in statutes.  These include very lofty ideals such as: to facilitate the expansion and balanced growth of international trade and to contribute thereby to the promotion and maintenance of high levels of employment and real income; the development of the productive resources of all members as primary objectives of economic policy; members may exercise such controls as are necessary to regulate international capital movements.  That is stated in the articles and statutes of the IMF.  It sounds great, but what is its record in reality?  The policies of the IMF contradict its statutes.The IMF has supported neo-liberal policies, including the complete liberalisation of capital flows, which are precisely the mechanisms that fuelled the financial speculation that was one of the key reasons for the world economic crisis for which we are now paying the price.  The Bretton Woods institutions have had oversight of the international financial system since 1944, during which time we have witnessed financial fraud, embezzlement and wholesale tax evasion, all of which have spiralled.  Under the watch of the IMF and World Bank so-called offshore banking systems, which are really tax havens such as the Irish Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and so forth, have enabled capital flight, transfer pricing and massive tax evasion.  The Tax Justice Network International report of last November estimates that total tax evasion now stands at $3,100 billion dollars, the equivalent of over 5% of the world's GDP.  This revenue and due taxes that are being withheld could transform the health, education and welfare services of the industrialised and the less developed countries.  The losers are working people and their dependants in the industrialised economies and the poor in the least developed countries.We must examine the record of so-called success with regard to the economic guidance of the IMF.  I will not even give a Socialist Party analysis but refer to what some people in the heart of the beast say about it.  The US Congress Meltzer Commission report of 2000 states the following:Numerous studies of the effects of IMF lending have failed to find any significant link between IMF involvement and increases in wealth or income.  IMF-assisted bailouts of creditors in recent crises have had especially harmful and harsh effects on developing countries.  People who have worked hard to struggle out of poverty have seen their achievements destroyed, their wealth and savings lost, and their small businesses bankrupted.  Workers lost their jobs, often without any safety net to cushion the loss.  Domestic and foreign owners of real assets suffered large losses, while foreign creditor banks were protected.  These banks received compensation for bearing risk, in the form of high interest rates, but did not have to bear the full (and at times any) losses associated with high-risk lending.  The assistance that helped foreign bankers also protected politically influential domestic debtors...Does this sound familiar?  Of course it does.  This is the same type of regime and policies that have been imposed on people in Ireland.  The international economic crisis that began in the summer of 2008 demolished all the neo-liberal dogmas and exposed all their lies and deceptions.  It totally discredited neo-liberal regulation measures and structural adjustment programmes.  In addition, the economic predictions of the IMF have been incredibly unreliable.The IMF is not a white knight coming to the rescue of the Irish economy or any other economies.  This organisation has defended and advanced the neo-liberal agenda even though it has been discredited and the toxic policies it promotes are the ones for which ordinary people are now paying the price.  It is particularly galling for citizens of this State to see a Labour Party in Government stand over such measures.The IMF and the World Bank on a global scale are largely responsible for the food crisis during 2007 and 2008 which increased the number of people suffering from hunger by 140 million.  The IMF and the World Bank produced the structural adjustment programmes which recommended that governments in Africa, Asia and Latin America should stop maintaining the grain silos that had been used to feed the domestic market during periods of food shortage or steep price increases.  The IMF insisted that these countries, to secure loan finance, had to abolish food subsidies and cut public credit agencies giving subsistence to farmers, thus driving them into the hands of private lenders charging penal rates of interest.  IMF policies coerced tropical countries to stop producing food to eat and instead promoted cash crops such as coffee, tea, flowers, peanuts and so forth for export, to ensure payment of loans to foreign banks, while opening their borders to food imports produced with major public subsidies in the advanced capitalist countries.That is the agenda that goes on behind the IMF.It demands that less developed countries open up their economies to the investment products and services of multinational corporations of the advanced capitalist countries.  It does that to enable multinationals to produce what they like, where they like, under whatever conditions they like and at wages they decide with practically no taxation and 100% profit repatriation.  The 30 years of these neoliberal policies were examined by the UNCTAD report in 2006 and declared a total failure.These policies have caused enormous hardship, suffering and deaths in the least developed countries.  Large numbers of subsistence farmers in India have taken their own lives in the course of the past decade because of the debts they had to take on as a result of the imposition of IMF policies.  Far from alleviating poverty and promoting growth in this country or any other, the IMF and World Bank policies have led to massive increases in the public debt of the least developed countries, locking them into dependency on foreign banks, dollars and euro.The G20 countries agreed, in the face of the crisis in 2009, to quadruple IMF funding to $1 trillion.  Debtor countries can borrow $1 trillion from the IMF not to develop their economies and raise living standards, but to hand the money back to parasitic banks and pay exorbitant interest rates.  The IMF is really saying that the solution to the debt crisis is more debt.  That is all it is offering these countries.The Minister, Deputy Noonan, and the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, who believe that the IMF programme and debt payment demands are manageable while at the same time lamenting the necessary sacrifices, are not learning the lessons of modern history.  Debts that cannot be paid will not be paid and foisting austerity on people will not alleviate the situation.People can waffle on all they like about the millennium development goals and so on.  They are totally irrelevant against the backdrop of hundreds of millions of people dying painful deaths from hunger.  The IMF and World Bank encouraged debt.  It is odious, immoral and a major obstacle to fulfilling people's basic needs on a global scale, including the right to food.No tinkering with IMF voting rights will benefit working people in this country or the world's poor.  These discredited institutions will have to be abolished and replaced by really democratic institutions which a truly democratic economy would use to develop the world's resources in order to enable all people to develop their talents to their fullest potential.
#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	405	It is very fitting that the previous speaker mentioned so many sub-Saharan countries.  Ireland is now beholden to the IMF, which shows us where it is in the scale of freedom and sovereignty.  The people of Zimbabwe under Mugabe's rule were praying for an institution such as the IMF to come in and help them because some people were starving billionaires.It is with great disgust that I acknowledge the IMF is in this country and it will be a great day when we remove it.  However, in light of the position we are in, I am glad it is able to assist us.  We have developed a form of friendship, if one can call it that, with the IMF that will be an ally to us, along with the ECB.  There is an understanding that austerity does not create prosperity.  It has acknowledged that there must be some form of write-down and quantitative easing, something I believe in.One has to look at the IMF in the context of our country being part of the ECB arrangement.  A lot of rhetoric comes from the other side of the House about passing on ECB interest rate reductions.  It is a complex matter.  For example, Ulster Bank operates in Ireland but 3% of its capital is funded from the ECB funding.  When people talk about passing on interest rate cuts to the generation of stressed mortgage holders, of which I am one, it is not a simple matter.  A reduction of 0.25% cannot be passed on because in some cases as little as 3% of overall funding is involved.The IMF was set up after the Second World War.  It did a lot of good and kept a stable world economy.  The Bretton Woods agreement fell apart in 1971 as a result of the credit bubble.  It culminated in the current banking disaster.  In the end there was one third the amount of gold bullion actually needed held in Fort Knox which was inextricably linked to the US dollar, the base currency of the world at the time.If there is anything to be learned from the current disaster it is that the IMF and institutions like it need to put regulations in place to stop hyperinflation, credit default swaps and markets protecting themselves.  The behaviour of the Tories over the past number of weeks is not encouraging.  They are happy to have an entirely free market in London when we have seen what the transfer of capital without regulation means to countries such as Ireland.The ECB will have to listen to the IMF a little bit more.  It is not good enough that Chancellor Angela Merkel and President Nicolas Sarkozy are meeting and determining the fate of our currency.  The IMF can have a role to play within European institutions.  It is disingenuous to say it should not exist.I am a member of the OSCE parliamentary assembly and this morning we met a small delegation.  It was the only independent body able to independently assess the elections in Russia as being inaccurate and improper.  If the IMF looked at departments of finance with the same level of scrutiny, we would be in a much better state than we are in currently.  It is an international monetary fund and we operate in international markets.This Bill is simply for housekeeping purposes.  It will be a great day for the country when the IMF is no longer seated in this House and we are no longer accountable to it.  I commend the current Government on the efforts it is making.  We are in a black hole and it will take a long time to get out of it.  There are bank guarantees in place which should not be.  They were in place prior to the IMF agreement.  We have to use the same ladder to get out of the hole with which we went into it.We will all work as much as we can, roll up our sleeves and try to dig the country out of the hole but it will not be easy.  Unfortunately, more austerity is coming.  I raised the issue of quantitative easing with the Minister at a committee meeting.  Prosperity will not be achieved through austerity but by having more money in the economy.I wish the House a very happy Christmas.
#ThomasPringle	unknown-#ThomasPringle-party	unknown-#ThomasPringle-dob	unknown-#ThomasPringle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I will respond to some of the Deputies on the other side of the House who said we in opposition should be wearing the green jersey and backing the decisions the Government is making, particularly in terms of the budget and continued austerity it is imposing on the people.  It is perfectly legitimate for us not to agree with what the Government is doing, put forward alternative proposals and not support the cuts it is implementing.  That is in no way going against the Irish people.  Rather, it is arguing on their behalf.There are alternatives.  The Government and we as a people have choices.  The Government has chosen to implement its budget.  It could have made different choices, which is a perfectly legitimate argument.  I do not agree with any member of the Government saying we should get on board with the programme and go along with the cuts and austerity being imposed because they are the only game in town and good for the Irish people.  We are absolutely entitled to our view that the wrong programme and the wrong agenda are being pursued.The legislation before us implements adjustments provided for by the review of the IMF management and voting weight structures, including an increase in the voting power of Ireland to something over 0.5%.  This will have hardly any impact on our potential influence in the policy direction of the IMF.  It bears repeating that the latter has not covered itself in glory over the years.  It has been a tool of Western capital, forcing many poor countries to implement policies that decimated their economies and set their development back by decades.  It initially did so in support of the United States in its Cold War against communism and, in recent years, in support of the neoliberal policy of globalisation.  In pursuit of these neoliberal policies, the IMF has been heavily criticised for prolonging and deepening the Asian crisis in the 1990s.  It forced fiscal reduction, increased taxation and widespread privatisation on Asian economies when what was needed was increased Government investment and stimulus which would have helped them to grow out of the difficulties they were experiencing.The similarities to our current situation are obvious.  According to its own fact sheet, the IMF's role is to maintain stability and prevent crises in the international monetary system and to review country policies and national, regional, and global economic and financial developments.  It is worth examining how it has applied its preventative role to Ireland.  The IMF was full of praise for our economic model throughout the Celtic tiger bubble.  Like the Financial Regulator, Central Bank and the other cheerleaders of the boom, it at no time shouted "Stop" or even "Slow down".In its country reports in the lead up to the crash, it remained full of praise for the model we were pursuing.  For example, it stated on 14 September 2007, "The banking system is well-capitalized, profitable, and liquid, and nonperforming loans are low".  The executive directors commended Ireland's continued impressive economic performance, characterised by one of the highest growth rates of GNP per capita among advanced countries and one of the lowest unemployment rates.  The report went on to state:This performance has been underpinned by outward-oriented policies, prudent fiscal policy, low taxes, and labor market flexibility.  Given the Irish economy's strong fundamentals and the authorities' commitment to sound policies, Directors expected economic growth to remain robust over the medium term.By 2009, however, it had changed its tune.  On June 24 of that year it stated:Following years as a star performer, Ireland is undergoing a painful adjustment as critical internal imbalances unwind.  Since the start of the decade, and especially from 2005 to 2007, easy credit fostered a property bubble, bank exposures to property lending soared while reliance on wholesale funding intensified, wages rose rapidly, and international competitiveness was compromised.This is quite a contrast to the previous glowing reports.  It went on to state:The banking system is under considerable stress as asset quality — especially that related to property development — has deteriorated and the global financial crisis has tightened access to wholesale funding.In 2010, the IMF became one of the major partners in the troika.  This was hard to stomach in light of its continued glowing reports even as the crisis deepened.  Now we are asked to take direction from one of the cheerleaders of the boom-bust cycle.  The IMF has praised the Government for the steps it has taken in forcing austerity on our people and ensuring the gamblers and speculators of the crash are protected, regardless of the costs to society, while cautioning that we should be careful of the impact the cuts will have on the disadvantaged.  That must ring very hollow to the disabled, unemployed and low paid who are carrying the can for the developers, bankers and politicians who brought the country to ruin.The Nobel prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz summed up the IMF's mission perfectly when he said:When the IMF arrives in a country, they are interested in only one thing.  How do we make sure the banks and financial institutions are paid?...  It is the IMF that keeps the [financial] speculators in business.  They're not interested in development, or what helps a country to get out of poverty.The agenda of the IMF and the troika is to make sure the German, French and British banks that fuelled the boom are paid every cent they spent in driving the property bubble.Writing in April of this year in reference to Ireland, Mr. Stiglitz stated:In effect, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and European Central Bank (ECB) are asking ordinary Irish workers and citizens to bear the burden of mistakes that were made by international financial markets.  But it is important to recognise that these mistakes are at least partly attributable to following deregulation and liberalisation policies that were advocated by the IMF and ECB and that these policies provided significant benefits to the financial sector.He went to state, in respect of the bailout programme:[E]ven were it to succeed, it will mean Ireland will be in partial indentured servitude for as far as the eye can see — devoting 10 per cent or more of what it earns to pay off what are largely the consequences of the financial sector's misdeeds.This is hardly an outcome to be welcomed by anybody in this House.  One can only wonder what our society will look like when we are finished looking after the financial elites of Europe and the world.The changes covered by this legislation will remove the automatic right of countries to appoint directors, and all directors will have to be elected.  This is no big deal.  The voting weights are already heavily in favour of the United States and other Western capitalist economies.  The board and decision-making structure of the IMF will continue to be controlled by the same countries that have driven the agenda for the past 60 years.  We need only look at the record of the IMF in Asia, Argentina, South Africa and so many other places around the world to see how little that policy will change.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on this legislation.  It is part of the broader debate on the role of the IMF, the urgent need for radical and progressive reforms and the future of this country.  Although it is a technical proposal, its implications for Ireland deserve careful consideration.  I would urge balanced and honest debate at all times on these international economic matters and their effects on this State.  Our people are tired of game playing.  All they seek is sensible solutions to get us all out of this economic mess.  It is time for leadership and straight talk from all politicians.  I say this as an Independent Deputy and a person who is open to any sensible proposals for relieving the crisis.The purpose of the legislation is to implement an amendment to the articles of agreement of the IMF, which was approved by the board of governors in December 2010.  The articles currently establish two categories of executive directors, namely, those who are appointed and those who are elected.  The amendment eliminates the first category and requires that all executive directors be elected.  This forms part of ongoing governance reforms at the IMF.  It is important that we have accountability and a democratic character in all institutions.In regard to the broader debate, we must take on board the views of the general public.  A recent survey showed that almost 50% of respondents agree that Ireland should continue to comply with the terms and conditions of the EU-IMF programme.  This finding comes exactly a year after the previous Government announced the €85 billion bailout.  Asked if the Government should continue to comply with the terms and conditions of the bailout, 48% of respondents agreed, one in three disagreed while 22% had no opinion.  These figures speak for themselves.  Some 22% of people have an open mind and want to see a realistic solution being proposed.  Asked if the Government had reneged on its election promises to demand a better deal for Ireland, 39% disagreed and 36% agreed while 25% had no opinion.  It is touch and go as regards 25% of the population.  This survey reveals a significant and continuing shift in public opinion as the paralysing fear which gripped people at the beginning of the crisis is replaced by considered criticisms informed by greater knowledge as to what has been perpetrated on us.  It also provides an opportunity for an objective study of the issues and the role of the IMF.The Bill provides that: "(b) Subject to (c) below, the Executive Board shall consist of twenty Executive Directors elected by the members, with the Managing Director as chairman.”  This replaces the provision whereby five of the executive directors could be appointed by the five largest members and it provides for an all-elected board.  It is crucial that these are elected positions to allow for a democratic body.  I have concerns about the democratic issue but I think we are moving in a sensible and logical direction.The debt issue has been the elephant in the room and is of concern to all political parties and to the Technical Group.  Many of us are concerned that this debt issue is preventing us from fixing the major problems.  I urge the Minister and the Government to keep pushing with regard to this issue.  Parties in the House are in agreement in this regard and I also include the views of Government backbenchers.  The situation is holding back the country from sorting out our own national finances.  This issue of the banking debt will drag our country down.  It is not acceptable to penalise the poor, those in disadvantaged schools or those with disabilities.  It is also bad economics because it will cost more in the end if these issues are not dealt with.  I warn the Minister that balance must be employed to deal with the issues so that job creation is the policy as well as austerity measures.  I accept that we must deal with our national debt and the public finances but as part of the resolution strategies we must develop a jobs strategy in order to lift the economy and get people off welfare.The role of the IMF is to look after the banks and the financial institutions and our job as politicians is to look after the citizens in our own country.  Members of the Oireachtas should not be afraid to examine and question everything that comes out of Europe and the powers of certain sections of the European Union.  We must examine objectively our relationship with the European Union.  We joined the EEC in 1973.  The Common Agricultural Policy gave Irish farmers €44 billion between 1973 and 2008 and €1.8 billion a year since then, making a total of €50 billion to date.  Up to 2013, Ireland will receive a further €18 billion from the structural, regional and cohesion funds.  The payments into the EU budgets must be subtracted from this sum which is a total of approximately €25 billion since 1973.  This is a net gain in the region of €43 billion.  At the time of the so-called bailout by the troika this time last year, eurozone banks held €214 billion in Irish debt.  German banks alone accounted for €103 billion of that total.  The purpose of the bailout and the entire policy of saturating failed Irish banks with public money is to ensure these debts are repaid.  Otherwise the eurozone's banking system will be plunged into crisis.  We must face up to these issues.It is impossible to state precisely how much the Irish bailout of the eurozone is costing us taxpayers.  We do not know how much NAMA will finally cost nor what the State's stake in the banks might ultimately be worth.  One slice of the cost is the money gone into Anglo Irish Bank.  This is definitely dead money.  It is a massive blood transfusion into a corpse.  It amounts to €30 billion up front and at least €17 billion in punitive interest payments to the European Central Bank.  This amounts to €47 billion, €4 billion more than all the money we have received from the EU through CAP and other funds since 1973.  I am open to correction on some of the figures I have presented.These figures are directly comparable, one being a transfer from relatively wealthy European and German taxpayers to the citizens of an economically hard-pressed Ireland, while the other is a transfer from the citizens of an economically hard-pressed Ireland to the relatively wealthy European and in particular German taxpayers.  Germany had trouble in the bond markets recently in a sign that the eurozone crisis has spread to the very heart of the European Union.  The country, whose credit-worthiness has until now been viewed as top class, can only sell two thirds of its ten-year bonds at auction, a development which has sent shock waves through the markets as investors wonder whether the fittest economy in Europe can remain immune to contagion from the eurozone.In recent weeks, borrowing costs have moved steadily upwards in the case of France, Belgium, Austria and the Netherlands, countries holding the highest ratings.  The climb in borrowing costs across the board is a sign that investors and banks are dropping their holdings of European debt, no longer confident in the ability of the euro to survive in its present form.Japan's biggest mutual fund has sold off its portfolio of Italian Government bonds but there are reports that the French bank, BNP Paribas and the German bank, Commerzbank, are selling European sovereign debt at a loss.  We must deal with these issues in our discussion of the Bill.The Bill provides:"(c) For the purpose of each regular election of Executive Directors, the Board of Governors, by an eighty-five percent majority of the total voting power, may increase or decrease the number of Executive Directors...” The effect of this provision is the possibility that the provision that the size of the board may be adjusted will continue to be applied to the restructured board.  The Bill also provides:"(d) Elections of Executive Directors shall be conducted at intervals of two years in accordance with regulations which shall be adopted by the Board of Governors.  Such regulations shall include a limit on the total number of votes that more than one member may cast for the same candidate.”The effect of this provision is that elections to all elected executive boards will continue to be at intervals of two years and in accordance with the regulations adopted by the board.  Sections 4 to 15, inclusive, delete or amend the existing provisions which refer to the category of appointed executive directors and include transitional provisions to govern the period between the entry into force of an amendment and the first election following such entry into force.  These sections do not provide for any changes to the existing provisions beyond those resulting from the elimination of the category of appointed executive directors.  We should closely examine these matters in the debate on austerity and taxation.The Ministers for Finance and Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation must take a more proactive approach to job creation.  I wonder if the Government is alert to ideas being proposed by people in broader society, for example, in the agrifood sector, and on the Opposition benches, including Deputies from the Technical Group.  It is astonishing that no one has taken up the ball and run with a proposal which has the potential to create 5,000 jobs through the revival of the sugar beet industry.  The agrifood industry is up for the proposal, as is the wider agricultural sector.  The figure of 5,000 jobs has not been suggested by the Technical Group or any left-wing body but by the Irish sugar beet bio-refinery group, which has carried out a feasibility study of reviving the sugar beet industry.  The PricewaterhouseCoopers-backed study calls for the establishment of a bio-refinery plant somewhere in the country which would produce sugar and ethanol from beet and grain.  The plant, which could be publicly or privately run, would cost an estimated €350 million to construct.  It is envisaged that 30% of the finance required would come from equity investment, with the remainder being made up by 15 year bank loans.  According to the study, the plant would be profitable within its first year of operation.  This is a serious plan.

#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	411	As the Minister will be aware, the growing problem of access to the services of free legal aid centres is causing crises for individuals who are on waiting lists for civil legal services.  Figures provided by the Department show the number of people waiting for the services of free law centres increased from 1,681 people in January 2009 to 4,500 in September 2011.  One must bear in mind that 74% of those on the waiting list are seeking legal services for the purpose of family law cases, whether emergency cases or cases involving divorce, separation, maintenance and so forth.  I am aware that priority is given to urgent cases involving domestic violence and urgent child care needs.One hears a great deal about the impact of the recession.  The people affected by the delays in providing legal services include individuals whose relationships have broken down, those in negative equity and people who are trying to resolve problems related to family, children and property.  To ask people in such circumstances to wait for up to 11 months at some law centres is tough and cruel.  It creates major difficulties for those who are unable to avail of the advice of a solicitor for lengthy periods during which they believe their world is falling apart and they need some certainty, advice or professional input from a lawyer.  Many of those affected have visited my clinic to raise this problem and my heart goes out to themI ask that inroads be made in the waiting lists.  The law centres seek to achieve an average waiting time of four months but are clearly unable to reach this target given that waiting periods have increased to 11 months in some cases.  I commend many of the solicitors in private practice who give legal advice or guidance to people who cannot afford to pay for it but require independent, objective advice on their circumstances.  For many of the individuals in question, solicitors who give their services free are a godsend.The second aspect of the matter I raise is the possibility of generating some revenue through the criminal legal aid service.  Last year, €56 million was spent on criminal legal aid and I understand the €47 million allocated for this year will be exceeded by approximately €10 million.  As of 1 August, 33,225 legal aid certificates had been granted.  I am not sure what the current figure is.  Those who avail of the services of law centres are asked to pay a contribution towards the cost of the legal service provided.  While the charge depends on the person's means, it may range from €1 to upwards of €50.  On the other hand, people who receive legal aid certificates in criminal cases are not asked to pay anything.  Information on re-offending levels among those who come before the courts, specifically those who receive non-custodial sentences, is not available.  As a practitioner who did criminal work in the District Court, I used to see the same people repeatedly come before the court and receiving legal aid certificates at no personal cost.  This practice is ridiculous and flies in the face of justice and common sense.  If people receiving legal aid certificates, especially those who have reoffended, faced charges similar to those applied to those who receive civil legal aid, savings of approximately €3.3 million would have been made up to 1 August this year.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I thank Deputy Mulherin for providing me with the opportunity to discuss the matters she has raised.  As she knows, the Legal Aid Board has 33 full-time law centres located throughout the country, including seven located in Dublin.  The board also operates a private practitioner service, refugee documentation service and library service in Montague Lane, Dublin.  In addition, the functions of the Legal Aid Board were recently extended to include a family mediation service.The past three or four years have seen a considerable increase in demand for legal services from the Legal Aid Board.  This increase in demand has coincided with the downturn in the economy and greater pressure on Departments and their agencies to provide services from reduced financial resources.In 2007, slightly more than 10,150 persons sought legal services from the board in relation to general civil, non-asylum matters, a substantial portion of which fell within the family law area.  This figure increased to 17,175 in 2010, while the number of applicants in the first six months of this year was almost equal to the total number for the 12 months of 2007.  The board has been proactive with regard to the provision of services at this time of increasing demand in a resource constrained environment.  It has prioritised certain types of cases for immediate or near immediate service.  Priority cases include those where allegations of violence have been made, child custody matters and where statutory deadlines are fast approaching when clients make their first contact with the law centre.  These cases comprise some 15% of all applications.  A considerable number of other applications are referred speedily to private practitioners.  Up to 40% of all cases receive a very speedy service.The budget for civil legal aid for 2012 is being maintained at the same level as for this year.  However, the ongoing increase in the number of people seeking services from the Legal Aid Board makes it inevitable that difficulties will continue. As the Deputy may know, a new board was appointed this week and I am confident it will do its best to address the pressures under which it is operating.The Legal Aid Board primarily provides legal services through law centres located throughout the country.  I am acutely aware that as a consequence of the relatively small number of staff, a retirement or maternity related absence can have significant impact on the capacity of an individual law centre to provide services.  The board has been to the fore in making use of the JobBridge scheme.  It has retained a number of solicitors who are making a valuable contribution to the board's work in that regard. while at the same time gaining valuable experience that will assist them in the jobs market.  The board will pilot an initiative early next year.  It is a somewhat different approach to the provision of legal services.  It will attempt to ensure every applicant for legal aid gets an appointment with a solicitor within three to four weeks.  The person may have to wait for a period of time if he or she wants representation in court, or further steps undertaken on his or her behalf.  The Deputy may be aware that in November of this year, I announced the formal integration of the family mediation service with the board.  I hope many of the family disputes that have resulted in litigation up to now will be resolved through the use of the mediation service.I would like to speak briefly about the criminal legal aid scheme.  As the Deputy knows, the scheme is demand-led in the sense that it is affected by the incidence of crime, the rate of detection and the prosecution of cases.  It is difficult to anticipate the level of activity in this area and to control the costs associated with it.  This year's Estimate for the criminal legal aid scheme was €47 million, but that has been exceeded by €10 million to date.  It is estimated that the ultimate out-turn will be €57.5 million.  Just €47 million will be available for the scheme next year.  As Minister, I have to find savings of €10 million.  Of necessity, a number of cost reduction measures were implemented this year, including a 10% reduction in the fees and rates payable to legal practitioners under the scheme.As in other sectors of the economy, the reduction in the fee rates paid under the scheme has had an impact on practitioners.  Nevertheless, they cannot be exempt from the financial stringencies that are applying across the public sector, or from the difficulties the State is experiencing within the funds available to it.  We have identified a series of cost-saving measures which we hope to implement in 2012.  The Deputy's specific suggestion that every successful applicant for criminal legal aid should have to make some initial payment has been investigated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  Unfortunately, an examination of the matter has given rise to the receipt of advice to the effect that if we were to introduce such a payment, it could give rise to constitutional difficulties and difficulties pursuant to the European Convention on Human Rights.  Nevertheless, we will explore the matter further in so far as we can.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I suppose I am most interested in the latter part of the Minister's answer.  While I understand the difficulties that potentially exist, I suggest that a fee of between €10 and €50 would be affordable even for someone on social welfare, especially if it were spread over a period of time.  It would represent some form of justice.  I appreciate that people are not guilty until they are tried and their cases heard.  However, many of those who break the law are reoffenders.  A woman and her children will have to wait between six and 11 months to be seen by a solicitor in a law centre, whereas someone who breaks the law tonight will get legal aid in the morning.  While I accept that such people need to be represented, I do not think it is excessive to deduct between €10 and €50 from their social welfare over a period of time to facilitate that.  It might mean they have to do without a packet of cigarettes, or stay out of the bookies, for a week.  I am not generalising when I say there are many cases of that nature.  There is merit in providing for such a levy.  I agree this service should be provided, but those who avail of it should have to pay something towards it.  I do not think the rest of society should have to pay in every way for the actions of these people.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Deputy might be aware that the judgment which was delivered by the courts in the 1976 case of State (Healy) v. O’Donoghue, which has been reiterated in many judgments since then, provides for a constitutional right to legal aid in criminal cases.  As I have already mentioned, there is a view that a small application fee might deter some applicants from availing of the scheme in circumstances in which they perhaps should not benefit from such a scheme.  It is important that we remember there is a presumption of innocence in criminal prosecutions.  Those who cannot afford to pay for legal representation have a constitutional right to obtain it.  We must respect our Constitution and the obligations imposed on this State by the European Convention on Human Rights.  Detailed consideration is being given to the possibility of introducing a scheme of the kind she has proposed.  Even if it were constitutionally feasible, I would have to ensure it would be of financial benefit.  We should not introduce a scheme that would create further unnecessary administrative expense which could exceed any financial benefit that might accrue to the State.  I appreciate the Deputy raising this issue.  Although we should protect the rights of those accused of crime and ensure they are properly legally represented, it is of huge importance that we ensure taxpayers’ money is not wasted at the same time.  There is an overriding need to bring the cost to this State of the criminal legal aid scheme under some level of control.  It is not tenable that this year, the scheme will cost €10 million more than the provision made for it by the State.
#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-party	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-dob	unknown-#MarcellaCorcoranKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	415	I welcome the opportunity to raise this matter.  Concerns have been raised with me about the length of time it takes to deliver court judgments.  Many of those who go through the courts process find it stressful and costly.  It appears that the timeframe for which they have to wait before the process is concluded is being extended.  We should try to alleviate such delays.  I have been informed that 71 cases in the High Court have been awaiting judgment for 12 months or less, as have 17 Supreme Court cases.  I do not think it is acceptable that the public should have to wait so long for a judgment.  The cost of going to court is often prohibitive.  The stress and anxiety that many people endure is a cause of additional concern.  The pressure that brings to bear on a personal level can manifest itself in all sorts of ways.  Any effort we can make to ensure these judgments are delivered in a timely fashion would be most welcome.  The European Convention on Human Rights provides that people are entitled to a fair trial within a reasonable timeframe.  It specifies that the judgment must be made known within a reasonable timeframe.  I am concerned that people's rights under the convention might be breached.  What is being done to alleviate these delays?  If efforts are being made to that end, how soon will their benefits be evident?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I thank the Deputy for raising this important matter.  As I recently outlined to her in reply to a parliamentary question, the Courts Service has informed me that at present, there are nine High Court cases and one Supreme Court case in which judgments are awaited for between three and six months.  I have also been advised that there are 15 cases in the High Court and 19 cases in the Supreme Court in which judgments have been reserved for in excess of six months.  Three of these have awaited judgment in the High Court for over 12 months and seven have awaited judgment in the Supreme Court for over 12 months.  The corresponding figures for judgments awaited for less than three months are 50 cases in the High Court and four cases in the Supreme Court.This is of significant concern as under the European Convention on Human Rights, member states are obliged to ensure excessive delays do not occur in domestic proceedings.  Article 6(1) of the convention establishes the right to a fair trial, and within this provision "trial within a reasonable time" is protected.  The length of trial is measured up to the moment the national judgment becomes final.  Therefore, the length of time a judge takes in giving judgment is considered when establishing whether there has been a violation of Article 6(1).  If this right is found to have been violated, as in the case of McFarlane v. Ireland, the injured party may be entitled to compensation.  Notwithstanding the independence of the Judiciary, it is incumbent on the Government and the Judiciary to take all possible steps to ensure delays do not become excessive.As the House will appreciate, the delivery of judgments following completion of a court hearing is a matter for the Judiciary and the presidents of the courts who are independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, subject only to the Constitution and the law.In addition, within my area of responsibility as Minister, I have an obligation to take action to seek to address particular problems as they arise, including those arising through legislation.  Following the decision in the McFarlane case, I established an expert group on Article 13 of the convention to consider how delays might be remedied.  I look forward to considering the group's report when it is completed.I understand the Chief Justice has brought forward a welcome series of initiatives to facilitate a review of the reserved judgments list in the Supreme Court on an ongoing basis, including the implementation of an electronic database of the list.  Active management of the list is being facilitated by a series of processes which have been put in place by the Chief Justice to minimise current delays and to establish new systems for the future.  Considerable progress has been made in reducing delays generally.I am also informed that the Chief Justice and the President of the High Court regularly meet with senior officials of the Courts Service to review matters relating to the operation of the courts in order to ensure efficiency in the disposal of court business.  In addition, where possible, supports are provided to assist judges in the preparation of judgments, including the engagement of judicial fellows and judicial research assistants.  I am informed that the introduction of such assistants since 2008 to assist High Court judges has had a positive impact in addressing delay.In addition, there is a register of reserved judgments in civil proceedings which was introduced in 2005.  It provides that if a judgment is not delivered within two months from the date upon which it was reserved, the president of the court which heard the case must list the proceedings before the judge who reserved judgment at two-month intervals.  That judge must specify the date on which he or she proposes to deliver the judgment.  The register provides a mechanism to remind judges of outstanding judgments, and supports the Chief Justice or the President of the High Court in ensuring that judges who need it can be given time out of court to write reserved judgments.It is worth noting that the Supreme Court operates a priority list to expedite urgent cases such as those that arise under the Hague Convention in regard to child abduction and European arrest warrant appeals and these are automatically prioritised.  In other cases, a party may apply to the court for priority if urgency or another basis for the application can be shown.  The President of the High Court has also been proactive in reducing delays experienced in judicial review proceedings in asylum and immigration cases in which leave has been granted, and the court has held additional hearings before vacation periods to reduce backlogs and delays.The Council of Europe Committee of Ministers which monitors how member states implement ECHR judgments has recently recorded satisfaction with how Ireland is progressing in dealing with delay.  For this reason, I am most anxious to ensure that we do not regress and I very much welcome the Chief Justice's recent initiatives in this regard.I thank the Deputy for raising the matter.  I appreciate her legitimate interest in ensuring the efficient and effective administration of justice in Ireland and I recognise the importance of ensuring that when a hearing of a case is concluded, judgment is delivered within a reasonable timeframe in the interest of the parties to the proceedings.

I note he referred to a report from the expert group which is examining this matter and his expectation of a response.  I hope that report will come sooner rather than later.  It would be good if there were a timeframe for it because it is very important that it is available as soon as possible.What progress has been made on the establishment of the court of appeal to which the Minister referred?
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I expect to receive the report early in the new year and intend to publish it then.  I hope it will contain comprehensive recommendations to address outstanding issues, in order facilitate the hearing of cases earlier than currently occurs in some courts.  I also hope the measures that have been taken will ensure that judgments which are outstanding are delivered within a reasonable period.  I emphasise that what I can do about this matter is limited because of the independence of the courts.  However, I welcome the initiatives the Chief Justice has taken.It is part of the programme of Government that we provide for a court of civil appeal.  That matter will require the holding of a constitutional referendum.  The establishment of such a court is likely to result in some additional expenditure being incurred.  Nevertheless, it is in the interest of justice that such a court is established.  I hope that towards the end of next year the preparatory work being undertaken on this issue will be complete.  A considerable number of cases have been appealed from the High Court to the Supreme Court in recent years that might have been dealt with at the level of the civil court of appeal.  That would have taken some pressure from the Supreme Court and allowed for earlier hearings of some appeals and a resolution of civil litigation at an earlier time than occurs at present.  I hope we will make progress on that matter which remains very much part of Government policy.  I hope to advance the proposal substantially in 2012.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	424	Deputy Boyd Barrett submitted this yesterday.  I shall continue and the Acting Chairman can consider this as a joint submission by all the Deputies concerned.I am glad the Minister for Finance is in the Chamber.  What we would like to have with him today is a quiet measured conversation about the issue I raise which concerns 370 workers at EBS Limited, now merged with Allied Irish Banks.  These are very low-paid and middle-income workers.  They are coal-face workers, not the erstwhile high fliers who expanded the property bubble and destroyed the economy in the process.For 45 years workers in the company were paid their annual wages in 13 equal instalments.  Therefore, after nine years of service, a worker on a gross income of €30,000 would receive 13 instalments of €2,308, before tax deduction.  The 13th instalment was paid in December, before Christmas.  For decades this was accepted by everybody to be part of the basic wage and not as a Christmas bonus.  It was consolidated into the wage de facto.On 6 December, possibly as the Minister was on his feet in this Chamber announcing the budget, the workers were informed that their 13th instalment was not going to be paid.  They had expected this payment the very next day in a pay packet.  Obviously, they had planned for Christmas and had already spent the money on their families' Christmas preparations, etc.  They were totally reliant on the payment, given they are very low-paid or middle-paid workers.  This is a devastating blow.A loan facility at 12.5% interest offered to the workers by the management of EBS as an alleged compensation adds insult to the injury.  It is because of this great outrage and the injustice the workers feel that they have called a strike on December 20.  If it goes ahead, another day's pay will be lost by those workers.Perhaps the Minister can enlighten us but I understand the Department of Finance made that decision by virtue of powers invested either in the Department or in the Minister himself, in conjunction with AIB.  In addition, senior managers on €90,000 a year who had the same arrangement are not having their 13th instalment withdrawn — not that the measure would be justified if they were.On behalf of those workers I ask the Minister to go into immediate conclave with officials and management of AIB and EBS to ensure this decision is reversed.  As it is Christmas time, he could cast himself in the role of Santa Claus rather than Scrooge.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	425	I have the utmost sympathy for EBS staff regarding the timing of the announcement of the decision that this so-called 13th month payment would not be made.  This does not reflect well on management and should not have happened.  However, this payment is described in the contracts of the relevant staff members as the payment of a Christmas bonus.  The terms of the latest capital investment in AIB and its accompanying letters made clear in July 2011 that no bonuses whatsoever could be paid or awarded.Since 1 July 2011, EBS is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB and covered by the above conditions.  When approached in November and again in December, my Department made it clear to AIB management this was our understanding of the relevant provisions of the agreement underpinning the State's capital investment in the bank.Much has been made of the fact that these payments have been paid for several years previously, especially from 2008 onwards.  For clarification, when the State invested moneys in EBS in May 2010 by means of a subscription for a special investment share, remuneration restrictions only applied to senior management.  As a result of this investment and the recommendations of the covered institutions remuneration oversight committee, no bonuses have been paid to this cadre of staff since 2008.As conditions deteriorated and further capital was injected into AIB in December 2010, these restrictions were broadened to formally prohibit the payment of bonuses to all staff and became the template that would apply to all the institutions as further investment was made.  Had EBS been maintained as a separate institution following the PCAR, prudential capital assessment review, of March 2011 any further injection of capital would have been covered by the expanded restrictions.The Government decided, as part of the restructuring of the banking sector, that EBS would merge into AIB and, as a result, the wider restrictions on the payment of bonuses came into effect.  Either way the blanket restrictions on the payment of bonuses to all staff would have applied.  I have indicated this when replying to parliamentary questions on the matter yesterday and today.While I have sympathy with the staff on the timing issue, it has to be stressed that the State's capital investment into the banking has protected jobs across the financial sector.  Without this crucial investment, our banks would have encountered severe difficulties and many jobs would have been lost.  The State has already invested some €20 billion in AIB and identified it as one of the two universal pillar banks.Last week saw the introduction of a very difficult budget that meant reductions in State payments to some of those who rely on the State as their only source of income.  This was in addition to other reductions in previous budgets including the termination of the Christmas bonus payment to social welfare recipients.  We are facing three more difficult budgets as we attempt to extricate ourselves from our present challenging economic and fiscal circumstances.  While I readily acknowledge the sacrifices made by employees, both public and private, in this battle for survival of the nation, in this context, it is not unjustified for a bank which the State has rescued not to pay a Christmas bonus.The proposed strike is to be very much regretted.  I fully acknowledge the staff have a right to express their grievance in any legitimate way.  However, the union and staff should reflect again taking all of the circumstances into consideration.  I understand EBS is putting in place a loan scheme to facilitate employees to assist them in meeting their commitments over this period.This is not a case of going after the "little people" who have not caused this crisis while more senior employees have departed with generous remuneration and severance arrangements, as has been alleged.  This latter aspect is a cause of great annoyance to citizens and shared by the Government.  In such circumstances we are greatly constrained by the strong legal advice available that recovery of such awards would not be possible.  Hence the introduction of the blanket restrictions on the payment of bonuses and other remuneration items now included in the latest agreements with the banks.In such circumstances, I do not think it is unreasonable to ask employees of a rescued institution to forgo a Christmas bonus where it is totally dependent on the State for survival while the Government has to ask citizens to accept much greater impositions with the likelihood of more to follow.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	426	That is a deeply regrettable response.  For the Minister for Education and Skills sitting next to the Minister to be nodding his head in agreement is also rather ironic.  The prohibition of bonuses in the banks is enthusiastically supported when it relates to the high flyers and the fat cats who devastated our economy with their reckless lending and gambling.  Their bonuses ranged from €60,000 and €70,000 to €100,000 and €250,000.  The bonuses in question here are for workers on €26,000 per annum.  The Minister is denying them a gross of €2,000 as the 13th instalment.  Clerical staff on €34,000 per annum are being cut a gross bonus of €2,600.  These bonuses have also been cut the day before they were due.  The Minister will know how families will have already prepared to spend that money for Christmas.  This was not a bonus and the arrangement obtained for 45 years.

A manager on €91,000 would traditionally get two instalments on 12 and 13 December of €7,000.  He will still get this 13th instalment while the other workers will not.  It compounds the whole injustice of making ordinary people for this crisis.  They are not responsible for it but the victims of it.  The majority of ordinary, decent, fair-minded people will agree the workers in question should be paid the thirteenth instalment of what is their normal wage.  Will the Minister reconsider this decision?

#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I am sure the Minister is well aware that an ESRI report stated that the scaling back of guidance counselling in schools will be most keenly felt among young students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  Such students are more reliant on advice from their school in making post-school decisions, particularly those relating to higher education entry and educational quality and standards.  The guidance teacher is also a counsellor and he or she has an important role in a school.  There is little doubt that children from less well off backgrounds are more in need of advice because they do not have the same support at home.The route to successful adulthood can be an obstacle course and those from difficult backgrounds often fail it and opt out.  Middle class children very often copy their parents to achieve a good standing in employment and life whereas working class children often have to throw off the role of their parents and aim for something better to find a better way in life for themselves.  I understand form teachers originally were allowed four hours in community schools but given the pressure on schools, fewer form teachers are given time to operate.  They also acted in a pastoral role.  I acknowledge schools have the option of retaining the guidance teacher within their pupil-teacher ratio but that could lead to the loss of another teacher and, sometimes, a subject.  The options are poor for the school.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I appreciate the presence of the Minister to reply to this important question.  Following budget 2012, guidance provision at second level will be managed by schools from within their standard teacher allocation from next year.  We believe this decision will not only lead to the end of the guidance counselling profession but its effect will be felt most by vulnerable  and disadvantaged students.  The Government decision to include guidance provision within the standard teacher allocation is an effective increase in the pupil-teacher ratio at second level.  Next year, second level schools will be faced with the choice to either let go of up to 1,000 guidance counsellors in 700 schools or to let go other teachers such as science and language teachers leading to reduced subject choice.  However, apart from the impact on the pupil-teacher ratio and on subject choice, we are hugely concerned that this decision will result in the obliteration of the guidance counselling profession and about the severe social impact of this decision on young vulnerable students, particularly those with mental health problems.Through parliamentary questions, I asked the Minister if his Department's guidelines relating to the entitlement to appropriate guidance at second level still remains in force.  Under current legislation, students are entitled to appropriate guidance under section 9(c) of the Education Act 1998.   Is this still in force?  Will the Minister ensure all second level students continue to have access to career guidance and counselling services at some level?   For example, will schools be required to provide a certain level of provision?  Will these services be provided by fully qualified guidance counsellors only?  Does he still believe only qualified guidance counsellors should provide counselling services to students?These are fair and reasonable questions that the Minister needs to urgently answer.  Instead, the Minister's reply to these questions this week avoided addressing any of these issues.  He said, "Schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resources provided by the normal staffing schedule."  This would indicate that there is still a requirement to keep guidance counsellors in place.  However, he contradicted that assertion when he went on to say, "Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available."  What are the guidance requirements the schools must meet?
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students, including how they provide for guidance and counselling.  It is a change to how resources are allocated to schools not a policy decision to terminate guidance provision as some may chose to present it.  Until now, a specific resource was provided to all second level schools for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation.  This broadly equates to an additional allocation of approximately one teacher for every 500 pupils.In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by the normal staffing schedule.  Individually, schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling.  Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interest of students and to ensure the best use of resources available.  I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.  Our schools are caring institutions and I am certain they will provide the necessary supports for vulnerable pupils in their care.In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against all other competing demands.  Moving to a more general allocation by integrating stand alone allocations like the one that has existed for guidance is how many other countries resource schools.  In other words, we trust the principals to deploy the resources made available to them in a manner they think is most appropriate.  It is about devolution and liberation within management at school level and I fully support it.  Many principals have been seeking that flexibility rather than a one size fits all direction by way of circular from the Department.The Government's protection of schools serving disadvantaged areas is further underlined by the maintenance of €13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools, €2 million in school book funding for DEIS schools, as well as a €26 million investment in the home-school community liaison scheme.  We will communicate with schools in early January regarding the guidance issue.  There are two components to this.  The first is counselling for students who are distressed or who are coping with difficult circumstances in their lives and the second is career guidance.  It may be that we can examine ways in which both those complementary services can be provided.I assure the Deputies that we will communicate with schools indicating to them how they may interpret this devolution of power and responsibility.  Principals have been looking for this.  Deputy Smith will recall that many principals said there needed to be more devolution of responsibility.  The countries we wish to emulate, which are achieving good educational outcomes, such as Finland and Australia have schools in which principals have much greater discretion.  It is not the case that career guidance will disappear or that counsellors will not be retained.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	461	There is nothing wrong with the notion of giving more responsibility to the schools themselves but I have spoken to teachers from two different schools who feel they are under more pressure to deal with the children's problems.  I do not know whether that is down to the principal not allocating the resources in the most efficient manner.  I accept there have been cutbacks and everything is more difficult.  I also understand there is not as much money around as we would like but I am glad the Minister will communicate with the schools in January.  The feedback from schools is that they are under severe pressure.  Children are under more pressure than they ever were and the classroom is a more difficult place to be than it ever was because children are so insecure and there are more issues at home.  They are bringing more problems to school and teachers have fewer resources to deal with these additional problems.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	462	The ESRI said yesterday in its report, Improving Second-Level Education: Using Evidence for Policy Development, that the removal of guidance counselling in schools will impact most on young students from disadvantaged backgrounds.  They are more reliant on advice from their schools, particularly in regard to going on to third level.  Better-off households can afford to buy particular guidance at different times.  We want to ensure that vulnerable young people will not lose out when the changes are made.  I am sure the Minister shares that ambition, as we all do.Will section 9(c) of the Education Act 1998 be clarified in the circular that is due to issue from the Department in January?  In the parliamentary question reply I quoted, which the Minister might check when he has the opportunity, it was stated that the schools “must” meet and then, subsequently, it was stated that the schools “can”.  Clarification is badly needed.  We do not want to see section 9(c) of the 1998 Act changed.  We are all aware of the importance of the Act and we want those requirements adhered to.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Let me respond very clearly.  Section 9(c) is not being changed.  It stands, and the schools have an obligation to adhere to the 1998 Act, including section 9(c).  Second, school guidance is not being eliminated from the schools and guidance counsellors are not being eliminated.  That is scaremongering and it is simply not the case.I accept the advice and findings of the ESRI on this matter.  Deputy Wallace referred to the role models that might exist in some households as against others.  There is a major distinction between guidance as to how best to deploy the talents of young people as they move into the adult world and counselling for young people, from whatever background, who are encountering real difficulties — sadly, there is much evidence of this.  This is not uniquely the function of the guidance counsellors.  Every school teacher will say they have to deal with that in their own classroom.I agree the counsellors have professional counselling skills, which are essential additional skills that are needed for particularly troubled young people.  What has been said to me in the last three years in opposition by principals in primary and secondary schools is that they want more autonomy in how best to deploy resources in their schools, not the kind of one-size-fits-all circular that has characterised the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street.  I am changing that.  I am giving them that discretion.  If some guidance teacher said that they fear their principal is going to get rid of them, they must ask themselves the question, "Is that because I am not valued in the classroom or in the school?"  I can understand the uncertainty that might be there for some people but, in the communication I will have with the schools in January, I will clarify that along the lines Deputy Smith referred to, and I will ensure the sort of concerns that were conveyed to Deputy Wallace will be properly addressed.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The HSE, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, has been conducting a national audit of all Catholic dioceses and religious orders.  It expects to be in a position in the spring of 2012 to furnish a report to me on the diocesan element of this audit.  I have stated that the need for follow-up action will be informed by the findings of the national audit.  It is my intention to publish the HSE's report when I receive it.The HSE's national director for children and family services, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, is also at my request engaging directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns, and that it has in place the necessary safeguarding structures and practices to fully protect children who come into contact with the church.As Deputies will be aware, as a Government, we are committed to strengthening the arrangements for the reporting of concerns of abuse by putting the Children First national guidance on a statutory basis.  The necessary legislation is being worked on by my Department as a priority.  This legislation will not only bring forward statutory requirements on organisations and individuals to report, but I believe it will also support all of civil society in understanding what to do when they have concerns about a child.  The roll-out of Children First will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place and demonstrate that they have robust safeguarding arrangements.  I very much welcome the work undertaken to date by the national board to strengthen child protection practices in the Catholic Church in line with this objective.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseWe must also recognise that child abuse takes many forms and occurs in many settings.  Anyone with child abuse concerns or information should not hesitate to come forward and assist the HSE and An Garda Síochána in their respective roles in carrying out their work to protect children.Reports such as those published over the last number of years by various State-commissioned inquiries in respect of the dioceses of Ferns, Cloyne, Dublin and the report of the Ryan commission serve to remind us all that the abuse of a child is a crime which is to be abhorred and that those involved must be subject to the full rigour of the law.  I fully recognise that these inquiries have provided an important opportunity for victims to have their voices heard and for the dreadful crimes committed against them to be exposed publicly.Due to the number of clerics against whom complaints and allegations were made, in certain instances for practical purposes it has been necessary to investigate a representative sample of cases.  In Dublin a representative sample of 46 priests were investigated out of a total number of 102 falling within the commission's remit.  In addition, other priests or religious against whom allegations were made may have fallen outside the time period covered by a statutory inquiry or, while operating in the relevant geographic area, may not have been working on behalf of the diocese concerned.  Therefore, while the investigations conducted to date have shed light on the abuse perpetrated on many victims, for practical purposes they cannot relate the individual suffering of all of those who were abused, even in the three dioceses already examined.I want to acknowledge those victims of clerical abuse who have shown great courage in coming forward to the authorities and thereby helped to expose a culture of secrecy that was endemic within some church dioceses and religious orders.  I recognise this has been a very painful experience for many individuals who have had to battle to have their experiences heard and believed, and to have their suffering recognised.  We must ensure that victims are supported in these circumstances.  In this context, the HSE's national counselling service provides services to adult victims of past abuse and their families.  The national counselling service is a professional, confidential counselling and psychotherapy service available free of charge in all regions of the Health Service Executive.  Since 2000, the national counselling service has received over 20,000 referrals.  The client group of the national counselling service includes adults who have experienced trauma and abuse in childhood, with priority given to adult survivors of institutional abuse in Ireland.The HSE's audit will provide a comprehensive picture of current practice across all dioceses and will provide an overview of the handling of allegations up to November 2011.  Taken with the work already completed, it will provide a fuller basis on which to determine the most appropriate next steps and will inform the Government's decisions in regard to this matter.

The six reports published by the National Board for Safeguarding Children two weeks ago outlined once again the abuse that many children had to suffer in this country in recent years.  In regard to the six dioceses, that abuse was within the Catholic Church.  The national board's report and work is commendable and welcome in the sense that it is ensuring that practices within the church at present are what they should be, identifying that the proper procedure and practice is in place and making recommendations to ensure that, where there are still some weaknesses, they are remedied immediately.That board carries out its particular purpose.  However, it does not go back over the failures of the church over the years, nor, indeed, does it take into account or examine how the State would have failed those victims at the same time.  For those——
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	466	A question, please.

The Minister's response to the publication of the six reports, of which the Raphoe report particularly stood out in terms of the practices that took place there, has been too vague and too weak.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	468	I call on the Minister to reply.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	470	I appreciate the fact the recent publication of the six diocesan reviews has served as a very painful reminder to many victims of the abuse and cover-ups they suffered.  However, in responding to the publication of these reviews, it is my view that it would be rash and ill-considered to immediately establish a new commission of inquiry, as the Deputy suggests, when we know an audit of all 24 dioceses is imminent, which will undoubtedly inform us how better to proceed.  While I am not ruling out further investigations, I would make the point that, here in Ireland, 1,000 victims have told their story very poignantly to the confidential committee of the Ryan report, the most extensive listening exercise done within Europe, I would suggest, in regard to victims of abuse.  That has been very important.  I believe there is scope in the church and elsewhere to consider further how the experiences and the voices of victims can be heard, as they should be heard.I acknowledge the great courage that victims of clerical abuse have shown in coming forward.  If the Deputy's Government had published the reports and the audit, when it was done, the current audit which the HSE has done would have been available and up to date.  It is delayed until the spring because it is important, when the report is published, that it gives an accurate, up-to-date picture, not an historical picture, of what the current situation is in regard to the audit of dioceses.  For that reason, the HSE will extend its report to the spring to ensure it is not just an historical report but an up-to-date report.  When I receive that, we will have a comprehensive picture of all of the dioceses.  I will also be receiving, I hope, the work of other dioceses.  The publication of reports on dioceses should not stop merely with the six dioceses; it should be comprehensive.

In fact, we have been waiting for that for six years.However, I disagree entirely with the Minister that we should be waiting any longer and that those victims, who were abused and who were outlined in the reports we received in the past few weeks, should have to wait.  The public, members of the church and, in particular, victims are tired of this drip feed of reports.  We need a comprehensive way that will deal with it, once and for all.  That demands nothing less than a State commission which can, from the State's point of view, assess where these victims were failed.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	477	I do not consider that an appropriate response to what is happening at present.  It is important to realise that there have been quite a number of investigations.  There have been the Cloyne report, the Murphy report and other reports.  There has been a series of four reports.  There have been the 1,000 victims who had their cases heard.  It is important for me to point out to the House that, due to the number of clerics against whom complaints and allegations were made, in certain instances, for practical purposes, it has been necessary to investigate a representative sample of cases.  In Dublin, for example, a representative sample of 46 priests were investigated out of a total of 102 falling within the commission's remit.  Other allegations may have fallen outside the time period.  While the investigations conducted to date have shed light on the abuse perpetrated on many victims, for practical purposes they cannot relate to the individual suffering of all those who were abused, even in those dioceses already examined.  That is a point that Deputy McConalogue must take on board and understand.  I think the public understands that.We must look at other methods as well.  While I am not ruling out that in some circumstances a commission of investigation may be necessary when the cross-referencing is done and when the HSE report comes out, it is important, as I stated, that, for example, the church and indeed the safe-guarding board could examine some of the material gathered which may address some of the points Deputy McConalogue raises.  I intend to have further discussions.  I have invited Mr. Ian Elliott and Mr. Gordon Jeyes to discuss with me these points to see how we might take further action to ensure victims' needs are further addressed.  The church could also examine what it might do to meet the needs Deputy McConalogue outlined.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I propose to take Questions Nos. 2 and 4 together.Young people in all care settings are deserving of the highest standard of care.  Regrettably, this was not the case in Gleann Álainn.  In view of the serious nature of the report, I have written to Mr. Gordon Jeyes, National Director of Children and Family Services, HSE, underlining my concerns as to the report's findings and asking him for details of the actions being taken immediately to ensure the standard of care in Gleann Álainn is improved to a safe and acceptable level in line with HIQA's recommendations.I thank HIQA for its report.  It was an unannounced inspection.  I am very disturbed by the findings within the report.  I have been informed that a range of measures are being taken to address the issues of concern highlighted by the inspection.  An action plan has been developed to ensure that all issues identified are addressed.  The Deputies will be pleased to hear that progress on the action plan is being measured on a daily basis and reported on fortnightly.  Pending evidence of improvement in line with the action plan, the HSE has decided there will be no further admissions to Gleann Álainn.  In addition, the HSE, at national level, is taking steps to improve overall management and governance of the special care unit and the high support services.  This includes the important appointment, in recent months, of a national manager for the service.  The HSE has also undertaken a review of the current model of care with reference to international best practice and the findings of this review will inform decisions on the future configuration of these services.HIQA has indicated that it will carry out another full inspection of Gleann Álainn in January 2012.  Progress on implementing the recommendations made will be assessed at that time and HIQA's findings will be communicated immediately to me.  In fact, I have invited HIQA to come in as soon as that inspection has been completed to discuss with me the findings of the report following its return to Gleann Álainn in January.  The ongoing work by HIQA is important in ensuring the provision of a high standard of care across the special care sector.The HSE has a four-year plan to develop the national special care service.  In January 2011, for the first time, the service came under a national director.  From January 2012, there will be 20 places available nationally, with an additional 14 places to be added within the next period, bringing the total number to 34 places.  The new places will be on the same campus as the two high support units — Monaghan and north Dublin.  This plan will enable children detained in special care to move from a special care unit to a high support unit.We have not really had such services and this is what is needed.  If children are in special care, which is a particular sort of situation where their liberty is taken from them and where they need high support services, what is really important is that they are able to move on from those services to high support units and be reintegrated back into the community.  That, certainly, is the plan in the future.

I lay emphasis on the word "unannounced" because that is critical if we are to have the degree of oversight that is necessary to establish best standards and best practice in all situations.I was disappointed with the HSE response which, in an effort to make excuses, stated that temporary management arrangements were place and that this had contributed to the situation in Gleann Álainn — an unfortunately named place in this situation.  One must remember that the HIQA inspection was carried out within a week of reports being received on two of the residents having absconded having secured keys that belonged to one of the support staff.  If that was a single incident, one might be able to wear the notion of temporary management arrangements, but there were 25 recorded incidents in the year preceding the inspection in October and a similar incident to that which gave rise to this unannounced inspection in October had taken place in September 2008.  Had we temporary management arrangements in place then too?  When does temporary management become an excuse?  It is no excuse and no excuses are acceptable in this situation.This is a facility that caters for up to seven girls.  It is critical that we get it right in the interest of those girls who find themselves in this situation.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin.

That is critically important.  It is not only about the issues highlighted by HIQA and that there have been repeat abscondments.  There are also reports that some of the girls in the facility fear others because of bullying and intimidation.  The capacity to contend with difficult circumstances that present themselves will vary.  At all times, we must be able to ensure that children in such circumstances can live without fear of any kind.  I am particularly interested to know the Minister's plans and whether she will publish them.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	484	I can only agree with most of the Deputy's points.  What  happened is unacceptable, as is the standard of management in the unit.  However, the report found evidence of good relationships and warmth between the staff and children.  The children told inspectors that their being placed in the unit was of benefit to them.  They stated they had built positive relationships with individual members of the staff team.  While we should not lose sight of that, we should certainly not underestimate in any way the seriousness of what has happened and the need to address it.I have a lot of detail on the actions that are being taken to improve circumstances, including allowing for more immediate access to a psychologist for the children; very detailed management actions; new management in the centre; much more national oversight; the assignment of a senior manager to undertake the role of quality improvement and an implementation manager; reducing the number of young people being placed in the centre; and an independent review to investigate the incident with the keys and the absconding of the young people.  Very detailed oversight is sought at present, which is absolutely correct.If it helps the Deputy regarding the implementation plan, I will send him a detailed note on what is happening.  When I receive the report from HIQA in January, I will be very happy to share it with the Deputies.
#CharlieMcConalogue	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-party	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-dob	unknown-#CharlieMcConalogue-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	485	Unfortunately, the events in the report by HIQA into Gleann Álainn are not isolated.  The report is consistent with other HIQA reports into the State's other two special care units.  Just last week, HIQA published the report on Gleann Álainn finding it in a state of crisis.  HIQA declared Ballydowd special care unit unfit for purpose in 2009.  The HSE committed to closing it down, yet it remains open due to the increase in the number of children requiring access to special care units over the past year.  HIQA found that Coovagh House in Limerick was in a state of crisis.  What is the position in the State's special care units?  The position is stark and, unfortunately, is a very poor reflection on how the State is dealing with vulnerable children.  The record has not been good.As a result of the passage of the Child Care (Amendment) Bill earlier this year, it is likely that pressures on the special care units and the number of people needing to access them will increase.  Has there been an assessment by the Department of the likely increase in numbers?  While I totally understand the need to be able to move on to high support units, I believe there will always be, unfortunately, a requirement for strong special care units and an effective service.  Does the Minister intend to continue sending children abroad to gain access to special care units and services?  How many children will be in this category in the coming year?  It is not acceptable.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	486	It is unfortunate that the previous Government neglected special care.  There is a great deal of work to be done to address the deficits I have inherited; that is the reality.  I am determined to address the deficits, however, because the needy group of young people in question deserves the very best the State can offer.A recommendation was made to close the unit in Ballydowd.  I visited the unit and the decision was reversed.  Considerable improvements have been made in the unit, which currently has nine children.  HIQA has inspected it recently and this will result in many improvements and good standards.Gleann Álainn has five children.  Therefore, 14 children are in the care of the State.  That is the maximum number of places at present.  We need approximately 34 places.  There will be another five when Coovagh House reopens in January 2012.  While there should not be a waiting list for special care, there is.  This cannot be dealt with overnight.A number of children are abroad in care placements.  The number supplied to the Deputy previously, 31, is incorrect.  The correct number, which I gave to the Deputy, was 15.  This has risen to 17.  Of those, eight are in a secure care placement under court order.  The rest are in need of care.The shortage of places in Ireland must be addressed, and I have outlined how this will be done.  Some of the children in question require very specialist placement.  We simply do not have the sorts of therapeutic inpatient units that some of the children need given their range of sexual, behavioural and developmental problems.  This is being dealt with.It is reported that many of the children are doing extremely well in their placements.  Eight of the 17 children abroad are in secure care placements and the others are in care placements.  The total is 17, not 31.  There are 14 places in Ireland at present but there is a need for approximately 34.  An assessment has been carried out and there is a national plan to move towards 34 places.  I am working on that and will be paying special attention to ensuring we have those places for children in Ireland.  There will probably be a need for some placements in the near future for children with very specialist needs whom we simply do not have the resources to cater for.Unfortunately, over the past ten years of the Celtic tiger, inpatient facilities were not made available for young people with mental health difficulties.  They should have been.  We are witnessing the deficit in this area and it affects children negatively.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	490	In March 2011, the social services inspectorate of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, carried out an announced follow-up inspection of the foster care service provided by the Health Service Executive, HSE, in the Dublin North-Central local health area.  The inspection was carried out under section 69(2) of the Child Care Act 1991 and was done to assess progress in implementing the recommendations of the full original inspection report, which was published by HIQA in July 2010.  The findings of the first inspection identified significant shortcomings in the HSE's compliance with national standards and regulations pertaining to foster care services, and a series of local and national recommendations was made by the authority.  In 2010, the HSE provided HIQA with an action plan against the local recommendations that related to the Dublin north-central area.A follow-up inspection found that good progress had been made in the implementation of most of the recommendations in the original inspection report.  The positive changes that had taken place included an increase in the number of social worker posts in the area, a reduction in the number of unallocated cases and improved local systems of gathering and maintaining information and care records.  Seventeen new social worker posts had been allocated and all of the posts were filled.  The inspection found that the provision of supervision to social workers had improved.  Other positive changes were related to improved governance of this service and the considerable efforts to ensure social workers carried out their duties in accordance with foster care standards and regulations.  However there continued to be children in foster care and foster carers in the area who did not have an assigned social worker.  Delays in the assessment and approval of relative foster carers continued, and the Children First guidelines were not being complied with totally.  These findings were of particular concern.However, the HSE is working to address the deficits in Dublin central.  The 17 additional social worker posts that have been filled will help us to complete the assessments that are outstanding.  Further work must be done to ensure all children in foster care are assessed and have a foster care plan.  The HSE will be closely monitoring this work at local and national level and will report back to my Department on it.

Such an environment is not available to many children in the north inner city because of the area's drugs problems.  Some of them have seen their parents die, sometimes through suicide, or continue in addiction.  Many of them are being cared for by their grandparents, who have taken them in with an heart and a half despite the additional strains involved.  I accept the Minister's assurances on the overall report but these grandparents need support.I acknowledge the tireless efforts of family support workers, many of whom come from the area.  If the supports are not provided now there will be an increase in the numbers of children looking for places in Ballydowd or additional services when they reach adulthood.  What exactly is being done to address the issue, other than the 17 additional posts?  What can be done for these grandparents?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	492	The deficiencies in the system are being addressed.  We are increasing the number of cases assigned social workers beyond the 88% of cases identified in the report.  The assessments are ongoing.  Clearly the level of family support required cannot be determined without assessments.  If the Deputy wishes to bring individual cases to my attention or discuss them directly with the local HSE office, I will be happy to facilitate her.  We are funding a range of family support services at the voluntary and statutory level to provide the supports these families require.An audit of alternative care services is being finalised at national level.  This will provide valuable information about the demand for alternative care services.  I pay tribute to foster parents.  We are fortunate that the vast majority of the 6,000 children in care are being looked after by experienced and caring foster parents.  Sometimes we forget about the good work being done when we receive reports that highlight deficiencies.  I also acknowledge the work being done by children's extended families.

Perhaps they will all be approved.  I have been involved in the young people's facilities and services fund since its establishment in the late 1990s and I chaired the group for the north inner city.  It does great work for the capital money it receives.  I welcome the provision of a small grants fund this year.  This funding went a long way in the north inner city.In view of the impact of drugs, would the Minister consider engaging more directly with the existing structures of the national drugs strategy?

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	495	The Government has completed and published the results of a detailed comprehensive review of expenditure.  This review examined all areas of Government expenditure in order to meet the Government's overall fiscal consolidation objectives and realign spending with the priorities set out in the programme for Government.  Central to the review process has been the need to consider new ways of achieving Government objectives in the context of public sector reform.My Department participated fully in this review process, which involved detailed analysis of all areas of relevant expenditure, identification of additional costs associated with programme for Government commitments and other spending pressures and the formulation of options for savings.  Detailed interactions took place with relevant agencies, including the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.My Department's input to the comprehensive review of expenditure process was fully aligned with the Government's reform objectives for children's services and encompassed the child protection and welfare services currently operated by the HSE which are going to transfer to the new agency.  In addition, the Government's public service reform announcements on 17 November signalled my decision to merge the Family Support Agency into the child and family support agency following the latter's establishment.  This is consistent with the approach taken by my Department in the process of considering more effective ways to use resources to achieve the Government's key objective to improve services for children and families.Last week, I announced a dedicated new budget subhead which was established for the first time in the HSEVote in preparation for the planned establishment of the child and family support agency.  Provision of €568 million has been made for 2012.  Traditionally the budget for children has been underestimated.  It is important that we do due diligence to ensure the money earmarked for child and family support services are covered by the new subhead.  A process is currently underway in conjunction with the HSE to review and refine the detailed components of this subhead.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseThe provision for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and families within the HSE Vote will pave the way for the establishment of the new Agency in 2013.  This dedicated budget will be managed by the national director of children and family services and his staff in support of the process of operational improvement in child protection and welfare services which he is leading.  Central to this reform is the delivery of transparent and accountable management and budgeting.The Government's reform of child welfare and protection services is also being assisted by the task force on the child and family support agency which I established in September.  The task force, which has considerable expertise, met for the eighth time earlier this week and also has a number of sub-groups undertaking particular aspects of its work.  The task force is chaired by Ms Maureen Lynott and it also includes the national director of children and family services, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, and the Secretary General of my Department.I am satisfied that the recent budgetary decisions, while taking place in a context of huge pressure on the public finances, have been fully informed by the Government's commitment to the establishment of the child and family support agency.  The establishment of the new agency is part of a wider change agenda aimed at strengthening the organisational capacity, business processes and systems necessary to deliver safe and reliable child protection services.  This change agenda is necessary in order utilise resources to their fullest to promote better outcomes for children and achieve Government objectives for the improvement of the child protection system.  I believe, in time, this will constitute an important and demonstrable example for the public of the benefits of public service reform.

She spoke about her full participation in the review process.  Did she have an opportunity to discuss the impact of cuts directly with the Ministers for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform?  Was an analysis conducted into the curtailments that may result?In regard to the 2% cut in the areas of mental health, disability and children's services, a footnote to the document presented by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform projected the so-called savings of €50 million.  I have tabled a parliamentary question on this issue and I understand that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, may not be in a position to address the matter today.  What impact will this cut have on children's services and her Department?  The projected savings are not broken down according to the categories.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	497	Every Department faced a difficult budgetary outlook.  No Department was exempt.  What I and my Department had to do was to examine the various spending areas.  The saving to which the Deputy referred is across a range of areas and is part of the reform programme, including various budgetary controls that have been established.  It relates to a number of areas, which I can correspond with the Deputy on.I had to be clear about the areas I wanted to protect.  For example, there was a requirement for an extra €12 million in the area of early childhood care and education alone in order to meet the increased number of three and four year olds participating.  I was pleased that I was able to protect that service.  For other services, I will have to examine the possibility of reforming how they are delivered.  I have already mentioned the budget for the youth sector; I am introducing reforms in this area which I believe will create efficiencies among organisations.  In addition, I will be asking a range of organisations to examine how they spend their money, to carry out due diligence on their spending and to consider how they can deliver services in a more efficient way, including by working together and perhaps sharing services.  We have seen that this is beginning to happen in other areas; for example, in the early childhood area, two major organisations have come together and are working effectively as a unit.  We will certainly see more of that.To answer the Deputy's question, I took a careful approach to the budget decisions.  I wanted to ensure that priority areas were protected within the budgets over which I had control, and I believe we have achieved that.  I would prefer not to have to make any of these decisions but, unfortunately, the national financial and economic situation demands it.

When does she expect to see the agency in situ?  I know from cases presenting at my office — I am sure other Deputies have had the same experience — that the budgetary cutbacks will have negative effects, particularly on families, which will result as it sadly often does in friction, disruption and the break-up of families in many cases.  Often, the result of this is young adolescent displacement, which can result in more homelessness and an increase in the number of young people seeking State care services.  If the Minister does not have the exact figures, could she give us an indication of the number of children who were placed in care because their families were experiencing financial difficulties?  We have talked about this before.  It is a particular situation as against other issues that contribute to children needing State care.  I am asking about children seeking State care as a direct consequence of their families’ financial difficulties.  That is, more and more, the reality we are in, and such children will present in ever-increasing numbers in the future.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	499	To answer the Deputy's question about the establishment of the new agency, January 2013 is the indicative date at this stage, assuming we are in a position, during the course of 2012, to disaggregate from the HSE and pass the legislation to establish the new agency.With regard to children coming into the care system due to financial pressures on their families, it is hard to separate out one factor such as that.  The main reason children are coming into care, from the information available to me, is neglect.  Very high numbers of young children are coming into State care because of such situations.  My information is that alcohol and drug abuse are behind many of these cases, and these are among the key factors that lead to young people coming into care.  It is difficult to disaggregate precisely the impact of the financial pressures on families as a specific reason for children coming into care, but undoubtedly, financial difficulties place extra stress on families.  We have a range of family support services and it is the intention, and the practice, to ensure by any means we can that children stay out of care.  That must be the priority in our approach.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	500	I noted with interest the report Letting Children be Children, which was published in the UK earlier this year.  I am also aware of, and indeed share, Irish parents' concerns regarding the increasing sexualisation and commercialisation of childhood.Since becoming Minister I have repeatedly stressed the need for a cross-community approach to protecting children and preserving the space of childhood.  All of society has a responsibility in this regard, including retailers, broadcasters, advertisers and the Internet industry.  Indeed, some disturbing information is becoming available about the abuses children can be exposed to via new media.  As I have already indicated, I have directed that my Department's new policy framework for children and young people, which is to be published in 2012, should address emerging issues such as the impact of new technologies, media and consumerism on young people.The UK report acknowledges that while the body of knowledge on topics to do with the sexualisation and commercialisation of children is growing, it is still inconclusive, and that further research, particularly longitudinal research, is required to investigate whether there is evidence of harm to children from these phenomena and how this harm occurs.  Many people have an opinion that such harm does occur, but there is a suggestion that further work needs to be done.My Department recently published the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children's Lives 2011-2016.  In the preparation of this strategy, extensive consultation was carried out with a variety of organisations working directly with children, regional and local bodies, representative groups and central Government as well as children and young people themselves.  This consultative process identified a small number of references to the issues addressed by the Letting Children be Children report, such as the influence of marketing and media messages on children and sexualisation through clothing.Additional information not given on the floor of the HouseMy Department is funding a national longitudinal study of children entitled Growing Up in Ireland.  The broad base of this study enables the examination of a range of influences and outcomes in children's lives and, while it is not explicitly concerned with issues of commercialisation and sexualisation, it has the capacity to provide data on issues of relevance, such as the extent to which nine year old children have unsupervised access to different forms of media.  Findings from the Growing Up in Ireland study and other recent research and consultations are informing the development of my Department's new policy framework for children and young people.  In particular, my Department has been engaged in one of the most extensive consultations ever undertaken with children in Ireland.  All of these results will inform the priorities set out in the policy framework for children and young people next year.

What we are talking about is a commercial attack on childhood.  Childhood is becoming much shorter, and this is for the purpose of commercial profit.  I am aware of the phenomenon of little girls coming to school with pencil cases with Playboy logos on them in a deliberate attempt by certain commercial interests to normalise pornography.  The Minister mentioned some of the issues in the Bailey report in the UK, Letting Children be Children, including the inappropriate manner in which various retail outlets were selling children's clothing.  What I am hoping is that we will be able to get tough on this and to have strict guidelines for retailers and advertisers.  There is money to be made from the shortening of childhood and from encouraging children to have adult attitudes from an earlier stage of their lives.  There is money to be made from the music industry — the whole "X-Factor" music industry is particularly directed at children — and from clothing and make-up, so advertising in these industries is being directed at children of younger and younger age groups.  Although commercial interests are powerful — money would not be spent on advertising if it were not powerful — we have a responsibility in this House to protect childhood.  I appreciate the Minister's response and ask her to indicate the potential legislation in this area.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	502	I accept the points the Deputy makes.  It is interesting to note, for example, the contrast between the UK and Ireland in the retail sector.  The British retail consortium has already established basic guidelines on responsible retailing of children's wear, which has been signed up to by major retailers including Tesco, Marks & Spencer, Debenhams and TK Maxx, all of which operate in the Irish market.However, in Ireland there is neither a code of conduct for the retail of children's wear nor even basic guidelines similar to those prepared by the British Retail Consortium.  This should be addressed.  My Department has had some preliminary discussions with the National Consumer Agency but I expect it will be addressed in the new children's strategy.  There will be a public consultation phase for that.  We should be examining high level objectives and the type of actions we should take in this country, similar to what has already been undertaken in the UK and what is proposed in the Bailey report.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	503	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 and 12 together.The HSE, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, has been conducting a national audit of all Catholic dioceses and religious orders.  It expects to be in a position in the spring of 2012 to furnish a report to me on the diocesan element of this audit.  The need for follow-up action will be informed by the findings of the national audit.  As I said previously, it is my intention to publish the HSE's report.  The HSE's national director for children and family services, Mr. Gordon Jeyes, at my request earlier this year, is also engaging directly with the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church on a programme of action designed to ensure that the Catholic Church is responding properly and comprehensively to all child protection concerns.The roll out of the Children First national guidance will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place robust safeguarding arrangements to ensure compliance with the guidance.  I very much welcome the work undertaken to date by the national board to strengthen child protection practices in the Catholic Church in line with this objective.

The reason it is unsurprising is that the Dáil has heard the same response before, and it is also surprising for that reason.  It is now December 2011 and the Minister tells us that she expects to receive this report from the HSE in spring 2012.  Last December, the then Minister said that he expected to receive this report from the HSE in spring 2011, yet we are getting the same answer again in December 2011.Last July, when the Minister responded to the Cloyne report, she told us that she expected to receive and publish the HSE audit in September, three months ago.  What happened between July and now?  What has changed?  How can we have faith that this audit will be delivered in the spring?  As regards the Minister's previous response about the six reports published on the six dioceses, her position now is to wait for the HSE audit.  We could be waiting indefinitely.  I disagree with that approach.  What happened between July and now to explain this report still not being available?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	505	As I already explained, if the previous Ministers had published this report earlier, as they said they would, we would not be in this situation.  The reason I am in this position regarding the publication of the report is that a range of changes have been implemented, which were outlined in the dioceses report.  To have an up-to-date report from the HSE that is relevant and speaks to the present as opposed to the past, I am informed by the director of children and family services in the HSE that more time is required to get the type of information that will ensure the report is up to date.  In addition, from a legal point of view, one does not wish to publish a report that does not reflect the changes made in recent times.  In the discussions he is having in the course of carrying out this audit it has become clear to the national director that he needs further time to have a report that reflects current practice, is up to date, reflects the changes that have been made and to ensure that he is reporting accurately on the dioceses with regard to child protection.  For those reasons he said he needs extra time.  Legally it makes sense to do that because it will be a more accurate report.I cannot take responsibility for the fact that the previous Government did not publish the report over a five to six year period.  What is surprising is that it did not publish it.  I must ensure that the report is accurate, up to date and reflects the current situation, in so far as possible.  That is why the extra time has been requested and it is reasonable that the time should be given.  This has emerged since I first answered the question to which the Deputy referred.  This information is new and having received it, it is appropriate to give enough time to ensure we have a comprehensive, accurate and up-to-date report.

This is being put on the long finger and is not being dealt with as quickly as it should be.  I would not be surprised to get the same response again in the spring.  I urge the Minister to take hold of this issue with the HSE and ensure the report is completed and published as soon as possible.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	511	There is a difference between five years of looking at an audit and not publishing it and four months.  That is the contrast and the Deputy's party must take responsibility for that.  I have certainly taken hold of this issue.  I have had a great deal of discussion about it.  I am anxious to ensure that when the report is published it will be up to date and defensible in terms of the data it contains.  Due to the delays in publishing it, extra time is needed to ensure that it will be up to date.  I want to ensure it is published as soon as possible, and I am informed by the director of national services for children and families that it will be available in the spring.

That is my appeal.  I want the report to be published but, as Deputy McConalogue said, let us not have a repetition of this.  The Minister must do everything she can to ensure the publication of the audit in the spring.When does the Minister expect the Children First guidelines to be put on a statutory basis?  What plans does she have for implementing the range of outstanding recommendations in the Ryan report that have still not been implemented?  Does she have a plan in place, and is it being worked on proactively?  What is the current position with that report?
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	513	A great deal of work has been done on the Children First legislation.  I said previously that the heads of the Bill would be referred to the Oireachtas committee in the next Dáil term.  I will do that because it is important to get a response.  As the Deputy would expect, it is proving to be complex legislation, but much progress has been made.  I will be submitting a further memorandum to the Government on it this week.  It will be before the committee in the next session, and I hope the heads of the Bill will be prepared in the near future.What was the Deputy's other question?

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I am very pleased that by the end of this year the 60 additional social workers, to which I referred during the last priority questions when some doubt was being cast on the recruitment, will be in place.  There is another question about the matter which we may not get to.  They will have been recruited and some will have started work.  They will start working in December and January.  That is one of the key recommendations of the Ryan report and I am very pleased to have been able to deliver 60 extra social workers.  They were not affected by the pause in the HSE or the embargo in place.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	516	Section 45 of the Child Care Act 1991 places a statutory duty on the HSE to form a view on to each person leaving care as to whether there is a need for assistance and, if it forms such a view, to provide services in accordance with the legislation and subject to resources.  All young people who have had a care history with the HSE, be it foster care, residential care, high support care or special care are entitled to an after care service based on their assessed needs.Where a young person turns 18 years of age, it is policy within the HSE for him or her to remain in his or her placement and receive full support to complete his or her leaving certificate examination.  In the case of separated children seeking asylum, on reaching 18 years of age these young people transfer to adult services operated on behalf of the Department of Justice and Equality.Recently a small number of cases have been brought to my attention where consideration was being given to the transfer of a young person from residential placements with a private provider to alternative accommodation.  The young person involved is in a leaving certificate year and I am concerned that this important consideration needs to be addressed.In particular, relocation some distance away would necessitate a change in school and this would clearly conflict with supporting the young person with his or her exam preparations.  I have discussed the matter with the national director of the HSE and have asked him to review the cases with a view to providing continuity in education for the young person in preparation for the leaving certificate.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	517	The Minister has asked the question but has she got a response?  Can we have certainty that her request will be acted upon?  She is right in that preparation for leaving certificate examinations is a huge challenge in the life of a young person at a very difficult time in the life of any young adult.Those in care also have the added worry of reaching their 18th birthday in the course of their preparation for the leaving certificate and not knowing what the future will hold.  This is in the context of after care and the entitlement to it.  We have spoken about the phrase "is subject to resources" and have tried to have it taken out of the current vernacular because it can be a cop-out.The Minister has demonstrated her awareness that these are real cases.  I am also aware of this.  It is very important that we recognise this group of young people will repeat present as the leaving certificate and other such challenges in life come about.  We need to have a holistic approach in place, one that is truly caring and all-encompassing.  I support the Minister's request.  I would like to have some certainty as to what action and performance we can now expect.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	518	As I have made absolutely clear, I am deeply concerned when I hear that it has been decided to move young people from their current placements.  The level of disruption that would cause would clearly be detrimental to them at a particularly challenging and crucial time in their life.  I have contacted the HSE and asked that the decision be reviewed and that the young people concerned have continuity of care when they are doing the leaving certificate.  The HSE is to revert to me very shortly.  I have outlined my concerns in great detail to it and expect the decision to be reversed in order that the young people concerned can continue to remain in their current placements.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	519	I respect the intent of the Minister.  When she uses the phrase "asked it to review" I always become concerned because it offers escape clauses.  I have no doubt she will be forceful in conveying her wishes which are just as strong as mine.  I hope it is understood on the receiving end that this is what is expected, end of story.  It cannot apply only at this time for this particular cohort of young people in this situation.  It must be part and parcel of the HSE's realisation of its duty of care and responsibility into the future.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	520	The policy is clear.  When a young person reaches the age of 18 it has been policy and practice for him or her to remain in his or her placement if he or she is in a leaving certificate year.  The vast majority of those doing leaving certificate examinations are aged 18 because of the slightly later school starting age.  I have made it absolutely clear I am concerned about the decisions taken.  They should be reversed and I believe they will be.  Best practice is that young people stay in their current placements until they complete the leaving certificate.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	521	I very much welcome the tabling of the question by Deputy McLellan.  The transition from childhood to adulthood is not as crude as any one calendar date.  I ask the Minister to examine the issue of children who turn 18 years of age while completing third level education and the trauma that can be inflicted on them when they have to move a significant distance.The Minister should examine how the Child Care Act interacts with the Refugee Act.  A number of people who came to the country as minors have completed their leaving certificate in supportive lodgings but at 18 years of age are put in hostel accommodation and are unable to complete third level education.  There is no economic saving to the State.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	522	I take the point the Deputy is making.  We have a much better understanding of the after care needs of our young people who have been in care.  It is important they are addressed and a proper assessment is done in each case.  Financial resources come in to play as young people get older, as well as whether the service can sustain the kind of support suggested by the Deputy.  I take the point that we need to have the most supportive services available to young people who have been in care because we know they are a very vulnerable group.As I said, there is a particular issue in regard to separated children seeking asylum.  They transfer to the adult services operated by the Department of Justice and Equality.  That can be very disruptive to those young people, whether they are in a secondary school or third level education.  Perhaps it is an issue that Deputy could take up with the Minister for Justice and Equality and he and I could examine it.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	523	I am very pleased to be able to tell the House that is provided for in the HSE's 2011 service plan, the recruitment of additional social workers is at a very advanced stage.  The 60 posts have been cleared completely.  The budget is in place and the latest information available from the HSE indicates that 53 additional posts have been filled or accepted.  A further five posts are being offered to candidates this week and the rest will be filled very shortly afterwards.  As the Deputy will see from the figures I have provided, this is a high priority.I informed the House on previous occasions that the 60 additional social workers requested under the Ryan report implementation plan would be in place by the end of the year.  I am now confirming that they will have been recruited by the HSE within that timeframe, which is very welcome.  These additional workers will be targeted at priority areas of the service, having regard to the overall assessment of workload which is being undertaken by the national director of children and family services at the HSE, Gordon Jeyes, and his team.   The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a broader change agenda within the executive which will enable us to deliver better outcomes for children and families.  This reform agenda will involve the establishment of a new child and family support agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection, something we did not have in the past when child protection was part of the broader HSE remit.

I asked a straightforward question as to how many of the promised 60 social workers are now in place.  The Minister referred to posts being "cleared" and plans being "at a very advanced stage".  She said the budget is "in place" and that 53 of the posts have been "filled or accepted".  I have been hearing for months that candidates have accepted the posts, but that was the end of it; they were not subsequently appointed to their roles.  I am asking how many of these staff are in place, as of 15 December 2011.My concern is that through the course of this year — the figures speak for themselves in this regard — we have, in fact, gone backwards in terms of social worker numbers.  The most recent figures from the Department show that at the end of September, there were four fewer social workers in place in the system than was the case at the beginning of the year.  Moreover, the decision by the HSE not to cover maternity leave or replace temporary posts means there are even fewer workers in the system.The impact of that is easily foreseen.  Last week in the Central Criminal Court we saw a father sentenced to life imprisonment for abusing several of his children.  That abuse continued in the last decade even though the health authorities first became aware of the family in 2000.  The response of the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Alan Shatter, to that case was to focus on the introduction of mandatory reporting.  This ignores the reality that the key problem in this particular case was that the health authorities had failed to intervene at an earlier stage, which allowed the abuse to continue.  That comes back to the requirement for more social workers.  The unfortunate reality, however, is that, as of today, there has instead been a reversal in this regard.

As I said, the budget is in place and I have indicated the numbers who have been recruited.  The 60 social workers will be commencing work and some have already started.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	527	Some 53 of the 60 additional posts for 2011 requested under the Ryan report implementation plan have been filled or accepted, with the remainder being offered.The Deputy is incorrect in his claim that there has been a decrease in the number of social workers working with children and families.  On the contrary, there has already been an increase of 24 this year within that area, and now we will have the additional 60.  That amounts to 84 additional posts in the child and family protection area.  The Deputy should recognise that the 60 social workers will be in place.  The money is there and the posts have not been affected by the recruitment embargo.  Those 60 social workers will be working in the HSE in the course of 2012.  That is the situation and there is nothing unclear about it.  I have made absolutely clear that the funding has been made available for those 60 posts and that they will be in place.  Moreover, an additional 24 are already working in the system.As the Deputy knows, to maintain numbers within the public sector generally in the current economic circumstances is extremely difficult.  As such, these additional posts represent important progress.  The staff in question have a very challenging workload to undertake.  The Deputy should acknowledge that the 60 social workers will be in place.Written Answers follow Adjournment.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	528	Special Care involves the detention on an exceptional basis of a non-offending child for his or her own welfare and protection in a Special Care unit with on site educational and therapeutic supports. The child's behaviour, and the risk of harm it poses to his or her life, health, safety, development or welfare is addressed in the care setting. Future care requirements are also explored.There are three designated Special Care units in the country which are operated by the HSE under a single national governance arrangement. They are Ballydowd Young Peoples Centre (Dublin), Gleann Alainn (Cork) and Coovagh House (Limerick).The placing of a child in a Special Care unit is considered as a last resort, for as short a time as possible, and when other forms of residential or community care are considered to be unsuitable.My Department is advised that, as of yesterday, there were a total of 14 children resident in the existing units. In relation to the number of children who have been detained in residential care during each of the past five years, I have asked the Health Service Executive for the information in question which I will forward to the Deputy.The HSE has a four year plan to develop the National Special Care Service.  In January 2011 the service came under the National Director.  From January 2012 there will be 20 places available nationally, with an additional 14 places to be added within the next period, bringing the total number to 34 places.  The new places will be on the same campus as the two high support units- Monaghan and North Dublin.  This plan will allow children detained in special care to move from a special care unit to an open high support unit on the same campus with the advantage of staying in the same school and working with the same staff groups.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	529	Under the Child Care Regulations 1995 the HSE is required to keep one or more registers in relation to children placed in care. The register holds personal information in respect of the child and his or her parents contact details, as well as details of the child's care placement. Currently, these registers are kept at local level. The registers are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) as part of their function. Up to now there has been no single national register of children in care.A register of all young people in custody in the Children Detention Schools (CDS), Oberstown, Lusk, Co. Dublin is maintained and updated on a daily basis.The National Child Care Information System (NCCIS) will be the central system supporting Social Work services. As a social work case management system, it will be used to record and store the case history of every child and other clients of the service. Management information will be derived automatically from the case management system. The aim of the NCCIS project is to identify and procure an easy to use technology solution to support this type of case recording and to automatically provide management information. The HSE estimates that the NCCIS will be at contract stage by mid 2012. This will be followed by a four month development stage, to be followed by a four month pilot roll out. On this basis,  it  expects that management data from the system will begin to be available from approximately mid 2013.The implementation of the National Child Care Information System is an important element in ensuring nationally consistent approaches to the recording and management of information in order to support case management and national oversight. In addition, I believe the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency in 2013 and associated reforms will represent a decisive shift towards achieving nationally consistent standards across all child protection services.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I provided the Deputy with a detailed response on this issue on the 3rd of November last. The HSE was asked for an update on the position and has provided the following additional information:The issue of training spans several of the report's recommendations. A detailed training programme continues to be rolled out in a number of areas including neglect, courtroom skills and report writing. Training on Attachment Theory will be rolled out in 2012. In relation to management development, training was rolled out for first time managers and senior managers during the summer and autumn of this year. Supervision training has been rolled out for Supervisors at the levels of Child Care Manager, Principal Social Worker, Team Leader and Social Care Leader.I published revised Children First National Guidance earlier this year. Briefing sessions in relation to the Guidance continue throughout the HSE. The HSE's associated Child Protection and Welfare Practice Handbook has also been distributed amongst all relevant staff.On the issue of targeted family support, a dedicated Family Support Service is in place in North Roscommon and it is planned to expand the service through a redistribution of funding from other sources. This will be achieved by employing another youth worker and increasing the capacity of youth workers currently providing a service.The report recommended that the nature of public health nursing records in respect of children where there are child protection concerns should be reviewed to ensure their adequacy. In this context the public health nursing service has developed a Child Health Record, and it is currently in the process of developing a Child Protection Record.The report recommended that there should be full involvement of the HSE Speech and Language Department in the development of support and treatment services for children and families where this is an issue for the child's well-being. A Communications Working Group has been established, comprising representatives from social work and allied disciplines such as public health nursing, occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The objective of this is to ensure a more seamless flow of information between the various disciplines.The report recommended that a nationally appropriate quality assurance system be established, that considers the practice issues as well as the technical aspects of each case. A Principal Social Worker has commenced auditing of files with support provided at regional level.In conclusion, the HSE continues to address the recommendations of the Report into the Roscommon childcare case as a priority. I hope that the information provides the Deputy with a helpful update on the progress being made.

The media coverage linked the individual concerned to a supplementary report prepared by the Dublin Archdiocese Commission. I note that the identity of the individual was not disclosed in the Commission's Supplementary Report or any subsequent communications by the Commission of which I am aware.Following the publication of the Dublin Archdiocese Commission's Report, the report was referred by the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to an Assistant Garda Commissioner specifically appointed to examine the report. The Supplementary Report was subsequently referred to the Assistant Garda Commissioner, who is examining how complaints were handled and investigated by the Church and State authorities. Such matters are still under consideration by An Garda Síochána.I have indicated that I am awaiting receipt of the HSE's national audit report on all Catholic dioceses before responding to calls for the establishment of further statutory or other inquiries. The HSE, which has statutory responsibility for child welfare and protection, has been conducting a national audit of all Catholic dioceses and Religious Orders. It expects to be in a position in the Spring of 2012 to furnish a report to me on the diocesan element of this audit. It is my intention to publish the HSE's report. At that point it is expected that the findings of the Ferns, Dublin and Cloyne reports; the reports of the National Board for Safeguarding Children in the Catholic Church and the HSE audit of Catholic dioceses will inform the fullest consideration of the matter.In the meantime the Government is to ensure that all child protection concerns are responded to and acted upon. I am committed to strengthening the arrangements for the reporting of concerns of abuse by putting key elements of the  Children First National Guidance on a statutory footing. This legislation will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place robust safeguarding arrangements.

In effect this means that the HSE is free to replace staff on maternity leave subject to remaining within its overall approved ceiling and resources.The Ryan Report Implementation Plan committed to the recruitment of an additional 270 social workers. The first 200 of these new posts were in place by the end of 2010. The HSE National Service Plan includes financial provision for the recruitment of a further 60 social workers this year.The additional social workers will be targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to an overall assessment of workload undertaken by the National Director and his team.   The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider change agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families. This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of  the new Child and Family Support Agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and support families in need.In relation to the specific manpower related matters raised, I understand that due to the financial pressures experienced by the HSE during the course of this year a decision on the temporary replacement of social workers while on maternity leave is made on a case by case basis. Consideration is given to overall staffing levels and service pressures within the wider social work team. I have asked the Health Service Executive for the specific information requested and I will forward this to the Deputy as soon as it is available.

The immediate and ongoing needs of separated children seeking asylum (SCSA)  as well as their application for refugee status are the responsibility of the Health Service Executive (HSE) in accordance with the Refugee Act, 1996 (as amended) and the Child Care Act, 1991. Where children are identified by An Garda Síochána, at the point of entry, the circumstances are investigated and if there are any concerns about the welfare of the child, they are placed into the care of the HSE.The Implementation Plan on the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, 2009, contained a commitment that the HSE would end the use of separately run hostels for separated children seeking asylum and accommodate children in mainstream care, on a par with other children in the care system. In accordance with this commitment, the HSE phased out hostel type care for separated children seeking asylum and since January 2011, hostels have  not been used  to accommodate unaccompanied minors. Instead each child is cared for in a  registered care placement or equivalent.The HSE has developed a national policy on the standards and services to be provided to separated children seeking asylum.  The policy seeks to achieve equity and equality of services to separated children seeking asylum vis-à-vis indigenous or resident children and to ensure that there is no differentiation of care provision, care practices, care priorities, standards or protocols.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Under the Child Care Act, 1991, the Health Service Executive (HSE) has a duty to promote the welfare of children who are not receiving adequate care or protection. The policy of the HSE is to place children in care settings, preferably in foster care, as close as possible to their home and community. The vast majority  of children in care are in foster care and residential care.However, some children have highly specialised needs arising from severe behaviour difficulties. The HSE  has in place a network of special care and high support facilities for children with specialised care needs.  This includes three designated special care units at Ballydowd in Dublin,  Coovagh House in Limerick and Gleann Alainn in Cork. The units were established to provide an individualised programme of support through the provision of a time-limited, therapeutic intervention in a secure  environment.  The unit at Gleann Alainn is designed to provide secure residential care for up to seven girls aged between 11 and 17 years on admission. The children are detained under a High Court detention order on the basis that they pose a serious risk to themselves or others.Special care units are inspected by the Health Information and Quality Authority's (HIQA) Social Services Inspectorate (SSI) in accordance with the Child Care Act, 1991. The units are inspected annually against the Child Care (Special Care) regulations 2004 and the National Standards for Special Care (2001).  The most recent inspection of Gleann Alainn was undertaken by HIQA  in October 2011. At the time of inspection there were six children detained.The inspection found that some practices were of a poor standard, such as locking the children in their individual bedroom sections by 7.30pm.  The HSE has produced a management plan to implement HIQA recommendations and implementation of this plan is subject to follow up by HIQA.  I understand that HIQA has signalled its intention to conduct an early follow up inspection of Gleann Alainn in order to ensure action has been taken on the issues in its October inspection.    I have written to Gordon Jeyes, National Director of Children and Family Services, HSE underlining my concern in relation to the HIQA findings and  asking him for details of the actions being taken  to ensure the standard of care in Gleann Alainn is improved to a safe and acceptable level in line with HIQA's recommendations.

Work on the wording of the referendum is ongoing, focusing on ensuring that the proposed Referendum reflects the deliberations and conclusions of the Joint Committee and the commitment in the Programme for Government.   It is my intention to seek approval from Government for the proposed wording once finalised, with a view to holding the referendum next year. I anticipate that a wording will be developed shortly. I am anxious to ensure that any wording which emerges will have the support it needs across parties and with the public. The timing of the referendum will have regard to the need to allow an appropriate period of time for the proposal to be fully communicated to the public. Not withstanding that I am committed to advancing the referendum at as early a date in 2012 as possible.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	540	I propose to take Questions Nos. 23 and 44 together.My Department is represented on the Special Action Group on Obesity established by the Minister for Health.  Evidence from the Growing Up in Ireland Study and other research shows that obesity among children is a major issue of policy.  Finding solutions will require an integrated approach across Government and my Department will contribute to that effort.The direct actions I have taken in 2011 to tackle the issue of childhood obesity involved refocusing areas under my direct responsibility such as national play and recreation polices, to assist and encourage local authorities in playing their part in getting children, young people and adults alike to lead more active lives. I am the process of setting up the first formal network of play and recreation officers from local authorities. This will help to ensure that we have a more coordinated approach to both the provision of services at local level and the improved promotion of the concept of physical exercise and non sedentary activities for children and young people, at national level. I believe that the local authority network can contribute significantly to the already well established national play day and national recreation week initiatives increasing participation even further and ensuring that the enormous potential for such events is maximised. I am greatly encouraged by the growth in popularity of such events in recent years as evidence that local communities themselves are becoming more aware of the importance of play and recreation and physical activity generally in the lives of children and young people.Growing Up in Ireland, the National Longitudinal Study, which is funded by my Department has also been enormously helpful in identifying the rates of childhood obesity and data emerging from Growing Up in Ireland, particularly the recently published report ‘Overweight and Obesity among 9-Year-Old Children in Ireland'   signals where we need to continue focussing our efforts.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector. The latest data available is in respect of October 2011. This shows that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies at that time was 2,416 whole time equivalents (WTEs). The equivalent figure at the end of 2010 was 2,432 WTEs.The employment census also provides a breakdown of staffing levels by care group. In the case of social workers employed in the Children and Families area. The figures indicate that there were 1,183 WTEs employed at the end of 2010 and 1,207 WTEs at the end of October 2011. This shows an increase of 24 WTEs  since the end of 2010. It should be noted that the classification by care group is viewed by the HSE and the Department as provisional and is subject to ongoing revision/refinement as part of the process of disaggregating the children and families resource base from the HSE prior to the establishment of the new Children and Family Support Agency.The number of social workers employed at any one time will vary due to a variety of factors. The policy goal, in line with the Implementation Plan, published in 2009 in response to the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan Report), is to achieve an overall increase of 270 social workers.   In this context, it should be noted that the HSE has made provision for the recruitment of an additional 62 social workers this year, to build on the recruitment of over 200 additional social workers in 2010. The recruitment process is being managed by the HSE National Recruitment Service (NRS).  The latest available information from the HSE indicates that 53 of these posts have been either filled or accepted, while a further 5 posts are being offered to candidates this week. The remaining  4 posts are due to be filled by individuals returning from career break. The HSE is attaching a high priority to the completion of the recruitment process by the end of the year. My Department will continue to closely monitor the position with regard to the recruitment of the additional personnel.The additional social workers will be targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to an overall assessment of workload undertaken by the National Director and his team.   The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider change agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families. This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of  a new Child and Family Support Agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and support families in need.It should also be emphasised that the grade of social worker continues to be exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and filling of vacancies. The HSE is therefore free to fill social worker vacancies as they arise and within available resources.

Seventy-nine applications for National Lottery funding, to a value of over €2.4 million, have been received by my Department since its establishment on 2nd June 2011.  I hope the Deputy will appreciate that it is not possible, therefore, to approve every application received.The closing date in 2011 for the submission of applications for National Lottery funding was 20 October last.  There was no formal application for funding assistance made by this organisation to my Department this year.  It will be open to projects, including the organisation in question, to apply for funding in 2012.  I understand that a similar level of National Lottery funding will be available to my Department in 2012.

When a child cannot live with his or her family either on a short or long-term basis be it due to illness in the family, the death of a parent, neglect, abuse or violence in the home the HSE where possible, will place a child in foster care.Fostering involves caring for someone else's child in one's own home and providing a family life for a child. The Foster Care Allowance is paid to foster carers for the benefit of the foster child. It is not an income or an income support. The allowance is paid in recognition of the obligations placed on foster carers to meet the needs set out in the child's statutory care plan and to meet the standards set out in the National Foster Care Standards. Foster Carers work closely with Social Workers and make themselves available to attend case conferences, meetings and training.

Ministers also had collective responsibility for the consideration of the overall package of measures which were considered and decided on, including measures relating to programmes administered by the Department of Social Protection, such as the One Parent Family Payment, the Back to School Clothing and Footwear Allowance and Child Benefit.  Having regard to the doctrines of collective responsibility and Cabinet confidentiality, I believe it would be inappropriate for me to make further comment on these matters.

It carries out this remit through its Children and Family Services directorate, under Mr. Gordon Jeyes, National Director. It should be emphasised that the remit of the HSE covers all organisations and individuals.The National Board for Safeguarding Children is a Church body which offers advice on best practice in safeguarding children, assists in the development of safeguarding policy, procedures and practice, and monitors such practice within the Catholic Church. I have no specific function in relation to the constitution and functions of the National Board. However, at my request the HSE over recent months has developed a closer working relationship with the National Board, and this is a very welcome development. The focus of this engagement is on ensuring that the Catholic Church is reporting all allegations of abuse to the statutory authorities in line with the Children First National Guidance, and that it has in place the necessary safeguarding structures nationally.The roll out of Children First will require all sectors and organisations working with children, including the faith sector, to put in place robust safeguarding arrangements, including internal audit of practice. I very much welcome the work undertaken to date by the National Board to strengthen child protection practices in the Catholic Church in line with this objective.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I established the Task Force on the Child and Family Support Agency in September 2011 under the chairmanship of Ms Maureen Lynott.  The Task Force will advise my Department in regard to the necessary transition programme to establish a Child and Family Support Agency, and will base its work on best practice in child welfare, family support and public administration; consistent with the Government's public sector reform agenda.  In relation to the Agency it has been asked to: —Propose a vision and the principles to guide operations;Advise on the appropriate service responsibilities, and the delivery of same;Review existing financial, staffing and corporate resources; and propose a methodology for resource allocation;Propose an organisational design and operating child welfare and protection service model;Prepare a detailed implementation plan;Identify the main priorities and core relationships required;Oversee the implementation and monitor progress, pending establishment of the Agency.The Task Force met for the eighth time earlier this week.  I look forward to receiving the report of its work, which will inform preparations for the new Agency, including the drafting of legislation.Last week, I announced that a dedicated new budget sub-head had been established for the first time in the HSE Vote, in preparation for the planned establishment of the Agency in 2013.  A provision of €568m has been made for 2012.  The equivalent provision in 2011 was €587m. The reduction of 3% is based on targets for procurement, employment control framework, pay and other efficiency savings applying more generally within the health service Estimate.  A process is currently underway in conjunction with the HSE to further review and refine the detailed components of this sub-head.  Additional provision in the order of €2.2 million has been made for 2012, within my Department’s Vote, for some initial requirements associated with the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency and related transitional arrangements.  I am firmly committed to the transformation of Ireland’s child protection and welfare services.  Central to this is delivering transparent and accountable management and budgeting.  The establishment for the first time of a dedicated budget sub-head within the HSE Vote for children and families is an important part of the ongoing ‘change agenda’, which is aimed at strengthening organisation capacity, business processes and systems, and will pave the way for the transition to the new Child and Family Support Agency in 2013.  Management of these services will be led by the National Director (Mr Gordon Jeyes) who already has a very close working relationship with me and my Department.  These developments are an integral part of preparations for the new stand alone Agency.  I am anxious to advance the full establishment of the Agency at as early a date as possible, subject to the work of the Task Force and necessary legislature provision.  I would envisage tabling legislation before the House next year to provide for the Agency’s setting up in 2013.The expenditure being committed to child and family services in 2012, through my Department and the new dedicated sub-head in the HSE Vote, demonstrates the Government's ongoing commitment to children and to improving their lives and opportunities.  While savings must be made in some areas, the approach to expenditure priorities for 2012 is underpinned by a commitment to improving outcomes for children, in particular through transforming child and family services and the reform of funding streams and delivery mechanisms across all programmes in order to make the best possible use of resources.  My Department will continue to work to deliver on its mandate to promote better outcomes for children and young people.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	549	Last week, I announced that a dedicated new budget sub-head had been established for the first time in the HSE Vote, in preparation for the planned establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency in 2013.  A provision of €568m has been made for 2012.  A process is currently underway in conjunction with the HSE to further review and refine the detailed components of this sub-head.  The provision for the first time of a dedicated budget for children and families within the HSE Vote will pave the way for the establishment of the new Agency in 2013.  This dedicated budget will be managed by the National Director of Children and Family Services and his staff in support of the process of operational improvement in child protection and welfare services which he is leading.  Central to this reform is the delivery of transparent and accountable management and budgeting.The provision of €568 million includes a 2% efficiency adjustment. In the context of public service reform and the difficulties in the national finances, all areas in receipt of public funds are required to pursue greater efficiencies and to find new ways of achieving policy objectives. The HSE is currently developing its Service Plan and this will set out the detailed level of service provision for next year, including in respect of children and families. My Department is working closely with the Department of Health in relation to the Service Plan. I expect the continued commitment by the HSE to the full implementation of Children First to be a key feature of the HSE Service Plan for next year.I launched the Children First: National Guidance for the Protection and Welfare of Children on the 15th July, 2011. The Guidance deals with the recognition, reporting and management of child safety concerns.  It sets out a number of key messages relating to the duty to protect children.  Among these are that the safety and welfare of children is everyone's responsibility, that children will have safer lives where everyone is attentive to their well-being and that people who work with children across a range of areas understand their responsibility for safe practice and the reporting of concerns.  The Guidance sets out specific protocols for HSE social workers, Gardaí and other front line staff in dealing with suspected abuse.  The scope of Children First extends beyond the reporting of suspected abuse.  It emphasises the importance of multi disciplinary, inter-agency working in the management of such concerns.  Key to this is the sharing of information between agencies and disciplines in the best interests of children and the need for full co-operation to ensure better outcomes.My Department is finalising legislative proposals to make compliance with the Children First Guidance a statutory obligation. The legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk and the objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by strengthening the existing system for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.Putting Children First on a statutory footing was a key recommendation of the Ryan Report and went hand-in-hand with other recommendations including the commitment to recruit an additional 270 social workers. These posts were exempted from the public service recruitment moratorium and will significantly strengthen the capacity of the state's child protection and family support services.It is also important to recognize that the original Children First Guidelines were in place for over a decade and as such are not new in terms of the responsibilities placed on organisations working with children.  In this regard, it should be emphasised that there are already very significant resources in place to support the implementation of Children First.  In the case of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, the two statutory agencies with particular responsibilities for the assessment and investigation of child welfare and protection concerns, Children First forms an integral part of their existing operations and practices. For example, the HSE has in place a network of personnel to provide training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First. It is currently delivering a programme of information and training on the new Guidance across the country. It recently published a Child Welfare and Protection Practice Handbook for all its staff in order to achieve consistency and Children First compliance across all its authorities.The consistent implementation of the Children First Guidance across all sectors working with children is a high priority for Government. The new revised Guidance, together with the introduction of legislation, is designed to heighten societal awareness of the importance of safeguarding children. The difference is that compliance with the Guidance will became mandatory. While this may give rise to an increase in the number of child protection referrals to the statutory authorities it will be equally important for the HSE, as part of its ongoing reform programme, to ensure that its services are re-balanced with an emphasis on primary prevention and family support for child welfare cases and interventions, including assessment of current risk, where child protection concerns are evident.  My Department is chairing an Inter Departmental Committee to oversee progress in implementing the Guidance across Government.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I propose to take Questions Nos. 34 and 40 together.The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established on 2 June 2011.  In 2011, the full year allocation for the programmes implemented by the Department, amounted to just over €417 million, of which €406.3 million was current funding.  In 2012, the full gross year allocation for the Department under Budget 2012 will be just over €408 million, of which €400.1 million relates to current funding.  This represents a 2% reduction in funding which is significantly less than reductions in some other areas of Government expenditure demonstrating the priority attached to programmes and services for children and young people.As the Deputy will be aware, the review process conducted by individual Government Departments as part of the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure was a central part of the overall pre-Budget deliberations of the Government. Officials of my Department have been engaged in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure since June of this year and have scrutinised every area of area of expenditure as part of this process. While there was no formal child impact analysis or child proofing study conducted as part of the Review within my Department it is important to point out that it provided the opportunity to critically examine all spending programmes under the operational remit of my Vote and inform the Department`s new structures and priorities, based on streamlined and effective use of limited resources.I had detailed discussions on a number of occasions with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform in relation to the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure and its impact on my Department and savings of some €16.5 million in current funding have been agreed for next year.  However, this figure reduces to €4.5 million when account is taken of the fact that additional funding has also been provided to meet demographic pressures arising under the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and to protect the universality of that programme.  The reform process will continue over 2012-2014 and the projected current funding allocations for my Department will be sustained at levels of €382 million in 2013 and €373 million in 2014.  While the need to reduce expenditure will be challenging, I am satisfied that the reform of programmes and schemes identified under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure will be implemented in a way which generates efficiencies and improvements in outcomes, within the resources available.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	553	I propose to take Questions Nos. 36 and 45 together.The Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established on 3 June 2011.  In 2011, the full year allocation for the programmes implemented by the Department, amounted to just over €417 million, of which €406.3 million was current funding.  In 2012, the full gross year allocation for the Department stands at just over €408 million, of which €400.1 million will be current funding.  This represents a 2% reduction in funding which is significantly less than reductions in some other areas of Government expenditure demonstrating the priority attached to programmes and services for children and young people.Since May of this year, my officials have been engaged in the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure process and have scrutinised every area of expenditure as part of this process.  The Review was used as an opportunity to critically examine and inform the Department's new structures and priorities, based on streamlined and effective use of limited resources.  The challenge for all of those who work in the public service today or are funded from the public purse is to maximise policy outcomes and service delivery.Under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure savings of some €16.5 million in current funding have been agreed for next year.  However, this figure reduces to €4.5 million when account is taken of the fact that additional funding has also been provided to meet demographic pressures arising under the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme and to protect the universality of that programme.  The reform process will continue over 2012-2014 and the projected current funding allocations for my Department will be sustained at levels of €382 million in 2013 and €373 million in 2014.  While the need to reduce expenditure will be challenging, I am satisfied that the reform of programmes and schemes identified under the Comprehensive Review of Expenditure will be implemented in a way which generates efficiencies and improvements in outcomes, within the resources available.As I have said, the Government has made a very significant commitment to maintaining the universality of the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.  The Programme for Government commits to maintaining the ECCE programme and indeed developing early childhood care and education as resources allow.  Given the budgetary constraints we are facing, I am very pleased to be able to say that the programme is being maintained as a universal and free pre-school year.  The universal nature of this programme is critical for childhood development and providing every child with early learning and preparation for school.  I am delighted to say that the programme has been maintained on a universal and free basis.  I believe this is an investment in our country's future prosperity.  We will recover from our economic difficulties.  In time, too, the generation of children benefiting from this programme will repay our investment by proving the long term value of investment in early education.Due to demographic pressures, which mean that the number of children eligible for the programme will increase by some 3,000, the cost of the programme is expected to rise to almost €176 million in 2012, an increase of almost €10 million, and this funding has been provided for.In terms of the main areas of savings, the key areas where savings will be made in Vote 40, are as follows:In addition to the Early Childhood Care and Education Scheme the other two main programmes of support for childcare operated by my Department are the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme and the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme.  All three programmes are being retained but some revisions are being made to certain payment rates and subvention levels under each programme.Under the Early Childhood Care and Education Programme the staff to child ratios will be increased in September 2012, from a ratio of 1: 10 to a ratio of 1: 11.  As the pre-school year is targeted at children in the year before they commence primary school, the increase is not expected to impact on quality.  The Child Care (Pre-School Services) (No.2) Regulations 2006 will be amended to accommodate the change which will apply to services for the duration of the ECCE provision only.  The increase will give the majority of pre-school services some flexibility to manage a modest reduction in the capitation rates which I am introducing from September next.  A reduction of €2 per week, approximately 3%, will be made to the capitation rates paid to providers.  The reduction in capitation rates will achieve savings of €2.2m in 2012 and €5m from 2013 onwards.  Notwithstanding these reductions the funds available under this programme in 2012 will increase by €9.8 million or 6 per cent.The Childcare Education and Training Support programme provides qualifying FAS and VEC students with free childcare places for the duration of their course.  The Department pays childcare services €170 per week for each full-time place contracted under the programme, in some 1,600 community and commercial facilities.  This is the only category of parents who currently pay no contribution to the cost of their childcare requirements.  From September 2012, the Department will reduce the weekly price paid to services to €145 per full-time place.  The services will be allowed to charge a weekly fee of not more than €25 per full-time childcare place. In practice it is expected that the charge passed on to parents will be less than the €25 reduction due to cost efficiencies and competition on fees.Under the Community Childcare Subvention Programme, parents who have a social welfare entitlement or are in receipt of Family Income Supplement, qualify for subvention rates of up to €100 per week for full daycare.  The parents must be using a community service to avail of the programme.  Payment is made to the service and allows community providers to charge reduced fees to eligible parents.   From September 2012, the higher subvention rate of €100 will be reduced by €5 to €95.  To qualify for the higher rate it will be necessary to have an entitlement to a medical card as well as a social welfare entitlement.A 5% reduction will be made in 2012 to the operational costs of the Family Support Agency and to the Family Resource Centres programme.  This will yield savings of almost €0.9 million in 2012.  In addition, savings of over €1.2 million will be made in 2012 under the Counselling Grants Scheme which is administered by the Agency.While no reduction is being made to the Education Welfare Service operated by the National Education Welfare Board (NEWB), my Department, together with the Board, will complete a major review of the School Completion Programme by mid 2012 to identify operational efficiencies and achieve greater integration with the other NEWB programmes.  A new and more rationalised programme will be introduced in September 2012 which will allow savings of €2 million to be achieved in 2012.A review of all of the Department's Youth Programmes will also be undertaken in 2012.  This will be informed by the new Youth Policy Framework and will result in a restructuring of the programmes and their delivery models into a more cohesive and effective set of programmes from 2013.  This approach will allow for savings to be achieved while still maintaining effective youth programmes and maximising outcomes.  Pending the outcome of the review, in 2012 a reduction in funding ranging between 5% and 10% will applied to a number of the programmes.  This will result in savings of some €4.6 million.A number of pilot projects and programmes which were limited in time, are due to come to an end over the period 2012-2014.  While the outcomes from these projects and programmes will, where possible, be mainstreamed into programmes implemented by my Department as well as by agencies involved in the provision of services for children and families, significant additional savings will arise.  It is also my intention to use the annual capital allocation of €8 million to continue and enhance the youth café programme, which was implemented during 2010-2011, to maintain the funding support for Parent and Toddler groups, and to establish a new, capital maintenance programme for community childcare facilities.  As alcohol free venues for young people, Youth Cafés will form an important part of the Government's Strategy to combat alcohol misuse.  The Parent and Toddler small grant scheme is a valuable resource for parents in disadvantaged areas and the maintenance programme for community childcare facilities is intended to assist services with the funding of essential repairs.In terms of my priorities over the period 2012-2015, in addition to reviewing the current delivery of programmes to improve outcomes, it is my intention to progress a number of issues as a matter of urgent priority.  In 2012, the Constitutional Referendum on Children's Rights will be held.  I am pleased to note that an allocation of €3 million has been provided in Vote 40 in 2012 to meet the costs which will arise.Work is also underway to establish the new Child and Family Services Agency which will operate from 2013 under the remit of my Department.  I hope to see this process completed during 2012 as I believe it will provide a new and coherent structure to meet the needs of children and their families.  While the resources for the new agency are currently located within the Vote of the Health Service Executive, an additional provision to assist the establishment of the agency has been made within Vote 40.  This amounts to €16.2 million in 2012 and will increase to €5 million from 2013.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	557	The free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme was introduced in January 2010 with the objective of providing a free pre-school year to all eligible children.The age range for eligibility under the programme spans 17 months with children qualifying for the free pre-school year where they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months on 1 September in the relevant year.  This means, for example, that children born between 2 February 2007 and 30 June 2008 were eligible for the free pre-school year in September 2011 and children born in July and August 2008 will be eligible in September 2012 .The objective of the ECCE programme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to eligible children in the year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the pre-school year are expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  For this reason, it is appropriate to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will qualify.A number of parents have asked for the lower age range to be reduced on the grounds that they wish to send their children to school when they are 4 years and 2 months of age or less.  The issue was referred by some of these parents to the Office of the Ombudsman for Children.  That Office found no reason to remove or amend the lower age range, accepting it as reasonable having regard to the various factors which apply.

In a recent debate on this issue in Seanad Éireann, on 12th October last, I gave a commitment to work with relevant Departments and agencies to establish this Hotline in Ireland in 2012. I also announced my intention to establish a cross-sectoral Project Team to include representatives of my own Department, the Department of Justice and Equality, ComReg and an Garda Síochána. The final nominee to the project team has been received and the team is now in a position to commence its work and a date has been established for its first meeting. While I do not envisage a lengthy process is required I am not in a position to give an exact date at this time. I have asked the project team to work as quickly as possible in advancing this matter.In June 2011, Comreg, who have responsibility for allocation of this number in Ireland, sought expressions of interest to run the Hotline and no substantive responses were received. However; I am aware of and have met with Irish NGOs who may be interested, but their estimated costings vary significantly. The Project Team will examine how best to operate the Hotline, in the context of  the demand for the service, and to establish the extent to which services, including Garda and victim support services, which are already in existence and receiving Government funding, can be mobilised to meet Ireland's commitments in relation to the Hotline.I want to emphasise that the investigation of a child's disappearance is the responsibility of the Gardaí.  Their structures in this regard include not only the local Gardaí, who will have primary responsibility for the investigation, but also the Missing Persons Bureau.  It is of paramount importance that any arrangements which are put in place to establish the 116000 Hotline in Ireland do not compromise the requirement that the first and most important contact to be made, is to notify the Gardaí of the fact that a child is missing, so the investigation can commence without delay. However the implementation of a dedicated missing children hotline is intended to provide a further level of support in such situations.

The matter has been under continuous review by my own Department and previously by the then Department of Health and Children over recent years. As part of the review the situation pertaining in other jurisdictions has been examined.In terms of reports received, I am aware of the views expressed by the Ombudsman for Children who has indicated her strong support for the introduction of an outright ban and similar views expressed by the Council of Europe Commissioner for Human Rights in his various considerations of human rights in the Irish context. No other specific reports on this matter have been received although the Law Reform Commission did examine this matter in 1994 as part its report ‘Non Fatal Offences Against the Person'.A number of options are now under consideration. These include examining whether the current so called ‘defence of reasonable chastisement' needs to be further defined in law as well as consideration of the option for the introduction of an outright prohibition in the home setting.I am currently examining these options and will make a decision in the matter in due course. At the present time it is not intended to bring forward any immediate specific proposals in relation to this matter as the possible constitutional implications for any such proposals will need to be carefully considered given the special protection afforded to the family under the constitution.  I am encouraged that recent research in this area indicates that the practice of corporal punishment itself is declining in Ireland with 88 per cent of parents opting for other non violent means of correction and in due course the timing may be right to bring forward new proposals.

It is intended to transfer these responsibilities by a Transfer of Functions Order with effect from 1 January 2012. While I have had many meetings with my colleague in Government, Minister Shatter, and with his officials in the context of the intended transfer of functions, I have not met with the Department of Justice and Equality specifically on the issue raised by the Deputy. Responsibility for St. Patrick's Institution will remain with Minister Shatter. I have recently visited St. Patrick's Institution and I am aware that it is suggested that the remit of the Ombudsman for Children should be extended to take complaints from children resident in St Patrick's Institution. I will be considering this issue in consultation with Minister Shatter in 2012.

It found that it is very difficult to identify young carers in the population.In order to learn more about children that undertake caring roles, my Department requested the Central Statistics Office to include a question in the Census of Population 2011.  People of all ages were asked whether they provide any unpaid personal help for a friend or family member with a long term-term illness, health problem or disability. These census results are due for publication in November 2012.It is further planned, under the National Strategy for Research and Data on Children's Lives published by my Department last month, that a detailed analysis of those children who report in the 2011 Census that they undertake caring roles, will be carried out by the end of 2013.  It is anticipated that the analysis will inform future policy as to how best to address the support needs of children and young people who undertake caring roles.The Government is committed to developing a National Carer's Strategy to support carers and to address issues of concern. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will work closely with the Department Health in the development of the new strategy to ensure that the needs of young carers are comprehensively addressed as part of an integrated approach to policy and supports for carers.

To date thirty nine (39) States have signed.  Nine of the twenty seven European Union member states have signed.  Five States have ratified the Optional Protocol:  Argentina, Ecuador, El Salvador, Mongolia and Spain.  The Optional Protocol will come into force three months after the deposit with the United Nations Secretary General of the tenth instrument of ratification or accession.  As only five States have ratified the Optional Protocol so far it has not yet come into force.  My Department has led consultations between Departments on possible signature of the Optional Protocol.  A formal proposal asking Departments for their views as to possible signature of the Optional Protocol was circulated earlier this month.  Once this consultation process is completed the question of the possible signature of the Optional Protocol will then be examined.  Ratification of the Optional Protocol would be a separate step and would be considered in due course.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	568	Sections 472A and 88A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 provide tax incentives for both employers and employees, to help the long-term unemployed to return to employment.  The relief under Section 472A, known as the Revenue Job Assist scheme, allows qualifying employees, in addition to their normal tax credits, to claim certain income deductions, including additional deductions for qualifying children, for the three year period after taking up employment.For the first year, the additional deduction equates to €3,810 plus €1,270 for each qualifying child.  For the second and third years, the deduction is €2,540 and €1,270 respectively with qualifying child additions of €850 and €425 respectively.  The relief for an employee, at the option of the employee, will be allowed in the three year period commencing with either the tax year in which the employment commences or the following tax year.  Furthermore, an employee may change jobs once within that three year period and retain the relief.  Section 88A provides an associated tax incentive for employers.  Employers may claim a double deduction in computing the profits of the trade or profession in respect of the first 3 years' wages paid to qualifying employees.  This double deduction may also be claimed in respect of the employers' PRSI contribution on such wages.Both incentives apply in respect of individuals who have been unemployed for at least 12 months and are in receipt of a specified social protection payment or, who are in a category approved for the purposes of the scheme by the Minister for Social Protection with the consent of the Minister for Finance.  Although the relief available under the scheme was unchanged in Budget 2012, I intend to bring forward an amendment in Finance Bill 2012 so that individuals signing on solely for credits with the Department of Social Protection can also qualify for the relief.  This change is being operated on an administrative basis by the Revenue Commissioners currently.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	569	The maximum amount that can be raised by a company in a 12 month period under the Business Expansion Scheme (BES) is €1.5m.  The lifetime amount that can be raised by a company under BES is €2m.  Relief at the individual's marginal rate of tax can be claimed by a qualifying individual who invests in eligible shares.  These amounts were not changed in Budget 2012.  However, no relief will be granted under the BES where eligible shares are issued after 31 December 2011.  Section 33 of Finance Act 2011 replaced the BES with a new scheme entitled the Employment and Investment Incentive (EII).  However, the measures provided for in Finance Act 2011 could not be given effect until the European Commission gave approval under the Community Guidelines on State Aid to Promote Risk Capital Investments in Small and Medium-Sized Enterprises.  In November 2011 that approval was granted, subject to minor changes to the qualifying conditions.  This scheme was commenced as and from 25 November 2011 and I provided for this on Budget night by way of a Financial Resolution.Under both the BES and EII an individual can invest up to a maximum of €150,000 per annum.  However, these investments are subject to the high earners' restriction which permits a maximum of €80,000 in specified reliefs that can be fully relieved in any one tax year.  Any amount that cannot be relieved as a result of the restriction can be rolled-over and relieved in subsequent years.  The maximum amount that can be raised by a company in a 12 month period under the EII is €2.5m and the lifetime amount that can be raised by a company is €10 million. Both these amounts represent significant increases on the limits that applied under the BES.Relief under the EII can be claimed by a qualifying individual, who invests in eligible shares, at an initial rate of 30%.  This represents a decrease from 41% under BES.  However, the period for which the individual is required to hold the eligible shares has been reduced to 3 years as opposed to 5 years under the BES.  A further 11% of tax relief will be available to the individual under the EII, where it can be demonstrated that employment levels in the company have increased at the end of the 3 year holding period or where evidence is provided that the company used the capital raised for expenditure on research and development.  This additional 11% will not be subject to the high earners' restriction.Some of the conditions necessary to qualify for the BES have been altered in order to make the EII available to a wider range of companies.  The BES was available only to companies carrying on certain trades, principally manufacturing.  The EII is available to the majority of trading companies with only a limited number of exceptions.  In view of the extended time frame involved in securing the approval of the European Commission, I decided to allow both the BES and EII schemes to run concurrently between 25 November 2011 and 31 December 2011.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I propose to take Questions Nos. 61, 67 and 72 together.As I indicated in my reply to questions nos. 82 and 83 of 14 December 2011 (refs 40290/11 and 40334/11) — on the same subject, I am advised by the institutions involved that the payments in question are considered bonus payments as per their description in the relevant contracts.  On this basis, as the conditions governing the provision of State assistance to Allied Irish Banks (AIB) prohibit the payment or awarding of bonuses whatsoever, the bank took the view that it is not in a position to make such payments to employees of EBS (which since 1 July 2011 is a wholly owned subsidiary of AIB).  The Government's prohibition on the payment of bonuses is a consequence of the level of State capital that has been provided to the banking sector.  This capital investment by the State has protected jobs throughout the financial sector.Much has been made of the fact that these payments have been paid for a number of years previously including especially from 2008 onwards.  When the State invested moneys in EBS in May 2010 by means of a subscription for a Special Investment Share remuneration restrictions only applied to senior management.  As conditions deteriorated and further capital was injected into AIB in December 2010 these restrictions were broadened to prohibit the payment of bonuses to all staff and became the template that would apply to all of the institutions as further investment was made.  Had EBS been maintained as a separate institution following the PCAR exercise of March 2011 any further injection of capital would have been covered by the expanded restrictions.  The Government decided, as part of the restructuring of the banking sector, that EBS would merge into AIB and as a result the wider restrictions on the payment of bonuses came into effect.  I am informed by AIB that no such payments have been made to EBS management since 1992 and no bonuses of any kind have been paid to this cadre of employee since 2008 in line with the conditions outlined above.

Sections 101(1) and 102(1)(d) Finance Act 1999 refer:Section 101(1), There shall be charged, levied and paid on a licence granted by the Commissioners to be taken out annually by every person who produces, sells, delivers or deals in on any premises any mineral oil, other than additives, for use as a propellant which is chargeable with mineral oil tax, a duty of excise, in this Chapter referred to as the licence duty, in respect of each such premises.Section 102(1)(d), It shall be an offence under this subsection for a person to produce or sell on, or to deliver from, any premises, or otherwise deal in, any mineral oil, other than additives, for use as a propellant which is chargeable with mineral oil tax unless such person holds a licence granted under section 101 in respect of such mineral oil and in respect of such premises.Therefore, if a person is licensed to sell mineral oil at a premises, then leases the premises to a tenant, the tenant must obtain a new licence before he/she can sell mineral oil.  A licence is a permission to the holder of the same to sell mineral oil, it is not a permission for any other person to sell the oil.

However, that legislation, on review, was found to have flaws and would have required amendment before it could be implemented.As part of the announcement in the Jobs Initiative, the Government undertook to provide further funding for the grants available under the Better Energy Homes scheme operated by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI).  Because of these circumstances, I decided to review the requirement for a coexisting tax incentive for similar works and, following this review, I decided not to proceed with the introduction of the tax relief scheme.  It is worth pointing out that it was never envisaged that individuals could qualify for both the grants and the proposed tax relief.  Refocusing the funding such that it is provided via the grants scheme clarifies Government support measures for energy efficiency works.

While the real GDP growth forecast for 2012 was marginally revised downwards in Budget 2012 relative to the MTFS, to 1.3 per cent from 1.6 per cent, the GDP deflator was revised up (on foot of the increase in VAT and a minor improvement in the terms-of-trade).  As a result, the nominal level of GDP in 2012 is broadly unchanged.  The real GDP growth forecasts for each of the years 2013-2015 in Budget 2012 are unchanged from the MTFS.The levels of consolidation for each of the years 2012-2015 as outlined in the MTFS are still viewed as being sufficient to adhere to the General Government deficit targets for those years as set by the ECOFIN Council in December 2010.  Given the difficulties in forecasting in the current uncertain environment, these estimates will continue to be assessed over the coming months and years in light of more up-to-date information that becomes available.

This group has now terminatedMortgage Arrears Steering GroupThis group was established in December 2011 to, inter alia, progress the recommendations set out in the report of the Mortgage Arrears Steering Group as approved by Government.Fiscal Advisory Council:As Minister for Finance I  announced the establishment of the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council on 7 July 2011.  The Council is part of a wider agenda of reform of Ireland’s budgetary architecture which is envisaged in the Programme for Government. When I announced the establishment of the Council, it was stated that the Council would be an independent body whose existence and independence would be underpinned by legislation to be brought forward by Government in the Fiscal Responsibility Bill by the end of March 2012. The role of the Council is to provide an assessment of, and comment publicly on, whether the Government is meeting its own stated budgetary targets and objectives. It will also be charged with assessing the appropriateness and soundness of the Government’s fiscal stance and macroeconomic projections as well as an assessment of the extent of compliance with the Government’s fiscal rules. The latter are also to be brought forward in the proposed Fiscal Responsibility Bill.NewERAThe establishment of NewERA and the Strategic Investment Fund under the National Treasury Management Agency (NTMA) was announced on Thursday, 29 September 2011. NewERA has been established on a non-statutory basis as a Shareholder Executive within the NTMA.  NewERA will bring forward proposals by mid-2012 for consideration by Government on options for moving towards a full holding company status which could own the shares in commercial semi-states. The policy objective behind NewERA is to modernise the manner in which Government manages its shareholding in the semi-state companies and will oversee the corporate governance of commercial semi-states from a shareholder perspective. The Strategic Investment Fund, which will be the forerunner of the Strategic Investment Bank, will, following appropriate legislative changes to the investment policy of the National Pensions Reserve Fund (NPRF), channel commercial investment from the NPRF towards productive investment in the Irish economy.The Commission  on Credit  UnionsThe Commission on Credit Unions was established by the Government on 31 May 2011. Its purpose is to review the future of the credit union movement and make recommendations in relation to the most effective regulatory structure for credit unions, taking into account their not-for-profit mandate, their volunteer ethos and community focus, while paying due regard to the need to fully protect depositors savings and financial stability.The Financial Inclusion  Strategy Implementation Working GroupThe Financial Inclusion Strategy Implementation Working Group was set up on 8 December 2011 on foot of a Ministerial decision.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	581	The details supplied appear to relate to the restriction on the deductibility of interest in computing taxable rental income from residential property: in the case of interest accruing on or after 7 April 2009 (insofar as it would otherwise be allowable) the deduction available to the landlord is limited to 75% of such interest.  The thrust of the matter raised in the question is that this restriction can result in a charge to tax and the income levy of rental profits in excess of the actual profits from the letting of such property.  This position appears to be based on an assumption that in the case of income from investment assets (expected to produce income and capital gains) the taxable amount should inherently be computed after allowing a full deduction for the funding costs of the asset acquisition.  However, there is no such general principle in the tax code and there are many examples of situations where interest deductibility is not allowed in the context of investment assets, for example, the funding costs of quoted shares are not generally deductible against dividend income from those shares.The interest restriction on residential landlords was introduced in the April 2009 supplementary budget as part of an urgent revenue-raising package aimed at stabilising the public finances.  The reduction in the level at which interest could be claimed for residential rental properties significantly reduced the cost of this relief to the Exchequer.  Increasing the relief to 100% could result in a cost to the Exchequer of the order of €100 million per annum.  In a context where tax expenditures are being significantly cut back in many areas to broaden the tax base, a 25% restriction on allowable interest available to residential landlords does not seem an unreasonable measure.

My hope is that a full return to the bond markets will become possible by mid-2013.  The steps necessary to position the NTMA for such a return include continued progress in the reduction of the budget deficit in line with the targets agreed in the EU/IMF Programme of Financial Support, together with the implementation of policies that will see us return to sustainable economic growth.  Of course, resolution of the wider euro area sovereign debt and banking crisis is also a critical factor.  The NTMA is in ongoing contact with market participants and will advise me when it feels that the time is right to re-enter the markets.I should say that, based on conservative projections of our funding needs, there is no urgency about a return to the markets.  Indeed, the purpose of a programme such as the EU/IMF Programme for Ireland is to provide the space necessary for economic and fiscal adjustment to take place.  Based on current projections and assuming no market access, the State has access to sufficient funds for its needs well into the second half of 2013.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	585	As the Deputy is aware the provision of State funds to the financial institutions is to ensure that those institutions have sufficient capital to meet regulatory requirements.  The capital injections were, for the greater part, required to cover losses, or loss provisions, on the loan books of those institutions.  The capital has been provided by the Exchequer or the National Pension Reserve Fund (NPRF) by way of Promissory Notes or cash in respect of preference shares, ordinary or contingent capital instruments.  The bank recapitalisation commitments made by the State to date are set out in the table.  Please note that these figures only represent the capital committed to recapitalising these institutions and they do not take account of revenues received directly or indirectly from the banks.  It should also be noted that the total cost of the recapitalisations would have been significantly higher were it not for the burden sharing achieved with holders of subordinated debt in each of the institutions.No State capital was provided to any financial institution without a detailed examination of the capital requirement.  External consultants were engaged to assess loan losses and capital requirements on an institution by institution basis.  The Department, the Central Bank/Financial Regulator and/or the NTMA then advised the Minister in this regard.There are extensive terms and conditions applying to banks in receipt of State Aid.  These conditions arise in the first instance from the requirements of the CIFS Act.  Under this Act and the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities Guarantee) Scheme the State provided a guarantee of deposits and debt of the covered institutions.  Further terms and conditions apply, on a case by case basis, in relation to the provision of capital by the State.  The conditions, in this regard are set out in Subscription and Placement Agreements and the relationship between the State and IBRC is prescribed in legislation and in a Relationship Framework.  This latter document, drawn up by the Minister, sets out the respective roles and responsibilities of the parties.  Relationship Frameworks are currently being reviewed in the case of IBRC and developed for the other covered institutions.  Furthermore, the provision of State Aid, is in every instance, subject to EU Commission approval under State Aid and Competition Authority Rules.  In this context the institutions that need State Aid are required to submit a restructuring plan to the Commission indicating in specific terms how the institution proposes to address its problems and the timeframe within which this is to be achieved.  As part of the approval process the Commission will detail terms and conditions in relation to the proposed restructuring including restrictions to ensure compliance with Competition Rules.  Finally, the overall national strategy to stabilise and restructure the financial services sector is an integral part of the Programme of Financial Support with our international partners.  There are specific time based targets associated with this strategy. Progress on these targets is reported on a regular basis.A number of bodies including the Department of Finance, the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and the EU Commission are directly involved in monitoring the performance and compliance of the various institutions on an on-going basis.€bnAIB/EBSBOIIL&PIBRCTotalGovernment preference Shares (2009) — NPRF3.53.5*——7.0Capital contributions (with Promissory Notes as consideration) /Special Investment Shares (2010) — Exchequer **0.9——30.731.6Ordinary Share Capital (2009) — Exchequer———4.04.0Ordinary Share Capital (2010) — NPRF3.7———3.7Total pre-PCAR 2011 (A)8.13.5034.746.3PCAR 2011:AIB/EBSBoIIL&PAnglo/INBSTotalCapital from Exchequer***3.9—2.7—6.5NPRF Capital8.81.2——10.0Total PCAR (B)12.71.22.7—16.5Total Cost of Recap for State (A) + (B)20.74.72.734.762.8* €1.7bn of BoI's government preference shares were converted to equity in May/June 2010 (€1.8bn still left in existence).

The Deputy will be aware that the previous Government announced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme ("CIFS") on 30 September, 2008, in order to maintain financial stability for the benefit of depositors and businesses in general, and for the Irish economy as a whole.  This action was taken following advice from the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator about the impact of the international market turmoil on the Irish banking system.The CIFS expired on 29 September, 2010, and was effectively superseded by the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities) Guarantee Scheme ("ELG Scheme") which came into effect on 9 December, 2009.  The main differences between the CIFS and the ELG Scheme are:the duration of  the guarantee for fixed-term deposits extended from the 2 year limitation under the CIFS to 5 years under ELG Scheme;the exclusion of dated subordinated debt and asset covered securities from the ELG Scheme.Following the recent approval by both Houses of the Oireachtas the terms of the ELG Scheme have been extended in law to 31 December, 2012, subject to EU Commission approval every 6 months.  On Thursday last, EU state aid approval was given to the prolongation of the issuance period for eligible liabilities to 30 June, 2012.  The prolongation of the ELG Scheme is seen by the State authorities as necessary for financial stability reasons given the continuing market dislocation for Sovereigns and banks.Further information on both Schemes, including the liabilities covered, can be obtained on the Department of Finance website  (http://www.finance.gov.ie)
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	587	The previous Government announced the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Scheme ("CIFS") on 30 September, 2008, in order to maintain financial stability for the benefit of depositors and businesses in general, and for the Irish economy as a whole.  This action was taken following advice from the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator about the impact of the international market turmoil on the Irish banking system. Similar State interventions across Europe and the world were introduced around that time.  The Deputy will be aware that the CIFS expired on 29 September, 2010, and was effectively superseded by the Credit Institutions (Eligible Liabilities) Guarantee Scheme ("ELG Scheme") which came into effect on 9 December, 2009.  The reason the Government continues to provide financial support in the form of the ELG Scheme to those banks of systemic importance to the Irish financial system is that, having consulted with the Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland, it considers that circumstances set out in section 2(1) of the Credit Institutions (Financial Support) Act, 2008, exist and are likely to exist until 30 June, 2011, the financial support end date recently approved by EU state aid.A fundamental element of Government Strategy has been to restore a functioning banking system.  However, it is important to point out that the Government has made other important interventions in the wider economy.  For example, as part of Bank of Ireland and AIB's capital raising requirements, the pillar banks have both agreed to meet an SME lending target of €3 billion each in the 12 month period for 2011, €3.5 billion each for 2012, and €4 billion each for 2013.  The banks produce an annual SME lending plan for each of these 12 month periods to demonstrate the manner in which they intend to meet the targets.In addition, the Programme for Government contains a commitment to help homeowners who are facing difficulty with their mortgage repayments and the Government will examine a number of proposals in relation to this commitment.  In this context, the Economic Management Council asked that further work be carried out to address the situation of over-indebted mortgage holders with a view to identifying a range of responses appropriate to individual circumstances.  To facilitate this commitment, a Mortgage Group has carried out this work and reported to Government.These interventions and the radical restructuring of the banking system are designed to put our banking system and economy on a firm footing which is essential to Ireland's economic recovery.

It is managed and controlled by the Central Bank Commission.    The Minister for Finance is the sole subscriber to and holder of the Central Bank's capital. The Central Bank's surplus income is payable to the Exchequer in accordance with regulations made in accordance with section 32H of the Central Bank Act 1942.The members of the Central Bank Commission are the Governor, appointed by the Government, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, appointed by the Government, the Deputy Governors, appointed by the Central Bank Commission and between 6 and 8 ordinary members appointed by the Minister for Finance. These are currently: Prof. Patrick Honohan, Mr. Kevin Cardiff, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, Mr. Stefan Gerlach, Mr. Max Watson, Mr. Michael Soden, Mr. Alan Ahearne, Ms. Blanaid Clarke, Prof. John Fitzgerald and Mr. Des Geraghty.The Central Bank is independent in the exercise of its functions but the Governor and the Deputy Governors may be required to appear before committees of the Houses of the Oireachtas to address certain matters, including the Bank's annual regulatory performance statement.

To the extent that such information sought by the Deputy has already been publicly released, it is available in the published annual reports and/or at the web sites of the respective covered institutions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	590	The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible for financial regulation in Ireland. The Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority (the Financial Regulator) ceased to exist on 1 October 2010 with the commencement of the relevant provisions of the Central Bank Reform Act 2010, which created a single structure within the Central Bank controlled and managed by the Central Bank Commission. The powers and functions of the Financial Regulator were subsumed into the Central Bank of Ireland.   Under sections 19 and 23 of the Central Bank Act 1942, the terms and conditions of employment of the Central Bank Governor and the Deputy Governor (fulfilling the role largely filled by the former office of Financial Regulator) are matters for the Central Bank Commission.  Therefore, I am not privy to the contractual arrangements that apply.  However, I am informed by the Central Bank that both positions are subject to the Ethics in Public Office Act and the Central Bank's Code of Ethics and Behaviour.  It would not be appropriate for me to comment on the contractual position of individuals who have held these posts previously.Finally, regarding reckless trading and personal liability, the obligations of managers of regulated financial service providers imposed by Irish financial service legislation are in addition to any obligations imposed on them by other law, including. As regards the Companies Acts, financial institutions are in the same position as all other companies.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	591	I propose to take Questions Nos. 82 and 84 together.The Central Bank Acts — and in particular the Central Bank Act 1971 — set out the principal legal definitions related to banking in Ireland, including provisions relating to ‘banking business' and persons deemed to hold themselves out as bankers.The Central Bank is the statutory body with responsibility for licensing banks and attaching conditions to those licences.  Copies of banking licences are not available to the public.  However, section 12 of the Central Bank Act 1971 provides that the Central Bank must publish a list a persons holding banking licences at least once a year; that information is published on the Central Bank's website.With regard to foreign banks the supervisory responsibilities of financial regulators in relation to credit institutions operating in more than one EU member state have been set out by the EU in a number of Directives and cover both home and host state regulators.  A credit institution authorised in Ireland must notify the Central Bank if it wishes to operate under a passporting arrangement in another EU Member State.  Credit institutions authorised in another EU Member State must notify their home state regulator if they wish to operate under a passporting arrangement in Ireland.The Central Bank is responsible for monitoring compliance with the terms of banking licences and therefore matters arising from any breach of a banking licence fall under its responsibility.   On the question of transparency, the Central Bank is subject to a duty of banking secrecy in accordance with the Supervisory Directives and section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942 when carrying out its regulatory functions.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	592	The amount of Euro banknotes on the balance sheet of the Central Bank of Ireland represents Ireland's share of total Euro banknotes in circulation. Ireland is currently allocated 1.46 per cent of the total euro banknotes in circulation based on its fully paid up share of the capital of the European Central Bank (ECB). These banknotes are backed by assets which relate to Eurosystem monetary policy operations, and primarily comprise loans provided to credit institutions and securities (Government bonds) purchased in connection with monetary policy operations. The income earned on assets backing the Euro banknotes in circulation is pooled by all Eurosytem National Central Banks and distributed back to these Banks in accordance with their respective share of the ECB's capital.   With regard to legal requirements in place that loans advanced by banks should be supported by assets or deposits held by those banks, I refer the Deputy to my reply to Question No. 85 on today's Order Paper.Euro banknotes have legal tender status within the Member States whose currency is the euro. The issue of euro banknotes is not subject to quantitative or other limits.   Banknotes are printed in accordance with a pooled production system within the European System of Central Banks.  Under this system, the ECB coordinates the annual banknote requirements of the eurosystem with the National Central Banks  and allocates banknote production.The Central Bank of Ireland is typically allocated one denomination per year. Under this pooled production arrangement, the Central Bank of Ireland printed 127.5 million €10 banknotes in 2010.There are 13 printing works fully accredited by the ECB to print euro banknotes.  In Ireland our production allocation of euro banknotes is printed by the Central Bank of Ireland.  All accredited printing works must report progress on the production plan to the ECB on a regular basis.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	593	As Minister for Finance, I have no function in relation to Euro area monetary policy operations. The Governor of the Central Bank carries out his European Central Bank-related functions under the Treaty of Rome and the Statute of the European System of Central Banks (ESCB) and his independence in doing so is guaranteed. Section 19A(2) of the Central Bank Act 1942 provides that the Governor has sole responsibility for the performance of the functions imposed, and the exercise of powers conferred, on the Bank by or under the Rome Treaty or the ESCB Statute.   I am advised by the Central Bank that, as part of its approach to monetary policy implementation, the ECB requires credit institutions in the euro area to hold compulsory deposits on accounts with the national Central Banks: these are called "minimum" or "required" reserves. For Irish banks, the reserves must be held at the Central Bank of Ireland. The amount of required reserves to be held by each institution is determined by its reserve base. The reserve base of an institution is defined in relation to prescribed elements of its balance sheet.In order to determine an institution's reserve requirement, the reserve base is multiplied by a reserve ratio. The ECB applies a uniform positive reserve ratio to most of the items included in the reserve base. This reserve ratio was set at 2% at the start of the monetary union.The compliance with reserve requirements is determined on the basis of the average of the daily balances on the institutions' reserve accounts over the maintenance period of around one month.The ECB announced on 8 December that it will reduce the reserve ratio for Euro area banks to 1% as of the reserve maintenance period starting on 18 January 2012. This is part of the ECB's measures to support bank lending.Bank solvency is a regulatory as distinct from a monetary policy matter and solvency requirements are set out in the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD) which implements the Basel II capital framework in the European Union.  By requiring banks to hold minimum levels of capital to absorb unexpected losses that a bank may face, capital requirements provide for continuing bank solvency so that they can continue to provide credit and other functions into the economy. The CRD was adopted in 2006, superseding previous directives in this area, and came fully into effect from 1 January 2008.The Central Bank of Ireland is responsible, in accordance with the legislation transposing the CRD into Irish law, for the regulation and supervision of the capital, or solvency, requirements of banks in Ireland. Irish banks are required to calculate capital requirements and maintain a minimum level of own funds in accordance with the CRD as a cushion against credit and other risks and to absorb unexpected losses that a bank may face.    In addition to capital requirements imposed under the CRD, I am advised that the Central Bank, as part of its prudential oversight of banks in Ireland, imposes qualitative and quantitative requirements on banks in relation to the management of liquidity risk. These requirements are imposed by the Central Bank pursuant to its powers under the Central Bank Act 1971 and the European Communities (Licensing and Supervision of Credit Institutions) Regulations, 1992, (S.I. 395 of 1992). The latest iteration of these requirements is set out in Requirements for the management of liquidity risk, published by the Central Bank in June 2009 and available to download from its website.Arising from the recent financial crisis, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision adopted amendments to the Basel capital framework in December 2010 to significantly increase the quality and quantity of capital held within the banking system relative to banks' risk-weighted assets and to impose standard liquidity requirements. These changes, known as Basel III, will require amendments to the Capital Requirements Directive which will be implemented in due course in the EU.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	594	In October the European Commission published its proposal for a Financial Transactions Tax, or FTT, and its assessment of the impact of the measure.   We are analysing the proposals in the draft Directive.  The proposal will now be subject to detailed discussions at Council Working Party level and, as always, we will participate constructively in those discussions.There is no consensus as yet among European Member States on this issue, either about whether an FTT should be introduced, or what precise form it should take.It is important that any proposal does not have the effect of encouraging relocation of activity or damaging the EU's competitiveness in financial services.  It is for this reason that there is an emerging view that the EU and other international groupings, such as the IMF and G20, should move in tandem in a global manner to avoid the danger of financial sector business gravitating to jurisdictions where taxes are not levied on financial transactions. Indeed the Commission has indicted that they see their proposal as part of a wider development in this area.I have said previously that any FTT would be best applied on a wide international basis to include the major financial centres.  I also think it important that the proposed Directive would apply on an EU wide basis to prevent any distortion of activity within the European Union.  As I stated in response to the Deputy on 5 October last, if the UK decides not to impose an FTT, there would be a great risk of displacement of business from our financial services sector.The matter will be discussed again next year at an ECOFIN meeting once the Council Working Party has discussed the proposal.

With the change in the corporation tax rate from 10% to the standard rate now applying to IFSC activities it is generally speaking no longer possible to distinguish between corporation tax paid solely on IFSC activities and on other income.  An exception is made in the case of the main associated banks where an estimate of the tax paid by them on their IFSC activities is derived from indicative data available. This estimate is incorporated in the €630 million figure provided above.Other tax remitted by the IFSC, such as PAYE, DIRT on deposit interest, and stamp duties on credit cards, ATM cards and cheques, are not included in the figures given, since the tax liability is not on the institutions themselves.

The Deputy will be aware that from the tax year 2010 onwards, the high earner's restriction for individuals on high incomes, who make significant use of certain specified tax reliefs, has been further tightened such that an effective tax rate of approximately 30% now applies.These reliefs do not include health expenses and standard tax credits, which are available to all taxpayers.

If the Primary Medical Certificate is refused, the person may appeal the refusal to the Disabled Drivers Medical Board of Appeal, National Rehabilitation Hospital, Rochestown Avenue, Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin.I understand the person appealed the decision of the Senior Medical Officer not to grant a Primary Medical Certificate and the appeal was subsequently refused by the Medical Board of Appeal. If the person wishes to apply again for a Primary Medical Certificate, the application to the Senior Medical Officer must be accompanied by a medical certificate from a registered medical practitioner indicating that the practitioner has formed the opinion that the medical condition of the person concerned has materially disimproved since the previous application.I would point out that the Medical Board of Appeal is independent in the exercise of its functions.

This examination is normally included in one of the Appendices of the Budget Book.   However, as no significant changes were made to Income Tax in Budget 2010 or in Budget 2012, consequently no such examinations were undertaken in those years.I am aware that the Department of Social Protection undertook an analysis of the distributive and poverty impact of the welfare measures on individuals and families in advance of Budget 2012. It is my understanding that this analysis will be published shortly.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	599	On 14 November 2011, the European Council approved co-financing of €35.7m under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) in respect of three applications for assistance for almost 9,000 former workers made redundant in the construction NACE 41, 43 and 71 sub-sectors between 1 July 2009 and 31 March 2010. Redundant workers were identified based on evidence of statutory redundancy payments and on data from the apprenticeship database held by FÁS.The final EU funding decision releasing a maximum 65% EGF contribution of €35.7m in total is expected shortly. Including the national 35% co-funding element, the measures included in the EGF applications amount to circa €55m in total.  A number of active labour market activation measures, for which EGF co-financing has been sought, are already being provided by the relevant service providers and funded from national sources. These measures include career guidance, full, part-time and evening further education and training courses, apprenticeship on- and off-the-job training, full and part-time third level education programmes and related training and education allowances where appropriate.The main service providers delivering these supports are FÁS, Vocational Education Committees and publicly funded higher education institutes. Training is also being provided through contracted private providers and the technical employment support grant mechanism administered by FÁS.My Department has not notified any of the identified redundant workers to date. It is intended that letters notifying all persons who are eligible for EGF co-financed assistance of a number of new supports which will be made available to them will issue very shortly.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I propose to take Questions Nos. 93, 108 to 111, inclusive, and 119 together.As part of the Budget 2012 decisions that have been announced, the Modern Languages in Primary Schools Initiative will be cease at the end of the 2011/2012 school year. The savings from this measure will go towards the cost of implementing the new National Literacy & Numeracy Strategy, which is a key commitment in the Programme for Government.Since becoming Minister for Education and Skills, I have spoken repeatedly about the need to raise educational standards. In terms of curriculum reform, the priorities in the period ahead are to strengthen achievement in literacy and numeracy, to implement reforms in maths, Irish and science, and to progress junior cycle reforms.  The Modern Languages Initiative was a pilot scheme involving approximately 500 schools and had been operating since 1998. It has not been possible for other schools to join the pilot project for a number of years and the way in which it operated was not capable of being rolled out to all 3,200 primary schools. The decision to end the scheme was based in part on policy advice from a 2008 Report by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment (NCCA), which has identified serious issues with curricular overload at primary level. The NCCA's advice recommended that Modern languages should not be part of the Primary School Curriculum as an additional and separate subject at present. The primary curriculum is currently being reviewed by the NCCA in the context of the National Literacy and Numeracy Strategy. The focus of the review will be on how best to enhance children's learning in these areas, provide a clearer delineation of the learning outcomes required, and integrate into the infant cycle the learning experiences from Aistear, the curriculum framework for early childhood education.At post primary level, targeted support is provided to schools to enable them to diversify language provision with a particular focus on Spanish, Japanese, Russian and Italian. Other languages taught at second level include French, German and Arabic. Participation in foreign languages, relative to other subjects, remains high. The vast majority of students are studying two languages and are therefore developing core skills which will serve them well in future language learning over the lifespan, and there are many opportunities outside the second level system for people to resume language learning.It was not an easy decision to end this scheme, but I gave careful consideration to the concerns about the teaching of languages before taking it.

#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I propose to take Questions Nos 96 to 99, inclusive, together.While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department's budget, the Government has tried to protect front line services in 2012.The Government has protected the pupil-teacher ratio at primary level, prioritised targeted support for the most disadvantaged schools and maintained the overall number of resource teachers and SNAs to support children with special needs.  Until now, a specific resource was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by that normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.The change to guidance allocations must be seen in the context of the major challenges we have as a Government in trying to shelter public services to the greatest extent that we can in these exceptional times.My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	605	The new single allocation for the General Allocation Model (GAM) and language support will be based on the number of classroom teaching posts in each school in the previous school year.   This simplified approach to (GAM) will make it easier to automatically update it annually in line with the changes in the number of classroom teachers in each school.The staffing schedule is the long established method used for the allocation of classroom teachers to schools . It operates on the basis of enrolment bands using a general average of 1 classroom teacher for every 28 pupils or 1 classroom teacher for every 22 pupils in the case of DEIS Band 1 schools.  The number of classroom teachers in each school is based on the relevant pupil threshold point under the published staffing schedule.  In total there are over 20,000 classes in schools throughout the country.While I acknowledge that there can be some variances between schools in relation to the number of pupils in their classes the simplified approach to (GAM) will make it easier to automatically update it annually particularly given that for many schools it has not been updated since it was first introduced in 2005.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	606	I wish to advise the Deputy that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers (SENOs), for allocating resource teachers and Special Needs Assistants (SNAs) to primary and post primary schools to support children with special educational needs. The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The NCSE has responsibility for deciding on the quantum of resource teaching and/or care supports to be allocated to individual schools to enable them to meet the needs of pupils with special educational needs. Assessment reports carried out by relevant professionals are provided by schools to the SENOs as part of the application process for support.There is no automatic system of transfer of resources from one school to another. In considering applications for supports for individual pupils, the SENO takes professional reports into account along with other relevant factors such as the resources available to the school to identify whether additionality is needed or whether the school might reasonably be expected to meet the needs of the pupils from its current level of resources.The NCSE has outlined the processes involved in the consideration of applications for special needs supports in its Circular 01/05 which is available on www.ncse.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	607	The Government has prioritised targeted supports for schools with the most concentrated levels of educational disadvantage. These supports will continue to be targeted through the Delivering Equality of Opportunity in Schools (DEIS) scheme, which is focussed on 670 primary schools and 195 post-primary schools with particularly high levels of disadvantage. This scheme is designed to ensure that the most disadvantaged schools benefit from a comprehensive package of supports.The creation of a dedicated DEIS Band 1 pupil teacher ratio of 22:1 in the Budget will secure a more favourable staffing allocation for these primary schools in comparison to the mainstream pupil teacher ratio of 28:1. While the new staffing schedule gives greater autonomy to DEIS Band 1 schools, the schools should continue to prioritise their staffing allocation to implement more favourable pupil teacher ratios in junior classes, in line with DEIS policy.The Government is also providing €13 million in enhanced funding for DEIS schools, €2 million in school book funding for DEIS schools, as well as a €26 million investment in the Home School Community Liaison scheme. All of these areas have been protected from reductions in expenditure for 2012. In addition €28 million will be provided next year for the School Completion Programme, a major component of DEIS, funded by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.Furthermore DEIS post-primary schools will be targeted for additional support through an improved staffing schedule of 18.25:1, which is a 0.75 point improvement compared to the existing standard 19:1 that applies in post-primary schools that do not charge fees (or compared to the 21:1 ratio that will apply in fee-charging schools).In order to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources available under the DEIS plan, it is no longer possible to allow some schools to retain legacy posts on a concessionary basis that pre-date the introduction of the DEIS scheme. As a result, a decision has been taken to withdraw posts (428 posts) from earlier disadvantage programmes/schemes in 270 primary schools and 163 post primary schools that exceed what equivalent schools are entitled to under DEIS or to which non-DEIS schools are not entitled.As part of the alleviation measures, DEIS band 1 junior schools will be placed on a staffing schedule based on an average of 1 teacher for 20 pupils. 32 schools that have legacy posts that provided for 1 teacher for every 15 pupils in junior classes only will now have a staffing schedule that operates on the basis of an average of 1 teacher for 18 junior pupils.The special position of DEIS schools will also be recognised in adjustments to the General Allocation Model which is used to allocate learning and language support teaching posts to schools.All schools will be notified in January 2012, three months earlier than normal, of their staffing entitlements under the new arrangement including any alleviation measures that may apply. This will allow schools to plan for the school year beginning in September.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	608	While difficult choices had to be made to identify savings across my Department's remit, the Government has gone as far as it could to protect front line services in 2012. The recent changes announced in the Budget were made within the context of bringing our overall public expenditure back into line with what we can afford as a country. The challenge is to ensure that the resources that are provided to schools are used by them to maximum effect in terms of providing an appropriate range of subjects to meet the needs of our knowledge economy and in delivering the best possible outcomes for all our pupils.My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I propose to take Questions Nos. 104 and 120 together.As part of the Budget decisions announced last week, the number of pupils required to gain and retain a teaching post in small primary schools will be gradually increased between September 2012 and September 2014. The schools concerned are those with four or less classroom teachers. It is important to emphasise that no small schools will be closed due to the changes that have been announced.The pupil thresholds for DEIS Band 1 schools (disadvantage schools) are not as high as they reflect the newly introduced 22:1 staffing schedule. Reduced pupil thresholds will continue to apply in respect of schools that are the only primary school on an island. The phased adjustment is estimated to yield a saving of 250 teaching posts over the next three years, with 100 of these posts being removed in 2012/13 school year. The resulting surplus teachers will be redeployed to vacancies in other neighbouring schools in accordance with the redeployment arrangements.The phasing of these measures provides the schools concerned with time to consider the potential for amalgamation with other schools where this is feasible. We have a very significant number of small schools across the country. Due to the way the staffing schedule works at present, small primary schools benefit from significantly lower pupil teacher ratios than larger primary schools. For example, the minimum pupil threshold for the appointment of the second teacher in a 2-teacher school is currently 12 pupils. This means that this school has an average of 6 pupils in each of its 2 classes. The changes that we are introducing will mean that in September 2012 a minimum of 14 pupils will be required for the appointment of the second teacher in the 2 teacher school. The subsequent increases in September 2013 and September 2014 will increase this minimum pupil threshold to 20 pupils. Even when all of these phased increases are implemented the threshold will still be significantly lower than the minimum of 28 pupils that were required for the appointment of the second teacher in schools prior to the mid 1990's.The existing staffing schedule also acts as a disincentive for small schools to consider amalgamation. We have to ensure that the very valuable but limited resources we have available in the system are used in the best and fairest way across the whole system.  All areas of public spending have had to experience some adjustment given the scale of our economic crisis. Despite this challenge, the Government has sought to do this in as fair a way as possible.

From 2012/13 school year, the allocation of administrative principals will be enrolment based only. In DEIS Urban Band 1 schools, an enrolment of 116 pupils will facilitate the principal becoming an administrative principal, while an enrolment of 145 will apply in Band 2 urban primary schools, compared to 178 in other schools. Schools affected by the change to allocating principals on enrolment basis only, will retain their administrative principal status until there is a change of principal in the school.  When an administrative principal post needs to be filled in future, the allocation will be made on an enrolment basis only.In order to ensure fairness in the distribution of resources available under the DEIS plan, it is no longer possible to allow some schools to retain legacy posts on a concessionary basis that pre-date the introduction of the DEIS scheme.

This Forum  was officially launched on 19th April, 2011.  Its terms of reference are to advise the Minister on:  — how it can best be ensured that the education system can provide a sufficiently diverse number and range of primary schools catering for all religions and none;- the practicalities of how transfer/divesting of patronage should operate for individual primary schools in communities where it is appropriate and necessary; and- how such transfer/divesting can be advanced to ensure that demands for diversity of patronage (including from an Irish language perspective) can be identified and met on a widespread basis nationally. The Advisory Group was appointed to convene the Forum, to receive and distil the various views and perspectives of participants and to then provide the Minister with policy advice having regard to the Terms of Reference. The Advisory Group has held a number  of meetings in public (22-24 June and 17th November) and has sought and received submissions from the public as part of its work.    The Advisory Group will prepare its report for the Minister before the end of December 2011.The Advisory Group is chaired by Dr. John Coolahan, Professor Emeritus at NUI Maynooth. The other members are Dr. Caroline Hussey, former Registrar and Deputy President, UCD and Fionnuala Kilfeather, former Chief Executive of the National Parents Council — Primary.(2) Student Grants Appeals Board This Appeals Board was established under Student Support Act 2011 (Student Grants Appeals Board) (Establishment Day) Order 2011, S.I. 451 of 2011, with the 8th September 2011 appointed to be the establishment day for the purposes of subsection (2) of section 25 of the Student Support Act 2011. The Board will be independent in the performance of its functions. Its establishment will allow students that have applied for a grant under the 2011/12 student grant scheme and subsequent schemes to have any appeals determined by the Board. The Board, which comprises of  a Chairperson and six ordinary members all appointed in their individual capacity based on their knowledge and expertise. Ms. Maureen Waldron, a former Director of the Department of Social Protection, has accepted the position of Chairperson to the Board. She is joined by Mr. Padraig McNamara (vice-Chair) former Chief Executive Officer of the State Examinations Commission; Dr. Marie Clarke, Head of Education at UCD; Ms. Rebecca Murphy, former Student Union Welfare Officer, University College Cork; Ms. Eithne Frost, Consultant in the Voluntary Sector; Ms. Brenna Clarke, retired Professor of English at St. Patrick's College of Education; and Professor Kevin Ryan, former Registrar of the University of Limerick.(3) SOLAS Implementation Group   This Implementation Group is chaired by the Minister of State with responsibility for Training and Skills, Ciarán Cannon T.D.  Membership of the Implementation Group includes representatives from the Department of Education and Skills, FÁS, the Irish Vocational Education Association (IVEA) and the Department of Social Protection. It will also consult with other key stakeholders.  The Implementation Group will develop an Action Plan to implement the changes necessary to put SOLAS in place following the passing of the relevant legislation in 2012.  The Group reported to the Cabinet Committee on Economic Recovery and Jobs on progress in November in keeping with the Government decision on the creation of SOLAS.(4) The Literacy and Numeracy Implementation Advisory Group The role of the group is to monitor progress on implementation of "Literacy and Numeracy for Learning and Life: the National Strategy to Improve Literacy and Numeracy among Children and Young People 2011-2020.  The Group which met for the first time earlier this week is chaired by the Secretary General of my Department. In addition there are 12 other members on the group including the Chief Inspector of my Department,  the Director General of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the CEOs of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the State examinations Commission and the Teaching Council.(5) Advisory Group on Suitability of Qualifications for Higher Capitation Rates This group was established in October to advise the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on the equivalence of qualifications in other disciplines to a Level 7 Qualification in early Childhood Care and Education. The composition of the group includes representatives from the National Qualifications Authority of Ireland, the Irish Universities Association, Ireland's Institutes of Technology and from both my Department and the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.(6) Junior cycle Implementation Advisory Group  The general remit of the Group is to advise on and progress the implementation of the proposals on Junior cycle reform. The composition of the group includes representatives from my Department, the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, the State Examinations Commission, School Management, Principals and Teacher unions and Parents.  The inaugural meeting will be held in early January.(7) New Schools Establishment Group  In June 2011 I announced that twenty new primary schools and twenty new post-primary schools are to be established in the next six years.  I also announced the establishment of new arrangements for the recognition of new primary and post-primary schools.  These new arrangements included the establishment of a New Schools Establishment Group which will advise me on patronage of the new schools following its consideration of a report on the applications received to be prepared by the Department. This group is chaired by Dr. Seamus McGuinness (retired senior lecturer in the Education Department at Trinity College, Dublin) and also includes Ms Sylda Langford (retired Director of the Office of the Minister for Children) and Professor Seán Ó Riain (Sociology Department, NUI Maynooth).

While there would be no maintenance payments, all ‘special rate' students will have their fees paid while another 4,000 students will receive a fee contribution of €2,000. In access terms, the requirement to pay a fee would be likely to be a greater obstacle to entry than lack of maintenance support.This approach has enabled me to ensure that substantial allocations continue to be made to students from lower income backgrounds to achieve an undergraduate qualification to improve their job opportunities.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Higher Education Access Route (HEAR) is a third-level admissions scheme for students from socio-economically disadvantaged backgrounds. The scheme is operated by a number of higher education institutions and not by my Department. Admissions to the institutions under this programme are regulated by the institutions themselves. Further details are available at www.accesscollege.ie.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The Scheme for the award of incremental credit to recognised teachers in Second Level Schools is set out in Circular 29/2007 and was agreed under the auspices of the Teachers' Conciliation Council, a body established in accordance with the terms of the Conciliation and Arbitration Scheme for Teachers which is made up of representatives of the teacher representative bodies, school management and the Department of Education and Skills and Department of Finance under an independent chairperson.As outlined in previous correspondence the teaching service of the person to whom the Deputy refers failed to meet the criteria for approved teaching service and the application was refused under the above circular.  There is no provision for appeal of non-approved teaching service under the agreed scheme.An application was also submitted for relevant non-teaching service for the period Oct 1999 to Oct 2001, this was also refused as the service was deemed not to be directly relevant to the teaching post to which the teacher was appointed.  It is open to a teacher, who is unhappy with the decision of my Department to refuse a claim for relevant non-teaching service, to submit an appeal to an independent appeals committee.  This appeal should be submitted to the Incremental Credit Appeals Committee, c/o Department of Education and Skills, Cornamaddy, Athlone, Co. Westmeath.  As these are agreed procedures it would be inappropriate for me, as Minister, to intervene in any individual case.

The HEA has been liaising with the seven universities over the last number of weeks with a view to obtaining as much information as is possible. This information is now attached.Please note that the majority of institutions were not able to extract composite details from their information systems in relation to the location of rooms hired, and the purpose of such hire. The names of visiting lecturers, and the location of where they stayed and associated costs was also not readily available in most instances. These services are generally managed at a Department or Faculty level within institutions and the information is not readily available at an aggregate level.There is one outstanding piece of information and I would hope to be in a position to supply this very soon.Room Hire CostsTaxi HireLegal FeesAgency Staff CostsNumber of Visiting lecturersAccommodation CostsVisiting Lecturer Expenses/costsUniversity Presidents PayUniversity Presidents ExpensesTrinity College Dublin2010 — €579,9142010 — €33,0762009 — €846,7712009 — €126,411.81 of which academic = €0Not availableNot availableNot available2009 — €237,885Will be forwarded separately2011 — €550,3472011 — €38,3882010 — €605,3532010 — €60,589 of which academic = €0Not availableNot availableNot available2010 — €202,118Will be forwarded separatelyUniversity College Dublin2010 — €50,5612010 — €41,7252009/10 — €697,0832009 — €1,789,496. €473,644 for academic & €1,315,853 for support units.Not availableNot availableNo details supplied2009 — €237,0052009 — €381.032011 — €49,1422011 — €39,7672010/11 — €426,1992010 — €854,302.   €241,014 for academic & €613,288 for support units.Not availableNot availableNo details supplied2010 — €202,1162010 — €865.09Dublin City University2010 — €59,0002010 — €41,0002009 — €803,4762009 — €103,000.  €0 for academic.2009 — 972009 — €43,0002009 — €26,0002008/9 — €247,0002009 — €10,0002011 — €96,0002011 — €54,0002010 — €131,3982010 — €174,000.   €0 for academic2010 — 732010 — €33,0002010 — €24,0002009/10 — €193,8432010 — €7,000University of Limerick2010 — €02010 — €36,0102009 — €152,4012009 — €83,036.     €0 for academic.2009 — 568Not applicablelecturers paid hourly rate only2009 — €228,0502009 — €6,550.852011 — €02011 — €28,6162010 — €165,6092010 — €150,082.   €0 for academic.2010 — 461Not applicablelecturers paid hourly rate only2010 — €193,8432010 — €7,533.56NUI, MaynoothNot available2010 — €75,4622009 — €304,1202009 — €13,597, €0 for academic staffNot availableNot availableNot available2008/09 — €239,4892008/9 — €5,945Not available2011 — €52,5762010 — €147,4422010 — €18,408, €0 for academic staffNot availableNot availableNot available20009/10 — €202,3952009/10 — €3,674NUI, Galway2010 — €255,5182010 — €24,1512009 — €894,6512009 — €742,589. €0 for academic2009 — 1602009 — €31,2432009 — €9,3702009 — €237,7852009 — €12,0682011 — €200,6212011 — €25,6962010 — €840,0002010 — €681,815.   €0 for academic2010 — 1472010 — €27,0172010 — €7,8382010 — €202,1172010 — €9,162University College Cork2010 — €173,6372010 — €124,9712009/10 — €1,030,0372009 — €343,842.

His grant awarding authority decided that the documentation submitted by him did not sufficiently support this position.  This decision was upheld by its appeals officer.  Following a review of the case, my Department subsequently upheld the appeals officer's decision.  This outcome was communicated by my Department to the student on 7 June 2011.  Further correspondence was subsequently received and a response to this issued on 4 October 2011.The Deputy will appreciate that the onus is on an applicant to provide sufficient proofs in support of his/her student grant application and this requirement is applied equally to all students.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	624	Until now, a specific resource was provided for guidance in addition to the standard teacher allocation to post primary schools. In future, schools must meet their guidance requirements from within the overall resource provided by that normal staffing schedule. Individually schools can continue to make provision for guidance and counselling. Decisions on how this will be done will be taken at school level in the best interests of students and to ensure the best use of resources available. I am confident school management and teachers will continue to work together to meet the needs of the students in their care.In this way, the main teacher allocation can be maintained at 19:1 for schools generally, while schools will have discretion to balance what they allocate for guidance against the competing demands of providing subject choice. The change that has been announced gives schools greater autonomy in how they allocate staff resources to best meet the needs of their students.   My Department will be notifying schools of the impact of the budget changes in January, 2012.

The project was listed for completion of the brief and the appointment of a design team. The brief was recently completed and the process of appointing a Design Team will commence shortly.
#CiaranCannon	unknown-#CiaranCannon-party	unknown-#CiaranCannon-dob	unknown-#CiaranCannon-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	626	I propose to take Questions Nos. 132 and 133 together.The 2011 allocation for school transport services is nearly €180 million.  My Department's expenditure on the School Transport Scheme was €155.2m to the end of November 2011. The expenditure to the year end will be in the region of €172m.  This expenditure provides for all aspects of school transport provision including the payment of grants.  The income generated by pupil charges is estimated at some €11.5m in respect of 2011.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	627	The new school referred to by the Deputy is one of eight schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership.  This Bundle was handed over to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) in July 2010 to commence the tender procurement process.   I am pleased to inform the Deputy that tenders were received on 5th July 2011 and following evaluation, the BAM PPP consortium was appointed Preferred Tenderer on 30th September 2011.  BAM submitted applications for full planning permission to the relevant local authorities and subject to the successful outcomes to these applications and the completion of the procurement process, it is anticipated that construction of the schools in the Bundle will commence in the first quarter of 2012. The accommodation is expected to be ready for occupation in September 2013.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	628	I can confirm that the school referred to by the Deputy contacted my Department regarding a proposed extension.  Following communications between my officials and the school, an application for major capital works was furnished to my Department in October 2011.   This application is being assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large-scale building projects.  The outcome of this assessment will be conveyed to the school authority in due course and a band rating will be assigned to the proposed project, details of which will be published on the Department's website at www.education.ie. The progression of all large-scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in  the context of the Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation  programme.  In light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department and the demographic challenge facing the education system in the coming years, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.The Government's Medium Term Infrastructure and Capital Investment Framework, which was published on 10th November 2011, sets out the demographic challenge facing the education system with substantial increases in enrolments at both  primary and post primary level projected in the coming years. Therefore, the delivery of new schools, together with extension projects to meet the increase in demand, will be the main focus for capital investment in schools in the coming years.  Given the constraints on capital funding, the Government has to prioritise school building projects and the very real need to ensure that every child has access to a school place.I have previously committed to publishing details this month of the school  building projects to be constructed in 2012 and in the new year, I will publish  a five year plan outlining the projects to be constructed in that time.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	629	The school in question submitted an application in April 2011 for Emergency Funding for a sewerage system upgrade.  As the scope of works for this project is outside the terms of the Emergency Works Scheme it cannot be considered for emergency funding.  A refusal letter in respect of this application issued to the school authorities on 2nd June 2011.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	630	The position is that under my Department's Free Fees Scheme, students who have  previously pursued but have not completed a course of third level study and  subsequently resume third level studies are not eligible for free fees for the  equivalent period of time spent on the first course of study.As the Deputy may be aware it is the third level institution concerned that determines a student's eligibility for free fees in line with the terms and conditions of the scheme.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	631	The teacher referred to by the Deputy was not eligible for access to the redeployment panel in respect of the current school year.  My Department will begin the process early in 2012 of identifying schools with vacancies to which surplus permanent and CID holding teachers in primary  schools will be redeployed for the 2012/13 school year.  As part of this process the redeployment arrangements, including access to the supplementary panel will be published on my Department's website.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	632	The school in question submitted an application in October 2010 for emergency funding for a perimeter fence.  As the scope of works for this project is outside the terms of the Emergency Works Scheme it cannot be considered for emergency funding.  A refusal letter in respect of this application issued to the school authorities on 17th November 2010.  The school applied for a Summer Works Scheme grant in 2011 to carry out replacement of windows.  Due to the scale of demand for funding under the scheme, it was not possible to fund all applications.  The school was advised accordingly.
#RuairiQuinn	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-party	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-dob	unknown-#RuairiQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	633	My Department has received an application for additional funding from the school in question. This application is being assessed and the school authorities will be notified of the outcome as quickly as possible.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	634	Civil servants recruited before April 2004 generally have a minimum pension age of 60 years.  This is a key long-standing feature of their pension scheme and I have no plans to stop pensions in payment to retired civil servants under the age of 65 years until those persons reach that age.Civil servants recruited from April 2004 onwards generally have a minimum pension age of 65 years with no maximum retirement age.Under the proposed single public service pension scheme, as provided for in the Public Service Pensions (Single Scheme) and Remuneration Bill 2011, which is currently before the Dáil, it is planned that future entrants to the civil service and the public service generally will have a pension age of 66 years, rising to 67 and 68 years in 2021 and 2028 respectively, in tandem with increases in the State Pension age, with a maximum retirement age of 70 years.I should point out that retirement is a significant means of reducing Public Service numbers and assisting in meeting the budgetary targets.These prospective changes to the minimum pension age in the single scheme are part of the Government's drive to reduce the long-term cost of public service pensions, thereby putting public service pensions on a more sustainable footing.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	636	Under the arrangements entered into with the European Commission, the IMF and the ECB on external financial support for Ireland, the Government has agreed to prepare a draft programme of asset disposals and associated regulatory reforms, by the end of December 2011, for discussion with the Troika in advance of taking final decisions on the programme to be pursued.   The draft programme will include:the identification of the potential assets to be disposed;any regulatory steps and changes deemed necessary, including those required to be consistent with relevant EU legislation, that would have to be completed in advance of a disposal;a timetable for implementation, taking into account the need for an orderly process that avoids fire sales and allows time to implement regulatory reforms; andan assessment of their classification as financial or non-financial transactions.The Government's final decision on the programme to be pursued will  take account of discussions with the Troika on the amount of proceeds to be generated and also the use to which these proceeds will be put.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	637	The question of putting in place a policy in relation to rents receivable by Government Departments and associated bodies on the lines adopted by NAMA is under consideration in my Department in consultation with potentially affected Departments.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	638	I refer the Deputy to the Comprehensive Expenditure Report 2012-2014 (Part IV Estimate of Supply Services, page 155), published recently by my Department and which contains the details requested.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	639	The Office of Public Works completed a study in 2009 into the feasibility of a number of possible flood alleviation measures in the area concerned. These measures included the construction of new channels to provide drainage into Lough Corrib and Lough Mask.As indicated in my response to the House of 3 May, 2011, the study identified no practical drainage solutions, and road raising was found to be the only practical option available to alleviate flood risk. A subsequent application by Mayo County Council, under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme, for funding for these works was not approved as they fell outside the scope of the Scheme.The OPW has recently met with Mayo County Council to discuss flooding issues generally in Co. Mayo, including the Neale. Subsequent to these discussions, the OPW and council engineers have exchanged information with a view to assessing the viability of providing a flood relief route via the proposed trench for the local water services upgrade to be undertaken by the council.Should the council bring forward a feasible proposal to undertake drainage works as part the water services upgrade, it will be open to the council to submit a funding application under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme.  Any application received will be assessed in accordance with the scheme eligibility criteria and having regard to the overall availability of resources for flood risk management.It should be noted that while the proposed water services infrastructure can follow the ground contours, a flood relief conduit would have to be constructed at a gradient, or at various gradients, with appropriate pumping. Such engineering requirements will impact on the economic viability of any proposal identified.

The SPS, which has been established initially within the civil service, aims to strengthen leadership capacity across the public service.  The SPS Management Committee will oversee the development of policies on mobility and training and development.  The Committee is comprised of the Secretaries General of six Government Departments and is chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.Human Resources Shared Services Centre (HRSSC) Project Management BoardThis is a cross Departmental Body that will oversee the delivery of the HRSSC project.ESB Sale Steering GroupThis group has been established on foot of a Government Decision of 14th September 2011  to consider the best approach to achieve the sale of a minority stake in the ESB as an integrated utility, including regulatory, legal, financial, economic and energy and other policy considerations, and report back to Government by end-November with a recommendationState Assets Disposal Steering GroupThis group has been established on foot of a Government Decision of 14th September 2011 to examine a range of other assets identified by Government as potential candidates for inclusion in any asset disposal programme and advise on the appropriate valuations to be placed on the assets and on the most appropriate method of disposal, likely timeframe and economic impact of any such disposal, in order to inform any further decisions that the Government may wish to make.Public Service Information Officer( CIO) CouncilIt comprises senior representatives from a range of Departments/Offices and public bodies with responsibility for Information Communications Technology (ICT) and eGovernment.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	642	In relation to a breakdown of the funding for this project, this information is not available to the Office of Public Works and, as pointed out in my reply to the Deputy of 8 December 2011, Roscommon County Council, as the local authority responsible for this project, is best placed to provide this information.Under the Minor Flood Mitigation Works Scheme, funding is provided to the local authorities who are then responsible for the planning, procurement, detailed financial management and day-to-day implementation of the works. Applications received under the scheme are assessed under a number of criteria, which are designed to ensure value for money.OPW has not been made aware by the council of any difficulties in relation to this project. Any such difficulties would be a matter for the council to address. If further works are considered necessary, then it is open to the council to apply for funding, and the application will be assessed in the normal way.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	643	The Party Leader's Allowance is provided for in the Oireachtas (Ministerial and  Parliamentary Offices) Act, 1938, as amended by the Oireachtas (Ministerial and  Parliamentary Offices) (Amendment) Act, 2001.The allowance is paid to the parliamentary leader of a qualifying party in relation to expenses arising from the parliamentary activities, including research, of the party. Payments are made in respect of members of the party elected to Dáil Éireann and members elected/nominated to Seanad Éireann at the last preceding general election, or a subsequent by-election or, in the case of Seanad Éireann, nominated to it after the last preceding general election.The primary restriction in the Act on the use of the allowance is that it may not be used in respect of election expenses.In addition, the 2001 Act gives a statutory oversight role in relation to the Party Leader's Allowance to the Standards in Public Office (SIPO) Commission. This requires each party leader to prepare a statement of expenditure for the allowance, to have it audited by an independent auditor and furnish it with the auditor's report to the Commission. Based on the accounts submitted, the Commission is required to make a report to the Minister in relation to the use of the Party Leader's Allowance and cause a copy of the report to be laid before the Oireachtas.In relation to payments made to Deputies and Senators that are outside political parties, an allowance in connection with his or her parliamentary activities may be paid if he or she is a member of Dáil Éireann or Seanad Éireann, who at the last preceding general election or a subsequent by-election, was elected as a member of Dáil Éireann or elected/nominated for Seanad Éireann after the preceding general election, other than as a member of a qualifying party, i.e. an Independent member. The SIPO Commission's oversight provisions do not apply to the allowances paid to Independent members.  I intend to bring proposals to Government in early 2012 in relation to the Party Leader's Allowance.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	644	The information the Deputy is seeking is freely available on my Department's website in the Public Service Staff Numbers Databank.The information is presented on a whole time equivalent basis and shows the number of staff employed in each sector at the end of each year for the period 1994 to 2010.  For 2011 the data is published on a quarterly basis.The Databank is regularly updated and uses the end 2008 figures as its base. The numbers are based on information reported to my Department on a quarterly basis.  As outlined in the Public Service Reform Plan that I published on 17 November last, the Government plans to reduce the size of the public service to 282,500 by 2015.  A sectoral breakdown of this figure will be announced in due course.The numbers reduction set out in the Budget last week will see 2012 public service numbers reduced to some 294,000, a 6,000 reduction over projected end 2011 figure of 300,000.  This represents a third of the required reductions between now and 2015 and is consistent with Government's policy to front-load the correction, thus maximising the potential savings.  Overall, from the peak level in 2008, by end 2015 we will see a 37,500 reduction in numbers.  There will also be a €3.5 billion or 20% reduction in the Exchequer paybill over that period.My Department has estimated that up to 9,000 staff are due to retire in 2012. It is expected that the vast majority of these will retire under the "Grace Period" which ends in February 2012.  A full sectoral breakdown of the numbers remaining will not be available until the end of the first quarter of 2012 and will be published on my Department's website.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	645	Contemporary data on earnings for public servants is not available to my Department.  The most up to date earnings data available to the Revenue Commissioners, as stated in my Reply to Parliamentary Question 37624/11 on 29 November 2011, is not comparable for a number of reasons to the statistics produced by my Department on public service numbers and earnings. They also predate the measures taken to reduce gross public service wages in 2010.The closest data currently available within the Department to that sought by the Deputy relates to salary ranges.  The estimated breakdown of employee numbers on a whole time equivalent basis (based on a whole time equivalent figure of 300,000) by salary range within the public service in 2011 is set out in the Table below:Pay ParametersNumbers€0-€20,00019,442€20,001-€40,00093,253€40,001-€60,000112,954€60,001-€80,00052,600€80,001-€100,00014,960Over €100,0006,791Total300,000The above salary figures include the reduction imposed on the remuneration rates of public servants under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No 2) Act 2009 effective from 1 January 2010. However, the salary ranges exclude the impact on gross salaries of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 which imposed a pension related deduction on the salary of public servants of an average of some 7% effective from March 2009.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	646	In June of this year, the Government agreed with my proposal to the introduction of:a general pay ceiling of €200,000 for future appointments to higher positions across the public service; anda general pay ceiling of €250,000 forfuture appointments to CEO posts within Commercial State Companies.I proposed this pay ceiling in light of the decision taken by the Government on its first day in office to reduce the salary of the Taoiseach to €200,000 and to apply a pro rata reduction to other members of the Government. In relation to current incumbents, the Government gave detailed consideration to the potential legal and contractual issues arising from the imposition of an immediate reduction of salaries. Having regard to those issues, the Government decided to seek voluntary waivers of salary of 15%, or by a lesser amount if the application of the full 15% reduction would bring the salary levels of such individuals to below the proposed pay ceiling.From the information available to my Department, 23 positive responses have been received on foot of the Government Decision including from former incumbents who have since retired.Arrangements are being made to implement the pay ceiling for future appointments where salaries are determined by the appropriate Minister. In addition, the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (Amendment) Bill 2011 which will, once enacted, apply the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Acts of 2009 to serving members of the judiciary in line with the decision of the people in the referendum on the Twenty Ninth Amendment of the Constitution is currently before the Oireachtas. This legislation will also amend the salary rate for future appointments to certain statutory offices, such as the Presidency, the Judiciary and the Ombudsman and formally provide for the reduction in the salary rates for members of the Government.Finally, I would like to acknowledge the substantial number of voluntary waivers of salaries made by other public servants including that made by the President on assuming Office.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21459	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	647	The Department of Justice and Equality determines the immigration status of persons within the State and whether they can remain in the State. A student on an Immigration Stamp 2, issued by the Department of Justice and Equality, is permitted to remain in Ireland to pursue a course of studies and is permitted to engage in casual employment which is defined as not more than 20 hours per week during term, and up to 40 hours per week during holidays. A student on a Stamp 2 is prohibited from engaging in full time employment and cannot be issued with an employment permit.Students on a Stamp 2 should be present in the State to pursue a course of studies and are not here for the purpose of entering employment. Accordingly, this Department is not in a position to consider employment permit applications from persons present in the State on a student status apart from applications received under the "Third Level Graduate Scheme".Non-EEA students who have, on or after 1 January, 2007, acquired a primary, masters or doctorate degree from an Irish third level educational institution are eligible to apply under the Scheme.Persons who qualify under this scheme will be granted one non-renewable extension to their current student permission (Stamp 2) for a six month or 1 year period, depending on their level of qualification, starting on the date upon which the person receives their exam results. The purpose of the permission to remain in the State under this Scheme is to seek employment and apply for a Green Card or Work Permit under normal criteria.I wish to advise the Deputy that it is current Government policy to issue new employment permits only in respect of:highly skilled, highly paid positions or;non-EEA nationals who are already legally resident in the State on valid employment permits or;positions requiring specialist or scarce skills, expertise or qualifications which, otherwise, cannot be filled.Furthermore, applications for new employment permits are normally only considered where a starting salary of €30,000 is on offer. While no change in this general policy is contemplated, consideration of Work Permit type applications under the Third Level Graduate Scheme may take cognisance of lower industry norms for the starting salaries of graduate occupations.

Industry figures indicate that the market for General Insurance i.e. motor, household insurance, in Ireland had contracted by over 20% in the last two years with Life and Pensions insurance contracting by over 30%. Given the above, Aviva stated that it  found it necessary to review its Irish operations to ensure that its cost base was in line with domestic demand to ensure sustainability.Aviva has indicated to IDA and myself its continued commitment to ongoing engagement with employees and unions and also has stated its intention, post-transition, to remain one of the largest employers of insurance people in Ireland.I have met with and had a number of discussions with senior management from Aviva, including the company's CEO, and had asked IDA to engage with the company to minimise job losses.In that context, IDA has and continues to engage with Aviva in an effort to develop other alternatives for the company's operations in Ireland.

This sum comprises €336.9 million in Current expenditure and €507.9 million in Capital expenditure and takes into account a targeted saving of €14.6 million on Programme Payroll and non-pay administrative savings for 2011 agreed in the context of the development of the National Recovery Plan. This allocation is broadly spent across 6 key Programme Areas.Actual outturn figures for end year expenditure are not yet available. However, significant spend is profiled for the last month of the year. My Department is closely monitoring spending under all expenditure lines with a view to returning savings made to the Exchequer.

There has been no change to this figure since the Budget.My Department, like all others, will find savings across its current expenditure, including in administration and pay budgets. However, capital spending on job-creating programmes will be maintained or increased in 2012.  My Department and its agencies will be able to continue present levels of capital spending on job creation, as well as increasing the scope of some crucial programmes and implementing some new measures.Individual allocations to CEBs will be made early in the first quarter of 2012 in line with established criteria administered through the CEB Central Coordination Unit (CCU) based within Enterprise Ireland.Under the 2012 Estimates Process, the Capital Allocation for the CEBs in 2012 has been set at €15 million which is the same as under the original 2011 Estimates Process figure. In view of the on-going challenges surrounding the public finances, this preservation of funding represents the Government's continued commitment to providing supports to businesses in the micro-enterprise sector.

Any change to the 12.5% rate would damage this brand name by indicating a lack of long-term commitment to certainty, a very important criterion for companies considering an investment in Ireland.  In his recent Budget speech the Minister for Finance reaffirmed the Government's Programme for Government commitment to retain the 12.5% corporation tax rate.There is a sound rationale underpinning our commitment to this sustaining this rate.  Not only is it important for competitiveness.  Empirical evidence obtained by the OECD during an ongoing study of the impact of various categories of taxation on economic growth across a range of jurisdictions suggests that corporate taxes are the most damaging category in terms of impact on economic growth, followed by income taxes as the second most damaging category and indirect taxes as the third most damaging category, with annual property related taxes being the least most harmful category in terms of adverse impact on economic growth.  The impact of alternative categories of taxation on economic growth and job creation is more significant in the case of a small open economy such as Ireland.  Hence the tax focus of Budget 2012.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	21459	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	659	European Directive 2008/104/EC on Temporary Agency Work was adopted in 2008 with a transposition date of 5 December 2011.  A central aim of the Directive is to ensure protection of temporary agency workers by applying the principle of equal treatment in their basic working and employment conditions.Earlier this week, Government approved the publication of a Bill entitled Protection of Employees (Temporary Agency Work) Bill 2011 to transpose the provisions of the Directive and the Bill will be published this week.  This is one of the priority Bills for my Department and the intention is to progress the Bill to early enactment in the Houses of the Oireachtas in the new parliamentary session in 2012.  When enacted, the Bill will, with the exception of the provisions that create offences, have retrospective effect to 5 December, 2011.This means that with effect from 5 December 2011, temporary agency workers employed by employment agencies and assigned to work with a hirer, are entitled to equal treatment in basic working and employment conditions in the same way as if they were directly recruited by the hirer to the same job.  My Department has engaged with the representatives of Employment Agencies and hirer undertakings with a view to making appropriate arrangements to ensure that equal treatment is given effect from 5 December, 2011 in respect of all temporary agency workers.

We are planning savings of €27.5m which represents a reduction of 7.5% in the total 2011 Community Employment Budget of €360m.The Government is fully committed to the protection and development of community and social employment initiatives.Community Employment schemes provide a very important and valued contribution to social employment, training and progression for unemployed people.  Furthermore, many Community Employment schemes provide vital community services right across the country.As part of the integration of the employment services division of FAS into the Department of Social Protection on the 1st of January 2012, I have directed that a review of CE schemes will commence immediately.No Community Employment scheme will close pending the outcome of this review.The purpose of the review will be to establish the on-going viability of each scheme in the context of the overall objectives of the CE programme and recognising in particular the community and social value of each CE scheme.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	662	I propose to take Questions Nos. 169, 170 and 175 together.As announced in Budget 2012, the employer rebate of statutory redundancy payments will reduce from 60% to 15% with effect from January 2012.  It is expected that this measure will save €81 million in 2012.  To give effect to this change, legislation was introduced and passed all stages in this House last week and is due to be debated in the Seanad this week.  While I acknowledge that this change may cause difficulties for employers it must be recognised that in the current economic climate, the 60% level of rebate is not sustainable.This measure will bring redundancy rebates arrangements generally into line with other EU jurisdictions where the payment of redundancy rebates is not general practice.  For example, in the UK the redundancy payment is funded by the employer and there is no recovery from the State.  In Sweden there is no statutory system of redundancy payments from the employer while in Spain the employer cannot claim back any amount from the State.  In contrast in Ireland last year, €373.2 million was paid out in redundancy rebates to employers and €186.2 million has been paid so far this year.   Supports to enterprise are generally a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	663	I propose to take Questions Nos. 171 and 184 together.I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that, based on 2010 figures the average processing times for all appeals dealt with by way of summary decision  was 27.4 weeks  while cases which required an oral hearing took , on average, 45.6 weeks.  In the case of illness benefit, invalidity pensions and disability allowance the average times for all appeals were 39.2/56.4, 40.9/59.7 and 30.8/51 respectively.   There are no separate figures maintained which identify appeals where persons who were on illness benefit were refused invalidity pension or disability allowance when their two years were up.These processing times are calculated from the registration date of the appeal to the date of its finalisation and include all activities during this period including time spent in the Department for comments by the Deciding Officer on the grounds of appeal put forward by the appellant and any further investigation and examination or assessment by the Department's Inspectors and Medical Assessors where deemed necessary.  A considerable period of time is added to the process when an oral hearing is required because of the logistics involved in this process.  I am assured by the Chief Appeals Officer that she is keeping the methods of operation by which the Social Welfare Appeals Office conducts its business under constant review, and that the processes are continuously being enhanced to reduce the backlogs in the Office and, overall, to reduce the processing times for dealing with appeals.   In that regard, as a result of various initiatives, including the assignment of 9 additional Appeals Officers from April, 22,406 decisions were made by appeals officers in the first eleven months of 2011,   in comparison to 16,232 for the same period in 2010.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	665	Invalidity pension is a payment for people who are permanently incapable of work because of illness or incapacity and who satisfy the contribution conditions.  Illness benefit is a short-term payment for people who are incapable of work due to illness or injury. Since January 2009 payment of illness benefit is limited to a maximum of 104 weeks (624 days) in most cases. Currently, letters are sent to illness benefit customers 13 weeks before their claim is due to expire. The customer is advised about other possible schemes for which they may qualify, depending on their circumstances, including invalidity pension, disability allowance, jobseeker's benefit, jobseeker's allowance and supplementary welfare allowance.An applicant is not refused invalidity pension without an assessment of their medical suitability for the scheme. Where a customer has had a recent medical review under the illness benefit scheme this review is used to assess medical suitability for other schemes as appropriate. Where there has not been a recent medical review, medical information is requested. This evidence is supplied by the applicant in the form of a diagnostic report completed by their General Practitioner, along with other medical evidence if available. A medical assessor examines this evidence and decides if the person is suitable for invalidity pension. Medical assessments are conducted in accordance with evidence-based medical protocols. If the applicant does not satisfy the medical criteria the application is disallowed by a deciding officer. The applicant is notified in writing and is advised of their right to request a review of the decision or to appeal it to the Social Welfare Appeals Office.The Deputy refers to the community welfare officer refusing to give an emergency payment under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme. A community welfare officer may issue a payment if a person is awaiting a decision on entitlement or awaiting the result of a review or appeal. However, assistance under the supplementary welfare allowance scheme is means-tested and is subject to other conditions.There are a number of possible social welfare payments for which a customer may qualify thereafter, depending on their circumstances. If a person is refused invalidity pension or illness benefit on medical grounds, they may apply for jobseeker's allowance including where the decision on their illness payment is under appeal.

In addition to the payment of ENPs, my Department also makes urgent needs payments, which can be made to persons who would not normally be entitled to SWA. The aftermath of flooding is one situation where urgent needs payments can be made.The Deputy will also be aware that in the immediate aftermath of the severe flooding experienced in October 2011, the Government put in place a humanitarian aid scheme which provides up to €10 million to assist the people affected by that flooding. The scheme is being administered by staff of the Department of Social Protection (former Community Welfare Officers).Since these recent floods, my officials have been providing individuals with emergency payments to offset their immediate needs such as the purchase of food, clothing, fuel and household goods. Payments have also been made in respect of essential household items such as carpets, flooring, furniture and white goods.Larger payments in respect of longer-term needs, such as meeting the cost of repairing homes and making them habitable again will be made in the coming weeks and months as the extent of the damage caused becomes apparent.My officials have made house to house calls to individuals they have identified as being vulnerable at this difficult time. In addition special clinics were established to offer help to affected households.Any person experiencing hardship as a result of the recent flooding should contact the local Department of Social Protection representative administering the SWA scheme who may be able to offer assistance.

Given the scale of the unemployment crisis, the key objective of labour market policy is to keep those on the live register close to the labour market and prevent the drift into long-term unemployment.  This will ensure that live register members availing of activation measures such as JobBridge will, while retaining social welfare unemployment payments and a top up allowance of €50, get an opportunity to engage in the workplace, get work experience and so be in a position to avail of employment opportunities as the economy improves.For these reasons, the eligibility for the scheme is confined to those on the live register and in receipt of unemployment payments or signing for credits for 78 days in the previous six months.  In so construing the scheme, the policy objective is to prioritise scarce resources on those on the live register so as to increase their chances of leaving it and ensure a reduction in exchequer costs over time.Individuals in receipt of one parent family payment may continue to access a wide range of activation supports including the FÁS work placement programme, which is designed to provide participants with valuable work experience, thereby improving their prospects of securing employment.

The position remains unchanged.The Labour Court recommended in July 2008 that an agreed pension scheme should be introduced for community employment (CE) scheme supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that such a scheme should be adequately funded by FÁS.  Notwithstanding the positions of the Department in rejecting that liability for these costs falls to be met from public funds, this matter has been the subject of discussions between the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, my Department, and the unions representing CE supervisors.  In the event that funding was required from FÁS, the implementation of the claim is not considered sustainable in light of the current and ongoing fiscal environment and the requirement to contain and reduce public expenditure.  The costs of the introduction of any scheme are likely to be of the order of €3m per annum with retrospective costs of the order of at least €30 millionThe Deputy should also note that FÁS is not the employer of CE supervisors and such employees are not public servants.  Neither was FÁS a party to the Labour Court dispute on this matter.  The responsibilities of the sponsoring organisations and the individuals concerned must also be recognised when considering pension provision arrangements.

Members of the group have expertise in economic and social policy as well as other relevant areas and include a mix of experience and expertise from within and outside the public sector.  The group has been tasked with recommending cost-effective solutions as to how employment incentives can be improved and better poverty outcomes achieved, particularly child poverty outcomes.  The issue of family and child income supports is currently being examined by the Group.I also appointed a steering group on the national internship scheme in May to advise me on the implementation of the scheme.  The steering group is comprised of representatives from the private, public and voluntary sectors.

A decision on the review will be made shortly and the person in question will be notified accordingly.  If it is decided that a revision of the original decision is warranted and that carers allowance is payable, any arrears due from the date of the original application to the date of death of the care recipient will issue to the person in question.Question No. 184 answered with Question No. 171.

This includes ensuring that applications are processed and decisions made on entitlement as quickly as possible.The average waiting time for new family income supplement (FIS) claims at the end of November is 17 weeks.  The waiting time for renewal FIS claims is currently 8-9 weeks.  At the end of November there were approximately 8,431 new FIS applications and approximately 5,136 renewal applications awaiting approval.The volume of FIS claims on hands and the delays in processing are a consequence of continued strong claim intake.The Department has introduced a number of measures to address the efficiency of claim processing for FIS in light of the current waiting times:Priority is given to renewal claims to preserve continuity of payment;Additional temporary staff have been recruited to help reduce the backlog;Existing processes and procedures are reviewed on an ongoing basis with the objective of reducing delays in claim processing;Overtime working is being applied where feasible.These measures are aimed at reducing the number of claims on hand and the average waiting time for a decision.As individual customer circumstances may change, renewal dates are not normally extended.  Where possible, cases of urgent need are prioritised for review and all customers who re-qualify for FIS are paid any arrears due with effect from their renewal date when their claim is re-awarded.The position is being closely monitored and kept under review by the Department.

This has significantly impacted on the processing time for appeals which require oral hearings and, in order to be fair to all appellants, they are dealt with in strict chronological order.  While every effort is being made to deal with the large numbers awaiting oral hearing as quickly as possible, it is not possible to give a date when the person's oral hearing will be heard, but s/he will be informed when arrangements have been made.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

On completion of the necessary investigations on all aspects of the claim a decision will be made and the person concerned will be notified directly of the outcome. The average time taken to process a claim to completion, including assessment of the claimant's means, medical condition and habitual residence status is approximately 17 weeks.This Department had earlier received a claim for invalidity pension from the person concerned. The medical evidence provided was examined by a medical assessor who found that the person concerned is not eligible for invalidity pension as he does not satisfy the medical criteria. The deciding officer accepted this opinion, the claim was disallowed and the person was notified of this decision on 10 November 2011.The person submitted further medical evidence in relation to his invalidity claim which was reviewed by a medical assessor but this did not alter the original decision.  The person has been notified of the result of the review.The person concerned is currently in receipt of supplementary welfare allowance.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	686	Eligibility to access employment schemes such as Community Employment or JobBridge require participants to be in receipt of a social welfare payment for a prescribed period of time.  This requirement exists as there is a significant cost to the State in the provision of these schemes.  In addition, it is important from an activation perspective that the link is maintained between employment schemes and individuals who are currently in receipt of a social welfare assistance payment.It should be noted that approximately 60% of individuals who first receive Jobseekers Allowance/Benefit actually sign off the Live Register within the first three months.  It is envisaged that reducing the eligibility period to access employment schemes will decrease the number of people who would have left the Live Register or other social welfare assistance payments and consequently result in increased costs to the Exchequer.  In essence if the eligibility to participate in an employment scheme was removed or amended this would significantly increase the deadweight costs to the State and may lead to those identified as in need of a place being displaced by others.  That is why I would not be in favour of allowing individuals retain their eligibility to participate in an employment scheme if they went abroad.

The review will commence in early 2012 and will encompass the issues raised.It should be noted that at present where a person is selling and the claw-back amount payable would reduce the proceeds of resale below the initial price actually paid, the legislation provides for the amount of the claw-back payable to be reduced to the extent necessary to avoid that outcome.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	706	Funding of €427 million is available under the Rural Development Programme (RDP) 2007-2013 for allocation to qualifying projects up to the end of 2013.  There are 35 Local Action Groups (LAGs) contracted, on my Department's behalf, to deliver the RDP throughout the country and these groups are the principal decision-makers in relation to the allocation of project funding.  Such decisions are made in the context of the local development strategy of the individual groups and in line with Departmental operating rules and EU regulations.Projects that request funding of €150,000 or more are required to seek final approval from my Department.  The project referred to in the question sought approval for a grant of €200,000.  The assessment of higher value projects (projects with a grant approval of €150,000 or more) usually involves detailed consultations between my Department and the relevant LAG.  It frequently necessitates the provision of further documentation or clarifications, as was the case for this project.  It may also, in some instances, result in modifications to the project proposed to ensure best value for money and compliance with all the necessary regulations, both national and European, governing the activities funded under the programme.  These assessments also consider whether the project as proposed addresses the needs of the local community in the best possible way.  A full and detailed assessment of all projects is vital.  The LEADER activities are co-financed by the European Union at a rate of 55% and, accordingly, come within the remit of a strict regulatory regime which requires that each project must be compliant before any funding is awarded by the LEADER companies.My Department will continue to work with the relevant LAG to make a full assessment of the eligibility of this project for grant aid of €200.000 and will inform the LAG once all queries have been addressed satisfactorily.

A planning authority or An Bord Pleanála will not associate the submission with any other application.While there is not a limit to the number of planning applications that may be submitted in relation to a particular site, section 37(5)(a) of the Planning and Development Act provides that no application for permission for the same development or for a development of the same description as an application which is the subject of an appeal may be made before the appeal is dealt with by the Board.If a subsequent application is made for a similar development on the same site it is of course open to anyone who made a submission on a previous application to make a submission on the subsequent application under the same conditions provided for by article 29 of the Regulations, including payment of the prescribed fee.

However, through the distribution of sandbags and the efforts of the fire service, civil defence and other services, local authorities provide as much practical assistance as possible to homeowners whose properties are at risk during flooding.Following the severe flooding on 24 October 2011, which particularly affected Dublin and parts of Meath, Monaghan and Wicklow, the Government established an inter-Departmental/Agency Working Group, which my Department is chairing, to oversee and to report to Government on any gaps that may exist within existing services, or on other services required, to address the consequences of the flooding on individuals, families and communities.  It is expected that the Group will report to Government in early 2012.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	714	Funding of €163,350 was provided from the Sustainable Communities Fund for the Community Warden Scheme in the Cranmore Estate, Sligo, over the period 2008-2010. An application was received from Sligo Borough Council in November 2010 seeking approval to use regeneration funding to support the Tenancy Support and Resettlement Programme, Community Wardens Scheme and the Youth Active Citizens Project.Following consideration of the request and having regard to the reduced funding available under the Sustainable Communities Fund, the beneficial impacts of these programmes in building community confidence in the regeneration project and fostering community involvement and tackling anti-social behaviour, it was decided to fund these projects from the regeneration budget. Approval to this effect issued in August 2011. So far this year €72,954 has been recouped to Sligo Borough Council in respect of the Community Wardens Project.My Department will review the continued funding arrangements for this project next year in the context of the Council's regeneration work programme for 2012.

The Programme for Government   provides for the introduction of a fair funding model to deliver clean and reliable water.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I propose to take Questions Nos. 229 and 230 together.The Sex Offenders Act 2001 contains a number of provisions aimed at reducing the risk to the public from convicted sex offenders. These include a notification system, also known as the "Sex Offenders' Register". A convicted sex offender is required to notify his name and home address to An Garda Síochána within 7 days of becoming subject to the notification requirement.  Thereafter, offenders must notify the Gardaí of any subsequent change of name or address within 7 days of such change. Absences from and return to the State are required to be notified and the legislation also applies to sex offenders convicted outside the State.Apart from the notification requirements in the 2001 Act, sex offenders released from prison can be subject to supervision and other restrictions. Part 5 of the Act introduced a system for the supervision of sex offenders after release from prison. Post Release Supervision Orders allow for court sanctioned supervision of offenders after custodial sentences have expired.The Act also provides a mechanism whereby the Gardaí can apply to the courts for a civil order, known as a Sex Offender Order, prohibiting a convicted sex offender from doing certain things, such as going to or being in a particular location, or loitering in the vicinity of a school or other place where children congregate.An added safeguard in the legislation provides that a convicted sex offender must advise his employer or any prospective employer of his conviction, if the work involves unsupervised access to or contact with children or mentally impaired persons.My Department has been conducting a wide-ranging examination of the law on sexual offences and a review of the Sex Offenders Act 2001 formed an integral part of that examination. Arising from the review, I expect to bring forward legislative proposals, including a number of amendments to the 2001 Act, in the coming months.In addition, my Department is preparing two new pieces of legislation to further enhance the protections afforded to children and vulnerable adults. These are the Criminal Justice (Withholding Information on Crimes against Children and Vulnerable Persons) Bill and the National Vetting Bureau Bill.The purpose of the "Withholding" Bill is to create an offence of failing to disclose, without reasonable excuse, information to the Gardaí where a serious criminal offence against a child or vulnerable person has been committed and the person knows or believes that the information s/he holds may be of material assistance in the arrest, prosecution or conviction of the offender.The "Vetting" Bill has two main objectives.  The first is to provide a statutory basis for the existing procedures where the Garda criminal records database is used to vet people applying for employment in the public service or those working with children or young adults.  The second is to provide for the use of "soft information" in vetting, i.e information other than a court determined criminal record, and disclosure of such information to prospective employers.I hope to publish both these Bills in the near future.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	718	The legal issues that bear on the case referred to by the Deputy are the subject of an appeal to the Supreme Court in another preceding case and, as they are sub-judice, I am constrained as to any comment I can make on the matter.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	720	Last month, I signed into law Statutory Instrument 569/11, which introduced an application fee of €175 for applications for a certificate of naturalisation.Managing and dealing with incomplete applications consumes scarce processing resources and the application fee is designed to recoup some of the costs associated with the application process.  The application fee is also intended to help cover costs associated with the processing of unsuccessful applications that often consume more processing time and resources than successful applications, but which heretofore attracted no fee.I might point out to the Deputy that the current certification fees, which have not changed since August 2008, do not recoup the full cost of processing.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	721	I refer the Deputy to my reply below to Parliamentary Question 168 of 17 November 2011,  Parliamentary Questions 161 and 174 of 24 November 2011 and Parliamentary Question 276 of 6 December 2011.  The position is unchanged since then.I am aware that there have been proposals of this nature and of course my Department will give due consideration to the issue.   However great caution should be exercised before embarking on such a project.  A proposal of this nature could give rise to very large, unpredictable and potentially very costly impacts across the full range of public and social services.At EU level,  the Member States, in agreeing the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008, made specific commitments "to use only case-by-case regularisation, rather than generalised regularisation, under national law, for humanitarian or economic reasons".   While the Pact is not legally binding, the political commitment among the Member States, then and now, is clearly against any form of process that would in any way legitimise the status of those unlawfully present without first examining the merits of their individual case.Any possible implication for the operation of the Common Travel Area would also have to be very carefully considered.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	725	The Question posed by the Deputy is very general and non-specific in nature.  I am not aware of any new positions that have been created. However, the number of new committees and  advisory groups that have been created are set out as follows:Expert Group on Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights.A new National Steering Committee on Violence against Men met for the first time on 14 December, 2011.Minister Lynch has established and is personally chairing the National Disability Strategy Implementation Group (NDSIG), which held its inaugural meeting on 30  November 2011. The NDSIG is not an additional group in the sense that it has replaced and will build on the achievements of the former National Disability Strategy Stakeholder Monitoring Group, which was in place under the previous administration.A Working Group on the establishment of the new, enhanced Human Rights and Equality Commission was appointed on 6 October 2011 to advise me on this extremely important matter. The Group will have a short timeframe for their work as it is intended to have a new Commission in place early in the New Year.On foot of the commitment in The Government Programme for National Recovery "to review the proposal to build a new prison at Thornton Hall and to consider alternatives, if any, to avoid the costs yet to be incurred by the State in building such a new prison”I set up a Review Group in April of this year to review the need for the Thornton Hall Prison Project. The Group reported to me on 8th   July.An  Inter-Departmental Committee which is independently chaired by Senator Martin McAleese, was set up to establish the facts of State involvement with the Magdalen Laundries, to clarify any State interaction, and to produce a narrative detailing such interaction.An ICT Governance Group has been established. This body is charged with the review and oversight of IT spending and direction in the Department and in some of the bodies under the aegis of the Department.  It has been established to obtain value for money and greater synergies and efficiencies  in the area. It is chaired by an Assistant Secretary in my Department.In the time available it has not been possible to obtain information on the above matter from the Garda Síochána. If additional information comes to light I will forward it to the Deputy.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	726	The number of committals for the past 3 years solely for non-payment of fines and civil debt is set out in the table. Figures are taken from the Annual Reports of the Irish Prison Service. In the case of 2011, these figures are provisional pending the publication of the 2011 Annual Report.YearCommittals for non — payment of finesCommittal for non — payment of civil debt2011 (up to 30/11/2011)6,9692920106,683520094,80616220082,520255I can advise the Deputy that the number of such persons held in custody at any one time is a minute fraction of the overall prisoner population. To illustrate this point 20 prisoners or 0.5% of the prison population on 30 November 2011 fell into this category. The Deputy may also wish to note that the Fines Act 2010 includes a number of provisions designed to minimise the level of fine default and where it does occur, to ensure, as far as possible, that fine defaulters are not committed to prison.  In particular, under Section 14 of the Act, the court must consider the financial circumstances of the person before the amount of the fine is determined.  There are also provisions in the Act, that I intend to commence in 2012, allowing for the payment of fines by instalments; the appointment of receivers to recover outstanding fines (or property to the value of those fines); and the substitution of community service orders for fines, where they remain unpaid after the receiver has completed his or her work.  I expect that these measures, taken together, will all but eliminate the need to commit persons to prison for non-payment of fines.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	728	I am advised by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person referred to by the Deputy was granted permission to remain in the State based on his parentage of an Irish born citizen child in 2000.  This permission  has been renewed on a number of occasions and is currently valid to 30 January 2012. The person concerned should attend the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) two weeks before the expiry date of his current permission to register and renew his permission.I should add that an application for a certificate of naturalisation from the individual referred to was received in the Citizenship Section of my Department in April 2008 and my predecessor decided in his absolute discretion to refuse the application. The person concerned was informed of that decision in a letter issued to him on 30 November 2010.   It is open to the person concerned to make a new application at any time.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.  This service enables up-to-date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	729	The persons concerned are failed asylum seekers. Their respective applications for Subsidiary Protection were considered and refused. Deportation Orders were made in respect of the persons concerned and these Orders were served by registered post which placed a legal obligation on them to leave the State.The persons concerned initiated judicial review proceedings in the High Court, challenging the decisions to refuse them Subsidiary Protection and to make Deportation Orders in respect of them. As these proceedings are ongoing, it would  not be appropriate for me to comment further on the cases of the persons concerned at this time.Given that the persons concerned have no current right of residency in the State, the issue of applications for citizenship do not arise at this time.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The person concerned had her status as a refugee revoked in March, 2010.  She was subsequently granted Permission to Remain in the State for the twelve month period to 4th February, 2012.  This position still obtains.An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to in the Deputy's Question was received in the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) in October 2007.Arising from the revocation of her status as a refugee, it was determined that the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. The person concerned was informed of this in a letter issued to her on 19 November, 2010.Section 15 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, grant an application for a certificate of naturalisation provided certain statutory conditions are fulfilled. The conditions are that the applicant must—be of full agebe of good characterhave had a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application and, during the eight years immediately preceding that period, have had a total residence in the State amounting to four yearshave, before a judge of the District Court in open court, in a citizenship ceremony or in such manner as the Minister, for special reasons, allows—(i) made a declaration, in the prescribed manner, of fidelity to the nation and loyalty to the State, and(ii) undertaken to faithfully observe the laws of the State and to respect its democratic values.In the context of naturalisation, certain periods of residence in the State are excluded. These include—periods of residence in respect of which an applicant does not have permission to remain in the Stateperiods granted for the purposes of studyperiods granted for the purposes of seeking recognition as a refugee within the meaning of the Refugee Act 1996.Section 16 of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, provides that the Minister may, in his absolute discretion, waive some or all of the statutory conditions in certain circumstances i.e. where an applicant is of Irish descent or of Irish associations; where an applicant is a person who is a refugee within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Refugees; or where an applicant is a Stateless person within the meaning of the United Nations Convention relating to the Status of Stateless persons.  A foreign national who is married to, or is the Civil Partner of, an Irish citizen for at least three years may apply for naturalisation under section 15A of the Irish Naturalisation and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended, where they have been continuously resident in the island of Ireland for the year immediately prior to the date of their application and for two out of the four years prior to that year.  The marriage or civil partnership must be subsisting and recognised under Irish law.It is open to any individual to lodge an application for citizenship if and when they are in a position to meet the statutory requirements as prescribed in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956 as amended.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The first named person concerned applied for asylum on 17 April 2007.  His application was refused following consideration of his case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeal Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), the person concerned was notified, by letter dated 9 February 2009, that the then Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of him.  He was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the then Minister setting out the reasons why he should not have a Deportation Order made against him. In addition, he was notified of his entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The person concerned submitted an application for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with these Regulations. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and his legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 17 July 2009. The case file of the person concerned, including all representations submitted, will soon be considered under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. Once a decision has been made, this decision and the consequences of the decision will be conveyed in writing to the person concerned.The second named person arrived in the State on 9 June 2006 and applied for asylum.  Her application was refused following consideration of her case by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, and on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Subsequently, in accordance with Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, the person concerned was informed, by letter dated 18 April 2007, that the Minister proposed to make a Deportation Order in respect of her.  The person concerned was given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why she should be allowed to remain temporarily in the State i.e. why she should not be deported.She was notified of her entitlement to apply for Subsidiary Protection pursuant to the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations, 2006. By correspondence dated 8 May 2007, an application for Subsidiary Protection was made on behalf of the person concerned by her legal representative. Following consideration of the information submitted, the application was refused. The person concerned and her legal representative were notified of this decision by letter dated 25 September 2008.Her case was then examined under Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999, as amended, and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996, as amended, on the Prohibition of Refoulement. Consideration was given to representations submitted on her behalf by her legal representative. On 12 November 2008, the then Minister for Justice made a Deportation Order in respect of the person concerned. Notice of the order was served by registered post requiring the person concerned to present at the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2 on Tuesday 2 December 2008 in order to make travel arrangements for her removal from the State.I am satisfied that the application made by the person concerned for Subsidiary Protection, as well as the representations made under Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) together with all refoulement issues, was fairly and comprehensively examined and, as such, the decision to deport is justified.The effect of the Deportation Order is that the person concerned must leave the State and remain thereafter out of the State. To date, the person concerned has not complied with the requirement in the Deportation Order to leave the State. The enforcement of the Deportation Orders is, and remains, an operational matter for the GNIB.

Their asylum applications were refused following the consideration of their individual cases by the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and, on appeal, by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.Arising from the refusal of their respective asylum applications, and in accordance with the provisions of Section 3 of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended), they were separately notified, he by letter dated 25th May, 2010 and she by letter dated 21st July, 2010 that the then Minister proposed to make Deportation Orders in respect of them.  They were each given the options, to be exercised within 15 working days, of leaving the State voluntarily, of consenting to the making of a Deportation Order or of making representations to the Minister setting out the reasons why a Deportation Order should not be made against them.  In addition, they were notified of their respective entitlements to apply for Subsidiary Protection in accordance with the provisions of the European Communities (Eligibility for Protection) Regulations 2006.The persons concerned submitted individual applications for Subsidiary Protection. When consideration of these applications has been completed, the persons concerned will be notified in writing of the outcomes.In the event that the applications for Subsidiary Protection are refused, the position in the State of the persons concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3(6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement.  All representations submitted will be considered before final decisions are made.

The application was refused on 9 February 2005 and Judicial Review proceedings were lodged challenging this decision. These proceedings were settled.  The person concerned subsequently made a second application for refugee status on 15 February 2006 which was refused at first instance and on appeal to the Refugee Appeals Tribunal. The decision to refuse by the Refugee Appeals Tribunal was made on 23 April 2009.The previous Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform informed the person concerned that it was proposed to make a Deportation Order in his case and he was invited to make representations as to why a Deportation Order should not issue. The person in question was also invited to make an application for Subsidiary Protection in the State. Following consideration of the representations made and the application for Subsidiary Protection a Deportation Order was signed on 10 June 2010. Judicial Review proceedings were subsequently lodged in the High Court challenging the Deportation Order and accordingly, as the matter is sub judice, I do not propose to comment further.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The permission has been renewed on a regular basis and is currently valid until 22 April, 2012.An application for a certificate of naturalisation from the person referred to was received in the Citizenship Division of INIS in June 2006. On examination of the application submitted, it was determined that the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.

Contact was made on behalf of the person concerned by a family member who was advised by a Visa Official that the only option available in such circumstances was that a fresh visa application be made, whilst outside of the State.A visa application for the person concerned was received in the Visa Office, Dublin on the 14 November 2011.  Given the circumstances the application was dealt with in an expeditious manner.  A Visa Officer considered the application and refused the granting of the visa sought on the 15 November 2011 for the following reasons:1. There was insufficient documentation submitted in support of the application.  The Visa Officer noted that a detailed explanation was not provided as to why the person concerned travelled outside the State without a valid Garda registration card or a re-entry visa;2. There was an inconsistency noted in that the recently issued passport submitted by the Applicant had not been signed.As is the case with all refused visa applications, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision were sent by way of letter to the applicant.  In addition, and in common with all visa applications refused in Dublin, the refusal decision and the reasons for that decision were posted promptly on-line (in a format confidential to the applicant).  It is open to the person concerned to submit an appeal within two months of the date of refusal, in this case before the 15 January 2012.  Guidelines on the visa appeals process is available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (www.inis.gov.ie).Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The person concerned was granted permission to remain in the State on the basis of family dependency by INIS on 21 December, 2004, and this permission has expired on 15 September, 2011. I am informed that the person concerned attended the Garda National Immigration Bureau (GNIB) to have his permission to remain renewed recently. However, given that he provided conflicting details regarding  his current residence, I would advise him to write to INIS c/o PO Box 10003, Dublin 1 to seek renewal of his permission to remain (including proof of his current address). Upon receipt of the appropriate documentation, his case will be examined by the relevant officials in INIS and a decision communicated to him in due course.I am informed that no application for a certification of naturalisation has been received from the person concerned in the Citizenship Division of my Department to date.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to the INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

I refer the Deputy to my reply to Parliamentary Question No. 272 of Tuesday, 6th December, 2011 — set out as follows. The position is unchanged since then.In the event that the application for Family Reunification has a favourable outcome then the case of the person concerned will require no further consideration. However, in the event that the application for Family Reunification is refused, the position in the State of the person concerned will then be decided by reference to the provisions of Section 3 (6) of the Immigration Act 1999 (as amended) and Section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996 (as amended) on the prohibition of refoulement. All representations submitted will be considered before a final decision is made.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	741	I am informed by the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that the person concerned had a recent application for an Irish temporary travel document refused. She was advised to contact her own consular authorities to establish the procedures to be followed which would allow for her to procure a national passport whilst resident in this State. She currently has permission to remain in the State until 21 April, 2012.In exceptional cases an application for an Irish temporary travel document may be considered in respect of qualifying non Irish nationals who are resident in Ireland.  In all such cases, the INIS must be satisfied that there is no alternative open to the applicant before an Irish temporary travel document will issue.  The person concerned has to show that they have made reasonable and formal efforts to obtain a national passport, that it has been formally and unreasonably refused and that their own consular authorities are unable to offer consular assistance to them whilst resident in the State.It is open to the person in question to submit a new application for a temporary travel document accompanied by the relevant supporting documentation to the Travel Document Unit of the INIS which is located at 13-14 Burgh Quay, Dublin 2. Full information in this regard and the applicable application form is available at www.inis.gov.ie.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose. This service enables up to date information on such cases to be obtained without the need to seek information by way of the Parliamentary Questions process. The Deputy may consider using the e-mail service except in cases where the response from INIS is, in the Deputy's view, inadequate or too long awaited.

In circumstances where the person concerned is visa required, it is open to that national to apply for a visa for any purpose.  Each visa application is considered on its individual merits, the onus resting with the Applicant to satisfy the Visa Officer as to why the visa sought should be granted.  Guidelines on the visa application process are available on the website of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, www.inis.gov.ie.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	743	I am advised by the Citizenship Division of the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service (INIS) that an application for a certificate of naturalisation was received from the person referred to by the Deputy in July 2007.The application is being processed with a view to establishing whether the applicant meets the statutory conditions for the granting of naturalisation and will be submitted to me for decision as expeditiously as possible.  The nature of the naturalisation process is such that for a broad range of reasons some cases will take longer than others to process.  It is not possible to provide a specific date for determination of an individual application.  However, I can inform the Deputy that good progress is being made in reducing the time taken to process the generality of applications and it is my objective that by the spring of next year, save in exceptional circumstances, a person applying for citizenship will be given a decision on their application within six months.It is open to applicants for a certificate of naturalisation to submit whatever additional documentation they wish in support of their application.  Any such documentation will be considered.  However, it is important to reiterate that all applications are being dealt with as expeditiously as possible.The granting of Irish citizenship through naturalisation is a privilege and an honour which confers certain rights and entitlements not only within the State but also at European Union level.  It is important that appropriate procedures are in place to preserve the integrity of the process.Queries in relation to the status of individual immigration cases may be made directly to INIS by e-mail using the Oireachtas Mail facility which has been specifically established for this purpose.

The Act provides that the service is independent in the performance of its functions, including the maintenance and provision of courthouse facilities.In order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I have had inquiries made and the Courts Service has informed me that  between 2008 and 2010 a total of €232,616.09 was spent on architectural, engineering and quantity surveying services appointed by the Office of Public Works relating to preparatory work carried out between 2008 and 2009 for the proposed refurbishment of Ballinamore courthouse.  However, given that work resulted in an estimated refurbishment cost of €2.5 million and in the context of reduced capital funding allocations, I am informed that the Courts Service decided in November 2009 not to proceed with the project.  I am informed that no further funding was allocated and no moneys remain unspent and this remains the position in light of the current economic circumstances.  It is regrettable that this expenditure did not lead on to a refurbishment but the Deputy will appreciate that quite extensive preliminary work is essential in preparing for capital projects.The Courts Service Board subsequently decided in 2010 to amalgamate the District Court Area of Ballinamore with Carrick-on-Shannon and therefore the court no longer sits in Ballinamore.  I should add that a new courthouse was provided in Carrick-on-Shannon in 1998 at a cost of €1.98 million.

The level of resourcing available for Defence has reduced significantly over recent years.  The funds available for paid training days for members of the Reserve have been cut from €4.96 million in 2009 to €2.48 million in 2011.This provided for approximately 30,000 paid training man-days in 2011.  These paid training days provided targeted development training for existing members of the Reserve including career courses and skills courses.  In addition, it was possible to provide for the training of 200 new recruits to the RDF.  This level of recruitment was agreed in consultation with the Military Authorities, having regard to the requirement to maintain the existing capabilities of the Reserve to the greatest extent possible.The number of personnel that may be recruited in the coming year or future years has not been determined as yet.

These entitlements were reverted to the National Reserve on 2 February 2011.EU Regulations governing the Single Payment Scheme provide that entitlements must be used at least once in each two year period. ‘Used' in this context means that in any one of these years a hectare of eligible land must be declared in respect of each entitlement held. The Regulations further provide that any entitlements that remain unused over the two year period revert to the National Reserve and are thereby lost to the farmer.A letter issued to the person named on the 22 February 2011 explaining that her 6.01 expired entitlements had been reverted to the National Reserve due to non-usage and invited her to put forward any extenuating circumstances that might be relevant to her case.

This application was selected for a Ground Eligibility/Cross Compliance inspection. During the Cross Compliance inspection discrepancies were recorded in relation to Bovine Identification and Registration concerning Bovine Passports and a failure to notify movements to the Cattle Movement and Monitoring System. These discrepancies resulted in a 1% Cross Compliance penalty being recorded for 2011. During the course of the Ground Eligibility inspection discrepancies were found which resulted in the claimed area for the Single Payment Scheme of 10.26ha being reduced to a payable area of 10.15ha.The person named was advised of this outcome on 27 October and a Final Notice will issue shortly detailing the reductions in area. He was also advised of his right to seek a review of this decision and to have the outcome of any such review appealed to the Independent Agriculture Appeals Office. This inspection is now complete and the results have been fully processed. A 50% advance payment under the Single Payment Scheme issued on 24 November with the balance of the payment issuing on 1 December. Full payment under the Disadvantaged Area Scheme issued on 7 December.
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	763	The Disadvantaged Areas Schemes seeks to compensate over 100,000 Irish farm families, whose ability to farm is restricted due to the poor quality of their land.  Over seventy five percent of Ireland's total agricultural area is designated as disadvantaged and in order to encourage sustainable use of this land, and protect against land abandonment, thereby maintaining the countryside, the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme was introduced.   As part of the recent budgetary process, I decided that there while there will be no changes in either the rates or the eligible areas qualifying for a disadvantaged area payment, that expenditure would be reduced by some €30 million in 2012.This lower financial limit will be achieved by the introduction of targeted reform in the Disadvantaged Areas Payments, which will be achieved through reform of the stocking density, retentions period and other elements of the scheme. The changes being introduced will favour active farmers, whose holdings are exclusively in Disadvantaged Areas and are subject to clearance by the European Commission.The main changes to the Disadvantaged Areas Scheme are:The minimum stocking density for 2011 must be 0.30 livestock units per hectare or greater and for 2012 must be 0.15 livestock units per hectare or greater. For official purposes a lamb becomes a sheep at 12 months.The minimum retention period has been increased from 3 months to 6 months and will be calculated over 12 months.There will be a reduced rate of aid where applicants hold both Disadvantage and non-Disadvantaged Lands.Exclusion of horses from the stocking density calculation. Remaining qualifying animals include cattle, sheep, deer and goatsAn exclusion of land more that 80 kilometres from a farmer's main holding where that is situated in a non-Disadvantaged Area.

The person named was approved for participation in the Agri-Environment Options Scheme with effect from 1 September 2010.Under the EU Regulations governing the Scheme and other area-based payment schemes, a comprehensive administrative check, including cross-checks with the Land Parcel Identification System, had to be completed before any payment could issue. The chosen AEOS actions of the person named are Wild Bird Cover and Tree Planting Whips, payment for which is due for 2011 onwards. The application of the person named was randomly selected for an on farm inspection and my Department is now finalising the examination of this case with a view to resolving all outstanding issues as quickly as possible.

Controls relating to the use of sewage sludge from local authority treatment plants where applied to agriculture land form part of these cross compliance requirements.My Department in implementing the provisions of the Single Payment Scheme is not responsible for checking the functioning of domestic septic tanks.  The inspection and control of domestic septic tanks is not part of the regime governing the operation of the Single Payment Scheme.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	774	I propose to take Questions Nos. 289 and 290 together.The Health Service Executive has a statutory responsibility under the Child Care Act, 1991 for child protection and welfare matters. It carries out this remit through its Children and Family Services directorate, under Mr. Gordon data National Director. The HSE has a national and regional structure in place, with services provided across a range of professional disciplines.The key guidance document in respect of child welfare and protection is Children First, which was first introduced in 1999. I launched the revised Children First National Guidance In July, 2011. The Guidance is designed to assist in identifying and reporting child abuse. It specifically highlights the roles and responsibilities of the HSE and An Garda Síochána, as the two agencies with statutory responsibility for child protection, and forms an integral part of their existing operations and practice. The Guidance is also intended to assist organisations in ensuring that children under their care are safe, that staff/volunteers can identify possible abuse within the organisation or elsewhere and that there is in place the appropriate structure for reporting to relevant statutory bodies.In addition, the HSE published a Child Welfare and Protection Practice Handbook for all its staff in order to achieve better consistency and compliance with Children First. The HSE has in place a network of personnel to provide training, information and advice on the implementation of Children First. It is currently delivering a programme of information and training on the new Guidance across the country.My Department is finalising legislative proposals to make compliance with the Children First Guidance a statutory obligation. The legislation will reflect a broad based approach to compliance with obligations extending beyond reporting to one of safeguarding children at risk and the objective will be to ensure the greater protection of children by strengthening the existing system for reporting and responding to suspected child abuse.In addition to the existing structures in place to support Children First, significant additional resources have been provided to the HSE over the past two years to increase the number of social workers in the child welfare and protection area. The number of social workers increased in 2010 by over 200 and the necessary funding has been provided to the HSE to complete the recruitment of an additional 60 social workers by year end.  The recruitment of these additional social workers was included in the Ryan Report Implementation Plan.  This additional resource will be of particular assistance to the HSE in driving forward the process of implementation of Children First.The social work positions will be targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to an overall assessment of workload undertaken by the National Director and his team.  The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider reform agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families. This reform agenda will lead to the establishment of a new Child and Family Support Agency which will provide a dedicated focus on child protection and will support families in need.It should also be emphasised that the grade of social worker is currently exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and filling of vacancies. The HSE is therefore free to fill social worker vacancies as they arise and within available resources.It must be pointed out that necessary and appropriate social services cannot be provided in the absence of knowledge about need. We must recognise that child abuse takes many forms and occurs in many settings, including the home. In this context there is a wider societal duty to report suspected child abuse. Anyone with child abuse concerns or information should not hesitate to come forward and assist the HSE and An Garda Síochána in their respective roles in carrying out their work to protect children.An Garda Síochána have powers under the Child Care Act 1991 to take children at risk to a place of safety. They also have extensive investigatory powers. I am working closely with my colleague the Minister for Justice, Equality and Defence on a range of legislative measures designed to both strengthen child protection and ensure that those brought before the courts on abuse charges are subject to the full rigour of the law.The Government is progressing a range of measures which will serve to significantly strengthen the existing legislative, policy and practice framework in the area of child protection. The intention is to ensure that child abuse in Ireland, whether within or outside the family, is strongly and decisively tackled, and that children are properly safeguarded. The various enhancements under way, coupled with the establishment of a dedicated Child and Family Support Agency, will be of considerable help in achieving this objective.

These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Fund and certain other provisions including the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, European Youth in Action Programme (administered by Léargas — The Exchange Bureau) and Gaisce — the President's Award.As Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, I am committed to placing children, young people and families at the heart of the work of my Department.  In this regard, my Department supports the provision of a wide range of services and supports for children, young people and families. To further enhance this work, a new children's strategy and youth policy framework are currently being progressed by my Department; these will place outcomes for children and young people at the centre of policy and service delivery and will aim to support children and young people to an even greater extent as they progress through important life stages.One of my key aims for policy development within my Department will be to ensure optimum use of all the financial and human resources available. Accordingly, the development of my Department's policies in relation to children and young people will focus specifically on ensuring greater coherence, coordination and impact in policy and provision so as to ensure quality outcomes for all.
#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	776	The Government is committed to a series of measures designed to significantly strengthen the existing legislative, policy and practice framework in the area of child protection. The intention is to ensure that child abuse in Ireland is strongly and decisively tackled and that children are properly safeguarded. A number of significant structural and legislative changes are being progressed in this context.  These include the establishment of a new agency with dedicated responsibility for the delivery of child welfare and protection services, separate from the HSE and reporting directly to my Department. Work on the establishment of the agency is under way and includes the preparation of primary legislation to provide for its establishment.  I believe the establishment of the Child and Family Support Agency in 2013 and associated reforms will represent a decisive shift towards achieving nationally consistent standards across all child protection services including better development of available resources in line with identified need.The HSE compiles a monthly census of employment in the public health and social care sector; the latest data available are in respect of October 2011. These show that the total number of social workers employed in the HSE and in directly funded agencies across all care groups at that time was 2,416 whole time equivalents (WTEs). The number of social workers has increased from 2,189 at the end of 2009.The employment census also provides a breakdown of staffing levels by care group. In the case of social workers employed in the Children and Families area. The figures indicate that there were  1,207 WTEs employed at the end of October 2011. It should be noted that the classification by care group is viewed by the HSE and the Department as provisional and is subject to ongoing revision/refinement as part of the process of disaggregating the children and families resource base from the HSE prior to the establishment of the new Children and Family Support Agency.The policy goal, in line with the Implementation Plan, published in 2009 in response to the Report of the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse (Ryan Report), is to achieve an overall increase of 270 social workers.  In this context, it should be noted that the HSE has made provision for the recruitment of additional social workers this year, to build on the recruitment of over 200 additional social workers in 2010. The recruitment process is being managed by the HSE National Recruitment Service (NRS).  The latest available information from the HSE indicates that 53 posts have been either filled or accepted, while a further 5 posts are being offered to candidates this week. An additional  4 posts are due to be filled by individuals returning from career break. The HSE is attaching a high priority to the completion of the recruitment process by the end of the year. My Department will continue to closely monitor the position with regard to the recruitment of the additional personnel.The additional social workers will be targeted at priority areas of the service having regard to an overall assessment of workload undertaken by the National Director and his team.  The recruitment of the additional social workers is one element of a wider change agenda within the HSE, through which I believe we can deliver better outcomes for children and families.It should also be emphasised that the grade of social worker is currently exempt from the moratorium on recruitment and filling of vacancies. The HSE is therefore free to fill social worker vacancies as they arise and within available resources.

#FrancesFitzgerald	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-party	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#FrancesFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	779	Tackling poverty, social and economic derivation and exclusion is a priority for Government and a goal of the National Action Plan for Social Inclusion 2007-2016, coordinated by the Department of Social Protection.That Department is working closely with the Departments of Enterprise, Jobs and Innovation and Education and Skills to deliver a range of measures aimed at getting people back to work.My Department has direct responsibility for a number of programmes which play an important role in improving outcomes for children and families. Early childhood care and education programmes, in particular those aimed at low income families, are important priorities for my Department, to enhance children's opportunities for social and education development and to support parents.Over €160 million will be spent in 2011 on the free Pre-School Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) programme.A further €76 million will be spent on the Community Childcare Subvention (CCS) programme and the Childcare Education and Training Support (CETS) programme, both of which assist low income parents with the costs of childcare.My Department also oversees grant funding, amounting to some €60 million in 2011, for a range of programmes and supports for young people. These include the Youth Service Grant Scheme, the Special Projects for Youth Scheme, the Young Peoples Facilities and Services Funds, the Local Youth Club Grant Scheme, Youth Information Centres, the European Youth in Action Programme and Gaisce — the President's Award. The programmes and services are delivered by some 1,100 staff and a volunteer base of over 60,000 and are availed of by some 400,000 children and young people. The Department of Children and Youth Affairs also has an important role in addressing educational disadvantage. The National Education Welfare Board (NEWB) operates under the aegis of the Department and is responsible for the Education Welfare Service (EWS), the School Completion Programme (SCP) and the Home School Community Liaison (HSCL) programmes, all of which are major components of the DEIS initiative. This integrated support service draws on the skills, expertise and knowledge of the three services which includes 408 HSCL Coordinators, 254 SCP project workers and 93 EWS staff, to deliver better outcomes for children, families, and schools. The SCP, which has a funding allocation this year of over €30 million, supports 124 projects and related initiatives linked to 472 primary and 225 post-primary schools and supports some 38,000 children and young people at risk of early school leaving.The Family Support Agency has also been brought under the aegis of my Department and funds a network of 107 Family Resources Centres to provide a range of support services for families living in disadvantaged communities. Finally, one of the key developments and priority areas for my Department, will be the establishment of the new Child and Family Support Agency. An expert Task Force has been established to plan and oversee the arrangements for the Agency which I hope to see established in 2013. I believe the new cohesive structures which are envisaged for the future delivery of services, for children and families, will be a very important development and will result in improved effectiveness of the delivery of services and the provision of supports, in particular to children from vulnerable families.

The HSE is facing challenges in respect of all services in 2012, and in the case of Community Nursing Units these include challenges regarding staffing, funding and the age/structure of the units.  In this context the Department and HSE are working together regarding the 2012 National Service Plan.  Should there be concern for the future of any unit, the HSE will engage fully in a local consultation process with all stakeholders before any decision is taken.Furthermore under the provisions of regulations under the Health Act, 2007, the HSE must provide the Health Information and Quality Authority with 6 months notice of the Unit closure.  I would like to reassure the Deputy that in the case of closure of a Community Nursing Unit, every effort will be made to ensure that the transition process will be managed professionally for the residents with a view to minimising disruption and to ensure that they can be accommodated elsewhere in line with their wishes.  In addition, no resident will be placed at a financial disadvantage from any closure.
#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	785	The Gross Current Vote for my Department in 2011 is €331.610m, of which €241.552m was spent to the end of November, leaving €90m unspent at that date.  The current projection is that there will be a surplus of at least €40m on the Vote in the current year which will be surrendered to the Exchequer, and will contribute towards the cost of the Supplementary Estimate approved for the Health Service Executive on 7th December.This surplus can be attributed to a number of factors:Hepatitis C Compensation SubheadsSubhead D, Inquiries and Miscellaneous Legal Fees and SettlementsThere is a projected surplus of some €4-5m on this subhead this year.  Subhead D provides for statutory and non-statutory enquiries and miscellaneous legal fees and settlements. Given the fluctuating nature of legal cases and settlements, the Department cannot be certain when a case may settle, and any unspent funds at the end of the year are surrendered to the Exchequer. To date in 2011, there have been a number of large payments made (€2.6m and €3.7m), with a total of €14m spent from the subhead to date, almost all of which relate to clinical negligence claims. Legal cases can run for some years, and acceptance of a settlement can be required at short notice.  Demands on the subhead are determined by the number of legal cases in process at any given time, but given the uncertain nature of legal cases there is a need for some flexibility with this subhead.Administrative BudgetThe Administrative Budget is projected to be €4m in surplus in 2011. €1m of this relates to a provision made in Subhead A.7 in relation to a proposed consultancy in relation to VHI.  A further €1.5m approximately is on other non-pay subheads, such as training, cleaning, office machinery and supplies etc.  The remainder of the surplus is attributable to the non filling of vacancies as a result of the moratorium on recruitment, and reduced levels of overtime.Grants to Health AgenciesIt is anticipated that there will be savings of approximately some €11m in relation to Grants to Health Agencies.  The main agencies showing surpluses are the Health Research Board and the Health Information and Quality Authority, with small surpluses on some of the other directly funded agencies.There is also a projected underspend of €6.2m on the Gross Capital Vote of €16.091m, €1.5m of which was approved for a Capital carryover into 2012.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	794	To streamline the processing of medical cards the HSE implemented its decision to centralise the processing of all new applications and renewals of medical cards at the Primary Care Reimbursement Service (PCRS) in Dublin from the 1st of July this year.After the centralisation of the service PCRS reported that they were receiving approximately 20,000 applications a week.  PCRS estimate that 80% of complete applications are processed within 15 working days.In June of this year PCRS circulated an information bulletin to all Oireachtas members.  As part of the bulletin members were provided with details of how information on medical cards could be obtained outside of the PQ process.  The information provided included: PCRS contact names; a dedicated phone number; a dedicated fax number; and a dedicated email address; and details on how to access information through the online enquiry form www.medicalcard.ie.Providing the above service does not lessen the HSEs requirement to respond in a timely manner to Parliamentary Questions.  The Executive is very aware of its obligations in this regard and attempts to answer all questions referred to it as quickly as possible.  There is regular liaison between my Department and the HSE on this matter.If the Deputy has queries in respect of specific Parliamentary Questions on medical cards I would ask that he provide me with the details and I will follow it up with the HSE.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	795	The transfer of patients referred to by the Deputy is in respect of 5 patients moving from an open unit to a low secure ward; the transfers are taking place following appropriate clinical assessment.  However, it is I believe highly regrettable that it is necessary to amalgamate the two units in question over the Christmas period, and I completely understand the distress caused by the decision.  It is clear, given the current shortage of psychiatric nursing staff in Dublin North West Mental Health Services, that the HSE has been left with no option but to devise a contingency arrangement so as to ensure both patient safety and continuity of services.  However, I have been assured that this is purely a temporary measure and Unit 3B will reopen on the 16th January next, if not earlier.I have concerns that because of the mature age profile of its staff, the moratorium on recruitment has impacted disproportionately on the mental health service.  This is an issue that is already the subject of discussions between officials of my Department and the HSE, and I intend to pursue this matter further to achieve an appropriate result in order to ensure the quality and safety of our mental health services into the future.

Charges are not payable in respect of items supplied under the Long Term Illness Scheme. Prescription charges do not apply to children in the care of the HSE or to methadone supplied to patients participating in the Methadone Treatment Scheme.Prescription charges result in savings to the Health Service Executive of approximately €27 million annually.  Despite the very difficult budgetary situation, the Government has ruled out an increase in prescription charges.

Details of the total amount of fees and allowances paid to GPs under the GMS Scheme in 2011 will not be available to my Department until 2012.In 2010, GPs were paid approximately €436 million in fees and allowances under the GMS Scheme.  This compares with approximately €441 million in 2009.  It should also be noted that the number of persons with a medical card or a GP visit card has greatly increased in recent years.  Since the start of 2010, the number of medical card holders has increased by 216,098 to a total of 1,694,658 as at 1st November 2011.  In the same period, the number of GP visit card holders increased by over 29,000 to 127,538.Under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (FEMPI) Act 2009, an 8% reduction in a range of GP fees and allowances was introduced in 2009, which effected full year savings in the region of €34 million.  Further reductions to a range of fees and allowances were introduced in 2010, which are expected to result in full year savings in the region of €44 million in 2011.  Under FEMPI legislation, the Minister for Health is required to carry out a review of the operation, effectiveness and impact of the amounts and rates fixed under regulations each year.  The 2011 review is currently being undertaken and the Minister for Health will shortly determine if any further changes to GP fees and allowances are required at this time.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	812	The following table shows the wholetime equivalent number of staff by grade category employed in the health sector from the end of 2004 to October 2011. As the table shows, the Management/Administration, and total employment across all grades, was at its highest at December 2007. Since then, management/administration has reduced by almost 2,000, or 11%. This compares to a reduction in numbers of 6.7% for the total health sector. This reduction has been achieved through the policy of not replacing Management/Administration staff who retire, and the Voluntary Redundancy and Voluntary Early Retirement schemes at the end of 2010, which were targeted at Management/Administration and General Support grades in the health sector.At December 2004, just before the establishment of the HSE, management/administration comprised 16.4% of health sector employment.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	814	It is difficult to predict with certainty the likely impact of any reduction in the uptake of private health insurance (PHI) on the demand for public hospital services.  Much depends on the numbers of people who reduce the level of cover offered by their PHI plans, and on the numbers who might stop purchasing PHI altogether.There is no doubt that public hospital services will face an extremely challenging year.  The current economic environment and the need to reduce public expenditure on health services will make difficult for hospitals to meet all of the needs of patients.  However, the decision to raise more funding through additional charges for private care in public hospitals offers some assistance in this regard.  The income from private charges will help reduce the extent to which services for public patients would otherwise be negatively affected.I am committed to ensuring the best possible service to public patients in our acute hospitals.  While the year ahead will be difficult, I believe that a well managed system will lead to most effective service for all patients.  The work of the SDU will be important in this regard.The SDU was established in June with the key aim of unblocking access to acute services by improving patient journeys through the system. The SDU is working closely with the HSE, building on existing initiatives, including the Clinical Care Programmes.As a priority the SDU is working with the HSE to put in place a systematic approach to eliminate excessive waiting in emergency departments.  On scheduled care the priority is to address waiting times for in-patient and daycase treatment.  The NTPF in partnership with the SDU are currently working with hospitals to ensure that by the end of 2011 no one will be waiting longer than 12 months for inpatient and day case treatment.The SDU is establishing an infrastructure based on information collection and analysis, hospital by hospital, so that we will know what is actually happening in real time. This will allow us to begin to embed performance management in the system, to build capacity and capability, to create and sustain improvements and to lay the foundations for a new accountability framework.The work of the SDU, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals and ensure that, within the level of resources available, the maximum number of patients are treated.DateVHIQuinnAvivaRMUsTotal% PopulationSep-081,539,248490,378162,48988,5932,280,70851.50%Sep-091,441,853507,018227,23688,8672,264.9750.80%Sep-101,377,031476,768284,84388,1192,226,76149.50%Sep-111,246,105458,061382,29086,9622,173,41847.40%

Consequently, patients may need to travel for treatment.  There are a number of systems of support in place for these patients including the HSE-NCCP's Travel2Care scheme.  The HSE is also currently reviewing its policy in relation to eligibility for non-ambulance based transport services in order to ensure that a consistent policy is adopted nationally for these services.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2011-12-15 00:00:00	Prelude	818	There are some 13,000 acute hospital beds, including some 1,800 day beds, in the Irish public acute hospital system.  The exact number available for use at any one time varies according to a number of factors, including planned levels of activity, refurbishment and infection control.  Beds are also closed to control expenditure because, like all other public agencies, hospitals have to operate within budget.The criteria for counting bed closures and methods vary between hospitals.  Instead of having a debate about the exact number of beds that are judged to be open or closed at any one time, I believe we must concentrate on getting the best possible services for patients from the budgets available to us.  This means we need to focus on how beds are used, on the throughput of patients, on reducing length of stay to international norms and on having as many procedures as possible carried out as day cases rather than inpatient work.The work of the SDU, together with implementation of the Clinical Care Programmes in the HSE, will help to improve the efficiency of our hospitals, allowing us to treat as many patients as possible within budget.  I believe that pursuing efficiencies through these means will be a far more productive approach than debating the number of beds open or closed at any one time.The emphasis for the HSE in 2012 will continue to be to make the most effective use of acute bed capacity through shorter length of stay, increased rates of day-of-surgery admission and more day surgery.  In this way the acute hospital system can ensure that, within the level of resources available, it facilitates the maximum number of patients with safe, effective and efficient care.

The criteria under which these organisations process applications for permits are set out broadly in legislation and in more detail through Terms and Conditions for the Disabled Parking Scheme agreed between these organisations and my Department.  The processing of individual applications within these criteria is a matter for the IWA and the DDAI.  My Department has no role in the processing of such applications.  The IWA and the DDAI are not State Agencies, and as such do not come under the governance of my Department.However, as part of the Terms and Conditions of the Scheme, both organisations have an appeals process in place for people whose applications for a Permit have been refused.  In the case to which the Deputy refers, I would advise the applicant to avail of the appeals process provided by the IWA.

Works on such roads are a matter for the relevant local authority to be funded from its own resources supplemented by State road grants.My Department does not set aside funding in its budget to cover expenditure resulting from severe weather.  Instead, local authorities are provided with flexibility, where possible, to amend their Specific Improvement Grants Programme or their Restoration Improvement Programme to accommodate remedial works.  As you will be aware, the initial selection and prioritisation of projects to be funded from these State grants is a matter for each local authority, and it is open to local authorities to prioritise these works and revise their applications should they wish to do so.The 2011 regional and local road grant allocations have now been allocated and there are no further funds available at this time from which an additional allocation could be made.
