In a fitting description, Monica was once described as the woman who saved the conscience of Fine Gael. In her championing of women's rights and in the care and compassion she showed for people in difficult situations, she inspired many people around the country. She was a particular inspiration for young women and young men in my party and beyond. When Monica was first elected to Dáil Éireann in November 1982 she was one of only 14 women Deputies, and at the time that was a record number. Her courageous example helped to change that for the better, and encouraged many others to enter politics. Over the following 15 years, Monica served the people of Dún Laoghaire with great ability, and spoke for people across the country who had been marginalised and excluded. At a time when it was easier to stay silent, she always spoke her mind and was a fearless campaigner for change. I think a profile in The
Irish Times once captured her best with a headline that read "Propelled by principle". Monica's principles helped to propel this country to a better place. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a hanam dílis.

Is léir gur pholaiteoir den chéad scoth í a bhí dílis dá muintir agus do mhuintir na tíre seo go ginearálta. Bhí dea-thionchar aici ar pholasaithe éagsúla agus chuir sí carn na bpolasaithe sin i bhfeidhm. I want to sympathise on my own behalf and on behalf of my party with Monica's family, her husband Bob and daughters Sarah and Joanne, her extended family and friends. She was a very warm and sociable person who easily crossed the partisan party-political divide in this House. She had many friends across that political divide. She is an enormous loss to Irish politics and of course a huge loss to the Fine Gael Party. She was courageous, she was outspoken, she was kind and she was considerate. She was a progressive voice at a time when that was not always welcome. She in many respects was ahead of her time, thought outside the box, and always spoke her mind. I admired her warmth, her passion and her commitment to the causes that she cared so deeply about. We hope that her family will draw some consolation from the rich legacy she has left the political world and the world in general. She was close to her community and she was one of the outstanding members of this House down through the generations. We were very saddened to hear of her loss last week. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis.

She was one of the political women I used to look at as a child with some considerable admiration. The Taoiseach will forgive me for saying the following, which I want to put in the right way. She did not really come across like a Fine Gaeler, at least not to me. I mean that as the highest compliment to her, not that some of the Members opposite are not also lovely. She was a committed feminist in every respect, a woman's woman and a courageous voice. Is it not something that just weeks before we go to the polls hoping to remove the eighth amendment, we recall that she was one of very few who stood against it when it was first proposed? She was one of the few who had the foresight, compassion and vision for women to take a very courageous stance at the time. I never met Monica Barnes and I am sorry that I did not know her. She represents a huge loss to her family. She had a considerable political career at a time when women were even rarer than we are now in the places of legislation and decision-making. Ireland and the world more generally are better for having had her and I am sure her family and friends are bereft at her loss. I am happy on my behalf and on behalf of Sinn Féin to pay our respects to her memory and to offer our condolences on the death of a very great woman.

We often give people titles, but "champion of women's rights" is one she earned absolutely by her deeds and actions. I worked with Monica on many campaigns and had the pleasure on one occasion to travel abroad with her and Máire Geoghegan-Quinn, a formidable pair of women. It was an enlightening experience for me. Monica was, of course, on the social democratic wing of Fine Gael and there was a time when that was an important force behind Fine Gael policy. It was shaping and forming Ireland at the time. I remember the period of the debate on the eighth amendment and how strong Monica was on that. I remember holding a joint meeting with Monica on another social issue in Dublin on a Saturday. I was very concerned about leaving Wexford on a Saturday and missing my clinics. I noted how terrible it was that we were missing out on our clinics. She said "Clinics on a Saturday? I meet my constituents for coffee on a Tuesday". I told her it was a very civilised way of doing politics. Everything about Monica was civilised. She had deep compassion and when she dealt with social injustices she felt them in her heart and one knew that. She made that crystal clear to all. She will be deeply missed, most of all by her family, friends and colleagues in Fine Gael, but also by all of us who were blessed to know her.

She had a vibrant political career. I do not know what age Deputy McDonald is but I must be a bit older as I remember many robust debates on radio, television and at a number Ard-Fheiseanna when I belonged to a different organisation and used to attend those.We heard on many radio programmes over the weekend, especially from Gemma Hussey and others, about Monica's activities during those heaves and debates within Fine Gael and about her spontaneous and gregarious engagement with former taoisigh and senior members of Fine Gael. I would like to have been a fly on the wall for that. She had a very distinguished political career and we thank her for her service. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a h-anam dílis.

I only met her on a few occasions and would have known her from a distance. As Deputy McDonald said, it was difficult to make sense of Fine Gael in the early 1980s when it had a group of very progressive women and, at the same time, some very conservative men. Certainly, a broad church is an apt description. However, I always felt a warmth about Monica Barnes, as people have mentioned, and I was aware of her forthrightness. At this time, with the referendum coming up, had she been well and able, I know she would have been involved in the campaign. I do not believe politics is something that would have left her. Our sympathies go to her family.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	6	Susan Mitchell of The Sunday Business Post wrote at the weekend that last week was one of the worst in the history of the Irish health service. She was summing up the understandable anger at how Vicky Phelan was treated, the failure to tell women the truth about their misdiagnoses, forcing a sick woman through the courts and questions regarding the quality of our national cervical cancer screening programme. It is fair and objective to say that the response of the HSE directorate, the Department and the Minister in the early days compounded the crisis. Nobody appeared to be in charge and women were justifiably worried, anxious and angry. Major issues have yet to be resolved. General practitioners, GPs, have yet to be properly advised, resourced and prepared to respond to the crisis. The help line has been way behind and has not been effective, as I know from people who contacted me over the weekend. Thousands of people are awaiting callbacks and, according to some reports we received this morning, some women were more worried after the calls than they were beforehand. Clearly, it is a rushed initiative that is not properly resourced. Many promises have been made. Will every woman who seeks a free smear test, as announced last week, get one? Is that the correct initial response? Does the capacity exist to do that? What criteria have been given to GPs to select and refer women for further smear tests? Surely, an initiative should be taken to proactively target women who are at higher risk of cervical cancer in an initial look-back exercise. There could be women walking around today who received false negatives and who actually have abnormalities and pre-cancerous cells. Some consideration must be given to a look-back programme that would focus on women at high risk. We welcome the inquiry but, given the role of the Department, it should report back to the Taoiseach's office or to a different Department. There is precedent for that. While focusing on an inquiry, we must be conscious of the victims of this scandal, namely, the women whose screenings were misread on a number of occasions. We must listen to their voices. I was contacted by one of the 209 women this week. Her tests were missed on a number of occasions on an annual basis. She had to have a radical hysterectomy that could have been avoided. She was not told of this until late last week. She said, "The impact of finding out that cancerous cells were running around our systems for longer than we thought, in some cases years, due to the missed scans only raises fears of recurrence."She does not want her medical team to be scapegoated and has stated:My medical team are my only security. Whatever happens in this inquiry, any damage to them will damage me and I refuse to allow any further damage. Enough is enough and I want assurances that my consultant will be able to focus on me and my care and not on bureaucracy.

The woman who contacted me asked us to be balanced and proportionate and, above all, to keep her needs as a victim as our number one priority in whatever we do.

He is right that at the forefront of our minds at all times must be our concern and regard for the women who have been affected and also the many others who are not affected but who are understandably concerned because of the fact that confidence in our screening programme has been so diminished. The Deputy is correct to say that the week gone by has been dreadful for our health service. We have many problems with our health service that need to be resolved, whether it be people waiting too long to see specialists or to get the treatment they need or whether it be some of the patient safety incidents we have become aware of in recent weeks and those of which we have been aware for a very long time. We must not forget some wider truths. In no way would I like to diminish or play down the seriousness of any of the issues we have been talking about in recent weeks but we need to recognise that there are also many good things happening in our health service. Life expectancy is improving all the time and people are living longer and healthy lives. This is due, in part, to our health service. When we ask patients what they think of our health service, 85% say they have a good or very good experience of it. We know that cancer survival rates are improving all the time. More people survive cancer than was ever the case previously. We have better outcomes in so many different areas, whether stroke, heart attack or cystic fibrosis. We now have nearly 10,000 doctors working in our health service - more than ever before - 1,000 more nurses and student nurses than we had a year ago and 114 primary care centres open, with another eight to open in the year ahead. This is just to give a small example of the kinds of things happening in our health service every day that are bringing about real improvements for patients and real changes for the better in people's lives. We do a disservice to the hard-working staff in our health service - all 100,000 of them - if we do not recognise the very good work they all do on a day-to-day basis. We also do a disservice to patients when we are not measured in how we speak about the health service. The Deputy has been very measured in the comments he has made to date. I will pick up on some of the questions the Deputy asked. He asked about the smear test. The smear test is available to any woman who is concerned and would like to have a repeat one. The terms of this have been agreed with both the GPs and the smear takers. A financial agreement on the fee was made last Friday and the Minister for Health informs me that guidance has been issued to GPs as to how to go about the process. Obviously, there will be logistical and cost issues in getting the tests done as soon as possible but we will overcome them, and the agreement is in place with the GPs and smear takers. The clinical review being carried out will give consideration to whether or not a look back would make sense and be appropriate. Obviously, there are pros and cons to that but it is certainly under consideration. When it comes to the helpline, I am informed that 11,000 calls have now been logged and 7,678 women have requested callbacks. All the calls are being answered quite quickly but it does take time to get back to people because generally what is required is a relatively long clinical consultation with a doctor or nurse. Often these callbacks - these conversations - can, for understandable reasons, take 20, 30 or 40 minutes because women have concerns and questions. Those questions need to be answered and time needs to be given to women and to patients for that. So far, 2,686 calls have been returned, but it should be borne in mind that before the call can be returned, a doctor or nurse needs to check records and data quality and needs to assign a call to a health professional. The initial call is answered and, once the information is collated, a longer callback occurs involving a doctor or nurse.

If we had been in a position to plan for this, we would have planned for it and would have had all these things in place. However, the Minister for Health, the Government and all the people working around us had to respond to this very quickly and to put things together in a matter of days. In normal circumstances, we would have had time to prepare but we did not have it in this instance.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	12	The point is that arguably the system did have time to prepare and did not respond initially as it should have to the Vicky Phelan case. That is why we have had these panicked, rushed measures that have not been properly thought through. There are 7,000 women waiting for a callback. That is an appalling number. Proper thought did not go into what type of helpline should be established and whether it would be a phoneline or a genuine resource that was resourced as such. A more primary-care focused response should have been developed. On the free smear test, presumably there will be a fee for every general practitioner, GP, in respect of every woman who comes back. However, first of all we are looking to get the quality assurance right and restore confidence in that. It needs to be thought through. Women at a higher risk should have been targeted first, working with primary care and their consultants, because there are different categories and some are more high risk than others. There is an urgent need to focus on that aspect of it. A redress scheme was announced last week and no one has an idea what it means. Initially, it gave the impression that everyone whose results were misread would get redress. During the weekend, there were newspaper reports that it would be for anyone who was not told. It seems as though things are being made up as they go along.  I want to hear more from the Taoiseach about the logistics of smear tests from every GP. Will the Taoiseach indicate what is envisaged by the Government on this? 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	13	The offer of repeat smear tests was a response to concerns expressed by women. A large number of women who contacted the helpline wanted to have a repeat test and the Minister for Health responded to that by making it available. The possibility of a look-back is under consideration but that would be based on a smear that may have been taken six months, a year or maybe two years ago or longer. A more up-to-date test might be the best way to get reassurance for people who want it. As I told the Dáil last Wednesday, the Government's intention is to establish a redress scheme. The first thing we must do is establish the facts of the case and we do not yet know all the facts. There are women for whom open disclosure did not occur. While the State may not have a legal liability in that regard, in my view it does have a moral liability and consequently we will need to provide redress to women who were not told this important information about their health. We also will need to look at the various different cases, of which there are approximately 166, of women who were diagnosed with cervical cancer where it subsequently turned out they had been given a false negative smear. We will need to examine that in some detail because there are different forms of false negative, namely, those within acceptable bounds of normal margin of error and those which should not have been missed. Part of what we are doing is ensuring that this clinical review is undertaken not just of the 208 women, but of all 1,400 who were part of the cervical screen audit.  On Tuesday night, the Minister for Health announced that about 1,600 cases that had been notified to the national cancer registry of Ireland had not been notified on to CervicalCheck. Much work has been done in recent days to go through that. We can confirm that the vast majority of those 1,600 cases will not need to be part of the audit because, as we suspected at the time, many of those women did not have a smear test or had not had one for a very long period. We will have the exact figures quite soon.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	14	By now the Taoiseach will be aware of the harrowing story of Mrs. Irene Teap. Mrs. Teap was twice given incorrect cervical cancer screening results, in 2010 and again in 2013. Two years later she was diagnosed with stage 2 cervical cancer. Irene Teap died in July last year. She was 35 years old with her whole life in front of her. She has left behind a heartbroken husband, Stephen, and two young children. Irene died not knowing that she had received two incorrect smear test results. She died not knowing that she could have benefitted from earlier medical intervention. I understand that Mr. Teap has spoken with the Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, who conveyed his feelings and listened to what Mr. Teap thinks should happen.He is quoted in today's Irish Examiner as saying:I want Tony O’Brien gone and to help get rid of the panic that’s out there. Tony O’Brien cannot remain on while an investigation into CervicalCheck takes place.Mr. Teap's words echo the same sentiment and message as those of Vicky Phelan when she asked how Tony O'Brien has the neck to stay in his job. The fact that the Taoiseach continues to back Mr. O'Brien sends a very negative message to the victims of this scandal and the public more generally. People look on and see the old boys' club that runs this State protected at all costs. The old boys' club is protected even when the lives of women have been placed in the gravest of jeopardy by its members' catastrophic failures. Now, despite Mr. O'Brien's gross incompetence and his failures, the political establishment is seen to circle the wagons around him. Earlier the Taoiseach spoke of the feelings of hard-working staff within the HSE. The Taoiseach's refusal to hold Mr. O'Brien to account does them the gravest disservice of all. Telling the women of Ireland not to worry because Mr. O'Brien will soon take his annual leave simply does not cut it. In fact it is downright insulting. It deliberately misses the point. We tabled an amendment to the Rural Independent Group's motion seeking to create an opportunity tonight for Deputies across the House to debate and to vote on whether this Dáil has confidence in Mr. O'Brien. We should not have to do this but we have had to because the Taoiseach and his Minister for Health have failed to lead from the front. His Government refuses to act and now the Dáil has been silenced on the matter. The Taoiseach said that he would listen to women and their families. He said they would be front and centre in all of his efforts. I now challenge him to be true to that promise, to start the process of accountability, to tell us that he has no confidence in Tony O'Brien and to tell him to vacate his post.

I have read and heard about Irene and Stephen Teap and their family. It is a very sad story and one which has affected everyone in the country. Indeed the Tánaiste met with and spoke to Mr. Teap over the weekend to hear about his concerns, to talk to him and to hear what he has to say. Many of us saw the photograph on the front page of The Sunday Times over the weekend. It was a picture of a beautiful young family, a perfect family which has been broken apart by the tragedy of cancer compounded by the fact that Ms Teap was not told about the false negative smear test, as she should have been, and by the two opportunities to intervene earlier which were lost. Everyone can understand the sorrow and anger which must be felt in equal measure by the family and by their friends. In terms of accountability, of course people want accountability and the Government wants it too. I know that people are very annoyed about how this has been handled over the last few weeks, about the drip-drip of information and about the misinformation given on occasion. I assure the Deputy that the Government and I feel exactly the same way. We have had resignations already. The clinical director of CervicalCheck has resigned. The manager of CervicalCheck has stepped aside from her role and has been replaced by Damien McCallion. It may be the case that more heads may roll in the period ahead, but it is important that they are the right heads and that we proceed with this inquiry as the Government has indicated. I do not think that our focus should be on looking for heads. This should not be about any one man.This should be about the hundreds of women who are affected and the thousands, or perhaps tens of thousands, who are very concerned about whether their smear tests were accurate. Mr. O'Brien has about eight weeks to serve until his term as director general of the health service ends. His focus during those weeks should be fully on getting to the bottom of this issue. He was in CervicalCheck's offices over the bank holiday weekend. His focus in the coming weeks he has left should be on doing everything he can to get to the bottom of this, to put things right and to restore public confidence in our cancer screening. That is exactly what we expect him to do. The post of director general will be advertised in the coming weeks. It is very important that we get a good person to take that job and lead the health service forward. The Minister for Health indicated again that it is our intention to re-establish a HSE board, one that can hold the organisation to account. I certainly would welcome the involvement of the Opposition parties in talking to us about how we might structure that board. I do not believe it should be established in the normal way, whereby we go to the Public Appointments Service and get applicants. We need to think on a cross-party basis as to how we can have a very high-powered board made up of people who can establish a layer of accountability between the Department of Health and the executive of the HSE.

I said to the Taoiseach in my remarks that he told us - I understood this in good faith - that he would put the women and families who have been devastated by this scandal front and centre. I am now asking him to demonstrate his bona fides in that regard. Those concerned have said that, for them, the first step in achieving accountability is to hold Mr. O'Brien to account. That is what they want and that is what the Tánaiste has been told. So far, it seems we are going around in circles. On the one hand, the Taoiseach critiques the HSE and its leadership but, on the other, he is not prepared to act and lead from the front. That is his job. It seems to people looking in from the outside, not least the women and their families, that Mr. O'Brien is absolutely untouchable - untouchable even though wives have been lost to their husbands, untouchable even though mothers have been lost to their children, untouchable even though life itself has been lost to women, and untouchable even though the man has patently and clearly failed in his duties. I want to know what the Taoiseach is going to do about that today. The only thing that has any credibility or that will honour the Taoiseach's promise to listen to the women and their families is for him to state clearly - as, I understand, members of his Cabinet have stated today - that he has no confidence in Mr. O'Brien, that Mr. O'Brien must go, that Mr. O'Brien is not part of the solution and that, in fact, his leadership of the HSE has been part of the problem.

That is what has been foremost in our minds in dealing with this matter over the past week or so. It is not right for any politician or any leader of a political party to seek to appoint herself or himself as a spokesperson for all the women and families affected.

I have also spoken to people who have been affected. It is not right for Deputy McDonald - or any other politician - to appoint herself as the spokesperson for a diverse group of women and families. That is really wrong. In the context of what the Government is doing today, it is establishing a scoping inquiry. The inquiry will answer as many questions as possible as quickly as possible. We all know people want to get answers as quickly as we can get them, and we want that also. That is why we have decided to establish a scoping inquiry under the leadership of Professor Gabriel Scally, assisted by Dr. Karin Denton. They will examine these issues. Our intention is to have them produce, in June, an outcome answering all the questions that can be answered and establishing the facts that can be established and are not contested. After that, we will follow on with a commission of investigation to look into those matters that cannot be dealt with by means of a short scoping inquiry.While that scoping inquiry is under way, I will certainly ask people to co-operate with that, respect it and allow these two professionals to get on with their work. Professor Scally is in the country today, and that work begins today.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	25	As the Taoiseach has just told us, the Cabinet discussed today the draft terms of reference of the scoping inquiry into the scandal of non-disclosure in CervicalCheck. Reports indicated that the scoping inquiry will look at the outsourcing of services and the background to non-disclosure. However, the grave concern and public alarm about CervicalCheck and the audit testing remains, and we are no closer to the truth. This day last week, I raised with the Taoiseach a number of serious concerns about the responses then under way, and little has improved on that front since then. As of yesterday, as the Taoiseach has indicated, there were 11,000 calls, 8,000 people had requested a callback and only 2,686 have received it. That left 5,000 people still waiting for a callback. Many people have been referred to their general practitioners, GPs, but GPs are contacting us to tell us that they have not been properly informed as to what to tell them. What has the Minister told GPs, and what additional resources have they been given? The key question from a patient safety perspective, however, is whether the cervical cancer screening programme was and is currently within acceptable parameters, both in administering the tests and, as importantly, interpreting the results. Vicky Phelan's case was that her 2011 screening test was wrongly interpreted. On proper reading interpretation, she should have been referred for further treatment. As we understand it, the HSE set out a CervicalCheck clinical audit to examine the screening history of all cases of cervical cancer, including Vicky Phelan's case. Of the 1,482 cases notified, 442 cases - 29% - were flagged for review of one or more elements. The most common review was of the smear test due to its known inherent limitations. Tony O'Brien confirmed last week that in 208 cases the review team's interpretation of the smear result was different from the original reading of it. Further, he said that the difference in interpretation in those cases would have led to a different clinical escalation in 175 cases or a recommendation for an earlier repeat smear in 33 cases. The figure of 208 cases out of 1,482 is 14% of the total, or approximately one in seven. To be clear, that is 14% mistakenly read, not 14% mistakes, due to the inherent limitations of the screening system itself.  The key question for those women that the Taoiseach is telling to go back and have repeat smear tests if they are concerned and who are due to have normal clinical smears this week is whether this 14% reader error falls within acceptable or normal test standards. That is the question I am asking the Taoiseach to clarify now for the thousands of women and their families who are fearful about smear tests they have had and concerned about having it repeated. Is a 14% misreading level an acceptable international standard?

That comes out at about 5 p.m. every day. If the Deputy goes to the CervicalCheck website, he will see it gives detailed guidance for GPs and smear takers as to what is happening and it gives them advice and guidance as to how they should communicate with patients who come to see them. That has been on the CervicalCheck website now for a number of days. One of the aspects the inquiry will look into is absolutely that question to ensure and give us assurance that our cervical screening programme is up to international standard in terms of the accuracy, false positives and false negatives, and also to look at the issue of the different laboratories, labs, and whether there is a statistically significant difference in the number of false negatives identified in one lab versus the other labs. As the Deputy knows, three labs are used, two in Ireland and one in the United States. It is important once again to put on the record of the House the inherent limitations that exist in cancer screening. Screening tests are not diagnostic, nor are they designed to be; they are screening tests.The whole idea or concept behind screening is that a patient is invited to come in long before they have any symptoms of cancer. By screening, one can pick up many cancers early before they become symptomatic, but one does not pick all of them up. Even the best test done by the best people will have a proportion of false negatives but those who are picked up early can get treatment earlier, which, of course, improves their outcomes and life expectancy immeasurably. We know from the Cochrane review, which was the highest level of clinical audit or study across the world, that roughly for every 1,000 women who go for a smear test, 980 can be given the all clear and assured that there are no abnormalities whatsoever, roughly 12 women will have abnormalities detected and can then go for colposcopy, which will prevent them from developing cancer or being diagnosed with cancer at that point, and eight will be false negatives. It is understood, therefore, that for every 1,000 smear tests, for every 1,000 women who goes through the door of their GP's surgery for a smear test, there will be a false negative in roughly eight out of 1,000 cases. False negatives do not necessarily equal incompetence, negligence or failure on the part of the pathologist looking at the slides. It is understood that this is a limitation of cancer screening. We must bear in mind that in the clinical audit that was done, what is called retrospection bias would have been understood from day one. Essentially, when one looks at these slides under a microscope, one is looking at cells dyed with a coloured dye. One tries to see whether or not there are abnormal cells in the pattern. When the audit was done and they looked back at the 1,400 or so individual slides, they looked back with a different set of eyes. They looked back knowing that these women had already been diagnosed with cervical cancer. When one already knows the outcome and what one is looking for, one is more likely to find it. All of these things must be teased out in the period ahead both by the scoping inquiry, which started today, and the clinical review, which is being carried by the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists.

There is a huge difference between the known limitations of a screening test and cases where cancer should have been detected but were missed beyond normal error. An error that reflects known limitations is a normal error. The question I am asking relates to missed positives where the actual smear was misread. We are told the rate is 14%. For the women who are going to have smear tests today, tomorrow and next day before the scoping exercise is complete, I am asking the Taoiseach whether a 14% misreading is within international norms and, if not, can we do something now to improve it?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	28	I again want to put on the record that we have no evidence that our cervical screening programme is below international standards in any way. We do not have any reason to believe that our cervical screening programme is any less accurate or is poorer that any cervical screening programme, but it does have limitations. Let us not forget that in the past ten years, 50,000 women have had lesions identified and because we had a cervical screening programme, those 50,000 women were treated early and many did not go on to develop cancer as a result. We should not forget that because this is a programme that works and saves lives. The biggest tragedy that could come out of this would be a significant fall off in the number of women going for smear tests because that will certainly cost lives and in some cases, cost women their fertility if they manage to survive. It is a fine line. Discovering the difference between normal error and negligent error will be a fine line. We are talking about something that was within the limitations of screening compared to something that should not have been missed under any circumstances. It will not be as simple as just saying black and white. There will be areas of grey in between and that is part of what the scoping inquiry and the clinical review will have to work out. I explained earlier what I meant by retrospection bias. One cannot use that clinical audit and extrapolate from it that there is a 14% error rate because when they did the audit, they looked back at those slides knowing that these women had been diagnosed with cervical cancer. Therefore, they knew that it should have been positive.That is not the same as looking at slides and samples de novo when one does not what one is supposed to be looking for on them.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	29	At the weekend I met a woman; let us call her Anna. She had two smear tests, one in 2011 and one in 2015. Both came back as negative from Quest Diagnostics. A year later in April 2016, Anna was diagnosed with an 8 cm tumour. Thankfully today she is in remission, but the treatment means she cannot have children, which is a huge blow to her, a woman in her 30s, and her husband. We cannot adjudicate here as to whether it was excusable not to detect her cervical cancer. However, why is there an aura of such confidence in smear tests when they are, in fact, so fallible? Why were women with symptoms like Anna's dismissed by their own GPs when the clear smear test was cited to refute their concerns? Last week Anna listened as the head of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, told the Joint Committee on Health that every slide is examined by two pairs of eyes. He was categorical about that. Last week, at the same committee I asked doctors from CervicalCheck if there is any difference in the results between the three labs, the public lab here in Ireland and the two private outsourced labs, one of which is in the US. They said "No". Strangely, they did not have the figures to back that up, but those figures have since become available when one went looking on the website. They reveal that over three years the outsourced labs have consistently lower detection rates, in particular Quest. Let us consider the year 2013-14. I believe the Taoiseach took over as Minister for Health during that year. In the Coombe, the detection rate for abnormalities logged was 14.1%; for MedLab, it was 12.4%; and for Quest, it was 5.8%. The following year, the Coombe was 13.07%, MedLab was 11.2% and Quest was 7.8%. In 2015-16, the Coombe was 11.7%, MedLab was 9.3% and Quest was 8.46%. I know differences in demographics have been cited, but there would want to be massive differences in demographics to bring about those differences in results. The detection rate at Quest was nearly half of that of the Coombe, for example. Why was Quest repeatedly given the contract when it has consistently shown these lower detection rates over these years? This is particularly true for lower grade abnormalities. Do Quest and the outsource labs meet the standard in the CervicalCheck quality assurance document of screeners not screening for more than five hours a day? Do its technicians screen not more than the 12,000 per annum or 50 a day? Why, based on the tendering document I have seen, are we not meant to give contracts to companies whose directors have been convicted of conspiracy, corruption and bribery and yet everybody knows the history of Quest from the 1990s, making settlements of $40 million in one decade, paying $11 million to the US Government in respect of lies over testing; and paying doctors kickbacks? Does the truth lie elsewhere in the tendering document that the most economically advantageous tender is the one that has to be accepted? Would the Taoiseach agree that it is serious cause for concern that for-profit private companies have been handed such a vital part of our women's healthcare?

I am very sorry to hear what she has been through. I am glad she is now in remission but obviously the consequences of her cancer will be with her for the rest of her life. The Deputy is correct in saying that we here cannot adjudicate on the issues she has put forward. That is exactly why we have established this inquiry - a scoping inquiry which starts today to be followed by a commission of investigation. When it comes to any contract such as this, laboratories must be up to standard before getting a contract.The issue as to which one comes in with the best price or the most economically advantageous price or bid only arises provided those labs are up to standard in terms of the quality of service they can provide, their accuracy and their ISO accreditation. Therefore, the cost only comes into it after standards are upheld. Cost is not a factor and if standards are not up to scratch, the laboratory would not even be permitted to make it to the final stage of the tender. I am speaking on this as somebody who knows a little about how these things work but it certainly was never the case that any contract was ever run by a Government Minister for approval. That is not how contracts work and it is not how public procurement works, as the Deputy will be aware. It is also important to say that detection rates are not the same as error rates and it may well be the case that the batches sent to different labs are not all the same. The whole point of establishing this inquiry is to get to the facts. We want to get to the bottom of this, we want to get to the facts, we want to put things right and we want to restore confidence in our cancer screening. Therefore, it is a specific term of reference of the scoping inquiry established today to, "examine the tendering, contracting, operation, conflict of interest arrangements, performance information and performance management, accreditation and quality assurance of contracted cytology laboratory services by CervicalCheck from initiation of the programme". That is exactly one of the terms of reference the scoping inquiry will examine not just for recent years, but going all the way back to 2008, to establish whether the suggestions the Deputy has made in the Chamber today stand up to scrutiny and are in line with the facts. Again, I would encourage people to give their support to Professor Scally and Dr. Denton in the work they are going to do in the weeks ahead to try to answer those questions for all of us as soon as possible. I recognise the involvement and engagement of Opposition spokespeople on health in contributing to the terms of reference of this inquiry last week.

Have we not arrived at the truth with these figures, given it is paying its technicians a fraction of what professionals are paid here? A private, for-profit company like Quest would be known to cut corners. I would like the Taoiseach to comment on its track record and why several Ministers stood over it being re-awarded the contract. I do not expect us to adjudicate on the particular case because that will have to be done elsewhere. However, such big variations between one lab and another, which are clearly shown by this, should have warranted investigation over the years. Research has shown that women are not listened to, and we know this because medical studies show women tend to get treatment later and are subjected to more pain before they get treatment. That has been combined with the perfect storm of privatising the screening service in this way and we are paying the price for that now.

What we want is to get to the truth, and that is why we have established this inquiry and why it is a specific term of reference that the inquiry will examine the issues the Deputy raises. I ask her and all Members of this House to allow the inquiry to make its inquiries, allow it to look at the facts and allow it to get to the truth, and then we will find out whether there was a failing in that regard. I ask Deputies, in the interests of women and their health, and in the interests of not causing additional concern or worry, not to jump to such conclusions until the inquiry actually happens and we find out the findings of that. Again, I inform the Deputy that, as I am sure she is aware, no Minister, current or past, has a role in contracts, tenders or public procurement. That is not how it works.

That is a separate matter, however, and I will come back to him on that. What is striking in terms of the reforms that have been announced is that the director general of the HSE announced his retirement date months ago. We now know that he will be leaving in eight weeks time. The advertisement for his replacement, however, is only going out in the coming weeks. What was envisaged by the Government in respect of the intervening period? Were we to have a HSE without a director general effectively for six months because it will take a considerable length of time to find a replacement? One would have thought that headhunting would have begun much earlier for the new director general in respect of the reforms that have been announced. That is the big story. Was the position going to be, or will it be, vacant for quite some time given the lateness of the advertisement going public?

On the other point, I understand that an executive search or some headhunting has begun already. The delay in placing the advertisement was related to the fact that the Department of Health wanted to define the role. There is a reform programme underway - it was set out in the Sláintecare report - to restore a HSE board and to retain the HSE as a body in place. The delay in advertising for the position was simply because the Department wanted to get it right and make sure that the position and its responsibilities were clear in respect of the advertisement being put in. Some initial work, however, has been done already on the executive search.

In every single county in the State, with the exception of Donegal, the 4% rent pressure zone cap is being breached on new lets. In Dublin, average rent is now at a record high of €1,875 a month. This is 12.4% higher than the same period last year and three times the 4% cap. Double-digit rent inflation was noted in 14 other counties, including counties in the Dublin commuter belt, and the average rent in Meath, Kildare and Louth increased by over 10%. This is creating massive affordability issues for those trying to access the private rental market. This issue cannot be left unresolved. We need to introduce real rent certainty, and the Residential Tenancies Board needs the power and resources to begin policing breaches of the 4% cap. When will the Taoiseach review the rent pressure zone legislation? Will he reconsider providing real rent certainty by linking rents to an index such as the consumer price index, CPI? When will he publish and move the residential tenancies (amendment) Bill to give the RTB additional powers?

It discusses rents sought rather than agreed rents, which is what the RTB collects. It also looks at a much smaller data sample than the RTB report, which gives us the quarterly rent index. The last RTB report from the final quarter of last year told us two important things, namely, that the increase in rent was slowing down dramatically, with a 1.1% increase in the fourth quarter, and that the rent pressure zones in Dublin, which have been in place for 12 months, are working. There was an almost 3% decrease in rents being asked for over the course of 2017 when measured against 2016. Having said that, we recognise that new powers are required for the RTB. It needs to become a more independent regulator to enforce the market robustly on behalf of landlords and tenants. That legislation is being prepared at the moment by the Office of the Attorney General, in conjunction with my Department, and we hope to publish it at the beginning of June.

This legislation, namely section 15(3), covered the long-term detention of people in psychiatric institutions. The making of orders extending periods of detention by up to 12 months was ruled to be unconstitutional. There is a six-month delay in the ruling coming into effect. There are currently 78 patients subject to long-term detention orders and a further 15 patients in the Central Mental Hospital. We have heard nothing from the Government or indeed the Minister of State with responsibility for disabilities on this issue during the past five days.

That is welcome, although is somewhat late in the day, given that people have been protesting about this issue for years. Will the Minister's campaign include other forms of precarious and insecure employment? Today 100 film workers, possibly more, protested outside the offices of the Ministers for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and Employment Affairs and Social Protection. I was there with them. It was the latest in a series of protests they have held. They claim there is rampant abuse of workers' rights in the film industry and are particularly angry that conditions attached to the €70 million per year grant of public money that goes into the film industry are not being met. The money is supposed to be attached to a condition of quality employment, which does not exist in reality. The protesters say there is blacklisting and insecure employment and that people are refused further employment in the industry if they raise issues of health and safety, overtime or excessive hours.There is no policing whatsoever of these public moneys and the precarious conditions under which many workers in this industry are suffering. Will they be included in this campaign? They have requested several meetings with Ministers on these issues and have been refused those meetings.

We did not merely intend to launch the campaign he mentions, we actually did so over the weekend. It would be welcome were everyone, both inside and outside this House, to encourage people to contact us if they believe they are in a self-employed status not through their own making. To answer the Deputy's specific question, no industry is excluded. We are trying to reach people who are registered as self-employed not through their own choice. I have not received a meeting request from the people to whom the Deputy is referring. If he asks them to contact me, I am happy to meet anybody but I believe the people to whom he refers are employees in the main, as opposed to being made self-employed, and may have difficulties with regard to their conditions. The Workplace Relations Commission and the Labour Court are in place to assist those people. The new legislation, which we are bringing to Committee Stage on 17 May unless I am mistaken, should further strengthen employment rights for those who are on precarious and low-paid contracts.

We are told that as part of this deal, An Post seeks to gag the people who have signed the contract. They cannot talk about cuts to rural Ireland. They cannot talk about issues around rural broadband. They cannot ask about the waste of prefabs in rural schools. They cannot ask about anything. I thought the heavy gang had left with the former Minister, Patrick Cooney. Are we back in the 1970s in this Dáil? Is this an attempt to stop people from having any democratic right to go about their business? They cannot speak about all these issues. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, has been offered the chance to take the driving licence registration function away from the county councils and have it operated through post offices. He flatly refused. What is the Government trying to do - close down rural Ireland, and to hell or to Connacht with the people? Is it trying to gag them and buy their silence? This is outrageous.

As has been said, Sláintecare recommends several items of accountability legislation pertaining to reinstating the independent board and ensuring accountability for the Minister, senior managers and clinicians.

The progress and timelines of the other important Bills will be outlined in the implementation plan for Sláintecare, which I hope to bring to Government very shortly. I take the point the Deputy makes. I am not sure whether we can hold off on appointing a director general of the HSE but we can certainly appoint a director general who will become a CEO once there is a board in full knowledge of the changes that are coming down the tracks. I would be happy to give that further consideration.

We are coming into the holiday period and I acknowledge there are huge concerns every year at this time. I refer to cases where people book their holidays and then find out they have no passports. Could legislation be brought in whereby people would be required to show their passport before they book their holidays? I was hoping the Tánaiste would be here to answer the question. This affects quite a number of people. There is quite a lot of work being done by the Passport Office, and I must acknowledge the wonderful work it is doing, with a current backlog of something in the region of 70,000 passports. There are a lot of people who are concerned, through their own fault, because they did not check their passports in advance of booking their holidays.

Certainly it has been a big one in my constituency office, and I am sure it has been so for others as well. I do not think the solution to this is legislation.

During the weekend Mr. James Cawley, a young teacher who is a disability advocate, gave 50 hours' notice of his intention to travel on Bus Éireann. He was forced to take a trip around the country and pay €200 in taxi fares to make a journey from Ballina to Longford. This is not the first time, unfortunately, that we have heard of stories of people with a disability left stranded by our public transport network. Can the Taoiseach give a commitment that he will talk to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability issues to ensure that people who have mobility issues or disabilities can at the very minimum be guaranteed that they can avail of public transport when they give the required notice? Currently, unfortunately, that is not happening.

The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, the Minister of State with special responsibility for disability issues, Deputy Finian McGrath, and I spoke about this last week.

I understand the office dealing with this has 11 staff members, even though the workload has increased by 1,200% over the past two years. A business plan is being considered at present and I ask that this plan be approved without delay to ensure that people who have to avail of the scheme and have to travel are refunded as quickly as possible.

I welcome that this is happening throughout the country and in my own constituency. However, counties like Roscommon are far below where they were. We have lost five Garda stations and we still have a major issue with policing. About two weeks ago in Strokestown, a daring robbery took place at the Bank of Ireland. At the time, it was a very frightening experience. It has now emerged - I do not know why it has not come out before now - that two young people, one of them with disabilities, were held hostage for quite some time. This is shocking. While the efforts of local gardaí were outstanding, these guys got away. There is no sign of them and nothing has happened. I ask the Minister to look into exactly what happened and the full facts of the robbery. I ask him also to ensure we get more gardaí on the beat in all of our counties and towns, in particular Roscommon and Strokestown.

However, the Government is determined to ensure Garda recruitment continues apace. At the end of last year, we had succeeded in reaching our target of 13,500 gardaí. By the end of this year, that figure will have risen to 14,000 gardaí, many of whom will have been assigned to County Roscommon. I am happy to engage bilaterally with the Deputy on the point he raised about the distribution of gardaí, which is, of course, a matter for the Commissioner in the first instance.

In Sligo-Leitrim and many other parts of the country, people are on the housing list and directed to HAP to secure a house. I was talking to a person last week and I note that the cap for a single person is €350. That person cannot get anywhere for less than €450 to €500. In many cases, landlords are setting the rent barrier higher so that people who would avail of HAP cannot get into the rental market. Many of those who are on HAP find they have to pay that extra money through the back door to have accommodation and a place to live. As such, I ask the Minister to review the zones in which the HAP caps are in place.

We have approximately 20,000 landlords nationally who are engaging with HAP and taking HAP tenants into their accommodation. However, I recognise that in certain parts of the country HAP has not been as successful as it should have been. There is a 20% uplift which is allowed in most local authority areas. It is not being used in every case, nor does it have to be, thankfully. We are looking at certain issues around the HAP banding currently and I will come back to the House when I have a further update in that regard.

As the Taoiseach said earlier, 7,678 women are still waiting to be contacted. Can the Minister for Health advise the House if more staff will be put in place? There is anxiety and uncertainty among those waiting for a return call. I understand the staff there are extremely busy and this is causing huge distress. Can the Minister tell the House also whether the calls are being returned in order of priority or are they being returned by reference to when a call was initially logged?

I assure her that resourcing is not an issue in regard to the helpline. Whatever resources are required will be provided. As the Taoiseach outlined earlier, it is important that the message does not go out that nobody in CervicalCheck is bothered to return these calls. These are calls where women are, rightly, asking for specific information on their screening histories. That information has to be obtained and relayed to a woman by a clinician, be it a doctor or nurse. Often, these conversations take a significant period of time. Even as recently as the weekend, more staff were assigned to the helpline. The commitment given by Mr. Damien McCallion yesterday was that the overwhelming majority of calls will have been returned by this weekend. The Deputy is correct that staff are working their way through this and are prioritising calls on the basis of clinical need and level of concern rather than just the date the call was logged.

They are being told that while the HSE has full-time work for them on qualification, they cannot go to Kerry but must go instead to Dublin. We need psychiatric nurses in our county and I know of plenty of opportunities where facilities dealing with people's mental healthcare desperately need more nurses. However, the HSE says that while it will give them a full-time job, it will not be in Kerry. I want to know why. It does not make sense. If the jobs are there and they are needed on the ground, why are they being told to go to Dublin?

Following on from the review of the operation of the strategic communications unit, or SCU, my Department will revert to a reformed Government information service, or GIS, model. The GIS will have a smaller budget, fewer staff and a more limited role than the SCU. There will be a managed reversion to the more traditional GIS model with a transition period until July 2018. This transition is now under way and will conclude on schedule. The reassignment of staff is being dealt with as a confidential HR matter by the management of the Department in consultation with each individual staff member. As outlined in the review, surplus staff will be given the opportunity to be reassigned to another post either within my Department or in another Department or agency. In some cases, the duties of staff will not change as they either predate the establishment of the SCU or such work will continue in a reformed GIS. Civil servants in the Government information service and the Government press office will come under the management of the assistant secretary general with responsibility for corporate affairs while respecting the role of the Government press secretary and the deputy and assistant Government press secretaries in the day-to-day management of press and communications. The 2018 funding allocation for the unit has been reduced by €2.5 million. This will result in my Department's 2018 Estimate being 9% less than its 2017 Estimate. While the Government information service will lead and conduct the citizen research as planned, this will only commence once the Opposition parties have been afforded an opportunity to review the proposed survey. This review will be done in the coming weeks. Once the survey has been run, the results will be published expeditiously.

Is that to happen in the next couple of weeks? Is the survey going ahead and will we be contacted in that timeframe? What has been the delay in coming back to us since 4 April? For clarification, does the title "strategic communications unit" exist anymore or has it been abolished? Is there a strategic communications unit currently? On the €5 million, the Taoiseach says half the sum will simply be rebated to the Exchequer and not reallocated within his Department. Is that right? What is the employment framework number for whatever the strategic communications unit is currently called?

When does the Taoiseach plan to consult with the Opposition on the public opinion survey? What form will that consultation take? It was one of the recommendations in the recent report of the Secretary General of the Taoiseach's Department, Mr. Martin Fraser. Another of his recommendations stated that issues raised in the review might usefully be considered by the Oireachtas. What form will that take? Is the proposal, for example, to clear some time and allow for a Dáil debate or consideration? As to accountability, the report outlines problems and issues but does not address conclusively the issue of who was responsible for the debacle surrounding the strategic communications unit.It states that the Government took the decision on 6 September last year to establish the SCU. Can the Taoiseach put a little more flesh on those bones? Does the Taoiseach accept political responsibility for what was a flawed and failed venture?

I have now asked the Taoiseach four times to respond to direct questions about information released by the Secretary General and each time he has ignored the question and launched a political attack. I will ask it once again. Does the Taoiseach acknowledge that the report on best practice prepared by the unit stated that the work of the unit should be directed by public input, not political decisions? Given this, can the Taoiseach explain why €2.5 million in irreversible contracts were issued before any public input had been sought? Why was the work plan discussed at Cabinet if the best practice identified by the unit said this should not happen? Furthermore, the Secretary General's report reveals that a significant majority of the €174 million State spending on communications is incurred by a handful of State agencies, mainly in agriculture and transport, which the Taoiseach stated would not be co-ordinated by the unit. It is a simple matter of logic that the claim about massive savings from the €174 million could not have been true. Can the Taoiseach explain why this claim was made repeatedly by him and his colleagues, even when he had the information to hand that it was not true? Finally, with regard to the research, is there a date by which the promise to consult will be carried out or will this continue to be delayed? The Taoiseach informed us previously that it would be available in February.

The plan is to consult with the Opposition parties on the questions. I imagine it will be much more straightforward than people expect. It will be questions about public satisfaction with different Government bodies, for example, and public knowledge and awareness of Government policies and the different programmes run by the Government, to see if there are information deficits in that regard. I have not been consulted on it so I have not seen a list of questions yet. As Deputies will appreciate, I have many things on my plate and many other priorities at present, and going through a list of questions for a citizen survey has not been one of them in the past couple of weeks given everything else that is happening. However, once I have been consulted, it is intended to consult the Opposition parties. The SCU title still exists and will exist until July. We are in the transition period at present and the title is still being used. It is intended that the €2.5 million will be remitted back to the Exchequer, but obviously there is the possibility that there may be overruns in my Department and they would have first call on it. For example, a number of commissions of investigation are run through my Department and there is a possibility that the money might have to be veered from that budget line to commissions of investigation. As things stand, however, we expect it will be remitted to the Exchequer. That means my Department's budget will have fallen significantly this year. As I mentioned previously, I have fewer advisers than the last two or three taoisigh and spend less in terms of the Department's overall spend. Obviously, spending in other areas is increasing but not in the Department of the Taoiseach. With regard to policy decisions, I take responsibility for all policy decisions I make. Administrative decisions or decisions made by third parties may be different, but I take absolute responsibility for any policy decisions. Regarding public input and how public input can guide the work of the communications section of the Department, the intention of the citizen survey is not only to do the things I mentioned already but also to identify where there are information gaps where people are not aware of services the Government provides for them or of Government policies and plans for reform. However, it is not always necessary to survey citizens in advance. With Project Ireland 2040, for example, it would have been a waste of money to have carried out a survey before it had been published asking people if they knew about it. Of course, they would not know about it. How could one know about something that has not yet been published? There will be information campaigns, therefore, where we wish to inform people about what is happening, and it is not necessary to survey them to find out that they do not know about something that has not been published. Obviously, they would not know it. That is where information campaigns could be Government directed. Another obvious area is pension reform. We have produced a detailed action plan for pension reform. It maps out how we are going to reform the pension system in a number of ways over the coming years. The centre piece of that is auto enrolment, moving towards a system whereby everybody is enrolled in a pension scheme. That is very important, particularly for people who work in the private sector. Two thirds of them have no pension provision other than the State pension. That is an area where we will have to inform people about what is happening and what is coming down the tracks in terms of pension reform. It might well make sense at the outset, as part of the citizen survey, to assess to what extent people know about the Government's plans for pension reform, whether they have heard of auto enrolment and so forth. I would wager that few people have heard of it. I do not know whether it is necessary to do that as part of the survey, but it is something that could be considered.

I delivered an address on the future of Europe at the Catholic University of Leuven as part of its Wilfried Martens series of lectures. This is an annual event, with previous speakers including Commission President, Jean-Claude Juncker, and former German Finance Minister, Wolfgang Schäuble. The event was live-streamed and the text of my speech is available online. My speech covered the many achievements of the European Union, the benefits for Ireland of EU membership and my thoughts about the future direction of the Union, including the importance of completing the Single Market and digital Single Market and working together to deliver concrete benefits for our citizens.  I also spoke about developments in the negotiations on Brexit. In my address, I emphasised the need for an ambitious and positive approach to our discussions about the future of Europe, and the importance of maintaining our core EU values and principles, such as respect for human dignity, personal and economic freedom, democracy, equality, the rule of law and human rights. I noted that many of the challenges we face - climate change, cyber security, illegal migration, international trade and the regulation of major corporations - cannot be resolved by 28 states coming up with 20 different solutions, and that we need to work together to respond to these challenges effectively. I also emphasised the importance of our relations with the rest of the world, including Africa and the western Balkans, and noted my intention to participate in the western Balkans summit in Sofia next week. I stressed the importance of communicating and engaging with our citizens on key issues relating to the future of Europe. From Ireland's perspective, I outlined our citizens' dialogue, which I launched last November and is being led by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and explained that the intention of this has been to facilitate an open and wide-ranging debate with our citizens, which will help to inform our approach into the future. On Brexit, I noted the particular issues arising for Ireland and the need to preserve the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts and the gains of the peace process, including power sharing in Northern Ireland and North-South co-operation. I noted the commitment to translate into the legal text of the withdrawal agreement the principles and commitments agreed between the EU and the UK last December, including in respect of the Border, and stressed the need to make real and solid progress on this before the June European Council. After the speech, I attended a reception in the university where I had the opportunity to meet a range of academics and students, including Irish students studying there.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	113	I noted a section of the Taoiseach's speech at Leuven. He said:The Europe of the future must do four things:1. Continue to do well what it currently does well.2. Focus on the big new challenges facing Europe and its citizens.3. Consider its competencies - not everything has to be done at European level; where appropriate, some things should be left to member states, regions and municipalities.4. Engage citizens more. Whereas we have a very different analysis of many aspects of the European Union, I believe approaching EU reform and the debate on that reform and change on those four grounds is a sound approach.As currently framed, however, the debate does not focus on many of the main issues of contention for citizens. In this time of political flux following Brexit and the other issues of concern with the outlooks of certain states, there is a danger that a very simplistic narrative might be peddled by some that a federal Europe can ameliorate the ills of the European Union. The first flaw in this argument is that so many recent studies show a consistent majority of citizens in Europe who support not the transfer of further powers to Brussels but, rather, the contrary. For our part, Sinn Féin wants to see an EU that is guided by democratic principles and based on the premise that it is by states working together as equals on matters of mutual interest that we can best serve all citizens of the EU. As witnessed by our extensive efforts on Brexit, we believe that Ireland's place is at the heart of Europe. However, this does not mean we will ignore failures of the European institutions as they relate to Ireland. What is required going forward, in line with the sentiment of the Taoiseach's third point, which I read out, is for powers to be left with member states, but not only that: we should interrogate whether some powers might be transferred back to member states. The European Union needs to begin listening to citizens in a genuine way and to uphold their interests. We need to move away from a very bureaucratic, centralised model which benefits the few towards a social Europe which reflects the interests of ordinary workers and families. This is the only way we will address the imbalance of power and the democratic deficit at the heart of the European project. In the spirit of the four principles he enunciated, what does the Taoiseach have to say, for example, on the issue of protecting Ireland's position of military neutrality and an independent, progressive foreign policy? What does he have to say, or what is his starting point, on advancing a debate in respect of social solidarity and equality? What is his big idea - or the big idea of the Government - in a Brexit scenario and then a post-Brexit scenario, of bridging that very deep democratic deficit that some might argue - and convincingly - was a major trigger and contributing factor to the success of the Tory Brexit campaign?

Having had the chance to look at his speech in Leuven on the future of Europe, I believe there are many questions one could ask. In general terms - we have had references to this previously during Taoiseach's questions - all of us need the opportunity to talk about the future of Europe. There is an ongoing debate on the future of Europe. The Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy McEntee, is involved in dialogue throughout the country regarding the matter but we do not have any real discussion on it in this House. The number of significant issues the Taoiseach has tabled merit detailed responses and interactions that would be very useful, including to our own people. Quite often, we have internal debate on matters of very fundamental importance to people and then end up with a treaty that the people know nothing about. We ask them to come up to speed in a matter of weeks on issues that may have been discussed over many months and, in some cases, years. We need that debate. I wish to ask the Taoiseach specifically about one aspect of his speech on which I would be interested in hearing his views. He said:I support calls for the establishment of a common asylum policy and system, to replace the current one which is clearly not working. A small number of countries are shouldering the responsibility of providing refugees with a fresh start in Europe.All of us can and must do more.Ireland, along with the UK, opted out of the reception conditions directive, as the Taoiseach knows, and we are semi-detached members of the common European asylum system in many ways. We are signed up to the Dublin regulations and Eurodac, but out, as I said, of the reception conditions directive. What role does the Taoiseach see Ireland playing in the new common European asylum system to which he referred?

It was a standard recitation of broad generalities and it is disappointing that the Taoiseach did not go into specifics about the major structural discussions currently under way within the Union. For example, it is disappointing that he failed to endorse President Macron's very specific call for an expanded European Union budget, which has the resources it needs to tackle the issues in respect of which countries are seeking leadership. A budget of roughly 1% of overall income will remain economically marginal and the importance to reduce important schemes to allow new activity will continue to rise. The Common Agricultural Policy is under threat because of both the British exit and the pressures on other areas, which will increase. One of the most effective ways of ensuring the retention of the Common Agricultural Policy funds at current levels is to support an increase in the overall EU contribution. Given the current concerns about future growth and incomplete euro area reform, countries should speak up for more comprehensive measures. Tomorrow is Europe Day. It was the policy of the previous Government that this would be an opportunity for a substantive debate on Europe every year. I think it is scheduled for 8 p.m. tomorrow.

I know we have been asked to pass our ideas on to the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, but some structure should be established within the Oireachtas between the parties and the leaders of parties to perhaps toss these ideas around and discuss them in more depth. More substantive briefings on major EU matters for pro-EU parties might be warranted, as was the case before. Does the Taoiseach have a position on the multi-annual financial framework proposals issued last week? Is Ireland in favour of expanding the European budget or is it part of the opposition led by the Dutch and Austrian Governments?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	120	I have not had an opportunity to take a look at it in detail yet but I understand that there is a survey out today which indicates that support for the European Union among Irish citizens remains very high. Something of the order of 90% of people support Irish membership of the European Union and see its benefits for citizens. That is very encouraging. One of the silver linings to Brexit has been that more and more Europeans across member states seeing the reality of what leaving the European Union entails perhaps have a better understanding of the benefits of European Union membership, which is to be welcomed. I never like to think about these issues in terms of a simple transfer of powers from national capitals to Brussels. That is a very binary analysis. Talk about national powers and Brussels is the kind of Eurosceptic language one tends to hear from anti-European British Conservatives and so on. I do not really think this describes the world in which we live any more. The truth is that there are many problems and challenges that are beyond any nation state to manage, whether mass migration, climate change or security threats such as cyberattacks. It is not as if member states could manage these problems effectively on their own. The only sensible option is for us to do things on a multilateral level, whether through the European Union or, in some cases, through the United Nations. I never like to see things as a transfer from the nation state to the Union; I see it rather as a question of how we can best solve and manage these problems. That is how one decides where the competence should lie. I put the idea in the speech, which is largely my own work - not all speeches are, but many are - and I very much like the idea of competencies being repatriated from member states back to regions and municipalities. I often remark that one sees in the United States that cities and counties can sometimes do things that member states of the European Union cannot do.That is because there is a lot of local democracy in the United States. However, when I try to think of examples of things I would like to see removed from European law and transferred to local authorities or national Government, it is difficult to come up with them. It makes sense that there are things that are now done at European level that do not need to be and that could be done at a national or administrative level, but if I was asked to name three or five of them, for instance, I would struggle to do so. Sometimes things such as labelling are suggested, but the whole point of the Single Market is to have consistency across that market. They are difficult to think of but if Deputies have suggestions for European competencies that could be transferred to member states, I would be interested to hear them. On Ireland's position on military neutrality, Ireland is a neutral country. We will not join NATO or sign up to a mutual defence pact. The Government fully supports the triple lock so that any military operation in which Ireland takes part will require Government approval, approval of the Dáil and a UN mandate, notwithstanding the restraint that puts on us with China, Russia or perhaps the United States vetoing certain things. However, there are new global security threats including terrorism, mass migration, cyber crime, human trafficking and modern slavery. They cannot be dealt with by member states alone. There must be co-operation, which is one of the reasons we signed up to PESCO. Ireland is a founding member of PESCO, which will allow us to co-operate more on security where we choose to do so. I do not think that Ireland will ever be a military power. We will never buy aircraft carriers or invest taxpayers' money in expensive missile systems. We have very little to offer by way of military prowess and can offer more to European security through other things we do such as peacekeeping, the participation of our Naval Service in the Mediterranean rescuing migrants and co-operation in other areas, such as cyber attacks. That is where we see ourselves, rather than in trying to do what France and Germany do and becoming a military power or replicating them in some way, even if it is 2% or 5% of what they do. We want to do something different and contribute to European security through other mechanisms, some of which I have mentioned. I am a very strong supporter of a common foreign policy for the European Union. We can be much stronger in the world if the EU acts together. Sometimes it is not possible for us to agree on a common policy. In those circumstances, each country's policy is independent and remains so. It is better if we can agree. We have spent much time discussing this at European Council meetings. We should not forget that in the world in which we live, Europe is increasingly a union of small states. Germany, which is the biggest country in the EU, has a population of about 80 million. I do not think that it is even in the top 20 most populated countries globally and if it is, it is so only barely. It is far behind the populations of countries such as the Philippines, Pakistan and Vietnam, countries one would not think of which have populations bigger than any country in Europe. Europe's position, whether in population or the size of its economy relative to the rest of the world, is falling. Some suggest that by 2050 Europe might make up less than 10% of the world's population or economy. We should bear in mind that it is a very different world from when these institutions were established in the 1950s and 1960s when the European population and its economies were much greater relative to the rest of the world.  On social solidarity and social Europe, my speech in Leuven referred to the Gothenburg proclamation which the Government was involved in drawing up. I attended Gothenburg with the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, and the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, to sign up to that proclamation. That is about putting fire back into the engine of the idea of a social Europe. Europe has never just been about economics, but also about raising social standards, employment standards, and having a common labour market. Due to the crisis of the past ten years, the fire has gone out of the engine of social Europe. The opportunity exists, now that European economies are strong again, to put fire back into the engine of social Europe, which is something the Government wants to do. The Gothenburg proclamation gives us a good agenda. There are issues we can pursue as Europeans, from auto enrolment to ending the pension apartheid that exists between public and private sector workers to things such as family leave. I wanted to speak about that in Leuven because the social market economy is very much a Christian democratic concept. Wilfried Martens was one of the great Christian democrats of his time. The social market economy has often been a part of the centre-right's agenda and it is very different from socialism, which is about state control of the economy and society. The social market economy, which is a Christian democrat concept, accepts that the market is the best way to produce wealth but that the Government's role must be to contain and manage the market economy so that it delivers social goods -----

I had a short meeting with Prime Minister May in the margins of the European Council on 23 March during which we discussed the latest developments in regard to Brexit, Northern Ireland and Russia. On Brexit, I welcomed her Government’s commitment to ensuring the backstop forms part of the withdrawal agreement, and looked forward to progress on this and on the other options before the European Council in June. I expect to meet her next week at the informal meeting in Sofia, in Bulgaria. The Government's position is clear. Our preference is to avoid a hard border through a wider future relationship agreement between the EU and the UK, a view we share with the British Government. We are also committed to exploring specific solutions to be proposed by the UK. At the same time, there is now the necessary legal provision to implement the backstop of maintaining full alignment in Northern Ireland with the rules of the Single Market and customs union necessary to protect North-South co-operation and avoid a hard border. This is very much a default and would only apply should it prove necessary. This is about delivering on our shared objectives of protecting the Good Friday Agreement and the gains of the peace process - no less and no more.  I also conveyed to her my outrage at the attack in Salisbury.  This was my fifth bilateral meeting with the Prime Minister in recent months. I had previously met her in Belfast on 12 February where we assessed the state of play in the negotiations to restore the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly and encouraged the parties to reach an agreement so that functioning institutions can commence work again in the interests of the people of Northern Ireland.  Between these two bilateral meetings, I spoke by phone with Prime Minister May on Monday, 19 February to review the latest developments in Northern Ireland and again on Monday, 26 February when we discussed Brexit and the draft withdrawal agreement in particular, in addition to matters relating to Northern Ireland. There is also regular ongoing contact between my Department and the British Government at official level about Brexit and the situation in Northern Ireland.
#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	124	Last week, I raised with the Taoiseach the so-called customs partnership being considered by Mrs. Theresa May and its lack of fitness to resolve issues relating to the island of Ireland. Last week saw another week pass without any viable proposal being put on the table by the British Government. After successive defeats in the House of Lords, the departure of several Ministers, and several splits in the British Cabinet, the only certainty is that the British Government is at sixes and sevens and still has not carved a defined path forward. Based on developments at the weekend, it seems as though the Tory party is more divided than ever and divisions are deepening. That is largely their own business, except that it affects us in Ireland in a very real way and it is of increasing concern. There is a proposal on the table, namely, the backstop, which Theresa May agreed to, which would ensure that the North remained within the customs union and significant elements, although not all, of the Single Market, avoiding the need for an EU border on the island of Ireland.Is it not now incumbent on the Taoiseach to state categorically that an agreement on this matter needs to be concluded in June and that dragging things out to October is not an option? We need clarity now more than ever because the British Government is in disarray. Without agreement on the legal text relating to the backstop agreement this whole edifice could come crashing down without any agreement being reached. There is a prospect of that happening. Despite this, may I say it is utterly regrettable that Arlene Foster and the DUP have not faced up to the real dangers that Brexit poses and that they continue to toe the line of the hard Brexiteer rump of the Tory Party, which has absolutely no interest in Ireland, North or South. The DUP leader's comments at the weekend ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the North. In fact they misrepresented them because the people voted to remain within the European Union. For the record, I therefore regard this approach by the DUP to be absolutely reckless and unacceptable. My question, which I have put to the Taoiseach before, is where does he stand on this matter and what needs to be achieved by the end of June in his view. I have set out our view. Now I want to hear specifically what the Taoiseach believes would represent an acceptable level of progress to arrive at by the end of June.

It is the basis for most of the direct leverage we are using, so the ongoing crisis in the institutions of the agreement would now appear to be at an emergency level. There is also the fact that no proposal for regulatory alignment appears credible in the absence of an administration in Belfast which can deliver it. I made this point at the-----

How do we achieve regulatory alignment if we do not have institutions, an Executive and an Assembly in the North to facilitate regulatory alignment in the context of Brexit? In this respect it seems surprising that the process in the North appears to be stuck in limbo, with no attempts being made to change the dynamic or to push matters forward. There are many contacts at ministerial level, which appear to be amounting to little, and few contacts at prime ministerial level, which also appear to amount to very little. The Taoiseach will have noticed the widespread commentary during the recent commemoration of the agreement about how the intensity and substance of past Dublin-London engagement is absent today and about how the issues at hand now are a fraction of those which were previously overcome by previous governments and leaders. Has the Taoiseach discussed any new initiative with the Prime Minister, Ms May, which they might both undertake in order to break the deeply damaging logjam now in place in Belfast? It is extremely important that we get some momentum given the inter-relationship with the unfolding Brexit crisis. The east-west relationship is equally key and, to a certain extent, is also being lost. A disorderly British exit may not happen because we have previously seen British governments in all sorts of situations coming close in negotiations and some fudge tends to happen or the can gets kicked down the road. However, Britain leaving the customs union and the Single Market will damage the Irish economy as well as Britain's own economy. We have to make the point relentlessly and consistently to the British Prime Minister and British Ministers that what they are doing will have a significant negative impact on the entire island of Ireland, not just the North of Ireland, in terms of our exporters, manufacturers and those who provide services to the British economy.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	128	I was uncharacteristically pessimistic in my own few comments during the dialogue in Dundalk because I am now becoming quite fearful that the British Government's strategy is to fudge the issue in June and again in October and to hope somehow to fold it into the transition period and that even that will not work. It is now abundantly clear that the so-called bulletproof, unalterable safety net that is the backstop is undeliverable. I do not believe that the British Government as currently constructed can actually deliver it. We have seen it again this week when Boris Johnson basically derided the contents of the Mansion House speech, which was supported by the entirety of the British Cabinet. How does one negotiate with people who change position so fundamentally? This was a speech made by Theresa May as Prime Minister with the endorsement of her entire Cabinet which set out that she was looking for a customs partnership arrangement. That proposal is now being described as crazy by her Foreign Secretary. These are extremely worrying times for us and we need to be clear about where we are heading. There are enterprises across the State, including Dublin Port for example, that are currently preparing for the worst option. That is probably a sound strategy now. I previously asked the Taoiseach about planning for the worst case. I understand that significant planning has happened across Departments. I asked that the Taoiseach brief Opposition parties in that regard. He might arrange for that briefing to take place, even in confidence. It is now crystal clear that we need to have these matters resolved by the meeting of the European Council in June in order that we will at least know where we are going to land by October and in order that we will have some sense of confidence that a bilateral deal between the European Union on one side and the United Kingdom on the other will be deliverable and that the understandings we had thrashed out with some difficulty last December will be upheld.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	129	On the proposed customs union partnership, as the Deputies will know that proposal first appeared in documents produced by the British Government last June. The Prime Minister, Ms May, has continued to put forward that proposal in recent times. The view of the European Union is that it is not workable in its current form, but that it is perhaps something we could make workable. The suggestion she is putting forward that a customs union partnership could be developed between the EU and the UK after it leaves is welcome. I do not think it will be sufficient to avoid a hard border on its own, but it would certainly be much easier to avoid if the United Kingdom continued to have a very close relationship with the European Union when it comes to customs and the goods and merchandise element of the Single Market. It would certainly make the job a lot easier. It is no secret that there are different views within the British Government and Cabinet. Those views have been well aired. There is also now a divergence between the position of the UK Parliament and the UK Government, given that it has now suffered quite a number of defeats in the House of Lords and that it is now impossible to predict whether there will also be defeats in the House of Commons. That makes negotiations very difficult but it is our responsibility to work through those difficulties and to ensure a good outcome for Irish people, workers and business. In terms of the backstop or the protocol on Ireland, as I said before we want to see real and meaningful progress by the meeting of the European Council in June. If we do not have real and meaningful progress on the text of the backstop agreement by that time it is difficult to see how we will be able to come to an agreement by October at all. As Deputies will know and as has been said before, not only by me but by all of the EU 27, if there is no backstop there will be no agreement and there will be no transition period for the United Kingdom. Notwithstanding the negative effects a hard Brexit without a transition period would have on the Irish economy, when I said that we would not leave the people of Northern Ireland behind again I meant it. That is why we are insisting that there cannot be a withdrawal agreement or transition period for the United Kingdom if the backstop does not form part of that agreement. Indeed, everyone accepts that there must be a backstop in the withdrawal agreement. The Prime Minister accepts that and Mr. Barnier's task force holds that view, as do all of the EU 27, so we are in a very strong position in that regard. The negotiating guidelines say that by the June meeting of the European Council progress will be reviewed and obviously decisions will be made at that meeting on the extent to which the progress being made is satisfactory.The deadline for the withdrawal agreement is and has always been October, with the ratification in the European Parliament and British Parliament happening thereafter to allow it to come into effect before the United Kingdom leaves the European Union in March 2019. I agree with Deputy Micheál Martin that the absence of devolved government and institutions in Northern Ireland is a real problem. It would make sense to devolve the power for the making of some regulations with regard to goods and services and perhaps regulations concerning agriculture and phytosanitary matters. Ireland is very much the one island when it comes to agriculture and related issues. Checks already happen at the ports because of this. Certainly, if the regulations could be devolved to the Northern Ireland Executive, it would help to resolve some of our problems. The absence of the institutions does make the situation that little bit harder. When it comes to east–west relations, I want the House to know that, on individual and personal levels, relations are very good between me and the Prime Minister, between the Tánaiste and Mr. David Lidington and between the Minister for Finance and the Chancellor of the Exchequer and of course they are also good at official level. While relations may be good and while we may be in contact very regularly, the context is a bad one. That context is formed by the decision of the British people to leave the European Union, creating enormous problems for themselves, us and everyone else. There is also an impasse in Northern Ireland. While relations are close and while there is regular contact, the context in which we are operating is perhaps as bad is it has been for many decades. With regard to further plans for Northern Ireland to try to get the Executive and Assembly back up and running, the Irish Government has proposed a joint initiative by the two Governments — our Government and the UK Government — to work together and perhaps produce a joint paper and use it as the basis to encourage the two main parties, namely the DUP and Sinn Féin, to come together to form an executive. As things stand, we do not have agreement from the British Government to do that. We are not giving up, however. We will continue to persist until we have the Assembly meeting and the institutions operating as they should be. With regard to briefings on EU affairs and Brexit, there is an open invitation. If any party leader wants a briefing on Brexit preparations or the EU negotiations on a confidential basis, the offer exists. All he or she has to do is get his or her office to contact mine and we will arrange for him or her to be briefed at the highest level on Brexit plans and the negotiations. Obviously, the briefing would be in confidence. People understand that there are things we can say in confidential briefings that we cannot say in a public forum such as this. Certainly, however, the offer exists. Should any party leader want to contact my office, we could set up a meeting.

The current Government and its predecessor have not delivered an affordable home since coming into power almost seven years ago. The current Government introduced a new affordable housing scheme in January 2018. An integral part of that scheme to deliver affordable homes is the local infrastructure housing activation fund, LIHAF. What has been the draw-down under that fund to date? What is the number of affordable homes built to date?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	136	I thank the Deputy for the question. The purpose of the local infrastructure housing activation fund is to relieve key infrastructural blockages for the delivery of housing at scale. I have approved 30 infrastructure projects under the fund at a cost of around €195 million, with an associated housing delivery of 20,000 units by 2021, and more will follow as the sites are fully built out. The total LIHAF funds drawn down in 2017 amounted to €1.6 million. My Department is currently examining draw-down requests for the first quarter of this year. The low level of draw-down reflects the stages that the infrastructure projects were at. Most were in the design, planning and tendering phases, where costs are lower than at construction stage. I therefore expect a major increase in draw-down as local authorities move projects to construction. While there was under-expenditure in 2017, funding for LIHAF is ring-fenced within the overall multi-annual housing budget. The LIHAF under-expenditure in 2017 was diverted to other housing activities, ensuring that the funding available was fully applied to housing priorities. The under-expenditure will be made good as projects are advanced in 2018 and 2019. LIHAF-associated housing will start coming on stream as we progress the infrastructure. Some sites will deliver housing in tandem with the infrastructure but other sites will require the infrastructure to be in place to allow proper access. While I am anxious for the infrastructure and the housing to be delivered as fast as possible, I recognise that local authorities must observe proper design, planning and tendering procedures. My Department will continue to monitor progress on these sites and ensure that every effort is made to secure the timely delivery of the infrastructure and housing involved.

He did not answer the question on how many houses have been delivered to date so I assume the answer is nil. I can understand the blockage in the system is because of the capital nature of the project. With regard to affordability, sums of over €300,000 are regarded as affordable in Dún Laoghaire. It is not really affordable to the average person. Can the Minister give us a breakdown of the different types of affordable housing he is proposing and their various price scales?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	138	It is important that we do not mislead the public on LIHAF. The objective of LIHAF was to unblock key pieces of land for housing delivery. The majority of the projects, if not all, were approved only in quarters 3 and 4 of last year. The intention is for the infrastructure to be delivered between now and 2019 and for 20,000 houses to be delivered between now and 2021. At certain sites, however, the houses will be delivered in tandem with the infrastructure. We are already seeing progress on some key sites in Dublin where there will be housing delivery. When we talk about what will be delivered under the 30 projects and about the target of 20,000 homes by 2021, we should note that 5,600 homes, or over 28%, will be social or affordable housing. That means 3,274 social homes and 2,350 affordable homes. Five thousand six hundred, or 28%, will have a LIHAF-related cost reduction, which was part of the scheme when it was originally set up. Eight thousand eight hundred homes, or 44%, will be sold at normal market rates. Therefore, 70% of the projects approved to date are likely to have housing available at €320,000 or less, subject to market inflation. Bearing in mind the number of first-time buyers and the homes that were bought last year, the figure of €320,000 is important. In the greater Dublin area, Cork and Galway, 69% of houses bought by first-time buyers in 2017 were priced lower than €320,000. Outside those areas, the figure was lower than €250,000. While LIHAF was not specifically an affordability measure in the first instance, it will deliver affordable homes. More important, it will deliver affordable purchase scheme homes. This scheme is the new affordability provision I announced at the beginning of this year.

Could he give us an update on LIHAF 2 and the projects that did not succeed under LIHAF 1? Will he state the affordable house prices he has proposed under all the schemes? It is very hard to understand the exact cost from the spreadsheet. As the Minister says, there is percentage discount and, equally, a fixed price in regard to affordability.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	140	On the Deputy's last question, it will depend on the scheme itself. In certain instances, based on the figures I gave the Deputy, there will be a cost reduction pertaining to homes across the site. A certain percentage will be taken off the proposed selling price or the proposed rental price. With regard to the affordable purchase scheme, again it will depend on the cost of delivering a house and what kind of stake will be taken in terms of the equity scheme.What we have announced already are the income eligibility requirements, which are €50,000 for an individual and €75,000 for a couple. That is important in terms of knowing who will be able to access these schemes. When I sign development commencement orders under the legislation, local authorities will be able then to make regulations in each of their local authority areas as to access. We are about to put a call out for the serviced sites fund, which is €25 million for the affordable purchase scheme, which will follow on from the Ó Cualann model. That is the model from which it comes in terms of having local authorities work with housing bodies to deliver affordable purchase scheme homes. Money was assigned in the budget for me to proceed with the second phase of the local infrastructure activation fund, LIHAF 2. Projects that were not successful in the first phase of it can apply in the second phase of it if and when that is announced, but if we are proceeding with a second phase of LIHAF, I want to make sure that it can achieve what we want it to achieve, which is the unlocking of sites of strategic importance in local authorities up and down the country and doing that quickly. If there is any concern that we might not be able to do that at speed, that might be something we would look at again, but at present I am still reviewing plans for LIHAF 2.

I spent much of Friday and early today talking to senior officials and front-line staff in local authorities and voluntary sector organisations and I am more convinced now than I was last week that the vast majority of those families are indeed homeless and still in emergency accommodation situations and they should be included in the figures. I hope the Minister can provide some clarity to justify the decision to remove 600 adults and children from the March homeless figures report.

I propose to take Questions Nos. 24 and 25 together. I thank the Deputies for their questions. My Department currently publishes data on a monthly basis on the number of homeless persons accommodated in emergency accommodation funded and overseen by housing authorities. These reports are based on data provided by housing authorities, produced through the Pathway Accommodation & Support System, or PASS as it is more commonly known. The reports are collated on a regional basis.  During the compilation of the March homeless report, in the course of examining data from local authorities, my Department established that a number of local authorities had miscategorised individuals accommodated in houses and apartments, owned or leased by the local authorities, including in some instances people renting in the private rented sector but in receipt of social housing supports, as being in emergency accommodation. As these issues have not yet been fully addressed, I am not in a position to provide a complete account of the extent of such practices. My Department is writing to local authorities as part of its continuing examination of the matter. However, I can say that a total of 247 adults and 331 associated dependants, residing in houses and apartments, were categorised as being in emergency accommodation in the Dublin, south-west, mid-west, north-east and south-east regions. These categorisations were corrected prior to the publication of the March report. I flagged the issue that had arisen very clearly when publishing the March figures and was also clear that the figures would have been higher had the corrections I referred to not been made. We do not yet know the trend month on month, beyond certain indicators such as the rate of presentations of families in Dublin being down almost 50%. We also know that there are further miscategorisations in the system still to be worked out. My priority as Minister is to ensure that families and individuals are moved from emergency accommodation, such as hostels, hotels and family hubs, into housing. I am satisfied that individuals and families who are being accommodated in publicly funded houses or apartments, whether it be social housing or homes leased from the private rented sector, should not be considered as living in emergency accommodation. The issues which have emerged indicate clearly to me that we need improved reporting in this area in order to reflect accurately the numbers of households in emergency accommodation so that we can measure our progress and target our further policies and actions. My Department is examining the current reporting arrangements with a view to ensuring that the best possible data is available to support policy making. No decision has been taken on amending the existing arrangements at this stage.

I believe that is what he said. I believe 247 and 237 were the figures he gave. Regardless of that, he said in an interview on "Morning Ireland" last week that people who were considered homeless were being accommodated in local authority houses. He gave an understanding that those people were in homes and will remain in those homes until they receive their long-term accommodation. Can he confirm that people who are being provided with local authority accommodation in local authority housing can remain in those houses up until long-term accommodation can be provided for them? The Minister mentioned hotels. I have a concern about that because the previous Minister gave a commitment that there would be nobody living in hotel accommodation by the end of June last year. Month by month since then, we are seeing increases in hotel accommodation being used for homeless people. Realistically, we are just not getting on top of the homeless figures.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	145	That response from the Minister is astounding. He seems to be claiming on the one hand that local authority owned or leased properties cannot be considered emergency accommodation, yet 63 units in Tallaght Cross, in my constituency, owned by a local authority are emergency accommodation and the families in that accommodation are included in the March figures. Likewise, hubs are leased by local authorities and the families in those for six, 12, 18 or 24 months are in emergency accommodation. In Louth, for example, 58 of the 100 families the Minister had removed from the March figures are in short-term, emergency-type accommodation arrangements. They are in properties that have been leased by the local authority but they do not have tenancies and they are no different from being in a hotel or in a hub. Twenty-two families are transitioning into the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme, but at the time the figures were submitted to the Minister's Department before he had them changed, they were not in receipt of HAP and were therefore being funded through emergency section 10 funding and should have been considered homeless. I will grant the Minister this. There were 20 families in HAP tenancies with a section 10 emergency funding top-up. I do not believe those families should be in the homeless figures. They should be removed, but that means 80 of the 100 families the Minister had removed from the figures in Louth are homeless, are in emergency accommodation type situations and should be classified as such. I challenge the Minister again to correct the record. Otherwise, he is claiming that these families who are homeless are not, and that is an insult to them and their children.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	146	I thank the Deputies for their questions. What we are seeing, as this is emerging, is a mixed practice in each local authority as to both what they are counting but also some of the provisions they are putting in place to prevent people from going into emergency accommodation. At the Second Housing Summit at the beginning of the year I told the local authorities to be creative in preventing families and individuals from having to access emergency accommodation. We know the tenuous nature of that with individuals going from day to day, night to night, not knowing where they will be living, and staying in hostels, hubs, hotels and emergency accommodation. I asked that they keep families and individuals out of emergency accommodation but to be creative with the solutions they put in place. What we have seen is that some families and individuals have been accommodated in local authority housing, some have been housed in the private rental sector with HAP support, and some have stayed in private rented accommodation which they were renting themselves but they were at risk of homelessness. The local authority provided supports and therefore they never entered into emergency accommodation and yet because it was section 10 funding, they were counted as being in emergency accommodation but they should not have been. I was glad to hear Deputy Ó Broin recognise the fact that there has been a miscategorisation error here. We are trying to get to the bottom of the scale of this. We do not know exactly when it occurred. That is why we cannot measure, with any accuracy at the moment, the kind of increase we might have seen from February to March because we do not know exactly when those miscategorisations occurred. However, we will get that information and when I have it, I will publish it. We are talking about 247 adults and 331 dependants who have already been taken out of the figures, but I am aware there may be as many as 200 more. The Deputy might have heard me say in the region of 600 to 800. We are trying to work through that currently. By the way, no one was removed by me from these figures. This was an agreement between my officials and the local authorities once we discovered that people were in homes with their own keys and front door, some for as long as two years. They were being counted as being in the same situation as someone who is in a hostel who has to go out and walk the streets every day. That is not case here. If we want to help people who are in emergency accommodation or people experiencing this crisis, we need to understand exactly who is there and the reason they are there. We are counting some people, including people from Tallaght Cross who have not been taken out of the numbers, but if some people are in a situation where they might have been in their own home with their own key and front door for two years, that is not emergency accommodation. If they are not at risk of going into emergency accommodation, they are not in emergency accommodation. They are in a home, and it may not be their forever home. In some instances, the home did become their HAP tenancy but they will not be going into emergency accommodation. They will be going into a home from a home.

The families in Tallaght Cross are in emergency accommodation. They do not have a tenancy agreement and there are key workers, which the Minister's Department funds, to try to move them into permanent accommodation. The idea that because somebody is left languishing in emergency accommodation for two years the Minister is now saying that they are no longer in emergency accommodation is truly astounding. All of this stands in marked contrast to the refusal of both the Minister and his predecessor to add into the homeless figures families and individuals who are in emergency accommodation but are not funded by the Minister's Department. There are two hostels in Dublin, for example, the Morning Star and the Regina Coeli, neither of which is funded by Government and both of which house people in hostel type accommodation. There are 66 people in the Morning Star Hostel and there are 40 rooms for women and children in Regina Coeli Hostel.They are not counted in the Minister's figures. Adults and children in Tusla-funded domestic violence step-down and emergency accommodation are homeless but are not included in the Minister's figures. The 520 people, including 163 children, who, despite having leave to remain, are trapped into using direct provision as emergency accommodation because they are unable get adequate housing are not included in the Minister's figures. When we highlighted all of this to the Minister previously, he would not change the figures because, God forbid, they would show an increase but now that the figures are going in the wrong direction, he is reclassifying the definition of "emergency accommodation" in a fundamental way. That is deeply dishonest and deeply insulting to these families. When the Minister finally publishes the data which I seem to have but which he, for some unknown reason, does not, I think he will be forced into a climb-down.. A total of 80% of the families removed by the Minister from County Louth are homeless and should be included in those figures. If that trend goes across all of the 600, that is an astonishing number of families to have removed from these figures.

In fairness, they should be described as being homeless. We have been producing monthly figures for two years and it has taken two years to discover this anomaly in the system, which is unacceptable. Is the Minister trying to play games with the homeless figures and create uncertainty and doubt? What other directions is he taking regarding the presentation of homeless figures? I have heard that we might be moving to quarterly reports instead of the monthly reports we have at the moment. When will these changes take place?

The tenants in Tallaght Cross are not at risk of being de-tenanted. Deputy Ó Broin is using the terms "temporary" and "precarious" but the tenants have been in those tenancies for a very long period and are at no risk of entering emergency accommodation. No decision has been made about people in Tallaght Cross. This is something we must address as a Dáil, a Government and a society. It is not fair on people in emergency accommodation who are experiencing that crisis in their lives to be described as being in the same situation as those who might be in the private rental sector, who have never gone into emergency accommodation and who are not at risk of having to do so. If we are to have the right supports and targets to achieve sustainable exits from emergency accommodation, we have to understand exactly who is there and why. I am not responsible for direct provision or women's refuges. These are different difficulties that are being experienced depending on where the person has come from in Irish life. What I am responsible for is getting people off the streets and into emergency accommodation and from emergency accommodation into homes. We need to understand exactly who those people are and why they are there to make sure we can provide those exits. There was a report in the newspapers at the weekend that we were going to recategorise non-EU nationals who did not have permission to be here. Nobody is talking about recategorising non-EU nationals but we must face up to the fact that if they do not have tenancy rights, they will be trapped permanently in emergency accommodation. In such circumstances, what is the proper way to support those people? These are the things we must look at and have an honest and open debate with ourselves and the public about the challenges we face. If we reach the figure of 10,000, it tells us nothing that the figure of 9,600 does not already tell us, which is that we are in a crisis. We know we are in a crisis but I am concerned about how we best help people facing this crisis in their lives.

If we go by Deputy Casey's definition, anyone in the private rental sector for two years might be included and counted as homeless. That does not make sense to me. We must be honest about the numbers. I was upfront about this when I discovered it. I have mentioned it previously. We are still working through this. We do not have the data Deputy Ó Broin claims to possess. The Deputy admitted to the miscategorisation there. He admitted that it is happening. I am trying to get to the bottom of it.

That report defines real social houses as units owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies. The real social housing output last year was around 6,297 units. These are units built or bought by approved housing bodies or local authorities. However, the most recent real social housing target for 2018 is 428 fewer, standing at 5,869. Can the Minister explain and justify the drop?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	153	I note the reference in the Deputy's question to "real social housing" units after which he then proceeded to outline an entirely unreal comparative analysis. Therefore, in order to be of assistance to the Deputy, I am happy to outline the actual comparison between social housing delivery in 2017 and the corresponding targets for 2018. In 2018, local authorities will deliver 2,319 new-build homes, approved housing bodies will deliver 1,500 and 590 will be delivered through the Part V mechanism. This will bring to 4,409 the number of new-build social housing homes to be delivered this year. That is a 92% increase on the comparable 2,297 new-build homes delivered in 2017, of which 1,014 were by local authorities, 761 by approved housing bodies and 522 through Part V. This increase reflects the changing composition of the overall social housing programme as we increasingly deliver more and more new builds while acquisitions and the voids programme become less significant delivery streams. In addition, it appears that the Deputy's analysis excludes homes delivered through long-term leasing in secure tenancies for up to 25 years. Such homes are very much a real home for the individuals and families that they accommodate and 2,000 such properties are targeted for delivery this year, well over twice the level achieved in 2017. In addition to the 4,409 new-build homes and the 2,000 leased homes, 560 void homes will be brought back into stock and 900 new homes will be acquired bringing to 7,869 the number of new social housing homes that will be delivered in 2018. This is more than 50% higher than the target for 2017 and more than 11% up on the 2017 output. This is before any account is taken of the housing assistance payment or rental accommodation schemes. In setting local authority targets for 2018, I have been explicitly clear with local authorities that these are minimum targets and that where additional capacity to deliver arises, we will work in partnership with local authorities to drive that accelerated delivery.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	154	Part of the problem is, precisely as the Minister says, an increasing reliance on leased properties instead of real social housing. The reason I use the phrase "real social housing" is because it was used in the unanimously endorsed report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness. The Minister claims to be meeting the committee's recommendation when the figures very clearly show that this is not the case. My concern is the dramatic increase in the Department's long-term leasing targets from approximately 798 in 2017 to in the region of 2,000 this year. This is to the detriment of the provision of real social houses, namely, units owned, built or bought by local authorities and approved housing bodies. This means that an over-reliance on the private rental sector, be it via leasing or involving the housing assistance payment or the rental accommodation scheme, will jump from 75% of total so-called social housing delivery last year to 78% this year. Every time we say that the Government is over-reliant on the private sector, the Minister says this is not true. However, this year, which is the first full year in which he will be Minister, the actual number of real social houses owned by local authorities or approved housing bodies will be fewer than last year. This is a significant fact, one for which the Minister is responsible and one he has yet to adequately explain.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	155	I do not know why Deputy Ó Broin wishes to misrepresent the progress that is being made when it comes to building social housing homes. He is not comparing like with like. He includes things such as voids when he wants to and then excludes them when he wants. This gives a very unfair impression of what is actually happening. Of course, we are building more units this year. We spent everything in our capital and current budgets last year. We were doing so much that I had to get additional money from the Minister for Finance to build more homes and that is what happened. This year, we again have a dramatic increase in our capital budget that will build more homes - real homes coming into the social housing stock. These are homes built by local authorities and approved housing bodies and homes delivered through the Part V arrangement. We will also acquire homes. That figure is down. Again, the Deputy looked for it last year and I agreed that we should be acquiring less and building more so we are doing that. When we do that, the Deputy says our acquisitions target is down. Of course it is down. That is the case because we are building more. The number of voids is also down because we have managed to achieve a huge amount in terms of taking vacant, sometimes derelict, social housing units and bringing them back into use. As we do more of that, fewer voids will be brought back into use. However, even when one takes the total sum of what we hope to achieve this year, it is up on last year in terms of real social housing units for people to live in. We still rely on the housing assistance payment and the rental accommodation scheme because we have not yet built enough social housing units for people on the housing list but as we move to 2020 and 2021 under Rebuilding Ireland, more people will be accommodated in new homes coming into the social housing stock than will be accommodated in the private rental sector. Our ambition does not end at the end of Rebuilding Ireland. It follows through into Project Ireland 2040 out to 2027. Between now and that date, at least 112,000 homes will be built. These are social housing units for the social housing stock.
#EoinOBroin	unknown-#EoinOBroin-party	unknown-#EoinOBroin-dob	unknown-#EoinOBroin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	156	First, I never called for the Government to acquire fewer units for local authorities. What I wanted it to do was to continue to acquire and to increase building. I keep coming back to the report of the Committee on Housing and Homelessness because that cross-party report set out the minimum that this House believed the Government needed to do to tackle the social housing crisis. Again, we talked about increasing the stock of real social houses owned by local authorities and approved housing bodies by a minimum of 10,000 units per year for five years.Last year just over 6,000 were produced and it will be less than that this year. There is no confusion; it is very clear. The number of real units delivered this year will be less than last year. I accept the number of leased units, housing assistance payment, HAP, units and rental accommodation scheme, RAS, units will be higher but that is part of the problem. There is an increasing over-reliance with up to 78% of leased or subsidised private rental accommodation rather than doing what the all-party Oireachtas committee recommended, which was to deliver an increase of real units. The Government is not even coming close to the target we set at that time.

The call to acquire fewer homes by local authorities was my call because I did not want them competing with young families in the market in high-demand areas. Where it still makes financial sense to do it and it is not a high-demand area, local authorities can still make acquisitions and that is why this year, in the region of 900 more homes will be acquired into the social housing stock, the permanent stock, under Rebuilding Ireland. The Oireachtas joint committee referred to 50,000 new homes and therefore it always presupposed a reliance on the private sector for another type of solution for people who needed social housing support. It always presumed that. It always presumed an over-reliance on the private sector under the programme of those 50,000 homes being brought into the social housing stock. The actual output figures for 2017 - I am only talking about local authority build, housing body build and Part V build - show that 2,297 homes were delivered. When we look at similar targets for 2018, the figure for local authority build, housing body build and Part V build is 4,409, which is a dramatic increase on the previous year. The numbers are increasing not decreasing.

It states that the primary earner on the application must have at least two years' continuous employment, which can be self-employment, and the second applicant must have continuous employment for at least one year. However, the application form states "continuous permanent employment". I know of people whose applications have been rejected by the local authority because their continuous employment was not permanent. The written answer to the parliamentary question also stated "continuous permanent employment" and that the Department would liaise with the Housing Finance Agency etc. to ensure consistent information. When checking at the time of tabling this question I found that the form still states "permanent employment". I ask that this be clarified. Obviously some people really want to get this loan because they cannot get it anywhere else. It is very important that they are not squeezed out because of lack of information.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	159	As the Deputy will be aware, the Rebuilding Ireland home loan is targeted at first-time buyers who wish to own their own home, satisfy the relevant income limits, have access to an adequate deposit and have the capacity to repay a mortgage, but who are unable to access a mortgage sufficient for them to purchase their first home. As previously noted regarding this issue, the primary earner on the application must have at least two years’ continuous employment and the second applicant must have continuous employment for at least one year. Both self-employment and employment with a number of different employers can be counted as part of this continuous employment. Since this issue was last raised, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, has had a chance to meet the chief executives of the two main agencies involved in the implementation of the scheme, the Housing Agency and the Housing Finance Agency, to address any issues arising from the roll-out of the scheme. One of the items raised was the manner in which information is presented on the application form. The Housing Finance Agency has undertaken to amend the wording on the application form to more clearly reflect the requirements of the scheme, specifically in reference to “continuous employment”, which I anticipate will address the Deputy’s concerns on this point. The application form for the scheme contains the phrase “continuous permanent employment” at point 4 of the eligibility requirements. The requirements for the scheme do not require that the relevant employment be explicitly permanent, but rather continuous in nature. The primary earner on the application must have at least two years' continuous employment, which can be self-employment or with several employers, and the second applicant must have at least one year of continuous employment. The Housing Finance Agency will revise the application form to fully clarify this point. I am glad to have the opportunity to put it on the record today.

I also ask whether those who have already been turned down because their employment was not permanent can now can have either an appeals system or a review of their applications. I know of people who have been turned down. I have one further question. This specific issue of overtime was covered on "Morning Ireland" last week. The income eligibility requirements state that single applicants must not be earning more than €50,000 per annum and the combined income of joint applicants must not be greater than €75,000 per annum. The "Morning Ireland" presenter stated that some local authorities are counting overtime and possibly also bonuses, while others are not. Can we have the same system for every local authority? It should not matter whether applicants live in Meath, Dublin, Limerick or wherever. If people qualify in one county, they should qualify in the other county. I ask for clarification particularly on overtime.

As with any scheme that is only three months old, there will be some teething problems. There were some issues with the assessment of data at the outset. Additional training is to be provided at all levels in local authorities. The Housing Agency has processed 460 applications and has sanctioned about 224 of those. If somebody has been refused for the wrong reason or there was misinformation regarding their continuous employment, that can be reviewed or there is an appeal mechanism there. We will make sure that happens as well. I think the scheme will work and has been working very well. Naturally there will be some question marks around parts of it. There are clear criteria set down to judge overtime, bonuses and all that. The local authority processes the application, which is sent to the Housing Agency and the final decision is made by the credit committee of the local authority. There are clear definitions about that. There are different types of overtime and different types of bonuses. We need to allow the credit committee to make the judgment on that. Some overtime is nearly like permanent wages - we are familiar with that around here - other overtime is not. That is the judgment call they must make when they assess that. We have asked that clear guidance be given. Any of the questions that have been raised are being worked through. If the Deputy comes across any other issues, we would be happy to have them amended. The frequently asked questions section is updated on a regular basis to reflect any changes. We want to make this as clear as possible and as accessible as possible because we want the scheme to work. That is why it is there.

Those people should not be caught out. I understand €200 million has been allocated in the budget. More may be needed if the number of applications continues to rise. Will the Minister of State be able to get more funding in order that people who qualify will actually be able to get the loan?

It is the credit committee's job to judge the different types of overtime. The overtime is very clear from someone's employment record. Applicants are asked to give a lot of information on the form as well. The credit committee analyses the data and makes the decision, as they do in banks, credit unions and everywhere else. People are asked to give as much information as they possibly can, make their case and back it up with their employment record and their payslips and so on. It can be quite clear to judge someone's overtime record from that as well. Different industries, different jobs and different employment backgrounds can mean different things when it comes to overtime. That is assessed and judged. In his meetings with the various agencies, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, made it very clear, when using the scheme, to be clear as possible about this while allowing for the different categories because they can work both ways. One person might want the overtime included to qualify in the first place and others do not want it included because it puts them over the limit. It is a question of making the right judgment call here. The criteria are set down and are implemented as standard across the country. The credit committee needs to make the judgment based on sound data, which is what they do once the evidence is there.

I ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government his plans to support a regeneration team to utilise public lands at a location for 300 social and public housing units - not affordable units. Will this model be used as a pilot scheme with a view to extending it to all public lands?
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	165	I propose to take Questions Nos. 28 and 37 together. I thank the Deputy for the question. St. Michael’s Estate is one of three significant sites being brought forward by Dublin City Council under its housing land initiative, HLI, the aim of which is to ensure the delivery of mixed-tenure homes in the Dublin City Council functional area. All three sites under the HLI are identified as strategic development and regeneration areas within the Dublin City Development Plan 2016-2022. Mixed-tenure developments are an important policy objective in the Government's Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan on Housing and Homelessness and uphold the principle of sustainable mixed communities where housing needs are not subject to rigid segregation based on income levels. They also provide an opportunity to see major sites developed more quickly, and integrated into existing communities and areas.  While I have not seen the details of the proposal referred to by the Deputy, I expect to meet those involved next week. However, I am very familiar with the approach which the city council is taking to the St. Michael’s project. This envisages the potential to yield a minimum of 420 mixed-tenure homes and the elected members of the city council have determined that the homes will be provided on the basis of a 30% social, 20% affordable, and 50% private tenure mix. The council also agreed the methodology for community consultation, as set out in the feasibility study presented to it via a community consultative forum.  In line with good governance procedures, a project board, which includes representation from my Department and the National Development Finance Agency, has been established and is working to progress the development of this site. As regards the delivery of affordable homes from this site, while it is ultimately a matter for the elected members of the city council to decide whether these are affordable homes to purchase or are delivered as cost-rental homes, I firmly believe that there is a need to ensure that the rental sector, particularly in our cities and major urban areas, is accessible and affordable. In order to do this, we need to invest in a different type of rental offering, a so-called cost-rental sector which operates between the social and private market sectors. We are learning from pilot projects and the examination of similar models operating elsewhere. My Department and I remain committed to working with Dublin City Council and other councils to ensure we make this a reality. We are working with the European Investment Bank and other key stakeholders with a view to announcing the first major cost rental project in Dublin city shortly, with a broader programme of cost rental projects across Dublin and other cities to follow.

It will be up to the city council and it has already discussed that there should be a pilot scheme on this site. It is an amazing proposal that the regeneration team is putting forward and I believe the Minister should take it on board. Although I know the Minister has said he will meet the team next week, he should then come back to the Dáil to say whether he will let it lead this model.

Dublin City Council has been supporting the establishment of the Kilmainham-Inchicore network as the primary vehicle for the interface with the local community on this. If a group has a new proposal that might work, I will, of course, be happy to engage with it. While cost rental has to be something we bring into our rental sector on a massive scale, we need to prove it first. We need to find a few sites, or perhaps one larger site, and prove cost rental. We need to put serious financial backing and firepower behind it and then roll it out on a broader basis across the country over a number of years. There is huge potential for cost rental on some key sites in Dublin. It will hit a number of the targets under Rebuilding Ireland, not just to build more homes but to build communities as well, and also to regenerate parts of the city that have, unfortunately, needed regeneration for far too long.

I believe this project would be a very good way of seeing how the cost-rental model works. The daft.ie figures show that rents have gone up by 80% in Dublin in recent years and that they are totally beyond the means of ordinary people - such as retail and transport workers, nurses, doctors and teachers - right across the board. This sort of plan could be a game changer for this country in regard to rent, as well as the high cost of mortgages, and I urge the Minister to look at it seriously. Some €56 million is not a huge amount and it could regenerate that community in St. Michael's Estate. The St. Michael's Estate regeneration team had been burnt badly by the McNamara public private partnership of the 1990s. We need something that people in the community can buy into, rather than people from outside buying into the community.

A majority of councillors have supported a motion of the housing strategic policy committee to request that this project is taken out of the land initiative for the purposes of the funding model and that the Department fully funds it through Exchequer or loan finance. It is not the business of the Dáil to decide whether it should be 420 or 300 units as that is for Dublin City Council, the councillors and the local community to decide. What Deputy Joan Collins is arguing - I fully support her - is that this project should be fully State-funded. There are reasons why it is different to the other sites. What we are asking the Minister to consider is direct State funding of whatever the final configuration of the project is, rather than the land initiative, because that would be better for the community as a whole.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	170	I thank the Deputies. The public private partnership model is not always the best model to use on a particular site. Deputy Ó Broin's colleague is chair of the housing committee on Dublin City Council. I have met with him and I can meet with him again to discuss some potential ideas for this site if it is not proceeding under the public private partnership model. I have had extensive meetings with the European Investment Bank, and those meetings continue, in regard to different sources of funding for cost rental on a major scale, as the Deputy is aware, given I have said this previously in the Dáil. Deputy Ó Broin is right that the decision regarding the mix or the number of units will not necessarily come to the Oireachtas but, nonetheless, 300 units is very low for that site. Under previous planning guidelines for apartments, it could have been as many as 420 and, under the new guidelines, one could achieve even more than that. It is very important, when we look at Project Ireland 2040, that, in the context of these key sites in the city, we are achieving compact growth and real density, particularly in light of public infrastructure for transport, schools and everything else. Deputy Joan Collins is right about rents being too high. The most recent information from the RTB indicates that rates of increase came down in 2017 in comparison with 2016 but that they are still very high, at just over 5%. However, as we begin to do more in the rental sector and to make more interventions regarding cost rental and land, which is something we are going to do, this will have an important impact on the different factors that are causing this affordability challenge for people up and down the country, particularly in the major cities such as Dublin.

The Commissioner of Valuation has responsibility for valuation matters, including the revaluation of properties, and is independent in the performance of his functions under the Acts. The levying and collection of rates are matters for each individual local authority. The Valuation Acts provide for the revaluation of all rateable property within a rating authority area so as to reflect changes in value due to economic factors such as business turnover, differential movements in property values or other external factors and changes in the local business environment. It is not the purpose of a revaluation to increase the total amount of commercial rates collected by local authorities. Indeed, section 56 of the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 provides that the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, having obtained the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, is obliged to make an order directing a rating authority to limit the overall amount of income it could raise through rates in the year following a revaluation to the total amount of rates liable to be paid to it in the previous year, plus buoyancy arising from valuations determined in the year of a revaluation of newly constructed property, and adjusted for inflation as measured by the consumer price index. Rate limitation orders have been made in each of the local authorities in whose areas revaluation exercises have been carried out up to now and further orders will be made in respect of future revaluations as they arise.

The dramatic increase in commercial rates is crippling SMEs across the country. Our small independent businesses are the backbone of the economy and we need to encourage SMEs to grow and expand in order to create jobs, especially in the regions. We must take urgent action on this issue. The Minister recently stated to me in the Dáil that the commercial rates Bill is currently being drafted. What is the status of this legislation, given we need to get it published as soon as possible? Fianna Fáil previously introduced a Bill in the Dail proposing that the level of increase being levelled on an individual business be capped. We also proposed that any increase should be allowed to be staggered over a five-year period at the discretion of the local authority. This would mean an increase is limited and spread over time, rather than the current process involving a single increase. There is also a clear need for reform of the appeals mechanism for businesses to local authorities to restructure debt repayments on the basis of inability to pay. The Government should also consider offering a choice of direct debit payments rather than two tranches of payments in order to help businesses cope with cash flow issues. Turnover and square metreage should be considered. Will the Minister consider these proposals as the drafting of the commercial rates Bill continues within his Department?

On the valuation process, as this happened in my local authority area, I know there are, generally speaking, more winners than losers when this occurs in terms of people seeing their rateable valuation decrease rather than increase. It is roughly a 65-35 split, so some 65% will find themselves paying less as a result. In some local authority areas, as the Deputy knows, this work has not been done in a very long time and it is a question of ensuring that there is fairness across the system in order that some people are not carrying a historic burden in meeting the rates needs of local authorities. This is very important work. If someone feels that a mistake has been made in the process, there is an appeals mechanism they can follow which is independent of me, as Minister, and my office.I raised the rates Bill with the Attorney General last week and I raised it with him again today. It is priority legislation for us and as it will not be going to pre-legislative scrutiny, once we have it drafted and ready to go we can bring it straight into the Dáil. I had hoped it would be published later this month but more than likely, it will be the beginning of next month. It is a very important Bill that will give greater enforcement powers to local authorities and allow them to achieve what the Deputy wants them to achieve, which is to be able to bring in rates alleviation measures and to recognise where certain areas need a bit more help to come up, for whatever reason, by reducing the burden on local businesses. The risk with having rates which are based on turnover is that it is not a very consistent basis for a local authority to be able to plan into the future based on how much money might be coming to them in a given year. I would much rather focus on giving authorities more enforcement powers in order that they can collect more than they collect today. Some local authorities do this very well, while other local authorities do not do it very well.

I am sorry to harp on about this and this is my second time to raise the issue in the past fortnight. However, the reason is that I am being contacted by local businesses in Kilkenny because of the revaluation that has been conducted in the past 12 months. They are coming to me with increases of 400%, 300% and 200%, which are too much for a business to take in one go. These are small and medium-sized businesses such as publicans, crèches, childminding businesses, which used to pay no rates, and beauticians. They are small businesses that are barely surviving and to go from paying €600 in one year to €2,400 is too much of an increase in one go. I am asking the Minister to change the system and bring the changes in over five years to give these businesses the chance to breathe before getting up to the next level. Three businesses have closed down on High Street in Kilkenny since Christmas. I do not say it is because of rates and it could be for other reasons but it is a sign. We need small and medium-sized businesses, as they are the backbone of employment in this country.

We all know the value small and medium-sized enterprises have to each county, especially in towns. Through no fault of the businesses themselves, rates have not been revalued in 20 or even 30 years but the businesses are now faced with a revaluation process that is unjust and will involve a significant hike. Deputy Aylward is looking for some form of concession, meaning the increase can be spread over a period of time rather than over one year but the legislation does not have the necessary flexibility. Is there any way we can amend the forthcoming legislation to give the power to local authorities to take the increase and spread it out over a four-year or five-year period, given the fact that there has been a deficit in the revaluation process? This is impacting the heart of rural towns and villages but it is not the fault of businesses.

There is nothing I can do about it as the process is independent of me. Nevertheless, I would be interested to see how it is working out for businesses in those particular circumstances. In the rates Bill, which is separate from this issue, we want to ensure local authorities have the flexibility to alleviate rates where they need to in order to help businesses in struggling areas, though the valuation rate is independent. When the legislation comes into the House I want to make sure we can achieve something that will give teeth to local authorities from the point of view of collection, and fairness in finding the balance between different businesses in their rateable areas. Whether it is national or local government, we should not do anything to hinder business but should support it as small and medium-sized enterprises are the backbone of our economy, and local business is what drives smaller towns and villages. Everything about Project Ireland 2040 is about opening the door to smaller towns and villages that saw a population exodus in previous years. Through greater investment and the urban regeneration fund, the rural regeneration fund and changes in technology and work practices, we will revitalise these towns and villages and we will give businesses the support they need.

#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	180	Local authorities have been notified of their targets for social housing delivery via construction, acquisition and leasing which, in the case of Limerick City and County Council, is 1,365 units for the period 2018-2021. The targets are based on the summary of social housing assessments of 2017.  Limerick City and County Council has an ambitious pipeline of new social housing construction projects in place, including those it is leading itself and those being delivered in partnership with approved housing bodies. There are approximately 770 new social homes in its programme and the council is adding to this on an ongoing basis. Other delivery for new social housing is also under way in Limerick through schemes such as the leasing schemes, which are working well.  Details of local authority activity across the range of social housing programmes are published on my Department’s website. I have also indicated that I intend to publish progress against targets across each category of activity on a quarterly basis. I am determined that local authorities meet their targets and the financial resources they need to do this are in place. I have always been clear that the targets that have been set are minimum targets and, where further social housing delivery opportunities are available and represent value for money, my Department will support the local authorities to pursue them.

The target of 1,365 units between 2018 and 2021 is ambitious and, now that the funding is being provided, we need to have an element of stick in our approach to ensure such targets are met on time. Some existing housing stock has already been purchased by the local authority, which is very welcome, but potential tenants are waiting a considerable amount of time for them to be upgraded or refurbished in order that they are habitable. Some in County Limerick have been waiting for 12 or 14 months, especially where it is one house on its own in a country area but has been bundled in with a number of other houses, meaning it is left for a long period before it can be done up. A number of people have said they will sign off on a deal to move into a house and have the works done around them, or move out for two or three weeks while the work is being done. A lot of the work that needs to be done is around regulations and not health and safety. The houses have been lived in already and it may be that someone died there but they are sitting idle because of regulations. I would be grateful if the Minister could investigate this problem, which is specific to country areas.

What is happening in the local authority at the moment is quite exciting. The Minister of State, Deputy English, has met the housing delivery team as part of the new delivery unit in the Department which he heads up, and it is a very good team. It members know what they are doing and we need to make sure they have the tools to deliver what they need to deliver. If there are any blockages or snags which the Deputy or any other Deputy can identify, they should give them to me. The Minister of State, Deputy English, the Department and I will inform the local authority in order that we can unblock problems. The funding is in place and local authorities know what they need to do so now we need to drive delivery and drive local authorities in respect of specific projects and sites. A lot is happening under the repair and leasing scheme in Limerick City and County Council and 66 applications have been received, with six agreements to lease having been signed. There are more in the pipeline and €32 million has been secured in capital funding for the repair and leasing scheme in 2018, while further funding can be delivered if it is needed. There are other long-term leasings for which there is an allocation of €115 million in 2018, an increase of €31 million on last year.Last week, a total of €2 million in claims for the council was processed in respect of delivery of new housing for social housing. We are doing that on a continuous basis, week in and week out.

The Minister is correct that the council is moving and working hard on this. I have had personal engagement with the county management. It has been second to none on coming back to me. I am however, expressing the anomalies from a rural perspective. I understand the cities like Dublin, Limerick and Cork have higher waiting lists. There are rural people too on the housing lists who want to live in their rural areas. These houses have been identified and earmarked, particularly in respect of medical circumstances. It is an anomaly in the system. I am not asking for a solution today. I am just highlighting that sometimes, rural single houses can get lost in the pipeline. That is not to take away from the required priorities. I refer in particular to people who are rough sleepers or who are homeless. As a Deputy representing a rural constituency, I wish to identify that this issue also arises. It is something that can be solved quickly and people can be moved into those houses. They are actually liveable at the moment.

When we look at local authorities, of course we give them autonomy in respect of how they manage their resources. Some try to manage those resources between going for bigger schemes and bigger sites versus the resources that might have to be put into individual units or homes. Each local authority needs to strike that balance to make sure that in providing social housing, local authorities are not working against our long-term plans under Project Ireland 2040. That aims to make sure we are doing what we can to regenerate parts of our counties that need to be regenerated. Initiatives like the repair and leasing scheme are key where a building can be turned into housing, if it has not already, and with some minor works can become a residence very quickly. If the Deputy has specific locations or specific towns or villages, he should give them to me and I will ask the Minister of State, Deputy English, to follow them up with the delivery team in the local authority.

In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, we are in the lowest zone in the country whereby the income limit for a single person is €25,000 and for a couple is €30,000. It is a 40% differential between that and most other counties throughout the country. We are condemning people to not being able to avail of social housing and at the same time those people have no chance whatsoever of being able to get a mortgage to buy their own home. I have repeatedly asked at Question Time that the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government finalise the review, increase the eligibility limits to a realistic level and to get movement on this issue without further delay.

The income bands and the authority area assigned to each band were based on an assessment of the income needed to provide for a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country. It is important to note that the limits introduced at that time also reflected a blanket increase of €5,000 introduced prior to the new system coming into operation, in order to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn, both promoting sustainable communities and providing a degree of future-proofing. I am conscious that seven years have passed since the review.  As part of the broader social housing reform agenda, a review of income eligibility for social housing supports has commenced. I acknowledge that Deputy Brendan Smith and others have raised this matter repeatedly here. It is an issue we highlighted in Rebuilding Ireland. We recognise the importance of that too. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and I have made it clear that this review is happening. The Housing Agency should have the report and its recommendations with us in the summer, possibly late summer. When we have that we will be able to make the final decisions. I accept it is dragging on. The Housing Agency is involved in many other policy initiatives with our Department. This is taking longer than we all hoped it would. It is an area being highlighted and on which we also want work to be done. We will have an update for the Deputy and the results will be published during the summer.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	192	It is most disappointing this review is taking so long. I have told the Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the Minister of State himself in this Chamber that were the departmental officials to ring around to a few good housing officers in the local authorities, the review could be done within an hour. Any of us who make representations meet people on a weekly basis who cannot qualify for a council house. They do not have a hope of getting a mortgage. Those people are being condemned to a life of living in rented accommodation. It is surely within the competence of the Department to raise these limits to a realistic level.  The Minister of State observed that one of the factors in deciding the eligibility limits and the cut-off point was rental cost. Rental costs have changed dramatically in the past year to 18 months. The Minister of State's home area neighbours my own county. He knows what costs are like in Mullagh, Virginia, Ballyjamesduff, Bailieborough and across to Kingscourt. That is just in east Cavan alone. It is similar in Monaghan. Will the Minister of State ask the Department to try to bring forward that review well before the summer? I was told it would be published "shortly" two years ago. I was told it would be "in the near future" six months ago. Now, we are being told it will be the summer again. It is far too tardy a response to this issue. It needs to be dealt with before we continue to condemn a generation of people to living in rented accommodation.

The last time we discussed this, I did say that we hoped to have the report by June. I hope it will not be much longer than that before we have it. To be clear, a ring around will answer some of the questions. We know from our own analysis with the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, what the rent increases are. We know there is pressure on the rental sector. We are looking at four areas under this review. The Housing Agency is doing this work on behalf of the Department. It will be similar to what happened in 2011 and similar criteria will be looked at. These include the current income bands to see if they reflect the cost of providing suitable accommodation in the private sector. If they do not, then the question arises as to what should the appropriate thresholds be. That is a judgment call that must be based on evidence and on research. It cannot be just for me, the Deputy or the Minister to pick on a whim. That is also what the Housing Agency is analysing. It is also looking to see if we will continue with a regional banded approach to eligibility for social housing support. That is an important issue because the Deputy highlighted himself the differences in the different bands in respect of our native counties and other counties. We have asked the Housing Agency to analyse that and bring forward a suggestion on that too. Finally, we have asked the agency to look at the feasibility of introducing a form of transfer system that would allow social housing applicants to move across local authority areas while keeping their time on the list.  That is an issue that has been asked about repeatedly over the last year by councillors and our own colleagues. The review has a few areas that will inform policy changes. It is important that we get that information gathered correctly and that we make policy changes based on that as well. In the past couple of months, we have seen what can happen with local authorities interpreting information differently. We want to be very clear on this. We will have this review on our desks in the next couple of months and then we will be able to make decisions based on that. It is taking longer than any of us wanted. It is important we get the work finished.

It is compounding the already multiple injustices of the current housing crisis. Every single week, working people come into my office - I am sure it is happening everywhere else - who are being cut off housing lists. They may have been on those lists for ten years or 15 years. Then they are just gone because they do a bit of overtime or get a slight pay increase. They are cut off the list. That is not acceptable. Now, they are not even on a list where they will not get a house. They have no housing support available. It is not just that they will be stuck in rented accommodation. In my area, they cannot get the rented accommodation. They cannot afford it. It means working people - bus drivers and people on average wages - are being forced into homelessness and simultaneously off the housing list, or not being allowed on the housing list in the first place. Two months is just not good enough. What is the Minister of State going to do for the family that came into me this week, that - because there was a bit of overtime - has lost ten years on the housing list? The decision was fought and the council said it would put the family back on the list but the ten years were lost. That was because of a bit of overtime. This is bonkers. It is completely unfair. For years, social housing was about ordinary working people who could not afford mortgages or could not afford the private rented sector. They are now being excluded in large numbers and thrown off housing lists. What is the Minister of State going to do about it?

I would be surprised.We had a discussion about overtime earlier, and how that is judged. To be clear, the reason for the review of the guidelines and the establishment of a national standard was because there was a different policy in every local authority prior to that. There were different income limits, gross or net, different allowances for overtime and different allowances for child benefit. A fair system was not administered across the board, so we made sure that was introduced. There is now a fair system. We agreed that it had to be reviewed, and that is happening. In the meantime, there are other supports available to help people who are over that income level. We had a discussion earlier about the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, which is working quite well; almost 500 applications for it have been received. It is a good scheme to help people whose income puts them above the social housing limits. Other schemes exist which seek to deal with the pressure zones in certain areas. We have provided LIHAF funding and we are working with the private sector to bring forward affordable housing. An affordable housing policy is in place throughout the system and every local authority has been asked to bring forward proposals on that issue, and have been asked to manage land for that purpose. Money has been made available by the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Murphy, so that such land can be opened up and serviced. A range of initiatives have been put in place; I have only touched on a few.  We recognise, as all Deputies in this House recognise, that the income limits need to be looked at and adjusted. The adjustments will be based on evidence and science, as they were before. The Housing Agency is doing that work for us and gathering the required information. It will make recommendations to the Minister, and the changes will be made in the summer. That is where we are now. If I could click my fingers and have the work done more quickly, I would do it, but it is important that it is done correctly.

I am telling the Minister of State that a person who did some overtime was taken off the list, and then after appealing and fighting the decision the family was told the appeal was not going to be accepted but they could reapply. Once that was done, the family lost their ten years on the list and they are back at the bottom of the list because of the overtime. That is completely unacceptable. If the Minister of State can sort that out, I would be very happy. I had a case where a working person has refused a €10,000 a year increase in pay from their employer because they would be off the housing list if they took it. Housing in my constituency would be completely unaffordable to that person. That person is actually refusing pay increases. The limits have not increased since 2011. It is ridiculous. Wages are rising at the moment, but they are not rising to a level where people can afford to buy a house. However, they are rising to the extent that people are now above the permitted limits. The housing list is being culled of people who have no other alternatives. It makes a mockery of social mix, because what is happening is that people who traditionally benefited from council housing are being taken off the list, meaning that only people on the very lowest incomes are eligible for social housing. Where is the social mix in that? These limits have to be raised urgently, and the Minister of State has to do something about people who are removed from the list because of small increases.

I am happy to check out the story. To allow for social housing mix, there are a range of schemes which blend social, affordable and private housing on State-owned lands. There are plans afoot to provide enough land to build 50,000 houses, taking the mix of social, private and affordable houses into account. People will benefit from that. In addition, to allow for that mix, a blanket increase of €5,000 above the limits has been recommended. I am aware that is quite low in today's terms, and that is why the Government has agreed to look at that criteria. It will be based on evidence brought forward. We want that mix, and we want to encourage people to bring forward housing schemes. We do not want housing schemes that would mean that people would turn down jobs or the chance of increasing their income. That is why the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme was introduced in the first place. It recognised the ability of people to get a job and to earn income. The Deputy does not like that scheme either, but it works very well and reflects the ability of people to work and earn income. That is what it is there for, and we see it every day of the week.

By definition, if a person is eligible for family income supplement, it means that his or her income is not sufficient to sustain a family. That supplemental money was being factored in and meant that people were no longer eligible to stay on the social housing list. As Deputy Boyd Barrett said, one of the cornerstones of social housing policy in this country going back many decades was to have a mix of people in the same areas, including people depending on welfare payments and those in employment. If the policy continues as it currently stands, nobody who has a job will be eligible to qualify for a local authority house. That would be a retrograde step for this country in every respect. Can the Minister of State give us a commitment that he will tell his Department officials and the other agencies involved in this review that he wants to bring this report back to the Dáil before the middle of July? It could go on until the autumn or until next year, given how the matter has been dealt with at official level so far. Can the Minister of State commit to that, and tell the officials and other agencies that he has committed to Dáil Éireann that this will be case, and that he wants it to be finalised with a new and realistic scheme in place before the middle of July?

Guidelines were issued in the first instance because we had to make sure that all interventions target the most needy. That is how taxpayers' money is best used, and that is why we have the schemes that exist and why we set a national standard. The review, carried out a number of years ago, occurred because national criteria were not implemented and different standards applied in every local authority. We are trying to address the housing difficulties across the country and bring in a standard approach, based on systems and process which has not been in place hitherto. That is part of the repair work we are doing. The Department will then be in a position to fix and address the housing problem across every sector for the years ahead.

My question is on emergency accommodation but I will preface it by pointing out that today the students in Galway are protesting because they have been subjected to an 18% increase in their lease for the coming year. As they enter the exam period, they have been told that they have to come up with an extra €1,000 for a nine month lease for next year. That is a symptom of the market. Another symptom is the cost of homelessness services. At the beginning of May, there were 190 homeless people in Galway. What has been the cost to the State of housing our homeless people in 2015, 2016, 2017 and to date in 2018? I want to bring clarity to the situation in Galway.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	209	On the issue of student accommodation, many changes have been made in that area since Rebuilding Ireland was launched. It is an issue of supply, like every other form of housing. We are intervening in the area of supply and are attempting to dramatically increase the amount of student accommodation. I do not have the specific figures for Galway because it was not part of the Deputy's original question, but I am happy to engage with her on the issue. We are trying to put our educational stakeholders in a better position so that housing can be delivered. Student accommodation must be sorted out, but it also reflects the overall housing market. Exchequer funding is provided to housing authorities on a regional basis towards the operational costs of homeless accommodation and related services. Under the funding arrangements, housing authorities must provide at least 10% of the cost of services from their own resources. Housing authorities may also incur additional expenditure on homelessness-related services outside the funding arrangements with my Department. Therefore, the exact amounts spent by housing authorities on homeless services, as well as the types of accommodation and the service providers engaged, are a matter for those authorities, as are many such contractual issues. Galway city and county is included in the west region, along with counties Mayo and Roscommon, for the purposes of homelessness administration, with Galway city as the lead authority for the region. Reflecting the position at national level, the funding provided to the western region has been increased significantly in recent years from €1.7 million in 2015 to €2.37 million in 2016 and €3.79 million in 2017. To date in 2018, just under €100,000 has been drawn down by the western region, and I expect this to increase significantly in the coming months. In this regard, my Department has advised the region, and all regions, that funding will be provided for all required homeless services as the year progresses.

I mentioned the students because that is the latest symptom of an out of control market. The Minister of State has as much information as I have; the students are protesting because they are being subjected to an increase of €1,000. Can the Minister of State imagine that? Homelessness is the most acute problem in Galway. The Minister of State is fully aware that not one social house has been built in Galway since 2009. It is clear from the figures from the Department that none was built last year. Galway distinguishes itself by being bottom of the league. It acquired seven houses; the lowest number in the country.Is this just a complete inability to deal with a problem or is it a refusal to accept that the market will not provide? I am asking the Minister of State about this matter again. I know it is difficult to hear these figures. In the context of emergency accommodation and the significant increase, I can tell the Minister of State that people are now in a situation whereby they are getting respite in apartments for a week or two in order that they can feed their newborn babies. They then have to go back to single rooms in hotels. That is the level to which the emergency service has been reduced. The Minister of State indicated that the Department spent €3.7 million in 2017. Does it not occur to him that he needs to go down to Galway on a regular basis, haul the local authorities over the coals and ask what land they have, why they are not using it and why they are not building?

That is exactly what we are doing. She will be familiar with this. I have visited Galway City Council and Galway County Council to discuss on a number of occasions. The Minister has also gone to Galway on several occasions and has visited some of the emergency accommodation provision being funded by means of the taxpayer's money paid to all the different service providers at local level. It is fair to say that there is serious pressure in Galway city and county. There is no mistaking the figures; they are very clear. This year, 145 new social homes will be delivered into the system. The target for the next three or four years is 1,089. We expect Galway city to treat that as a minimum and we have told the council that very clearly. We are going site by site and road by road in order to try to see what we can do to remove barriers and deliver accommodation much earlier. There are a number of schemes in the system. However, these are not sufficient to deal with difficulties that exist in Galway, which is a major pressure area. It will be getting major attention within the Department. The Minister, the social housing delivery team and I will be down there on a regular basis, visiting all the different sections, to ensure that the needs of Galway are addressed. Last year, through the benefit of the housing assistance payment scheme, more than 764 housing solutions were found. That will not be nearly enough to deal with the emergency, so I will be working with the authorities this year and next year as well. There are opportunities in Galway. We have made the resources available and we have made it very clear that we will do whatever it takes to move matters forward. We want this to be addressed.

He accepts that not a single house has been constructed. As a result, we are utterly reliant on the market. When the Simon Community carried out its snapshot study, Locked Out of the Market X, in March, it indicated that there were very few properties available for rent in Galway. In fact, the study identified 15 such properties. That is all that was available in the three days of the study. In the month overall, there were 28 properties. In addition, the Government is totally reliant on housing assistance payment, the residential accommodation scheme and the long-term leasing. None of those schemes come next or near prices in Galway, all of which was set out in the Simon report. Even with the discretionary payment of 20%, people cannot get a home to rent in Galway. Besides the fact that we have created the problem, the Government is making it worse by not building. What is wrong with Galway City Council or with the Department? Where does the problem lie? Galway City Council bought a lot of land at huge prices when I was a member. It has been zoned for residential use and it is not being used. I understand that two thirds of the residential land has been set aside because of a proposed road which, if it goes ahead, will not be built until the mid 2020s. Two thirds of the residential land has been sterilised. Can the Minister of State tell me I am wrong about that?

It is true to say that some of the land that Galway city owns is sterile because of a route selection. That project is going to be happening quite soon, which will deal with that part and which will open up the town. We have asked the council to bring forward plans for that land or, if necessary, for alternative land. We said we would work with the authority on purchasing new sites as well. We have gone through all the different areas, site by site. We have arrived at some solutions to bring forward some housing earlier. To be clear, we have looked at Galway city and County Galway. There are difficulties with both, and there is a line on the map that separates the two. In other initiatives, in Cork and other places, we have managed to make this work through a combination of local authorities. We both think that a similar approach, namely, for the Department to work with the two Galway local authorities to bring housing solutions forward, might be appropriate. We will deal with this by taking the line off the map. There are potential solutions with which we can work. Through taxpayers' money allocated by our Department and this Government, the funding to address this is available. The supply issue is a major difficulty in Galway, for both private and public accommodation. There is very little private sector development. We will work with all our abilities to try to make this happen. We are looking at a new approach to making this happen a little bit quicker, because it is a priority area. It is an area that we want addressed and the resources are there to do it. There is a difficulty with land but not with all of the sites. We will deal with it on a site-by-site basis and we will find solutions as we go along.

As part of the overall review, a strategic environmental assessment, SEA, is being undertaken on the revised guidelines before they come into effect. This is in accordance with the requirements of EU Directive 2001/24/EC on the assessment of the effects of certain plans and programmes on the environment, otherwise known as the SEA directive. SEA is a process by means of which environmental considerations are required to be fully integrated into the preparation of plans and programmes which act as frameworks for development consent, prior to their final adoption, with public consultation as part of that process. Following a tendering process, my Department appointed SEA experts in December 2017 to assist in this regard. It is expected that a public consultation on the revised draft guidelines, together with the comprehensive environmental report, will be commenced by the end of the second quarter of this year, with the aim of issuing the finalised guidelines, following detailed analysis and consideration of the submissions and views received during the consultation phase, in late 2018. When finalised, the revised guidelines will be issued under section 28 of the Planning and Development Act 2000, as amended. Planning authorities, and, where applicable, An Bord Pleanála must have regard to guidelines issued under section 28 in the performance of their functions generally under the Planning Acts. In the meantime, the current 2006 wind energy development guidelines remain in force. I hope this clarifies the matter for the Deputy.

I am quite aware that we are still working under the 2006 wind energy guidelines. The problem is that people throughout this country are living in fear. New guidelines were promised as far back as 2011. In fact, it is safe to say that this is one of the issues I have raised most frequently in the Dáil since being elected. The previous Government signed a memorandum of understanding with the UK Government concerning the export of wind energy in 2012. Wind turbines of heights of 160 m or 170 m were to be erected in the midlands. That did not proceed, but it highlighted the need to change the 2006 wind energy guidelines, particularly as these were published at a time when turbines were 40 m or 50 m high. The previous Government, including the then Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and former Deputy, Alex White, and the then Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly , could not agree on new wind energy guidelines. Two years have passed, there is a different Government in place but we still have nothing concrete. Every time I raise this issue, whether by way of parliamentary question or on the Order of Business, I am informed that the new guidelines are imminent and that the Government is working through the consultation period and examining submissions. We are still no further along, however. If an application was submitted in the morning, it would be judged on the basis of the 2006 guidelines.

The whole reason this Government is bringing forward new guidelines and a preferred option, which has to go through the SEA process, is to bring a better balance to the guidelines and assure people that their concerns are being dealt with. We are not just talking about it; this Government is doing it. The process, as I have said, has to include carrying out the SEA. As part of that, the experts were employed in December 2017. Their work will be finished quite soon. It will then go through a public consultation period, and we will be able to complete all of this near the end of 2018. We will have completed the initial stage at the end of this quarter, which is in about two months. This will address the concerns around noise, visual amenity, shadow flicker, consultation obligations, community involvement, community dividend and grid connections. All the concerns of which I, as a Minister of State and a Deputy, am aware and which were brought to us by various stakeholder groups are being dealt with in those preferred guidelines. The guidelines address the issues. They are being dealt with. It is best for those communities that we follow the process we are meant to follow under law. If we do not do that, the guidelines will not be effective.

However, this has to be done in a proper and appropriate manner and local concerns must be addressed. The reason we are where we are now is that the previous Government, of which the Minister of State was a member and in which the Labour Party was involved, did not publish the guidelines. Having gone through the consultation process and received in excess of six submissions, the then Government could not reach agreement and that delayed publication further.We are two years on and we are still awaiting new guidelines. What the Government has failed to address is the fact that any application submitted now is adjudicated under the 2006 guidelines, which are out of date. We need new guidelines in place as a matter of urgency which take account of the size and magnitude of proposals. A goodwill gesture would be to put in place a moratorium on future planning applications until such time as we have new guidelines on a statutory footing.

That is now taking place and I cannot move it any more quickly. It is an important process. If we want new guidelines, that is the process they have to go through. At the end of quarter 2, we will have draft guidelines and at that stage anyone making an application for a wind farm will probably reflect them in any proposal. The Deputy is correct, however, that until they become part of planning law, applications will be judged according to the old guidelines. The new guidelines will achieve what the Deputy and most other Members want, which is a balance wherein community concerns are dealt with. While it has taken time for the two Departments to agree on guidelines on behalf of the people on foot of the responsibility of Government to balance the issues involved, the draft guidelines are a step in the right direction and will solve the problem when published. It is important to go through the process, however, or the guidelines will not stand up.

Indications are that the current HAP rent limits and the flexibility to exceed those rent limits provide local authorities with sufficient capacity to assist households in securing rented accommodation that meets their needs. Indeed, increasing the HAP rent limits in particular local authority areas could have further inflationary effects on the private rented sector, which could have a detrimental impact on the wider rental market, including for those households who are not receiving HAP support. From data available at the end of quarter 4 of 2017, approximately 46% of the total number of households in the Dublin region being supported by HAP were benefitting from the additional flexibility that was provided to local authorities to exceed the maximum rent limits. When the additional discretion available to homeless households is removed, 18.3% of HAP households were benefitting from the additional flexibility. In those cases, the average rate of discretionary payment being applied was 15.4% above rent limits provided. The average rate of discretion for homeless HAP scheme tenancies being applied was 29% above rent limits provided. While I am satisfied that, in general, the HAP scheme continues to operate well in a challenging rental market, I will continue to keep the matter under review.

Rents are so far ahead of the limits that if one is told to get HAP, one might as well pack one's bags for the hub, albeit there is a queue for that as well. The Minister must answer the question for the people who come to me who have rung 50 places, which is no exaggeration. I tell people now to take note of the number of places they have called. They may have called 80. They face eviction or are in a hub and they are ringing, ringing and ringing. Within the limits or slightly above them, there is nothing. They cannot find anywhere. The number of HAP tenancies secured by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council has plummeted. What does the Minister say to the person who finally finds a place which will take HAP but where the uplift required is beyond what the local authority is willing to give? People cannot find anything else. It is obvious from going on daft.ie or myhome.ie that this is the case. What does the Minister suggest for that person? Unless he or she gets the uplift, he or she is homeless.

I recognise that in Dún Laoghaire, which is the area he represents, there is a particular difficulty in securing HAP tenancies. I can see that when I look at the data. We have a place-finder in place to assist those who are trying desperately to find tenancies as well as offering one month's deposit and the first month's rent. There is a potential need to use HAP in a different way to help those who really cannot find a tenancy. We are working on that to see if something can be done over and above what is being done now to help people into HAP tenancies. Nationally, we have secured 353 HAP tenancies a week so far in 2018. HAP continues, therefore, to be a very important solution for those who are struggling to secure housing. Of 163 HAP tenancies secured in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, 77% needed the additional discretionary payment. That went up to 18% which was still lower than the 20% uplift which is available in the system. When we add in the homeless HAP statistics, 190 tenancies were secured in the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council area. That is 26 benefitting from the homeless HAP, which is 96% of the discretion. The average rate of the discretion above that is 29% when there is a 50% uplift in homeless HAP. When one looks at Dún Laoghaire, not everyone is availing of the additional discretion or needs to and when they do they are not taking it to the maximum. There is still room, even in Dún Laoghaire, to get more from HAP.

He has had a busy evening answering Other Questions. The Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, is excused this time. I raise an issue for towns in west Cork, in particular Castletownbere and Castletownshend, where up to two thirds of the raw sewage they produce is being pumped directly into our harbours. Irish Water has recently received substantial fines for this but, strangely, the company has been allowed a grace period of two years to complete the work necessary to alleviate the problem. This is completely unacceptable and it must be addressed immediately. Two years is far too long a timeframe. I may be biased, but I am firmly of the belief that I represent the most beautiful and picturesque constituency in the whole of Ireland. It is a constituency which relies heavily on tourism and fishing. I am not sure whether the Minister of State has ever visited, but I invite him to come down over the summer when I will personally take him on a tour of the beauty spots. The Minister of State will be aware of the report in The Irish Times on 8 May last on two locations in west Cork, namely Castletownbere, which has a population of 1,300, and Castletownshend, which has a population of 450. In these towns, raw sewage is being pumped unashamedly into their harbours on a daily basis. In 2018, this is totally unacceptable. While Irish Water was to build a water treatment plant for Castletownbere, I understand that this will not now be completed until 2021. There were no previous plans for a similar water treatment plant in Castletownshend, but there is now an agreement to provide one by 2021. In the meantime, a culvert on the beach carries sewage directly into the sea. Following a prosecution for failing to carry out improvements at the respective harbours, Irish Water has received a mere slap on the wrist in the form of a fine. These are two of the most picturesque locations in west Cork and they rely heavily on tourism. The areas are becoming increasingly popular, in part due to their beautiful beaches. I vouch personally for their beauty and would give anything to be there this evening. To make matters worse, oysters from the harbour, which may be eaten raw in normal course, must be treated before consumption. This adds to the work and decreases the profits of those involved in the industry. That the breach of waste water regulations is being tolerated in any circumstance is alarming, but Irish Water is being granted a so-called "grace period" of two years, which is another matter. It is unacceptable. Environmental protection figures advise that between 2000 and 2010, €270 million was invested annually in waste water infrastructure.Between 2011 and 2013 there was a drop of 50% in investment. Although between 2014 and 2015 Irish Water increased the investment in wastewater infrastructure by 22% to €166 million, this was substantially lower than the levels under a Fianna Fáil Government. From 2016 to 2021, the remaining period of Irish Water's business plan, it is ramping up investment to spend an average of €326 million per year on wastewater infrastructure. This investment must be followed through as a matter of priority and I urge that places such as Castletownbere and Castletownshend be dealt with. Other areas such as Rossmore and Shannonvale in the Clonakilty area, along with many other areas, must also be considered with regard to either providing a new wastewater plant or improving existing ones. I will contact the Minister on another occasion about those areas.

I am familiar with the area of west Cork and have spent time there over the years, but after the Deputy's portrayal I will have to return to visit it again. The Deputy could have a job in the tourism sector as well, aside from being a Teachta Dála. However, she has raised an important issue and I thank her for providing me with the opportunity to outline the issues surrounding the matter of raw sewage being pumped into the harbour at Castletownbere and Castletownshend by Irish Water. The urban wastewater treatment directive mandates member states to collect and treat urban wastewater in towns and cities to protect public health and avoid pollution of rivers, lakes and coastal waters. Member states had until the end of 2000 to ensure appropriate treatment for large areas of population above 15,000 and until the end of December 2005 for areas with a population above 2,000 which discharge to freshwaters and estuaries. Since 1 January 2014 Irish Water has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level. Irish Water as a single national public utility is taking a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment, and meeting customer requirements. Irish Water is undertaking significant investment in urban wastewater collection and treatment over the period to 2021 and plans to deliver 255 wastewater treatment projects in urban areas, achieving water quality improvements and compliance with the requirements of the urban wastewater treatment directive. The details of these works are set out in the river basin management plan for Ireland for 2018 to 2021, which the Minister, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, published on 17 April 2018. The priority objective for this river basin planning cycle is to secure compliance with the urban wastewater treatment directive and to contribute to the improvement and protection of waters in keeping with the water quality objectives established in the plan. Castletownbere and Castletownshend are among 38 towns and villages nationwide where untreated sewage is currently discharged to receiving waters, either directly from sewer network outfalls or via septic holding tanks where the level of treatment provided is inadequate. In 2015, Irish Water confirmed that additional wastewater treatment will be provided at five locations in Cork, including Castletownbere and Castletownshend. Both of these urban areas have been identified in the river basin management plan as areas where works will be undertaken during the period of the plan. I am informed by Irish Water that the Castletownbere sewerage scheme will end the discharge of untreated wastewater into Bantry Bay. Irish Water's plan includes the construction of a new wastewater treatment plant as well as the associated sewer network and infrastructure. I am also informed that Irish Water will submit its planning application to Cork County Council later this year. Subject to statutory approvals, construction work on this project will commence in 2020 and be completed in 2021. Irish Water undertook a public information evening recently in Castletownbere on this project. The Castletownshend sewerage scheme is needed to stop untreated wastewater being discharged directly into Castlehaven harbour. I am informed that Irish Water will submit its planning application to Cork County Council this year or early in 2019. Subject to statutory approvals, construction work on this necessary project will also commence in 2020 and be completed in 2021. I am sure Irish Water will do this as quickly as it can but, as the Deputy knows, projects such as these must go through the planning system and public consultation. Irish Water is doing that. These projects were needed many years ago and should have been provided long before now, including by other Governments. However, Irish Water is taking action now and is going through the proper channels to do it. Money has been allocated, planning permission will be required and work will commence in 2020. It is important that will happen. I am glad we are ensuring these 38 areas of high priority are being rectified, and rightly so.

I am glad he admitted that there are inadequate services in parts of west Cork. I am also glad they are part of the plan for the future. The Minister of State said that other Governments could be to blame as well, but we are where we are, as the saying goes. I am one for looking forward rather than looking back. I realise the projects must go through the planning process but I ask the Minister to push these plans forward. It is not fair on the local people to have to live in substandard situations such as this.

However, I did not raise the issue. It was the Deputy who raised the issue of previous Governments, and I wished to clarify that we are taking action now. This matter must be addressed: it is as simple as that. It is not good enough that this still happens in 38 areas in Ireland. Irish Water was established to fix that and it is fixing it. The money has been set aside for this, but it must go through the proper planning process and get community acceptance. Given the urgency of these projects I have no doubt that community acceptance will be easier to achieve than on other projects, but Irish Water must go through that. That is democracy and the right way to do it. Naturally, Irish Water will try to progress through the planning process as quickly as it can. It has been asked to do that by the local authorities and by the Government. The primary function of Irish Water is to provide clean, safe drinking water to its customers and to treat and return wastewater safely to the environment. That is not happening in this case and that is why action is required. In providing these critical services Irish Water plays a role in enabling social and economic growth and in protecting the environment and the health and safety of the public. Irish Water has developed a long-term investment perspective to address strategically the deficiencies in the public wastewater system. It is optimising investment decisions to ensure that it utilises scarce capital by making investments that deliver the best possible improvements for communities. Building water treatment plants and upgrading or building sewerage networks necessarily will require significant investment. Irish Water's capital investment plans for 2014 to 2021 have identified an investment of over €5.5 billion. Some €1.25 billion of this investment will be in improving wastewater infrastructure quality overall, including the required investment in the Castletownbere and Castletownshend schemes. Completion of these projects will mark a hugely important milestone in protecting the environment in both locations, particularly the quality of water in Bantry Bay and Castlehaven harbour. I look forward to those projects being completed soon.

I am disappointed that neither the Minister for Health nor the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who has responsibility for mental health, is present. However, it would make no difference if they were. County Tipperary does not have one psychiatric long-term or any other type of bed. We have a crisis house and great front-line staff, but there is a chronic situation in Tipperary. There are half a dozen children between 11 and 13 years of age, mostly girls, languishing in beds in the paediatric ward in St. Joseph's Hospital in Clonmel. One has been there for 11 weeks, with others there for ten, seven and eight weeks. Their parents are distraught because they have no services. I ask the Minister of State to do something because this is not good enough. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, told me last week that a worldwide shortage of psychiatrists is delaying the delivery of mental health services. He said recruitment, not funding, is the issue in the delays. Last week I pointed out to the HSE that it spends €400 million every year on medication for the treatment of mental health but a mere €10 million on psychological and counselling services. That is the problem. We must spend money on counselling and psychological services and take money away from all the management and mismanagement.

It was shocking to hear many contributors say they were satisfied that their loved ones would be alive today if those beds had been open. The closure of the acute psychiatric unit in St. Michael's in Clonmel in 2012 was wrong and should never have happened. It has turned out to be an absolute disaster, as we warned at the time. The closure was announced without any consultation by the HSE. It was opposed by service users, families, carers, medical consultants, GPs, psychiatric nurses, public representatives and the public. Everybody opposed it because it was wrong, but the then Minister, former Deputy Kathleen Lynch, declared that the closure was written in blood and bulldozed it through. Mental health services in Tipperary, despite the best efforts of the staff, are substandard and not fit for purpose.I appeal to the Minister of State to approve the reopening of acute psychiatric beds in Clonmel.

They feel completely let down by the system. We have no psychiatric beds in our county. Even for people who do get access to a service, whether in Kilkenny or Ennis, it is completely inadequate to cater to their demands. The other point, which was made extremely forcibly by relatives of people suffering from mental health issues, was that when they are released from psychiatric care, the backup services are not there. The mental health clinics that are available are completely under-resourced. We have a complete lack of mental health resources in County Tipperary. We have no beds and we have completely under-resourced mental health clinics in the county. This situation is intolerable and must be addressed. The public anger was palpable in Clonmel last Thursday night. We need a psychiatric unit both in Clonmel and in Nenagh for north Tipperary, and it is essential that this commitment be given immediately. We also need extra resources put into counselling and other services in the mental health clinics in the county.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	233	I thank Deputies Mattie McGrath, Healy and Cahill for raising this very important issue of residential psychiatric care beds in County Tipperary. Mental health care remains a priority in the programme for Government. Since 2012, approximately €200 million, or 28%, has been added to the HSE mental health budget, which now totals more than €910 million. This is a significant investment by any standard. A Programme for a Partnership Government gives a clear commitment to increase our mental health budget annually, as resources allow, to expand and modernise all aspects of the services, including those in Tipperary. HSE mental health funding for Tipperary this year is in the region of €24 million. One of the strategic priorities for mental health in the HSE national service plan for 2018 is to deliver timely, clinically effective and standardised safe mental health services in adherence to statutory requirements. Acute inpatient care to the adult population of north Tipperary, which is in community healthcare organisation, CHO, area 3, is provided between the acute unit in University Hospital Limerick, which has 50 beds, and the acute psychiatric unit in Ennis, which has 39 beds. The 44-bed department of psychiatry based at St. Luke's General Hospital, Kilkenny, is the designated approved centre for acute inpatient services for south Tipperary, which is in CHO area 5. This enables all acute inpatient admissions for this CHO area to be managed at a single site. Referrals to St. Luke's are through a consultant psychiatrist, who makes the clinical decision to admit based on the level of acute presentation or need. In addition to the department of psychiatry, a dedicated psychiatric liaison team operates from the emergency department in St. Luke's. All service users presenting to the emergency department who require psychiatric assessment will receive that assessment within agreed timeframes, in line with relevant guidelines. Onward referral pathways are agreed with all service users upon completion of psychiatric assessment in the emergency department. Pathways can include admission to an acute unit, referral to a relevant community mental health service team or referral back to a patient's own general practitioner, GP. There are a range of other mental health services for adults in Tipperary. These include, for example, psychiatry-of-old-age teams, non-acute beds, day hospitals and day centres. In addition, there are community mental health teams and high, medium and low-support community residences. For those under the age of 18, there are three child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, teams operating in Tipperary, one in north Tipperary and two in south Tipperary. The CAMHS acute units at Éist Linn in Cork and Merlin Park in Galway, which has a total of 42 beds, serve the Tipperary catchment area. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, met Members from Tipperary last week to discuss current and future provision of mental health services in the county, including reviewing bed capacity.

The Minister of State talked about pathways. There are no pathways. These people have nowhere to go. We had to hear all the hopelessness and helplessness of the parents and siblings who spoke at the meeting, although we knew it anyway. There are no beds. There is no space in Kilkenny for us and there is no room in Ennis or Limerick because they are full already. As far as CAMHS is concerned, we heard from the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, last week that the youth and adolescent centre in Cork is shockingly only half occupied because the beds cannot be opened as there is difficulty getting and retaining consultants. If one divides up the figures I read out into the regions, so much money is being presented on mental health but it is all for drugs, treatments and so on. As I said, so little of it is to help people, on aftercare or on psychologists and various therapists to talk to those affected. There is no aftercare. Prevention is better than cure. The money is being mismanaged at an alarming rate. It is a shame for the Minister of State to read out such a report because it is not factual, not right and is insulting to the people who are suffering and our loved ones we have lost.

Patients from south Tipperary have to travel to Kilkenny for inpatient care. North Tipperary patients have to go to Ennis. Neither unit is fit for purpose. The Kilkenny unit is continually overcrowded, there are delayed admissions as a result, there are inappropriate early discharges and there are huge problems with travel for family members to support the patients there. There are huge industrial relations problems with staff; there have already been protests there. Patients are being admitted to the unit in Kilkenny to chairs and couches and some of them sleep on mattresses on the floor. It is simply not good enough. We need beds in Tipperary and we will insist that we get them.

If the Minister of State stopped in any street in any town in Tipperary, from Borrisokane to Carrick-on-Suir, and asked about mental health facilities, he would be told by anyone he stopped on the street that there are none there. He said €24 million was spent on mental health services in Tipperary in 2017. I honestly find it hard to know where it has been spent because the services are just not there. We have a crisis. I was elected to the Dáil in February 2016 and this is the topic on which I have spoken most since then. One of the most potent images I saw last Thursday night was pairs of shoes left at the front of the hall, which represented the people in our county who have committed suicide since 2012. The number of shoes there was frightening in the extreme. As I said already, we listened to family members say that if there was any kind of adequate service, their family members would still be alive. We are getting meetings with Ministers, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has met us on a number of occasions but we need money and services put in place. Shortly after I was elected to this House, we were promised a Jigsaw project by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee. That is over two years ago and that still has not happened. We do not want Ministers agreeing with us; we need money put in place and we need beds now in both north and south Tipperary.

I take their word for it as they were at the recent public meeting. I got the message very loud and clear and I will bring it back to the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, because it is very important we have a debate on money and services on the ground. It is a regular debate. The 2018 mental health budget for south Tipperary is €20.12 million, and for north Tipperary €3.5 million. It is legitimate to ask what we are doing with our money and whether we are getting value for money with these developments, particularly in Tipperary. What I am told and what I see here is that a number of matters are being taken on board including the community mental health teams, the acute day services and day hospitals, the south Tipperary home-based services, the high-support services in Garryshane House in south Tipperary and the crisis respite house. I believe that a permanent crisis respite house building will be developed in Clonmel on the Glenconnor Road, with planning resolved and approved. This has gone for tender and confirmation of funding received. The other very important matter is that the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has committed to review the bed capacity in the Tipperary area.

The school badly needs new accommodation. Good progress has been made in accommodation in the county with many mainstream schools having been built in the last six or seven years. However, the Kolbe centre urgently needs the same. There are 39 pupils with severe and complex intellectual and physical disabilities and very high needs. The staff and board of management are very committed and the parents are also very committed and supportive, but the accommodation is only two solid rooms and eight prefabs which have been added piecemeal over the past 30 years as the school grew and more pupils came in. It started as a very small facility and the problem is that the actual school building has never grown beyond that. All there is is a collection of prefabs, some of which are of very poor quality and are unsuitable as classrooms. There are issues with noise, they are very difficult to heat and some have signs of dampness. I visited the school accompanied by staff and parents and one can see its physical shortcomings. It is a very difficult environment in which the staff must work and try to manage children with special needs. It is very difficult to provide the services for children who have those very complex, considerable needs. I have made the case for the Kolbe school since 2011 when Deputy Ruairí Quinn was the Minister and I make it again today. I welcome the presence of the Minister for Education and Skills to take this issue. It is a very difficult environment for these special needs children to learn or progress in. We all know that children need a good environment in which to learn and grow, but children with such complex needs especially need a good environment. One issue with this school is that because of the pupils' special needs, a lot of space is required for their equipment, of which there is a great deal. It is not only a case of providing a standard classroom such as in a mainstream school. There has been some progress. According to a written answer to a Parliamentary Question on 23 March, the project brief is now being finalised. Can the Minister confirm that is the case? The answer stated it was being finalised and that this was part of the preparatory work necessary to facilitate the progression of the project. Have we moved into that stage? The site has been acquired and I understand the necessary transfers have taken place of contracts and so on and things are ready to move on. We want to see if this can be moved to the next stage. It is in the six year construction programme. Can the Minister confirm that funds are available for this and that money will not be an obstacle in moving the project forward? We need to see some definite movement on this.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23795	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	239	I thank Deputy Stanley for raising this issue with which he is very familiar. Kolbe Special School was originally purpose built in 1984. Time has moved on and its needs have dramatically changed, as Deputy Stanley noted. It has 39 pupils, seven teaching posts and a principal and 16 special needs assistants. It is under the patronage of the Sisters of Charity of Jesus and Mary's service. It caters to children with severe to profound general learning difficulties. A new building has been included in the Department's six year capital programme. It is a 2,265 sq. m single storey building project to include eight classrooms, a general purpose room, library, resource area, woodwork, art room, exercise therapy room and various ancillary spaces. It is envisaged that the new school will increase the capacity from 39 to 48 pupils. Those schedules of accommodation were developed in consultation with the National Council for Special Education. The acquisition of a 1.433 ha site from the HSE was completed last year and the project brief is currently being finalised. The next step is to go to the architectural drawing stage. The project was tentatively in the programme for 2018. I hope my Department will be able to move on to get the project to this next phase. I do not have a specific date as to when that project brief will be finalised. I will seek to find out if any more progress has been made on that. The Department clearly recognises the need for this development for children who have very particular needs. Money is not the constraint. We are making sure that every penny we get is spent and projects are continually being developed. Each one is developed through all the stages as quickly as possible so that we have a good pipeline of projects for the funds, so it is not a question of it being delayed for financial reasons, it is a project that we are keen to progress with. My Department will try to give a roadmap to the school so that as soon as the project brief is finalised it can anticipate the likely timescales of the different stages. However, one can never predict with absolute accuracy because of issues that might arise with the site or planning, for instance. Nevertheless, my Department will endeavour to push it on as quickly as possible.

I can assure him that Laois County Council is very active with school applications and does everything to move them quickly, so I do not foresee problems in the planning process. I welcome that the Department has completed the acquisition of the site. That is very good news as it is often the problem in other areas. However, the reply is disappointing in that it is very similar to the reply in March, in that the project brief is now being finalised. The Minister said he would ask his Department. I want him to be a bit more assertive with his officials. We both know that unless things are moved on and given a political push, particularly from a Minister, that they do not happen very quickly. I plead with the Minister to ask his senior officials to become active on this, to move it on and complete the project brief. That cannot take much longer. It has been sitting there for some time and I say that with respect to the Minister, but it should be ready to be signed off on by now. According to the written answers I have followed on this, it is going on since last December. It should be moved on to the architectural planning stage. From what the Minister said, I take it that money is not a problem which is excellent to hear. I am delighted. It is a very special case. I acknowledge that progress has been made with mainstream schools. During the noughties when there was loads of money, it was used to rent prefabs and we had them all over the place, but in the past six or seven years a lot of new schools have been built, which is good news, and County Laois has benefitted greatly. I ask the Minister to work with his officials and try to move the project on, to get some definite progress, to finalise the project brief and to sign off on it and move to the architectural planning process.I assure the Minister that, when it comes to schools and vital infrastructure in Laois, the county council will not delay the planning process by one day.

It has completed more than 200 new schools and 175,000 places have been provided in either new or replacement schools. That is a substantial increase on what had been there. There is a pipeline of projects being driven forward all the time within that programme. It is not a question of the Department waiting to be told to move on. It is moving these projects forward as quickly as possible all of the time. However, there can be unforeseen delays. I will seek for the Deputy an update as to what exact work is left to complete in the project brief stage in order that he might have some assurance that it is moving along.

The net effect of what is proposed is that, on 30 June, the defined benefit scheme will be changed to a defined contribution scheme. This means that there will be an immediate loss of more than one third of the pensions the people involved were entitled to expect. The transfer from a defined benefit scheme to a defined contribution model also means that the risk attaching to the pension will be transferred from the company to the employees and that the latter may well lose more than 35% depending on the vagaries of the market. None of the employees wants this. There has already been some industrial action and there is further industrial action threatened, even though these people are not the type of workers who usually engage in such action. We have long lamented the fact that wealthy, solvent companies are entitled to walk away from defined benefit schemes despite the fact that their employees have paid into those schemes year in, year out. Some of the 1,200 workers to whom I refer have been paying into the scheme for a lifetime. When we talk about such situations, we normally refer to a solvent company walking away from a pension scheme in which the liabilities exceed the assets. In this case, not only is the company hugely profitable - so profitable, in fact, that it is in a position to transfer more than €200 million per year to its Canadian shareholders - the pension scheme is eminently healthy. I am informed that the scheme is €240 million in surplus. It seems perverse that a company of such magnitude and profitability can penalise its Irish workers in order to increase the dividend to its wealthy shareholders in Canada. In 2017, we put forward legislation which would prevent that sort of thing from happening. At the time, the then Minister for Social Protection and current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, told me various things here on the floor of the House. He more or less told me that the sky would fall in if we attempted to take such action, all the while blithely ignoring the fact that other jurisdictions - not least our nearest neighbour, the United Kingdom - have in place the sort of protection to which I refer. The Bill in question subsequently passed Second Stage. Of course, it has since disappeared into the Bermuda triangle with thousands of other Bills that were put forward here in good faith.

Instead of Government saying that it will vote something down, it simply says that it will get back to it. That is the difference. The Social Welfare Bill 2017 introduced by the current Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, originally included some provisions relating to defined benefit pension schemes. These were removed on the basis that they would be put back in again on Committee Stage in substantially the same form. That is something which I do not understand. Is the Minister of State aware of the plight of 1,200 Irish Life workers? Is he aware of the fact that there are many rumours to the effect that other companies, particularly in the insurance sector, will follow suit if Irish Life gets away with this? Does he envisage that the legislation the Government is proposing, Committee Stage of which is to be taken 31 May, will be in place in time to save the situation? Even if it is in place before 30 June, will it be strong enough to do so?

I am very much aware of the concern highlighted by the announcement of the closure of the Irish Life pension scheme to future accrual. It is common knowledge that the scheme is very financially secure and that its assets adequately cover all liabilities that will arise in the event that the trustees take a decision to close the scheme. However, the closure of the scheme does not mean that its members will not receive pensions. First, the pensions accrued to date are secure. Additionally, those members concerned will also be beneficiaries of the new defined contribution scheme to which the company is contributing for them. Even where a scheme is closed to new members or to future accrual of benefits, the sponsoring employer's role continues in respect of that scheme. Finally, members will receive the level of contributory State pension commensurate with their social insurance contributions once they reach pension age. It is important to note that neither the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection nor the Pensions Authority has the power under existing legislation to intervene to freeze the winding-up of a scheme or to compel the employer to make contributions to a scheme. As we all know, the number of defined benefit, DB, pension schemes has declined in recent years. The decline of DB schemes accelerated during the financial crisis to the extent that the whole pension sector was possibly at risk. In recent years the Government has amended pension legislation to protect the pension sector and ensure fairer and more equitable outcomes for all members of schemes. Almost all Irish DB schemes have a rule that allows the employer to cease making contributions, usually after a notice period. At present, there is no legislative obligation on the employer to make contributions and no further liability on the employer where contributions cease. Neither is there an obligation on the employer to give notice to members or to consult in advance of ceasing contributions. However, in circumstances where a restructuring of benefits is proposed, pensioners, deferred scheme members and unions must be kept informed by trustees. Furthermore, changes made in 2015 require trustees to notify groups representing the interests of pensioners and deferred scheme members in a scheme in such a situation. The roadmap for pensions reform, which was published recently by the Government, details specific measures that will modernise our pensions system. Under strand 4, entitled "Measures to Support the Operation of Defined Benefit Schemes", the roadmap sets out that the Government is committed to advancing the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017. The purpose of the defined benefit pension measures in this Bill is to respond to the ongoing difficulties in schemes and to increase protections for members as well as encouraging employers to ensure that schemes are funded and managed well. As Deputy O'Dea is aware, the general scheme of the social welfare and pensions Bill 2017, which is now the Social Welfare, Pensions and Civil Registration Bill 2017, was published in May 2017 and proposed a number of key measures relating to defined benefit pension schemes. To ensure that an employer cannot walk away from the pension scheme at short notice, it is proposed to provide a 12-month notification period where an employer seeks to cease making contributions to a scheme. In order to seek a middle road between the current position, whereby employers can abandon DB schemes, and full and immediate debt on employer provisions, it is proposed that, where a scheme is in deficit and a funding proposal is not put in place in a timely manner, the Pensions Authority be allowed direct steps to be taken to ensure that the scheme meets the funding standard. The general scheme also proposed more frequent monitoring of the financial position of schemes. It is important to note that if this new legislation is enacted, a scheme will have to give a minimum notice period of 12 months before contributions can be stopped. However, provided the scheme meets the minimum funding standard, it will not prevent a company from ceasing contributions once the minimum notice period is served. These proposed legislative provisions are quite technical and very complex.Work to finalise them is at an advanced stage. The Department hopes to be in a position to bring forward the amendments on Committee Stage at the end of May or in early June. It hopes that, with the co-operation of the Oireachtas, it can pass the legislation before the summer recess.

That said, what we want to bear in mind here is that the workers in Irish Life, or GWL, as it is now called, are watching this debate because they face the prospect of huge cuts to their pensions. What the Minister of State says is not correct strictly speaking. Of course the pensions of people already in receipt of them are secure but the pensions of future pensioners, namely, those still working for the company who have yet to retire, will not be secure because of the change from defined benefits to defined contributions. The financial impact has been carefully worked out. The Minister of State says there is new legislation that does not allow people to walk away at short notice but the point is that it allows them to walk away. It allows them to walk away if they give 12 months' notice, which is not much good to the pensioners in Irish Life or any other group. The people affected are facing an appalling vista. Not only are they facing the loss of more than one third of the pension they were led to expect and for which they have paid but, because of their being transferred to a defined contribution system, they are also facing the possible loss of their entire pension at some time in the future. As I stated, it depends on the vagaries of the market. We are all too well aware of those. The Minister of State cannot tell me that the legislation, despite its being Government legislation, will be in place by 30 June. It is hoped that the legislation will be enacted by the summer recess. To the best of my knowledge, the summer recess will not be until some time in July. All that was expressed was a hope. I spoke to representatives of the trade union representing the affected people today. They are most anxious to meet the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, so they can explain their position to her face to face and explain what exactly is involved. I urge the Minister of State earnestly to ask his colleague, bearing in mind that there has been a request for some time for a meeting, to meet the people face to face. We are talking about real people losing a substantial chunk of the money they were expected to receive on retirement. It is a very real problem.

There are 1,200 workers and they have been paying into their scheme for a lifetime. If they are facing the loss of one third of their pensions, we must take it very seriously. I also take on board the Deputy's points on the risk issue. The Deputy said the company had a profit of €200 million, going to shareholders, and that the pension scheme value was in the region of €240 million. There is protection needed for the workers. With regard to the legislation, the Minister is determined to have it enacted by the end of May, or by June. I will raise the other issues with the Minister. If the representatives of the unions representing the staff would like to meet her, I will request it. It is not acceptable to have 1,000 workers in the circumstances described. We have to act. The legislation is really a priority.

Amendments Nos. 1 to 4, inclusive, are related and may be discussed together.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	250	I move amendment No. 1:In page 9, between lines 4 and 5, to insert the following:"(iv) in paragraph (k), by the insertion of "including safety implications arising from neighbouring states nuclear programmes" after "fit",".We are seeking to amend the principal Act. We need to have in place a reporting mechanism on the safety implications of neighbouring states' nuclear programmes, particularly that of Britain. In Britain, there are five new nuclear power plants on the west coast. That has serious implications for this country. Parts of Britain are only 17 or 20 miles from the coast of Ireland. The plants have the potential to have a devastating effect on the environment, human health, the quality of water in the Irish Sea, and a range of other things. There has been consultation recently on the Hinkley Point nuclear power plant. It only materialised, however, because of the actions of NGOs, voluntary organisations and other states, not because of any action by the Irish or British Governments. That is disappointing. We must be very vigilant in protecting our environment and we must be very careful to ensure human health. Considerable issues arise over nuclear waste. If anything goes wrong on the other side of the Irish Sea, we will be left very vulnerable in this State. I urge the Government and all parties to support the amendment, which seeks the insertion of "including safety implications arising from neighbouring states nuclear programmes" between lines 4 and 5, in page 9. It is a very small amendment but it would have a huge effect on monitoring. We are talking about developing renewable energy. It is right to have interconnectors but we need to be real about our commitment to clean energy. Nuclear energy is not clean energy because there is waste. People do not see the fumes coming out of the big stacks or the huge amount of waste being dumped in landfill sites, but that does not mean the energy is clean because it is not. Anybody who has been in or around any of the nuclear reactors in England will tell one that. I have seen them. I saw the Torness one being built. There are considerable implications for our health and environment in Ireland, and also for fish life and everything else in the Irish Sea. With regard to the importation of electricity, I am not arguing against having interconnectors, particularly the interconnector with the North, but we should not become over-reliant or any way reliant on imported electricity generated by nuclear power while at the same time claiming we are so great because we are nuclear free in this State. There is a bit of hypocrisy in that regard. We need to take our responsibility seriously in this matter in terms of reducing dependency on nuclear-generated power by developing our own sources. A wide range of sources must be developed. This is a matter that the Oireachtas and the Government must take on board. We must keep pushing on a weekly basis to ensure progress. I urge the House to support the amendment. It is very important. It is important that we protect the environment, human health and human life.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	251	We had a useful discussion on Committee Stage about this and a very useful meeting with the Minister's officials since then. I appreciate and welcome the attention paid by the Minister and others to radon and to implementing various measures in this regard. As the Minister said on Committee Stage, six people per week are contracting fatal cancers as a result of this issue going unchecked. We must all pay attention to it. Since Committee Stage, there has been a very interesting and useful hearing by the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government at which representatives of various Irish NGOs made the case for a much more detailed submission under the Espoo Convention mechanisms allowing us to engage in public consultation on the British nuclear programme. The Government has been remiss in not taking the opportunity to track that work and in not taking responsibility in this regard. The amendments would have the same effect in terms of seeking to compel the Minister and the Department to report annually to the Oireachtas on the national radon control strategy. Amendment No. 4, the third of my three amendments, seeks to ensure that the Government will be advised on the risk to Ireland from other nuclear programmes, be they military or nuclear energy programmes. I raise those two issues in order to highlight the need for us to put the focus on our national radon control strategy. I am aware of the activities of the bodies carrying out that work but the amendments seek to ensure that they will report on it to the Oireachtas. In my view, that would bestow greater import and attention on such work. The second issue is to compel the Government not to just ignore the issue of nuclear safety when it comes to neighbouring jurisdictions - be it in the context of military or nuclear energy programmes - but, rather, to assess that risk, engage in the consultation process, which we have not been doing, and to represent the Irish people in that way. That is the import of the three amendments I have presented.
#MichaelHealyRae	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-party	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-dob	unknown-#MichaelHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	252	I wish to speak on these amendments because some of them are very important. It is not every day that Deputy Eamon Ryan and I agree on something. However, we do agree on the national radon control strategy and any successor to it. During the years I have been involved in politics, I have come across issues relating to radon gas levels that have educated me a great deal. In terms of the difficulties that have arisen, people have died and it was determined that the radon gas levels in their homes contributed strongly to their deaths. When we are talking about issues of this nature, we must remember that. This is a serious problem. With proper building controls in place, we would hope that problem is being held at bay and that proper preventative measures are being put in place. Speaking to these amendments, nationally and strategically, and in terms of the bigger picture, we must have policies in place to deal with the risk posed by radon gas, the problems to which it gives rise and the costs associated with it. Major costs have been incurred in controlling radon gas levels and in putting a strategy in place. However, we must get on with doing the necessary work. In that context, implementation of the strategy is very important. In the context of surveying homes across the State that are at risk, I know that a number of what I would call black spots have been identified in the county in which I reside. No more than naming an individual in the Dáil, which the Ceann Comhairle always says we should not do, it is not appropriate for me to name specific townlands. Their names were in the public domain previously but I will not name them now because I do not want to be the cause of devaluing property in those areas. Suffice it to say that we do have a number of black spots. They are well known to us. I can only speak for my county. Other Deputies can speak about their areas. It is a concern and a problem. I mentioned property prices but the value of property is nothing compared to people's lives. I knew mothers who are no longer with us as a result of radon gas poisoning. I know those cases personally. The issue of safety is the most important consideration. That is the reason some of these amendments, which have been well thought out by the Deputies who brought them forward, very much deserve to be supported. In terms of radioactive materials and what happens in neighbouring countries, when we cannot see something and it is not in front of our noses, we might not worry about it. However, I am sure many people who were near the Chernobyl plant at the time of the disaster there did not think that it had anything to do with them. Subsequently, they realised the awfulness that is continuing to this day and the horrendous consequences it had on people at that time. There are those who were not even born at the time of the disaster at Chernobyl who are now being affected. If we consider our close neighbours across the sea and how near we are in the context of any potential problems that might arise in the future, we, as legislators, would be very negligent if, when discussing this matter, we did not say that we must be extremely vigilant and proactive. We must have our say, plan ahead and be very vocal in protecting our people. If we consider the relevant distance in miles, then, potentially, we are very close to being in harm's way if things do not always run smoothly. When we are talking about nuclear energy, problems can occur at any time. While modern methods of dealing with the safety aspects of such energy are very much to the fore - this was not the case when the incident at the Chernobyl plant took place - accidents can happen at any time. When discussing our future energy needs - that is probably not a debate to have in the context of this Bill - I know that we are looking at other sustainable methods of generating power into the future and of trying to ensure that we will be able to meet those needs. To return to the amendments, Deputy's Stanley's amendments and those tabled by Deputy Eamon Ryan, amendments Nos. 1 to 5, inclusive, are very important and deserve the full consideration of the House. On the radon gas aspect, I do not believe that either the Government or Minister could ever be accused of being overprotective of people's homes. In other words, the Minister should take any and every opportunity, whether through media campaigns or in other ways, to encourage people to get their homes tested. People spend a great deal of money on their homes. The Minister currently has in place a great scheme in respect of energy efficiency. What I would call substantial grants are being made available under that scheme. The Minister is a very imaginative person and I ask him to be proactive in helping the people of the country in respect of the issue to which the legislation relates. When it comes to drawing down grants, it might be no harm to subtly encourage people to get their homes tested for radon gas. If it saved one life, would that not be a big deal and a great achievement?

The results relating to some of the houses of which I am aware and which were tested subsequent to people dying prematurely - their deaths having been attributed to radon gas - were frightening. The level of radon gas above the norm was frightening to the extent that, in many cases, people were unable to stay in their homes without substantial works being carried out. I would like to hear the Minister say whether he could tie that into one of his existing schemes. He could inform people that there is a minor qualifying criterion requiring them to get their homes tested.

I do not know the cost of testing for radon gas but what I have suggested would be a worthwhile measure.The Government encourages people to be safe in every other way.

Fianna Fáil continues to support the Bill. It is a sensible and much-needed Bill that makes a lot of sense. A risk-based approach and the mitigation of threats are essential to the Bill. The amendments appear quite sensible and to concern the risk mitigation of the radon threat. They appear to strengthen and enhance our precautions and measures against same. I will await the Minister's response and the Department's views but the amendments appear to make a lot of sense. There is a reference to neighbouring states and risks to the Irish environment arising from other states with nuclear programmes, be they military or related to the production of energy. I am not sure whether it is a geographic risk or whether it concerns energy union, increasing interconnection and the importation of energy from any sources. Is there anything to consider in that regard? Is it geographic constraints or where the energy comes from that is pertinent?  I again voice broad support for the amendments but I await the official response. I acknowledge the Committee Stage debate where issues like the situation of chiropractors and medical physicists were discussed. I thank the Minister, the Department and officials for their very helpful advice on that point. They took on board the points that were raised. It has been an excellent debate to date and I am sure this evening will be the same as well.

I thank the committee and all involved in bringing it to this very crucial Stage. We have heard about five planned new nuclear power plants. Deputy Eamon Ryan is much more adept at talking about this area than I am but there is one significant issue in my region. It concerns overhead pylons and power lines to transmit power from Whitegate in Cork to Wexford. The communities there have huge issues with that. There has been a debate around underground versus overground for the interconnector and the fact that we never looked at the option of taking it from the sea. It might be strange in respect of the amendments but it comes back to nuclear power. Amendment No. 1 in the name of Deputy Stanley addresses safety implications arising from neighbouring states' nuclear programmes. It is very important. Amendment No. 2 concerns an annual report to the Oireachtas on the implementation of the national radon control strategy or any successor strategy. It is vital. We do not know what we are doing. We are shooting in the dark as regards the nuclear industry. I certainly am, and I do not believe our regulatory industry is up to speed with what is going on. We all remember Chernobyl and its horrible implications. I wish to talk about a great cailín from Clonmel, Adi Roche, and the work her organisation has done. We welcomed na daoine óga that came to Clonmel. They have been coming to Tipperary and other areas all over the country for nigh on 30 years. It is vital that we are cognisant of what happened and what can happen. Some of our very near neighbours are proposing to build new nuclear plants. It is vital that we have a recording mechanism and an input under EU regulations, that we are kept abreast of accidents in those plants and that safety standards are kept at an all-time high. It should be a belt-and-braces scenario whereby we are over-safe and over-zealous. I also salute the non-governmental organisations, NGOs, in our country and throughout the world for the work they have done and the information they have provided us with. They have left many State agencies in the hind tit position, in that they brought us up to speed. We ended up learning a lot about the inadequacies in those places due to pressure from them and through the media. It is incumbent on us to get this right. I fully support the amendments because we cannot have enough regulation, monitoring and insistence that these are run properly. Amendment No. 4 concerns advising the Government, the Minister and other Ministers about the risks to the Irish environment, population, society and economy from ionising radiation and radiation sources in countries with military nuclear programmes or nuclear energy programmes or both, including the risks of accidental or unplanned releases of radioactive materials. The only issue I would have with this amendment is that I would put population before environment. Nobody ever released something deliberately. It is the accidents that are the problem. We have no access to see how well maintained these plants are; obviously, they were built to certain standards but that was fadó, fadó. Standards have changed and the request for standards has changed. Above all, we need to protect our people. The environment is very important but it is second to our people. I can remember clearly being in a certain place and a certain vehicle two mornings after Chernobyl and having to get out three times to use my jumper to wipe black dust off my windscreen over a two-hour period. I could not believe it. I did not know what it was. None of us knew. At that time, it was discovered that the sheep in the Knockmealdown Mountains, which is in the area I represent, were the most radioactive sheep in the country. Their eyes rotted out of their heads.

We were not told. There were no warnings or checks. I like to think it was funny but I lost two first cousins who were herding those sheep. They had the most terrible deaths. We were all told about the Cooley Mountains at the time but in the fullness of time, we found out that the most highly radioactive sheep were in the Knockmealdown Mountains. The thing literally melted out of their eyes and people may have consumed the meat. People were using open water supplies but we were not told to be careful. People were not told not to drink it. We were behind the game. This is my point about this Bill, namely, we need to be ever vigilant. We cannot allow anything like that to ever happen again. Government agencies must up the ante both here and in our sister countries in Europe and insist that the most rigorous testing is used in these plants. We should make observations because it is in the interests of our people, animal life and environment. That happened. I lived through that time. Thankfully, I was in the car for most of the day when it happened so I might not have inhaled much of the ash but it was very serious. It was quarter or half an inch thick and we should consider what the results were in respect of sheep and beef cattle grazing the land. We had no idea the impact it had on the wildlife and never will.

Sadly, I believe one family lost three members. Since then, the local authority has been more proactive in insisting that radon barriers are put in place to diminish any further effects when building a new house. In three cases people wanted to knock down their old house and build a new house in order to install all these radon barriers, only to be told that the heritage section of the local authority wanted to leave the houses standing. It took a fair amount of persuasion to ensure that these people were allowed to do what they intended to do initially, which was to demolish the old house and to build a new house with all the protection they could have from radon gas. I wanted to get in those important points. We seem to be talking a lot in this Chamber, and rightfully so, about protecting life. People can also lose their lives from these and have done in the two matters I raised.

He will have a network across the country. I thank the three colleagues for raising the very important issue of radon. Deputies Eamon Ryan, Stanley and Lawless raised the issue early on in the passage of this legislation. On foot of that, we will introduce a pilot scheme specifically looking at testing. Deputy Michael Healy-Rae asked me about the cost. The cost of testing it will be between €40 and €50. Where it is identified, we will need to carry out works and we are putting a pilot scheme in place on foot of which we intend to roll out a grant scheme across the country. However, I need to get this legislation enacted if we are to proceed with that plan. I hope Deputies will facilitate me in doing so. The Government opposes amendments Nos. 1 and 4 as both the principle and detail behind them are already set out in section 7 of the principal Act. Paragraph 1(d) assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to "advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government on radiological safety matters relating to the transport, use storage, maintenance and disposal of radiation sources wheresoever located". Paragraph 1(c) further assigns the general function to the Environmental Protection Agency to "advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government and the public, on measures for the protection of individuals in the State from radiological hazards". Paragraph (1)(k) assigns the function to the agency to provide information to the public on any matters relating to radiological safety which the agency deems fit. The function of the Environmental Protection Agency to advise the Government, the Minister and other Ministers of the Government and the public on radiological safety matters is comprehensive and is not restricted by the geographic location, type or purpose of the radiation source. The amendments as drafted would bring no additional clarity to the functions of the agency as an advisory body. They include a number of undefined and unclear terms which may be open to legal interpretation and could impede the agency in delivering on its mandate. It would undermine the stated purpose of the amendments. While I support the principles of those amendments, they are already provided for in the legislation. A number of other questions were raised on the UK's nuclear build programme. The UK Government has identified up to eight locations for the construction of new nuclear plants by 2025. Five of these locations are on the Irish Sea coast at Moorside, Heysham, Wylfa, Oldbury and Hinckley Point. The remaining three locations, Hartlepool, Sizewell and Bradwell, are on Britain's east coast. Ireland's published position is that, while not a nuclear energy-producing country, we acknowledge the right of states to determine their own energy mix. However, we expect that where a state chooses to develop a nuclear power industry, this is done in line with the highest international standards with respect to safety and environmental protection. Since 2009, the Irish Government has been aware of the UK's plan to build nuclear power stations at sites judged as potentially suitable. There is regular contact at official level on a range of nuclear matters between Ireland and the UK. The contact is formalised in the biannual meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radiological matters. This group includes departmental officials and representatives of the regulatory bodies, the United Kingdom's Office for Nuclear Regulation and our Environmental Protection Agency office of radiological protection. Ireland has been actively involved in the consultation process on the proposed new building programme including Hinckley Point C, which is a standing agenda item on meetings of the UK-Ireland contact group on radiological matters. Comments on the Moorside plant were also submitted and a meeting subsequently held with the developers of that project. The Government asked the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland, now merged with the EPA, to prepare a report on the potential radiological implications for Ireland from the proposed nuclear power plants in the United Kingdom. A principal finding of the report published in May 2013 is that the routine operation of the proposed nuclear power plants will have no measurable radiological impact on Ireland or the Irish marine environment. This report continues to inform Irish engagement on new UK nuclear build programme.

There is waste from these plants. They will be close to the seafront. There is huge potential for damage to the Irish Sea. The Minister quoted the principal Act. We have looked at the principal Act and believe the amendment should stand. I had tabled amendments on radon which were ruled out of order. I will be supporting the Green Party's amendment No. 2 on the matter. Radon gas in people's homes is a huge issue. I note from the Minister's reply that there is to be a pilot scheme. I note that it is only in County Roscommon.

There are high-risk areas in north County Offaly, Laois and many other counties.I ask the Minister for a sample of the homes in those areas to be taken in order to inform the situation. He and I know that anything built before 2005 was built without a radon barrier. As a result, the people in such homes are at risk. We cannot ignore the fact radon is the second biggest cause of lung cancer, as the Minister stated in the Chamber a month ago. While I do not want to take a political swipe at him, it is important that the test is made more representative and that it is not just carried out in County Roscommon and part of east Galway. It would be beneficial to take samples throughout the State. I encourage the Minister to have samples taken in north Offaly and Laois.

I thought the Government would have given more consideration to this because, as far as I can see, it is very well thought out and I would have thought that the Government would be in a position to support it. Ultimately, what neighbouring states do with their nuclear programmes is as important to us as it is to their own people. If our own Government was engaged in a programme of nuclear energy, it would be incumbent on every one of us to have a say on it and, as legislators, we would be entitled to be involved in the formation of a plan relating to it. We do not, however, have such a programme and we are not, therefore, the masters of our own destiny because we are relying on the safety measures and precautions that other countries put in place and we are completely beholden to them. I would have thought Deputy Stanley's amendment would have been one the Department could look at more closely. I would like to say more on the issue of radon but I will wait until the debate on amendments Nos. 6 and 7, which, I presume, we will go through in detail due to their importance. Discussing radon in the context of those amendments would be more appropriate. In the context of the Minister's reply, I am very unhappy with this being completely dismissed in the way it has been. I would like the Minister and his officials to reconsider the position on it.

In our own lives, we all have to be cognisant of our neighbours, who are better than family to many of us. Amendment No. 1 proposes the insertion of "including safety implications arising from neighbouring states nuclear programmes” after the word “fit”. We have to do this. What is the point of having agencies if we do not insist, as we are entitled to do, that we have proper input into what goes on? We are not discussing some industrial building; it is a nuclear plant. We have a desperate and tragic history in this regard and we do not want it repeated. I do not see how any neighbouring state would not welcome an input from us. In fairness, any planning application for a major industry must have an environmental impact statement and outside evaluation. While we have changed this in order that projects go directly to An Bord Pleanála, all the experts are wheeled in nonetheless. I do not pretend to be an expert but I know that we learned a costly lesson. We must ensure we do not have any more costly lessons. We must ensure that our voice is heard, that our agencies are fit for purpose and that we are not depending on our non-governmental organisations to go out in ships and flotillas to bring this matter to media attention. We need to be awake, to have our antennae up, to be cognisant of what is going on around us and, above all, to have an input in order that there would be safeguards in place for our people if anything were to go wrong.

Places like Louth and Wexford, and all the coastline in between, are very close to Britain. It could be much more troublesome if England finally leaves the European market because we will have less of a say. The west coast of England is almost as near to the east coast of Ireland as Dublin is to Galway if one looks at it in that way. It is very important that we would monitor this and have a say, which is what I am demanding. We need to protect Irish people who are living on this island. As a Government and as a Parliament, we cannot dismiss the threat of a nuclear station being built in close proximity to our country and the adverse effect it might have on people living here or trying to do so.

The Minister mentioned a pilot scheme. Perhaps every politician representing a constituency could speak on high levels of cancer in their own communities. I have always felt there is a high level of cancer, particularly lung cancer, in west Cork. The fact radon gas is thought to be the second most prevalent cause of lung cancer after smoking must direct us towards what the Minister has called a pilot scheme. I would appreciate it if that pilot scheme could be brought to areas of west Cork in order that we might discover what levels of radon are there. To go back many years, I remember getting a little package with a little unit inside. I was fairly young at the time but I am 99% sure it was in regard to radon. I would like to know what results that exercise revealed in respect of each county. If radon is prevalent in a community, can the level be lowered and, if so, how? Overall, if there is a pilot scheme in other areas, regardless of where they are, it is important that the scheme be brought to all the different parts of the country, especially south-west Cork, particularly in view of the fact that I have very serious concerns that further research is needed in the context of tackling the unfortunate incidence of cancer in my area which has given rise to upset and hardship in many communities. I would appreciate it if the Minister would consider that. Where the funding will come from, I cannot say, and that is something the Minister will have to find out for us. When it comes to public health, however, it is important that the pilot scheme is brought to many other counties.

It is unfair criticism as far as we are concerned. We contend that we did not recommit the Bill and we did not ask that it be recommitted. We attended on Committee Stage and asked to discuss some of our amendments on different mornings but we were not allowed to do so. We just got stonewalling. The Minister, Deputy Ross, did not have it ready. All the blame cannot be apportioned to us, the Rural Independents, or whatever the Minister called us this morning - I think it was "the lost cause". We are elected by the people of Tipperary, Cork, Kerry and many other areas. The people who will decide if we are a lost cause will be the electorate in our constituencies. I am thankful we have elections and not a dictatorship. Last week, I appealed to the Minister to reconsider branding us as road traffic terrorists. It has awful connotations, especially in the current climate worldwide. I hope he has reflected over the weekend and perhaps in his opening remarks tonight he might withdraw those comments although they were not made in this House. My colleague, Deputy Danny Healy-Rae, who was named, has his own views.  I appeal to the Minister's greater judgment to allow us to have our debate. We feel that parts of this Bill are unworkable and legislation that is unworkable is not good legislation. Legislation implemented in this House must pass a litmus test that there must be relatively broad agreement. We will never get unanimous agreement or anything near that but there must be a majority in agreement and have goodwill to have any legislation accepted and, indeed, self-policed. No police force in the world can police without the support of the general public. I refer to the proposal to amend the Road Traffic Act 2016 to repeal section 39 and the proposal to amend the Road Traffic Act 2010 to rectify certain technical errors in sections 13A and 13B. We were certainly not responsible, nor was the Minister when he was in opposition, for any technical errors. We are the people who live in and represent rural Ireland. I refer also to the proposal to amend the Road Traffic Act 1994 to provide for the detention by An Garda Síochána of a vehicle being driven by an unaccompanied learner driver. I have been contacted by many people over last week and the weekend. I referred in the main previously to na daoine óga, the young people, but I have been contacted by people aged from their 30s to their 70s about this issue.  One woman is in her 80s and she is driving with an L plate. She is very concerned about the legislation. She is a law-abiding citizen and has never done any harm to anyone, thankfully. She wants to finish out her days in relative peace. She does not want to be excluded from social interaction with her peers in her local village - playing cards, getting necessary provisions to live and exist and indeed going to Mass. That is all she uses the car for. I have long called for insurance companies, on issues like this, to charge payment on the kilometres driven. This woman might not drive 100 km in a month, and she does not. I refer to the proposal to amend the Road Traffic Act 1961 to provide for an offence by the owner of a mechanically propelled vehicle which is driven by an unlicensed driver - the unlicensed driver should not be on the road and I have no problem with that - or by a learner driver who, contrary to regulations, is not accompanied by a qualified driver; and for consequential amendment of the Long Title to reflect the content of the Bill. That is the cause of the delay because the Bill was recommitted in respect of those provisions and we are entitled to deal with them. We are now discussing amendments Nos. 4 to 21, inclusive, and No. 28. That is where we are at now. I did not want to come in here last week to give a history lesson to anyone, but the inadequacies in this area and the sheer inability of people, young and old, but mainly young people, to get a driving test in my constituency, my county and many other counties is simply shocking.I want those issues to be dealt with before we legislate. If those people cannot get a date for a driving test, how can they prove they are fit to drive without an accompanying driver? I heard an item on Tipp FM this morning and subsequently made contact with a Mr. Thomas Ryan from Thurles. His 23 year old daughter went to do a test last week. She had her car for three years and was learning to drive, like most young people. She had done the required lessons and indeed had taken a second lot of lessons. She is a very careful driver. Her car passed the NCT two Fridays ago. She then went to do her test on the following Tuesday. The car was not driven between passing the NCT and her trip to the test centre. The inspector at the test centre carried out a visual inspection, opening the bonnet. It is important that people understand how a car is propelled mechanically and where all the different parts that need to be regularly checked are, including water, oil and the battery. The inspector noticed that a cap on the expansion tank - not the radiator or the overflow tank - was missing. It had been missing since the car was bought. Mr. Ryan is a mechanic himself. The inspector refused to do the test and failed that applicant, who was devastated. She had spent almost €1,000 on lessons, had purchased the car, insured it, run it and learned to drive it. After presenting for the test, having waited for six months, she was dismissed. When her father contacted the RSA, he was told that the tester has more power than the NCT people.  I asked the Minister earlier about the NCT process and the buildings the RSA rents, and asserted that every provider is operating illegally because they are outside health and safety legislation. I am asking the Minister for a third time to tell me whether I am talking balderdash or if I am correct. Has there been any investigation? Is the RSA totally above the law when it comes to the operation of these centres? Mr. Ryan was told that the tester had the right to fail his daughter's car. Road testing of vehicles should be totally overhauled, and there should be a fair advisory issued. The NCT passed the car, but if a problem is spotted during the NCT there is a fair advisory issued where the owner is asked to get something fixed and then return to be certified. Mr. Ryan's daughter will now have to pay another €55 for another test. Money is not growing in the back garden for these people. We are not talking about mushrooms growing in a shed. The girl had a job offer and she had to turn it down. She is a single parent and now has to mind her child without a car. She has given up the ghost, considering all of the issues she experienced. She had to get the lessons and then get the appointment for the test. Incidentally, she then had to wait a month before she could get a new test. She is now not going to bother; she feels the Minister, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the RSA are vilifying her by passing this legislation, putting her off the road and locking her in her home. She has no access to buses or to the Luas. She does not have access to the rural bus link that the Minister was talking about this weekend. She cannot get access to her work or to schools by train. Does the Minister or his officials have any thoughts about the impact this legislation will have on these particular families? The girl is lucky to have her father and family to help her out, but many of the people I am talking about are living alone.  There must surely be question marks about NCTs. This girl had her NCT certificate. The car did not travel more than 40 km between the NCT centre and arriving at the test centre, but on a cursory look under the bonnet the test was failed. That incident had nothing to do with the girl's ability to drive. Driving skills should be tested on the road. The process of testing should be examined as well; the test is only a snapshot in time and is dependent on traffic and many other issues. The girl was competent, having had all of the required lessons from qualified testers. Many driving instructors have been in contact with me. In the main, they are very professional. They also have huge issues with the RSA and are getting no engagement, meaningful communication or response. We are not operating in a dictatorship. Driving instructors are very important; young and old people need driving lessons. They instill and pass on a proper safe code of practice on the roads. They are not there to deal with a cap on an expansion tank, or to deal with the little bit of rubber on the lever that relaxes the seat.  In another case, on a recent wet morning - of which we have had many - a person taking the driving test did well, but the passenger side window where the tester was sitting fogged up a little. There are no vents on the side windows of most cars. They are at the front but the tester said that the test was unsafe because he could not see the mirror. Of course he could see because it was right beside where he was sitting but issues like this are happening. They should not result in failures but rather act as a caution and an opportunity to learn. The day one does not learn something is a bad day. I believe I learn something every day. Those who are not able to or are not willing to learn are unfortunate. There are many issues concerning the RSA centres.  A lady called Mary contacted me on Sunday. A person went for a test on a horrible wet Sunday about three weeks ago. The tester decided to start without any visual inspection because it was too wet. Thankfully the person passed the test. There should surely be a covered area in each of the test centres to ensure that each candidate is treated equally. It should not be the case that if it is a fine day the car will be checked for problems but that it will not be checked if it is raining. These are facts. This is happening. There must be a level playing field for young drivers and for older drivers on L plates. They are nervous enough. We are all nervous when we go for any kind of test, or hospital procedures or the like.

If a young driver gets six penalty points they are off the road. It is very relevant. On the last occasion I went through the national drivers licence service, NDLS, situation and the problems inherent in it. We want people to go and get their licences. They should start in school. Mol an oige agus tiocfaidh sí. The Leas-Cheann Comhairle has used that phrase many times himself. They should be given a proper chance and not be vilified and criminalised before they start. I mentioned speed cameras on the last occasion. It cost €88 million to provide them and so far only €32.7 million has been collected in fines. These are the areas the Minister should turn his attention to; he was well able to write about such things before he was elected to this Dáil. It cost €88 million and only €32.7 million has been collected in motorists' fines. That would not be good in any business; if any business operated in that way it would go under. Those figures cover the period from 2010 to 22 July 2017 and were provided to me by way of a parliamentary question, from all of the resources the Minister has in his Department. I know that the speed cameras have had a positive effect and have reduced the number of road deaths. I welcome anything that helps in that regard, contrary to what the Minister might want to suggest. I also believe it is time to re-examine that type of contract. There should always be a review clause included in any type of contract and this has not been reviewed for several years.  The impact of the safety camera regime has reduced road fatalities and accidents, particularly in areas blighted with incidents over the years. I am not suggesting we remove them completely. However, I have seen them on several occasions on roadways which are not accident blackspots. I have asked safety camera operators personally and I have written to their bosses, requesting that they avoid certain parts of the area. One such well-known spot in my area is Duggan's bends outside Cahir in Tipperary, where there have been multiple fatalities. As I said, they did not do as I asked. There is enormous cost associated with operating a Garda safety camera contract. In each year from 2012 to 2015, it cost the State over €17 million to maintain the contract, at a cost of almost €16 million in 2011. To date, revenue generated from the safety camera contract has totalled €32 million. There is something very wrong there. Again, the Minister is basing many aspects of his Bill on figures and statistics. I heard an interesting "Morning Ireland" programme since we last sat in this Chamber talking about this issue. I heard how the RSA had requested information from An Garda Síochána several times. It also requested it from the Minister's Department, but it could not be given. The request was refused. How can we make legislation on the basis of figures that do not stand up, and they do not stand up? It is bad enough to have common, obvious things in the Bill that the Minister blatantly cannot stand over, on which I will ask him to respond, without having a situation where the RSA's requests are refused. I heard someone senior on the radio saying that they had requested information. It may have been on Sunday when I heard it on the news but it was on RTÉ radio anyway. For some reason, the figures or the stats have not been provided.  In regard to the recent and ongoing breath test controversy, it does not give me any kudos at all but rather a sense of shame to note that Tipperary had the highest rate of falsification in the country, with the number of tests inflated by 385%. It is appalling that this would be carried out by State organisations. Nobody was held accountable. I know that an investigation is still going on, but some counties had rates of 60%, 50% and 40% while Tipperary had a rate of 385%. There is an adage that has been there since colonial times that where Tipperary leads, Ireland follows. That relates to the War of Independence and our fight for freedom, but I do not want anyone to follow this because the figures were falsified by a rate of 385%. The Minister is flicking through his notes. He is not listening, not interested and not bothered in many areas. It is easier to go after the vulnerable learner drivers. It is easier to go after the vulnerable young people who want to get out in life, further their education or get an apprenticeship, and their parents who bought the car for them and got the insurance, which is extortionate. The Minister is not touching the insurance industry. It is a pure cartel. Here is a quote from The Irish Times at the time of the scandal: Every geographical Garda division in the country had some level of over-reporting of breath tests but the figures varied between areas to a huge extent... These figures were reached by comparing the number of breath tests recorded on the Pulse system with the number recorded on the test devices. It is as simple as that. There is not much room for discrepancy. A boy or girl finishing sixth class in school could do the maths. This is not for scientists or mathematicians.  As I said, there is a blatant flaw in this Bill. If the Minister builds a house on shaky foundations, we know what will happen. We have had issues with pyrite and bad concrete, but this Bill is rushed. It is not properly considered, and it is certainly doomed for failure. There are too many flaws, and the Minister is refusing point blank to answer any question about the 385% falsification of figures, issues within the Road Safety Authority, the anomalies from test centre to test centre, or the facts that I have put before him about delays in driving tests and the different failure rate in different counties or in different test centres within counties. There is an appalling, frightening degree of variance depending on the test centre. We need a complete evaluation of the test centres and application centres, and for that matter the National Driver Licence Service, NDLS. We need to investigate it. We hope to attract people back to this country and the Taoiseach talks about the people who get up in the morning. We want to grow our economy and we want to get people back to Ireland to work. We invite them back, and we have roadshows all over. We are trying to get nurses, psychiatrists and every profession back to our country. However, if they have been gone for four or five years, they have to go back and start with a theory test and driving lessons. They have to go through the whole lot again. Why are we humiliating our citizens like that, people who might have driven in the busiest cities in the world since they left here, because their licence has lapsed and they have been out of the country? The cart is before the horse in many areas, and the Minister is refusing to engage with us. He is refusing to engage with the committee, and above all he is refusing to engage with the ordinary people. They will not even be listened to. When we are not listened to, how can they be listened to? There is a lot wrong with this Bill, and that is why we are here debating it. We are not doing it for fun. We are not doing it to delay or annoy the Minister. We are annoyed with the Minister's intemperate language and his habit of continuously writing us off as a cabal. We heard disparaging language this morning on "Morning Ireland". It would fit the Minister better to look at some of those glaring issues that are as obvious on the nose on his face. I refer to the things that are going on in the Road Safety Authority and in the test centres, and the things that are not going on. There was a young businessman in my constituency, who I thank the Minister for meeting. He came up with a great idea for road safety. He developed a tyre safety app. In fairness, the Minister did meet him, listened to him and was interested, as was anybody that saw the app. I was not aware of the danger that was out there. Between the tread on a tyre is everything a motorist is dependent on, no matter how big the tyre is or whether it is a BMW or a Morris Minor. He had an interesting app and he made attempts, with the Minister's help, to get the Road Safety Authority to engage with him. This was a vibrant, intelligent, excellent idea. He had gone with a prototype to many different national and international insurance companies to see if they would take it up, because it could save hundreds if not thousands of lives. Driving on bad and defective tyres, especially on a wet road, is really very dangerous and serious, which many of us do not know. As I said, that was a wonderful app, a wonderful idea. He went by appointment to meet the head of the RSA in Sligo. He travelled from Cahir in Tipperary to Sligo for a Monday morning meeting. He closed his business early on Sunday night, stayed in a bed and breakfast somewhere around Roscommon and arrived for his meeting, only to find he was the only person there. The head of the RSA did not think it was worthwhile to turn up, even though there was an appointment. It was not as though the young man had gate-crashed. This appointment had come after several months of trying. A wonderful idea to which the Government closed its eyes. There is none so blind as those who cannot see, or do not want to see. The RSA and the Department do not have all the wisdom here. There are normal people out there who know the roads, the land and the dangers. Any tyre salesman worth his salt will tell a motorist the tread of a tyre. An Garda Síochána has equipment to measure them, and rightly so because it is so dangerous to have defective tyres. If one meets a bit of frost or water, they plainly do not have a hope. That is an area that could be addressed. This was a young man with great initiative, with another business and a young child and partner, who wanted to play his part and have this innovative idea tested. I am not saying that it was going to be 100% perfect but he wanted it to be tried to and tested, and to see where it would end up. The Minister does not want to see that at all, see those other issues or listen to the complaints of mothers and fathers, and indeed the people who try to do their tests but cannot get the chance. When they do get a test, they are failed for spurious reasons. When they are failed for spurious reasons, they are then barred from testing for one month. They must then apply and go through the system again, which takes six months in my county. As I said, their driving is judged on the snapshot in time of the 40-minute test, the questions afterwards and the visual inspection, if it is not a wet day. If it is a wet day, they can get away without the visual inspection. There are many anomalies here, but the Minister refuses steadfastly to engage. I am asking him again to please listen and engage with us here. Why are we going to make criminals of young people when they are doing everything in their power to do the right thing? They have tried to learn. They are trying to get on the road. They pay for their lessons and then go to their test. We need a sliding scale there, a kind of advisory fail result if it is something minor and not a driving defect. I refer to cases where the fail is because of something that happens on the test, something about the oil, the water, the oil cap, a broken seat adjuster, or one that is not broken but is not fully covered in rubber. We need a whole-school evaluation from junior certificate up.

and— establish that all service users who have been transferred from congregated settings to independent living are progressing positively.The purpose of the motion is to examine progress to date on health reform. It is two years since the formation of the Government on 6 May 2016 yet here we are on 8 May 2018 with no meaningful reform in our health service. The establishment of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare was viewed as a positive expression of the Government's interest in reforming our health service. One year after the committee published its report on 30 May 2017, however, the Government has yet to respond to it, never mind implement any of its fundamental recommendations. The report recommended: the development of a single-tier health service, delivered on the basis of need rather than ability to pay; the initiation of a fundamental shift of emphasis towards primary care; commencement of the integration of primary, secondary and tertiary care services; and legislation to ensure accountability and answerability in the management of our health service. The need to guard against implementation deficit was recognised by the committee, which committed a full chapter of its report to the subject of implementation. We recognised that an extremely important component of Sláintecare was that it should not languish, as so many health reports have, without implementation. Health reform is not optional; it is essential. Sláintecare is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to tackle the disjointed and fragmented nature of our health service. Sláintecare talks about fundamental cultural change, not only in our health service but within the Department of Health, the HSE and all of its layers of management. The Minister, however, has failed to act to implement any meaningful health reform. He will be remembered as the Minister who had a plan but did nothing about it. So many of his predecessors had no plan. They did not have the luxury of a cross-party committee report produced following 11 months of sittings to deliver a blueprint for healthcare reform. He is the only Minister who has had that luxury but he has not acted on it in any meaningful way. I accept that Sláintecare is challenging to the health institutions of the State, the Department of Health and the HSE. They cannot cope with the challenge Sláintecare presents. I am afraid that, rather than implement Sláintecare, the Government has spent the past year moulding it to suit its own policy. Sláintecare, however, recommended that Government policy should change. Sláintecare's recommendations on reform are far broader and wide-ranging than existing Government policy. The Minister must accept that we need fundamental change in how we run our health services. That is something which goes way beyond Government policy. The Government is taking over the implementation process to suit its own objectives rather than setting up an independent implementation body to develop the implementation plan Sláintecare recommends. This is contrary to the vision of Sláintecare. The Government is deconstructing Sláintecare to suit its own policies. That was never the intention. We accept that many areas of the health service work well. However, those excellent areas work in isolation and there is no uniformity across the health service. Many areas of the health service struggle to prosper and deliver quality care. This is because management structures in the HSE are disjointed and dysfunctional. The most fundamental legislative provisions required include provisions to reinstate the HSE's board. A slimmed-down board would provide proper governance. One year after the publication of Sláintecare and seven months since the Taoiseach announced in the Dáil that he would reconstitute the board, the legislation has yet to come forward. It is one of the most fundamental underpinnings of Sláintecare. The health service should not be about process, it should be about the patient. The difficulty we have is that our health service is all about process while the patient gets lost in the bureaucratic procrastination of that service's decision-making. The HSE has too many managers and too few leaders. The Minister has heard this on many occasions I am sure. One of the prospective candidates for the position of HSE CEO looked at it and declared it to be overmanaged and under-led. That is a fundamental issue. To make an analogy, our health service is like a Swiss watch in that it has many moving parts. All of those parts must be interlocked so that they move in unison, otherwise one does not get the correct time. We have a disjointed and dysfunctional health service which is not delivering to its full potential. The lack of integration is the problem and inhibits the delivery of quality services. Taking the CervicalCheck scandal as an example, one sees how a lack of open disclosure, governance and leadership have led to the problem. This is at the core of so many of our health service's problems. We do not have proper governance and leadership. Too many layers of management get in the way of correct and logical decisions. Tied up in endless bureaucracy, the process trumps the patient who gets left behind. In addition to mandatory disclosure legislation, we need mandatory accountability legislation to guarantee accountability regarding decisions in the health service. People must be answerable for the decisions they make. We must create a proper management infrastructure to underpin a new and reformed health service. Legislative changes creating statutory powers, statutory targets and statutorily underpinned quality assurance will not cost money. They will not be a charge on the State. Rather, they will be the fundamental framework on which our health service is built. That legislation is outlined in the Sláintecare report but it has not been discussed or introduced in the House. The development of a GP-led primary care service is critical to the development of Sláintecare. The countries with the strongest primary care services have the least pressure on their secondary services, shorter waiting lists and better outcomes for patients. This is critical and one of the fundamental recommendations of Sláintecare. We talk here about GP-led primary care teams. If we had those, we could keep people out of hospital and treat their chronic disease conditions within the community. The benefit would be the release of pressure on secondary care. Failing to invest in primary care makes no economic sense. We must concentrate on those who need the most care.People spend less than a fraction of 1% of their time in hospital, yet the hospital service consumes most of the budget. I am not proposing that we take money away from the hospital service, but we must develop our primary care services. They attract 4% of the budget. It should be at least 10%, as is the case in other European countries. In the committee we often spoke about the inverse care law - the people who need the care most get it least. The Minister must take a fundamental look at how our health services are structured in that regard. Austerity was universally applied across the health service and the public service, but the unwinding of austerity and of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act, FEMPI, has been uneven and unfair, particularly with regard to general practice and primary care. It was applied to other services, of course, but it was disproportionately applied to general practice. If the Minister allows general practice to wither on the vine he will reap as a reward a huge cost in secondary and tertiary care by not supporting primary care. We must speak about recruitment of doctors and nurses, the retention of those staff and look at the reasons for the issues there. They have very poor working conditions. They are educated in a system that is very poor and which does not offer them career opportunities and career progression. They are the reasons staff are leaving the country. It is not because of pay, although pay is important. The average trolley count in 2013 was 247. It increased to 310 and last year it was 396. All the measures the Minister has instituted have not affected the trolley crisis. It is a crude measurement of the quality of our health service but it is a real-time measurement. The Minister must address health reform. I hope to hear in his response to the motion how he will address it, how quickly he will do so and how urgently he is undertaking it.

I thank Deputy Harty and Mairéad in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for drafting the motion. I will take this opportunity to once again put forward an effective solution to address a major problem in Galway. I firmly believe that a minor injuries unit in the grounds of Merlin Park University Hospital would significantly reduce congestion and overcrowding at the accident and emergency department in the hospital. One can hear most mornings on the local radio station, Galway Bay FM, of how chronic the situation there is at times due to overcrowding at the emergency department in University Hospital Galway, UHG, particularly with people on trolleys. It has passed its worst record ever. A minor injuries unit would help to alleviate the pressure on the emergency department in Galway. Last month, when I raised the possibility of a minor injuries unit at Merlin Park in Galway, the Taoiseach said it was a good idea and that he would appraise it further and discuss it with the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the HSE. This should be done as a priority. Since I raised this on Leaders' Questions I have been informed by reply to a parliamentary question that people with minor injuries now face an average wait of five and a half hours from the time they are first registered to when they are discharged from the emergency department at University Hospital Galway. This compares with less than one hour at the minor injuries unit attached to Roscommon University Hospital. I compliment the staff in that unit in Roscommon. It is working exceptionally well, despite all the bad publicity when the emergency department was closed, which is why I believe there should be a similar unit in Galway. The fact that it takes six times longer to be seen, treated and discharged for a minor injury in an emergency department shows the need for a unit at Merlin Park to handle the minor injuries that currently take so much time to deal with in the emergency department. Chronic parking congestion at the hospital is also a major problem. It frequently causes people to miss appointments. I have called for a designated parking spot to be established for people who have appointments in UHG, particularly cancer patients, but it has not happened. People have to leave the car outside, bring an elderly loved one to the unit where he or she is to be treated and run back out again and try to park the car. These people might have come from as far as Mayo, Sligo and Donegal. That issue must be addressed. The number of people seeking treatment at the emergency department in UHG increased last year to a total of 62,355. At present, only one in four people coming to the emergency department in Galway end up being admitted to hospital, so the majority of cases could easily be handled in a minor injuries unit at Merlin Park. Consider how that would transform the picture at the overcrowded emergency department in UHG, where staff are working under enormous pressure in a unit that is universally accepted as unfit for purpose. A minor injuries unit for Galway is a no-brainer, regardless of what plans there are for new facilities. There are 11 minor injuries units operating successfully throughout the country that can handle everything from broken bones, lacerations, strains and sprains to minor scalds and burns. They are open seven days per week from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. Last year the unit in Roscommon treated more than 6,000 patients. That unit is staffed by a small number of competent staff overseen by a consultant physician and an advanced nurse practitioner. I acknowledge there are plans for a new emergency department at University Hospital Galway, but this project is still at design stage. A new facility is still many years away. The Minister recently informed me that an elective hospital plan for Merlin Park is a long-term plan and that with a ten-year plan many proposals, including an elective only hospital, are at a very early stage. It could be ten, 15 or 20 years away while the minor injuries unit could be up and running by the end of the year. If we could bring the people with scalds, burns, strains, lacerations and broken bones to a minor injuries unit in Merlin Park it could reduce the number attending UHG emergency department by tens of thousands. It would free up parking and take the pressure off the staff, allowing them to deal with emergencies and more serious cases. The Taoiseach admitted that this could be put in place relatively quickly and that the minor injuries units that work in other parts of the country should also work in Galway. I call for support for this motion and I call on the Minister to work with the HSE to try to provide a minor injuries unit in Merlin Park University Hospital without delay.

I wish to discuss a number of the problems but I also wish to discuss solutions. First, I will concentrate on County Kerry. I have had meetings with the Minister in the past regarding University Hospital Kerry working in conjunction with the Bon Secours Hospital in Tralee. It is a unique situation where two hospitals are located within a stone's throw of each other. I compliment the management and staff in both hospitals because there have been improvements and there is more working together. However, we must enhance and grow that. We must change the way people are admitted to our hospitals. It is absolutely insane that the emergency department is the only way a person can be admitted today to University Hospital Kerry. Take the example of a doctor attending a person and telling that person he or she must go to the hospital because it is a hospital case. That person has been assessed by the GP and the GP, in his or her expertise, has diagnosed what is wrong and what care is required. However, the person must then go and queue in the accident and emergency department. The Minister knows as well as I do that it is not unknown to have to wait for 70 hours in an emergency department. That is in no way the responsibility of the people working in the hospital. I have visited emergency departments at odd times during the night and I have been told by the people working there that they are under unreal pressure. They are working flat out. They continually say, "For God's sake, talk to the Minister and use influence with the HSE to try to get them to see common sense." An admissions department is where many people should be admitted. That is why it says "Admissions" over the door. Emergency departments are for accidents and emergencies, people who arrive in a bad way or are brought by ambulance and need urgent assessment, triage, X-rays and other procedures. This has been pointed out to the Minister previously. What has he asked the HSE to do about it or what has been done? Nothing has been done. A great deal was promised in the programme for Government. The Minister was a diligent participant in that negotiation. He genuinely put his shoulder to the wheel for 70 days and I have no problem complimenting him for that. However, what has happened since? Our health service and the delivery of that service have worsened and become a shambles. I wish to speak about our community hospitals in County Kerry. We have community hospitals in Kenmare, Dingle and Cahersiveen. We definitely need a new community hospital in the great town of Killarney. I want to see this progressed. I want to see a shovel put into the ground. Killarney is a growing town in that the population doubles or trebles in the summertime. It is definitely deserving of a new community hospital. The existing hospital is great in that the staff and management are doing their very best, but they need a modern hospital and extra beds, just as we need extra beds opened in Kenmare and Dingle. There is a strong case to be made for Kenmare and Dingle because of our ageing population. If the HSE is to be serious, proactive and forward-thinking, it should consider extensions to those hospitals, even though they are new hospitals, to allow for future growth of the ageing population. HIQA has an awful lot to answer for. The Minister was not the creator of HIQA; others were. At this stage HIQA is definitely an out-of-control monster. We must have regulations and standards, but there is such a thing as standards gone crazy and people running away with themselves. People involved in the management of hospitals have highlighted to me that what HIQA is engaged in at present is neither right nor proper. Regarding the management of the HSE, we have layer upon layer of bureaucracy and it is failing us. We see psychiatric nurses who are fully qualified and who want to work in County Kerry. I highlighted this to the Minister today and he said he was delighted to be in a position to offer full-time employment to nurses. We have qualified psychiatric nurses who want to come-----

The events of the last week demonstrate how important and how personal healthcare is to every individual in this country. The issues we have been grappling with on cervical screening and maternity services in Portiuncula show just how devastating the effects can be when there are failures within our health services. It is incumbent on all of us, as elected public representatives, to work together to bring about real change in our health services and real improvements in healthcare for everyone in this country. Since taking up the role of Minister, I have been appreciative of the willingness of Deputies across the House to work together on health issues. This is one of the potential achievements of new politics and minority government. I refer to the fact that Government and Opposition Deputies sat on a cross-party basis to try to put together a plan for our health service. It is often forgotten in the narrative that Government Deputies also sat on the Sláintecare committee and that my party supports the Sláintecare recommendations as well. This really came to the fore in the workings of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, where all parties stepped up to the plate and worked together to develop a roadmap for change in our health services, and I pay tribute to all involved. It was evident again last week as we considered the serious failings in CervicalCheck. We have been united as an Oireachtas in our shock and dismay at what has happened to Vicky Phelan and her family, to other women across this country and to Mr. Stephen Teap and his late wife, Irene. I thank the Deputies who met me last week to discuss the establishment of an inquiry and who made submissions, which I sought to address in the proposals I brought to Government this morning. Today, the Government agreed to the establishment of a scoping inquiry to examine the facts and get answers quickly for Irish women, while also identifying the issues that will require a full statutory investigation. Dr. Gabriel Scally, who has been appointed to carry out the scoping inquiry, has widespread experience in undertaking reviews of this kind. He has had a distinguished career as a senior public health doctor and adviser with the UK Department of Health as well as the NHS, and is president of the epidemiology and public health section of the Royal Society of Medicine and a professor of public health at both the University of the West of England and the University of Bristol. He has also worked to unearth very many significant service and clinical failures in parts of the UK and Northern Ireland. I have no doubt that he brings huge experience to the issue, and he has really hit the ground running, starting his inquiry today. He will be joined by Dr. Karin Denton, a consultant cytopathologist who has huge expertise in cervical screening within the NHS. I thank Dr. Scally for arriving in Ireland today, for immediately beginning his work and for committing to report back through setting out his findings by the end of next month and providing a progress update at the start of next month. For many, CervicalCheck is just one in a long list of failings in our health services, and I understand that point of view. Too often we are here talking about lack of services, poor performance or, in the worst cases, breaches of trust and duty. In the face of these failings, it can be difficult to talk about any positives. However, we must remember that, in the vast majority of cases, staff across our health service are doing their utmost to provide high-quality care. They are treating more patients than ever before, they are providing much-needed care, support and compassion to people when they need it most and they are doing this in an ever-increasingly busier environment. We all know the pressures and challenges that face the health service. We all know people who are not getting the care they need as quickly as they should get it. We all know healthcare professionals who are frustrated and burnt out from working in a system that is not working all that well. Our system is already challenged, and the changes in demography, technology and the nature of illness that will happen in the coming years will place ever-increasing strains on it. Funding alone will not be enough to address this. There is no silver bullet or magic wand we can wave to get us the kind of health service we all want. The scale of the challenges we face means that fundamental change is needed, and this can only be delivered by an ambitious, coherent and sustained programme of reform that has broad support. I am on record here and elsewhere in expressing my belief that the Sláintecare report and the cross-party support it enjoys present us with a unique opportunity to embed long-lasting reform. Sláintecare has the potential to fundamentally change the way we deliver healthcare in this country, to allow us to provide high-quality, safe and fair healthcare for all our citizens. I have listened to health service users, patients, staff of the health service at all levels and Members of this House and I know the challenges that lie ahead in driving through large-scale reform. We will only succeed with this ambitious programme if everyone - and that includes all of us here - are united on the overall goal and pulling in the same direction. In the 12 months since the publication of the Sláintecare report, the Government has already taken significant steps to commence the programme of reform that it envisaged. We have already committed to the establishment of a Sláintecare programme office, and the recruitment process for the executive director of that office is in its final stages. This has been a very thorough and comprehensive process, led independently by the Public Appointments Service and involving a national and international executive search. I hope to be able to make an announcement on the new director for this programme office very soon, a key priority of Sláintecare. We have also prioritised the Committee on the Future of Healthcare's recommendation to remove private practice from public acute hospitals. Let me say on the record of this House again that I believe this must happen. We are an outlier among other countries in this regard. This is a far-reaching, complex reform but absolutely fundamental if we want to achieve a fairer, more equitable health service. I have established, in line with the Sláintecare report, an independent review group, chaired by Dr. Donal de Buitléir, to examine the impact of this measure. The group will conclude its work later this year, which will provide a valuable roadmap on how this can be achieved. That is another key recommendation of Sláintecare implemented. The Sláintecare report made a series of important recommendations in respect of accountability, clinical governance and patient safety, which resonate even more strongly now. I have already signalled my intention to bring forward a Bill to legislate for the establishment of a governing board for the HSE. I am pleased to confirm to the House that I will bring a memorandum to Government next week with the general scheme of a Bill, which will then be published next week. I ask for the co-operation of all parties and groupings in this House - and I know it exists - in getting this legislation through the Oireachtas as quickly as possible this year so a new board of the HSE can take up office, effective January 2019. I know we all agree that we need more robust and transparent structures of accountability across our health service, and the appointment of a strong board with the appropriate skills set is essential to achieving this. I ask that we work in a bipartisan fashion to work out how best to populate this board. It is really important we have the right skills set. If ever we were in any doubt about the need to improve accountability structures, recent weeks have shown the importance of that need. My Department has also commenced work on the committee's recommendations in respect of changes to the HSE structure itself. An important component of this will be the development of regional structures to support the delivery of integrated care, a key Sláintecare recommendation. This is an issue I raised with the committee myself during deliberations and it is something I fully support. Let me be very clear: my view on this is that the HSE as currently constructed is overly centralised, far too bureaucratic and does not have sufficiently devolved systems of governance and accountability.We need to create a leaner central body complemented by regional organisations which will provide the framework within which much clearer, transparent and more robust accountability and performance arrangements can be developed. The structure has become far too complex and far too bureaucratic. It was set up in an inappropriate fashion but we are going to fix it and do so in line with Sláintecare roadmap.  On accountability, I spoke to Róisín and Mark Molloy, who have been incredible patient advocates arising from the terrible tragedy they experienced with baby Mark in Portlaoise hospital, about accountability legislation. They asked me to examine what other jurisdictions have done and I am undertaking that work now. The first step in reforming structures is to better align our current regional structures, that is, hospital groups and community healthcare organisations. A public consultation on this is under way, I welcome the submissions of all and my Department will bring forward proposals later in the year. I have previously pointed out that I do not think that reform alone can solve all our problems. Given the scale of population change that is expected over the next decade, additional funding will also be necessary. This will build on the significant increases already delivered in recent years, with public funding on health increasing by 19% since 2013. In particular, the Government is committed to advancing a €10.9 billion capital programme over the next decade to improve our healthcare facilities and increase capacity across services. This is 165% higher than it was for the last ten years and will support major priority projects as well as enabling the roll-out of new additional capacity. The bizarre failed policies of the past of reducing hospital beds is over. We are now going to deliver in full the provisions in the capacity review, 2,600 acute hospitals beds, three new elective facilities - one each in Dublin, Galway and Cork, and 4,500 community care beds, and diagnostic hubs in the community. This is all funded. It takes several years to build hospital wings and new elective facilities and to put diagnostics into the community but we are beginning to plan for that. Crucially, we are also delivering on a key Sláintecare recommendation in committing €1.6 billion to delivering enhanced eHealth and ICT capability, which the Sláintecare report identified as an important enabler of reform. I fully appreciate that extra staff will be required and I very much welcome the Framework for Safe Nurse Staffing and Skill Mix in hospitals. I made an announcement on that at the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, conference last Friday in Cork, while the pay commission is also looking at issues on recruitment to and retention in the health service. It is due to report next month, and the Government will be guided by that.  I have secured Government approval to move forward with contract negotiations with general practitioners. I am pleased to inform the House that that engagement has commenced. It is clearly under way and meetings have taken place. We have many millions more that we want to spend in general practice but it takes two sides to negotiate and I also have requests on behalf of the Irish people and of patients. We are developing a new homecare scheme for older citizens and people with disabilities. It is under development and in the meantime we are committed to providing an additional 754,000 home support hours this year.  I am running out of time but we will have an opportunity at tomorrow's joint committee on health to further tease through some of these issues.
#StephenDonnelly	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-party	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-dob	unknown-#StephenDonnelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	319	I thank Deputy Harty and his colleagues for tabling tonight's motion on healthcare. Fianna Fáil is in agreement with much of tonight's motion, particularly the calls for immediate action for implementation for increased capacity in hospitals, in general practitioners' surgeries and in community care. I am pleased to say that Fianna Fáil will support this motion and has a very short amendment to the motion which we hope that Deputy Harty and his colleagues will support. It reads that the Government "in pursuing these healthcare goals, stay within the fiscal parameters required to maintain a prudent budgetary approach over the entire lifetime of implementation", which will be at least a decade. Given Ireland's young population by international standards, we should not need to spend as much as other countries on healthcare. However, not only do we spend as much as other countries, we spend more per person than almost any country worldwide. Given that, and that we have really well trained doctors, nurses and other healthcare professionals, one would expect that we would have a Rolls Royce healthcare system but let us compare what we should have with what we have today. We have the longest trolley lists in history. We have the longest waiting lists in history. There is a crisis across general practitioner practices that is so deep that seven in ten practices are no longer taking on new patients, whether private or public. We have a massive shortage of hospital beds, step-down beds, or rehab beds and a plethora of other different facilities. We have a chronic shortage of hospital consultants and people working as hospital consultants who are not even qualified as hospital consultants, and this has been the case for many years with the knowledge of the HSE. These are people working as specialists who are not on the specialist register. We do not have enough nurses and the job has become so difficult in recent years that over 70% of those who are about to graduate this year say they will leave the country and not work in this system. We have non-consultant hospital doctors who tell me that their training hours are being falsified by their employers and that they are still working 36 hour shifts. Many of them are also leaving the country. I am told that we are the biggest importers and exporters of doctors in the developed world. That is a shocking indictment on our duty of care to our healthcare professionals. Then there is our culture of secrecy. The Portiuncula report which came out last week would make one's blood run cold. There needs to be time given for this House to debate it. The cover-up which was uncovered in the Portiuncula report and what families whose babies died in that hospital is horrific. If it was not for CervicalCheck, the Portiuncula report would be on the front page of every paper, but we have another scandal that is so big that Portiuncula has barely been mentioned. The CervicalCheck scandal affects every woman and every family in this country. Every woman I have spoke to or who has contacted my office is furious. They are not a little annoyed, irritated or let down, they are furious that they could have been Vicky Phelan or that they could have been one of the 208 women where the HSE and State found out that their diagnosis had been missed but they were not going to tell them, rather just file it away, and that their doctors would be told that he or she did not need to tell the women affected either.  It is very clear that what has happened to Vicky Phelan is not an isolated case. It is only because of her bravery that we understand just how deep this conspiracy of silence has run. We now have correspondence that shows that the clinical director of CervicalCheck, who has now resigned, wrote to Vicky Phelan's doctor and said that they thought all the women in question should be told, but that they did not think they should do it themselves but rather the doctor should. They debated back and forth over whose responsibility it was and escalated it to the hospital group, but nobody made it public. Then they escalated it to the clinical director of the HSE who did not make it public and was assured that the matter had been sorted out. We have correspondence from the ex-clinical director of CervicalCheck saying that in her opinion, Dr. Hickey, Vicky Phelan's consultant, need only tell three of his ten patients. That is not an isolated event. It is a deliberate culture of non-disclosure.  The background to this is that in 2013 the HSE brought in an unambiguous open disclosure policy. In 2014 CervicalCheck decided it would do an audit. In 2015, two years after the policy of open disclosure, it decided it would tell the doctors. In 2016, three years after the policy of open disclosure, it actually got around to telling the doctors. In 2017, four years after the policy of open disclosure, Vicky Phelan actually found out about it. In 2018, five years after the policy of open disclosure was introduced, the other women affected and their families are now being told. This is a deep and sinister conspiracy of silence. The women of Ireland are furious and they are absolutely right to be.  I put it to the Minister that there is also a great deal of political accountability for this too.The HSE board was disbanded by a previous Minister, Deputy James Reilly. It is now going to be re-established. That action clearly led to a lack of oversight and governance. Another Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, pulled away from legislating for open disclosure when there was an opportunity to do so. While I respect that the Minister, Deputy Harris, acted when he found out about the scale of this, I put it to him that there was sufficient information and there were warning signs in that memo to lead him to act sooner. I am sure the Minister would dearly love to have acted sooner and I believe he should have. It was clearly a political error to let Tony O'Brien take on a position on the board of a company on the west coast of America. I also put it to the Minister that it is an ongoing political error to allow the director general of the HSE to remain in situ. The director general of the HSE needs to resign immediately, without prejudice, for three reasons. He was in charge throughout this entire thing, he is clearly a distraction from supporting the women involved, and the response to date in terms of the helpline has been shambolic. There are many other things that need to be done, but I put it to the Minister that as a first step and as a message to the women, and indeed men, of Ireland he should ask Mr. O'Brien to resign with immediate effect as the person who was in charge and who has, to date, essentially had ultimate governance for the helpline, which has been a shambles.

I want to concentrate my contribution on one issue, that of recruitment. Under questioning today the Taoiseach admitted that the advertisement seeking a replacement for the CEO of the HSE has not yet entered the public domain. It is less that eight weeks until the time when Mr. O'Brien will be leaving, if he does not leave before then. Regardless of when he leaves, the organisation that employs 110,000 people and is responsible for the well-being of our people will not have a permanent CEO for a period that will probably last at least six months. This is not acceptable. What organisation would survive with that recruitment policy? What organisation would let its head retire or move on without a replacement? The replacement should be there a month before the incumbent steps down to allow for a handover period. It is not only the position of Tony O'Brien that operates in this manner. It is the same for consultants, doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals at all levels. When somebody retires, there is never a replacement there on the day that person steps down. If a person walks into a hospital or phones up looking to speak to a consultant and that person is told that the consultant has retired, if the person looks for his or her replacement, he or she will be told that no one has been appointed yet. It is simply not acceptable. It is in the Sláintecare report, but we do not need the Sláintecare report to have a functional recruitment office within the HSE. We need that to be put in place right now. It is symbolic of the organisation. The Minister has responsibility for this. He has known of Tony O'Brien's imminent departure for the past 12 months, as has the whole country since the start of January. In today's response the Taoiseach said that the job description is changing and evolving. That is just not a strong enough excuse. There must be a CEO of the organisation in place at all times. It is very important not only that the lesson be learnt from this debacle but that, in respect of future recruitment, there is a root-and-branch overhaul of whatever recruitment policies are in place in the HSE so that not only the CEO but also doctors, nurses and healthcare professionals get recruited in a timely manner to allow the organisation to function properly.

It has also been said that without health, life is not life, that it is only a state of languor and suffering. In this motion we are dealing with patients who are trying to maintain good health or eradicate bad health, both physical and mental. In many ways we are dealing with very vulnerable people at every age on the spectrum. Two years into this Government we are still seeing inadequate delivery of services and, I have to say, a lack of urgency on the part of those in charge. Outpatient waiting lists have hit record highs. More than 10% of our population are waiting, many for more than a year. Emergency department overcrowding reached its highest level on record, which is 30% higher than last year. There are major delays in accessing community health services, especially services for children. Some 6,181 children are waiting for a primary care psychology appointment and, of these, 25% have been waiting for more than a year. This is happening at a time when we are saying that we care more about mental health than we ever have before. There has been a 10% increase in the number of children waiting for a child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, appointment. There is a GP crisis. There are 4,312 children with disabilities awaiting the assessments which are their right under the Disability Act 2005. Almost 10,000 children are waiting for an appointment in our children's hospitals. Many of these have been waiting for more than 18 months. That is before I even touch on or get into the cervical screening scandal. It is a scandal but, apart from that, the management of the issue since it was uncovered has been shambolic. The women of Ireland are enraged. Their families are disappointed, frustrated and angry. Every day questions remain unanswered and more questions arise. The call centre system put in place has been disgraceful. A friend of mine who had had an abnormal showing rang the first day, the fourth day and the fifth day. She was told twice that somebody was looking at her case and that somebody would get back to her. To this day, no one has. Women are very worried and cannot sleep at night. We have to do better, make no mistake about that. We need reform and we need it straight away. We need it for patients and for the wonderful people at the coalface of our medical and health system.

The way so many women were treated in respect of this important screening programme is scandalous. The withholding of information from those women is inexcusable and those responsible must be held to account. I refer to the Disability Act 2005 in regard to the assessment of needs. It is laid down in law that a person is entitled to an assessment which is to begin within three months and to be completed within a further three months. That provision is not being met. In my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan there are huge delays for hundreds of children. I appeal to the Minister and to the HSE to ensure that the necessary therapists, physiotherapists, occupational therapists, and speech and language therapists are put in place to ensure that those children get an assessment and the follow-up support that is needed. I recently spoke to the Minister again with regard to the emergency department in Cavan General Hospital. Some years ago we were promised an investment programme. It is not happening. I appeal to the Minister again to ensure that department, which is working well but which is under extreme pressure, is given the additional resources, physical infrastructure and upgraded and additional facilities to ensure that it can meet the demands of a growing population and annually increasing attendance. With regard to Sláintecare, I took the opportunity in this House before to compliment those who contributed to that committee. There is one thing with which I was disappointed. There is no emphasis on the all-Ireland dimension to the provision of healthcare on our island. That is one item which is unfortunately missing from the Sláintecare report.

It was signed into law by the President on 20 December 2015. The new section 32B which the Act introduced into the Civil Liability and Courts Act 2004 provided that there shall be pre-action protocols relating to clinical negligence actions.The inserted section specifically states, "The Minister shall by regulations make provision specifying the terms of the pre-action protocol" which will involve full disclosure of medical and other records. It was described by the then Minister for Justice and Equality as an historic day. Why has that section of that Act not been commenced by the Government, specifically by the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Charlie Flanagan? Had it been, the Government would not be in the mess it is in today in terms of the provision of information to patients, and it would not have the head of the State Claims Agency saying at a meeting of the finance committee today that things would have been completely different had pre-action protocols been in place. The former Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, was correct that it was an historic day but it was an historic day in what epitomises the Government, namely, saying it is doing it but really doing nothing. I ask that the Minister for Health ask the Taoiseach to clarify on Questions on Promised Legislation tomorrow specifically why the Government has sat on its hands in commencing legislation passed by this House that would have prevented the tragedy of the cervical screening disaster.

If trust is to be restored, we need full disclosure from CervicalCheck, the HSE and the Minister. We need it quickly. One of the great barometers of the effectiveness of our service is emergency department overcrowding. INMO figures show a record number of patients on trolleys in 2018 by comparison with a similar period in 2017. There was a rise of 19%. This is a key performance indicator for our health service, yet the figures continue to spiral out of control. In March 2018, the total number of people waiting for an outpatient appointment was the highest ever recorded. Almost 150,000 were waiting for over a year, with 75,547 of them left waiting for longer than 18 months. Ireland's three children's hospitals have 9,246 people waiting for over a year and a half. These figures are simply scandalous. With regard to child and adolescent waiting lists, recent figures show there were 6,181 children waiting for a primary care psychology appointment at the end of January 2018. Of young people waiting, 1,635 had been waiting for over a year to be seen. This effectively means that the children spent all of 2017 waiting for an appointment. The figures demonstrate the ongoing crisis in the provision of mental health services for our children. There are other points I wanted to make but we have one more speaker who wishes to contribute.

The cervical screening scandal is a national disgrace in which, yet again, the women of the country have been failed on their most fundamental right, namely, the right to proper health care. I welcome the appointment of Dr. Scally to head up the scoping inquiry. It is critical that the women affected by the scandal receive answers quickly as to what happened and why it happened, and that we see accountability. Our national CervicalCheck programme is very important. One of the most important jobs of the Government is to begin to restore confidence. Consideration should be given to the examination of our other national screening programmes to allay the fears of people who have been deeply disturbed by the revelations of the past 14 days. In the Minister's programme for Government, there is a commitment to providing better healthcare but in Cavan General Hospital, particularly in the emergency department, there is an absolute need for investment. My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, just mentioned that need. The unit needs to be expanded to deal with the overcrowding. There are ten examination cubicles that are not adequate to deal with the approximately 32,000 patients who attend each year. An issue arises over waiting times for young people and adolescents. The assessment of need is one of the critical issues. Parents are being told they have three years for the initial step in dealing with what they may need in terms of occupational therapy, physiotherapy and speech and language therapy. The Minister has to make the officials accountable. I ask him to do so.

I commend them on the concise nature of the motion, which has captured many of the difficulties in our health service. It is very timely that we are debating this matter this evening in the face of yet another scandal. The Government may go down in history as one that was dogged by scandals. It is my estimation that it definitely will. It is not lost on the women of Ireland. Never have they been mentioned so many times. We are so grateful for all the mentions we get. Time after time, the scandals that emerge affect women, including the scandals associated with sodium valproate, breast cancer misdiagnosis in St. James's Hospital and the scandals in Portlaoise and Portiuncula hospitals. These are just a few. Now we have to add to them another scandal, that of CervicalCheck. Anyone who watched the performance of the HSE officials at the meeting of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health last Wednesday could not fail to have been struck by the arrogance and complete abdication of responsibility for the service in the charge of Mr. Tony O'Brien. His utter refusal to take responsibility for the organisation he heads has angered not only me — it did anger me — because is has made the women of Ireland very angry. Mr. O'Brien, in response to the question on whether he is doing a good job, shrugged his shoulders and simply said "Yes". This was absolutely outrageous. Why does he do it? It is because he gets away with it. It is because the Government circles the wagons. There is not a person in this Chamber or this complex who has expressed confidence in that particular individual's ability to do his job, yet he is still in his position. We will not see him tomorrow because, apparently, he is on holiday. Good luck to him with that. He will not appear before the health committee for the quarterly meeting, apparently. He had planned on taking annual leave and that is why he will not be there. It is because of the attitude of the Government that he behaves in the way he does. The wagons were circled; the protection was there for him. He had no need to answer any questions. He had no need even to pretend to take responsibility for the organisation that he heads because he knew he was going to get the protection of this Government. Contrast that with the position of a nurse starting her shift in an emergency department tonight. Does the Minister believe she feels protected to that level? She does not. She absolutely does not because she knows that, with the failings in the health service, her head would be on the block. She sees that those who are at the top, or those who refuse to take responsibility time and again, will be protected. They are obviously very valued. The nurse working in an emergency department does not feel valued. I sat here and listened to the Deputies from Fianna Fáil bemoaning the state of the health service. Members will know, because I have said it before, that before I became a Deputy I represented workers under a Fianna Fáil Government and a Fine Gael Government. I was not impressed by either, and I do not believe the workers were either. Let us not forget that many of the issues we face in the health service today have their root in the recruitment embargo, which was brought in by Fianna Fáil two years ahead of the one for every other Department. When we say we have a recruitment and retention crisis, we need to go right back to where the recruitment and retention crisis started. It started with the recruitment embargo. It was a crude tool and it was resisted by the unions at the time. There was no reason for it but the Government ploughed ahead with it regardless. When we consider the crisis in recruitment and retention, we can see the health service has become a very cold place for those who work hard. Those people are voting with their feet and they are leaving. Once again, I thank the Rural Independent Group for this motion and putting it on the record that there will be no change in our health service unless and until those at the top of it are accountable.

As my party's spokesperson on finance, I have said for the past few years, as we have had budget after budget, supported by Fianna Fáil, that it would result in a crisis in hospitals because we were under-investing in health services. It is clear to me that the policies of the Government will continue to keep them at crisis level. Is ceart a rá nach bhfuil acmhainní amháin taobh thiar de na fadhbanna seo. Tá fadhbanna ó thaobh cúrsaí rialachais i gceist anseo feasta. Feicimid é sin go soiléir i gcás Vicky Phelan agus na mná ar lig an Feidhmeannacht na Seirbhíse Sláinte síos go dona iad.  We see once again that the State does not do accountability, not only on the issue of health but on all issues - the bankers, those in high places and the politicians. If we consider the different tribunals, there is no accountability. We, in Sinn Féin, say this needs to stop. We need to see accountability and action. The refusal of this House to discuss the future of Mr. Tony O'Brien and of the Government and the Minister to call on him to resign show that nothing has changed. The parcel of accountability is passed around and around. We will see Mr. O'Brien sailing into the sunset with his pension in retirement and the health service that he will leave behind him is in a dire position, with many people left in a terrible position as a result of the latest scandal of misdiagnosis.  I point to some cases in my constituency which show where the health system is at. People are waiting two years for a diabetes recall appointment. Letterkenny University Hospital requires an allocation of €1.8 million. It asked the Minister for that allocation last year to enable it to open its short-stay ward, which would accommodate 19 beds, instead of having patients on trolleys. It has a maternity theatre that was built in 2000, but the Minister and Mr. O'Brien have refused to commission it. It lies idle and empty, just like the short-stay ward. We have 12 beds in the community hospital that are closed. Why? The answer is because there are no staff to cover them. Since 2015, 41 beds have been closed. To add to the nightmare and scandal that is unfolding, we found out today that the HSE completely misinformed the State Claims Agency when it stated during the Vicky Phelan case that all the women had been informed of their misdiagnosis. We found out two weeks ago that 162 women had not been. Therefore, somebody is lying; somebody is covering up and the person who must be held accountable is the person at the top. Therefore, the Minister should do his job and tell Mr. O'Brien it is time to go.
#BrianStanley	unknown-#BrianStanley-party	unknown-#BrianStanley-dob	unknown-#BrianStanley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	328	I welcome the motion tabled by the Rural Independent Group. We all know that the health service is in need of radical reform. The HSE is more or less dysfunctional as it is organised. There are long waiting lists; there is a two-tier system and there has been a range of scandals, the most recent being the cervical screening scandal. The HSE's response has been nothing short of outrageous. All parts of the health system are important, but the emergency department strand is the vital front line. Dealing with emergencies, as the Minister and I both know, cannot be delayed, as we can see right across the hospital system. We saw it during the winter period with the trolley crisis. I saw it at first hand in Portlaoise hospital where its emergency department is part of the emergency department network. The numbers attending it have increased year on year and there are now almost 40,000 attendances every year. Capacity within emergency departments across the State must be increased. Everyone is saying this, including patients, people working in the hospital system and anyone who has observed what is happening. What we have in Portlaoise is a service that has been threatened and much promised consultation with local medics and the community. That consultation process needs to start. The time for decisions on Portlaoise hospital is now. We need to get the ball rolling to put in place the plan that is badly needed for the hospital, to provide the necessary resources and to secure staff. Staff will come once there is certainty about the hospital. I urge the Minister to do this. I want to touch briefly on another strand of the health service - the home help service, which needs to be expanded. People are waiting for months for essential services. Some have been on a waiting list since 2017 to be allocated home help hours. Home helps are one of the success stories of the HSE. It is one of the good services it provides. However, we need more home helps because there is an ageing population which will only increase as the years pass by. If we had them, it would ensure people could be kept in their homes and communities where they want to be. It would also mean patients could be discharged in good time, thereby freeing up critical hospital beds. It would save money because providing a few home help hours is much cheaper than providing private or public nursing homes place or critical care hospital beds.  I plead with the Government to act now and begin to implement the Sláintecare plan, on which there is broad agreement and on which the Rural Independent Group has brought forward this motion in order that we can build a proper national health system. The HSE has been shot through. Organisationally, it is totally dysfunctional, as I have suspected for years. The past seven years during which I have been trying to deal with it have proved that to me. There are some very good people working in it, but they are frustrated because the system, as it is organised, cannot deliver.

I will confine my comments to the CervicalCheck issue.  It has been said the chief executive of the HSE will not be turning up at the Joint Committee on Health at 9 a.m. I might be breaking some protocol, but, as the Acting Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday, he has informed us that he will not be turning up at it either. That is a disgrace. I ask the Minister, at whatever time he wants to do so, to take out his mobile phone and ring Mr. Tony O'Brien to tell him that he has to turn up. I believe nobody in this House would disagree with the Minister on that issue. Mr. O'Brien is not willing to turn up at the Joint Committee on Health, chaired by Deputy Michael Harty, at at time of national crisis when accountability is the real issue, as well as making sure the women concerned are protected. Furthermore, he will not turn up at the Committee of Public Accounts, the only constitutional committee in the State, at which we will be asking questions related to the HSE, the Department of Health and the National Cancer Registry. I will not blame the Minister and we will not find fault with him if the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, has to stay in the Chamber while he has to leave to make a phone call because it is deeply unacceptable in the extreme and for the public watching these proceedings, it is a bloody disgrace. Mr. O'Brien has to be accountable. He is the chief executive officer of the HSE. I want to confine my comments to a few issues and raise some concerns. First, obviously, we know the issues with the helpline. Let me make some suggestions. There are real issues about the volume of women with deep concerns. Will the Minister consider taking a random sample of smear tests undertaken in the past three years, given that is the cycle of smear tests involved and doing it quickly to give an initial stimulus of public confidence to the women concerned? We cannot get through all of them in that space of time. Therefore, we need something that will give confidence. Second, will the Minister, please, try to bring forward or fast-forward the introduction of the human papilloma virus, HPV, test because, ultimately, it will deal with many of the issues involved? It would be far more successful. It is something that has been proved in other jurisdictions. There will be issues with IT and laboratory space, but they can be dealt with. Third, will the Minister, please, go to the Health Information and Quality Authority to ask for an early health technology assessment of the HPV vaccine for boys? These three measures would absolutely help in giving confidence in dealing with this issue. I am pleased about the scoping inquiry. At times during the past week or so I felt more like an adviser to the Minister than a political opponent. Is it new politics? I do not know, but the Minister has taken our views on board. In particular, there were many here who felt a HIQA-led inquiry was the right solution. It was not, as I said from the beginning. Now we are going down the route I expected we would have to go down and I thank the Minister for listening. However, I do have other issues. We know what the position is on open disclosure. We heard it at the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform, and Taoiseach today when Mr. Ciarán Breen, head of the State Claims Agency, essentially said if they were not indemnified, they would have no choice but to continue the process on the claims taken by the women concerned. That means that they are locked into the process. This has to change and if it needs legislative change, we should do it quickly. We would support the Minister in that regard.We also found out that all ten legal cases being taken involve US laboratories. Was the Minister aware of this? When was he and his Department made aware of this? There has been a systemic and systematic failure of management across the health service, multiple organisations and the Department. I met the representatives from the Department last Tuesday at 3.30 p.m. Deputy Howlin, other colleagues and I were with them for an hour and 15 minutes. During that time, they were not aware of how many legal cases were being taken. I had to ask them to ask the State Claims Agency how many legal cases were being taken so that they would know for the meeting of the Joint Committee on Health the following morning. I asked them the same question again. If I had not asked them the question, I doubt they would have known. They were also unaware of any issues relating to the other cases the Minister had to bring to the attention of the Dáil, which he told us he was only made aware of beforehand. We now know there are 1,600 of those. We know they are categorised differently from the first batch of cases because of the circumstances in which these women got cancer or were tested. However, it is deeply worrying that the Minister was only told this at the last minute. It was the biggest debate in which the Minister has participated to date in his political life and he was just given this information beforehand. It does not add up for me. I do not believe the Minister is being told everything. I do not believe his Department even knows everything. If it does, it is certainly not telling the Minister. A cursory glance at the National Cancer Registry figures would have shown that only half of the women had been audited. How in the name of God is it possible that not one single individual within cervical screening, the overall screening programme, the HSE or the Department realised the differential between the two figures? The Minister has told me how he was told. I need him to find out who told the safety incident management team and who told Mr. Lynch about the differential and how they brought that information to him. I had a discussion over the weekend with someone who was involved in CervicalCheck who spoke to me again before I came in here. They believe that the National Cancer Registry, and I want the Minister to find this out immediately, actually wrote to the Department and told it that there was an issue with regard to the volume of cases compared to CervicalCheck. CervicalCheck would pass on the cases to the National Cancer Registry but the National Cancer Registry could not pass them back. I was told that the National Cancer Registry notified the Department in writing so could the Minister please check it out? I was told it initially took place in 2011 but has happened on numerous occasions since and that CervicalCheck would have orally notified the Department as well regarding this issue. If that is the case and if either of those bodies, particularly the National Cancer Registry, actually notified the Department about this issue, that means that half of the women in Ireland were not audited but the Department knew this beforehand, possibly for years. I said previously in the Dáil that this was either a monumental level of incompetence or a cover up and I went with the first. If it is what I have just described - if the Minister asks those questions and any aspect of that is true - then the latter is true. The Minister should find out whether his Department had any communication with the National Cancer Registry with regard to these cases, which he had to reveal to us as a bombshell last Tuesday, because for me that would be very dangerous territory. I have invited the National Cancer Registry to appear before the Committee of Public Accounts on Thursday along with the Department and the HSE. We have to get to the bottom of what is happening here. We must get to the bottom of the following issues. Why were these women not told in the first place - the 162 and the process by which that happened? Was there knowledge within the Department relating to that one or those two? This is the issue I really need the Minister to check out. Was there information in the Department for some time that the figures in the National Cancer Registry, which were very public, were not being passed on to the CervicalCheck process because of data protection issues and that in reality, people in the Department knew this for years and did not reveal it?

This motion deals with all aspects of this problem and proposes Sláintecare and moving towards a single-tier universal health service as the answer. I agree with that and support the motion but I really want to focus, as have others, on the CervicalCheck scandal and what that tells us about the problems we face in delivering a health service that is actually adequate for the needs of the people who depend on it. The way in which these revelations are drip dripping out is beyond outrageous at this point. It makes this scandal worse. It is extraordinary that the Minister gave Tony O'Brien permission to take up a job when the health service is in the state it is in. It is beyond comprehension. I do not care whether it was five hours or five minutes per month, although it is a bit to hard to credit when he was going to get €65,000 and €180,000 of stock options in a private US company for it. He is doing this while the health service is falling apart and the Minister gave him permission to do it last summer. I find that extraordinary. The Minister should explain how he thought this was appropriate when everybody in the country has known for several years that the health service is in meltdown. How could the Minister think that the head of the health service could do a nixer on the side? It is beyond belief. Mr. O'Brien then adds insult to injury by saying he will not turn up for a meeting of the Joint Committee on Health or the Committee of Public Accounts this week to explain himself.

As a result of a question I asked today in the exchange with the State Claims Agency we finally revealed something that we could not drag out of the Minister, the Taoiseach or the HSE for the past week. I asked if there was a difference between the accuracy and the quality of the screening that we got because of the outsourcing to US companies. We could not get the information or the detail. Then I asked a question today and it only occurred to me today. Nobody else had asked the question, which is a simple question to a representative of the State Claims Agency. Were the ten outstanding legal cases only taken against the US companies? He revealed that it was only against US labs. No cases were taken against the Coombe. Cases were taken only against outsourced, privatised US labs. That tells us something. That tells us that the outsourcing was the problem. Why is it only them? We certainly know that the outsourcing cost us in terms of public health and transparency because the State Claims Agency stated that under no circumstances would it try to gag anybody. It was CPL that tried to gag people because profit came first for CPL. That meant trying to shut Vicky Phelan up. If it had succeeded in shutting Vicky Phelan up - thankfully for her bravery it did not - what would the consequences have been? This would not have come out and we would not have forced the crisis which now means we might address the issue and get to the bottom of what the hell was going on. The representatives of the State Claims Agency told us today that if it had been in-house, it would never have been an issue; it would never have tried to gag anybody. However, a private for-profit company wants to gag people because it might impact on its profits. While I am not saying we should not have a scoping exercise, I am saying we do not need it to draw a simple conclusion: we should stop outsourcing to US labs which try to gag people and are the only ones against which claims are now being made. Why are no claims being made against the Coombe? It is because the Coombe had a better detection rate than these private companies. The outsourcing was the problem.

It was obvious from the start that Deputy Harty was the main driver behind the medical aspect of it given his role in the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health. We have a dysfunctional crisis-ridden health service which is simply not fit for purpose. We are an exception in Europe in that we never moved to a modern NHS-type model of public healthcare. In 1942 the Beveridge report recommended the introduction of the National Health Service in the UK as part of a welfare state. The NHS was seen as a stand-alone measure to improve people's health. It was part of the concept of the welfare state with social welfare payments, child support, better state pension provision and a major programme of public housing. This was because of an understanding that when it comes to health and life expectancy, inequality and poverty are key factors. Those from a lower income group or who are working class or unskilled are three times more likely to die younger than someone from the top end of society. Some 47% of the consistently poor have chronic health problems and we have completely unacceptable levels of poverty. Poor diet, poor housing, low educational achievement and stress are key factors affecting general health. We live in a very unequal society and this is compounded by the inequality of a two-tier health system. After the Beveridge report, a Government White Paper was produced here, outlining an Irish NHS and social welfare system. It was met by fierce opposition from the medical professions, the Catholic Church and the Department of Finance. The proposals were quietly dropped. We have continued since then with what is essentially a poor service for poor people and a better service for those who can pay. We have a hotchpotch of charities, NGOs, religious bodies and State agencies providing an expensive service, but as the current scandal over cervical smear testing shows, no one is really in charge. There is a huge democratic deficit and a huge accountability deficit. Someone has to be held responsible for the wilful deliberate withholding of medical information from women. Calling for the dismissal of people, who will leave the service in about 12 weeks and have about six weeks' holiday due which they will take in the meantime, is not good enough. We should be calling people to account. When someone in that position is on a board for five hours every month getting money for it and then he withdraws from that, it is obvious that is where he is going and that is his path for the future or some pharmaceutical company. Mary Harney did the same when she got her gold-plated pension. She is on the board of pharmaceutical companies as well. That is the problem here; no one is held accountable. Following the blood-transfusion scandal, the CEO of the Blood Transfusion Board got a gold-plated pension. He was not touched or held accountable for any of those women's deaths, including people I knew who had to campaign to try to get recognition and get money from the State over the period of time they would have to face huge medical costs. When the same blood-transfusion problem happened in France, the CEO there was brought to trial and jailed for what happened in France's service. Women died and the situation there nearly mirrored what happened here in Ireland. We had a huge problem with holding people accountable for situations happening here in institutions like the HSE and Government. The question of outsourcing is crucial from the point of view of Government policy. In 2008 it was outsourced on the basis of, "We don't know really what it is". I asked questions to be put forward for the scoping report. Were the minutes discussed with Tony O'Brien who was then CEO of the cancer screening programme? Were there minutes of doctors explaining to him, "We have a problem on this"? They noticed differences in the method of the screening. We must have accountability somewhere. I will be dogged in ensuring that will happen. I am sure other Deputies will do the same thing. Sláintecare is the way forward and we really have to push it. It is the essence of the Private Members' motion and I agree fully with the thrust of the motion. Despite the Minister's declaration of support for Sláintecare, the Government is certainly dragging its feet. Sláintecare will not be implemented by the Department of Health and certainly not by the HSE. That is why a fundamental element of the report was a recommendation for an implementation body, not in the Department of Health, but independent and located in the Department of the Taoiseach. The Government has sidestepped this key element of the report by planning to place the implementation office in the Department of Health. The implementation of Sláintecare will require increased funding over and above the annual health budget. The report calls for a €3 billion investment over six years. Will the October budget make provision for this funding? If not, the Minister's commitment is useless. In addition we also need a major increase in funding for capital development, as the Minister mentioned in his speech, and also day-to-day spending. In the 1980s the Fianna Fáil Government cut hospital beds by 3,000. The service is still struggling and reeling from those cuts. I hope to see the 2,600 acute hospital beds the Minister mentioned and the health service capacity review. I want to see them coming through. I want dates for when they will be brought into the system along with the staff needed to facilitate these beds. From 2009 to 2014 we had five years of cuts to services and staff numbers, including pay cuts and an embargo on recruitment.The service is now faced with the consequences of an inability to recruit staff due to extremely stressful working conditions and low pay, including a two-tier pay scale for nursing staff. We need a health budget of at least €20 billion a year plus the multi-annual fund advocated in the Sláintecare report. We also need the political commitment and the determination to face down the vested interests who will no doubt oppose this report. A first step would be the establishment of the independent implementation office as recommended in the report. We are 80 years behind the European norm. We cannot afford to wait any longer.

It is a matter of deep regret that almost 12 months after the publication of the Sláintecare report, so little progress has been made. There have certainly been plenty of positive noises from the Minister but actions speak louder than words and, unfortunately, the level of action from the Minister in this regard has been very disappointing. Sláintecare is a fully costed, cross-party, ten-year plan for the reform of the health service. It represents a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something of real significance in regard to our health service and to ensure that Irish people, no matter how much they have in their pockets, should once and for all have a legal entitlement to a proper public health service. We are on our own in Europe in terms of not having a universal, single-tier health service and it is not before time that we start to implement one. The priority in the Sláintecare plan is for prevention, early intervention and a strong emphasis on primary care. We need to improve access to end the shocking current situation where we have an inverse care law, whereby those most in need of health care are least likely to get it. We also have an extremely hospital-centric health service and, for that reason, Sláintecare calls for a reorientation of the health service away from hospital care, with a strong emphasis on primary and community care. In that way, of course, we would get much better health outcomes, as well as much better value for money, and it is also what patients want. The committee was very strong on the question of implementation. We did not want this report to be yet another report left to gather dust and, for that reason, we were very specific in regard to the implementation plan and devoted an entire chapter to that. There was a very tight timescale set out but, unfortunately, there has been enormous slippage since the publication of that report. At least six months has been wasted by the Government dithering in this regard and not committing fully to the cross-party report. The intention was that there would be a Cabinet response immediately. Unfortunately, we still have not seen that Cabinet response. The Minister promised it before Christmas, then before Easter, then by May and he is now saying "shortly", but we still have not seen that response. The implementation plan, as others have said, was supposed to be drawn up by the lead executive, not by the Department of Health. If the Department of Health was capable of a reform programme, it would have happened long ago. It is important that the implementation office is entirely separate from either the HSE or the Department of Health if it has to have the strength and the power to drive through the much-needed reforms. When we look at what is most important in the health service, it is a fact that we seem incapable of providing good quality services to our people. That is because the health service has traditionally been dogged by vested interests, which need to be tackled. Equally, there is no accountability within the health service and the HSE does not have an independent oversight board. Some 88 Members of this House voted to abolish the board of the HSE in 2014 so it is empty words from many people now, thumping their breast about the fact the HSE has no independent board. Some 88 Members of this House voted to abolish that so how did they expect there to be accountability? Accountability is also required in other areas - from the Minister, from consultants and from senior managers. All of that legislation should be put in place before a new CEO is recruited. I want to make the point that what happened in regard to Tony O'Brien looking to take on a very well-remunerated position in a US pharmaceutical company was outrageous. It was even more outrageous that the Minister for Health approved that position and he showed very poor judgment in approving it. It is entirely inappropriate that the director general of the HSE should be serving on a board whose chairperson is supposed to be answerable to him as the chair of the board of the biggest hospital group in the country. That is an entirely inappropriate appointment as well and Mr. Thomas Lynch should be removed from that position if we are to have any accountability whatsoever in our health service.

It is accountable to nobody. It was set up precisely to allow Ministers and Government to evade responsibility for problems such as the CervicalCheck scandal. We have to remember the HSE was established by the extreme capitalist free marketeer, the former Minister, Mary Harney, and supported by former Taoiseach, Bertie Ahern, and former Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy. The agency was set up to deliver a service to customers, not patients, and to divest Government responsibility from the health service. It went on to establish extreme right-wing managerialist models of public governance and delivery of services. The head of the HSE is not required to report operational matters to the Minister. His staff do not report failures to him. When a scandal breaks, of course, the Minister can say he did not know, he is shocked, in fact, he is furious. The head of the HSE can say he did not know, he is shocked, he is furious. The Minister and the head of the HSE cannot be expected to resign because they did not know. Now, they are required to clean up the mess. Both of them will set up investigations and inquiries, as they have done. They are both "bloody raging and mad as hell". Then, of course, the Minister and the head of the HSE will ride to the rescue of victims on a white horse. Of course, it will happen again on another issue in another few years, and the merry go round starts all over again. The Minister should do the right thing and abolish the HSE. We need a health service which is democratically accountable at local, regional and national level, and where the Government and the Minister are ultimately responsible for the health service.

I stand to talk on health service reform but, in fact, I could be standing here a year from now and will we have a reformed health service? The programme for Government promised the most fundamental reform of our health service in the history of the State. The need for change in the health service is unquestioned but where is this change? In November 2012 the Government approved Future Health - A Strategic Framework for Reform of the Health Service 2012-2015. Some of the measures it introduced were a health reform board, a programme management office in the Department and a system reform group in the HSE to drive the implementation of the health reform programme. It compiled two reports on the hospital groups, one on the establishment of hospital groups as a transition to an independent hospital trust and the other on securing the future of smaller hospitals. What actions have been taken on these reports? It is one thing to commission these reports but another to deliver action on them. Healthy Ireland, under the heading Building Capacity for Self-care and Self-management of Chronic Diseases in the health service national implementation plan 2015-17, stated there would be implementation of a national framework for self-care for the major cardiovascular, respiratory diseases and diabetes. The HSE national service plan for 2018 states that its mission is to ensure people in Ireland are supported by the health and social care service to achieve their full potential.It states that people in Ireland can access safe, compassionate and quality care when they need it and that people in Ireland can be confident that the HSE will deliver the best health outcomes and values by optimising its resources. This sounds like a wonderful plan but is there a realistic, achievable plan? Only last week I asked questions in the Dáil about the sad and shocking case of Vicky Phelan. When will there be justice for Vicky Phelan? Under the reformed health service, can the Government guarantee that this will never happen again to any person in the State? Why was there no accountability? The current health system is unfair to patients and it often fails to meet people's needs. It is not fast enough but the long waiting lists and overcrowding are but some of the problems in the health service. Deputy Danny Healy-Rae and I will take two buses to Belfast again this month to facilitate people to have a cataract procedure. It only takes 15 minutes but people have been on waiting lists for up to four years in the Republic. Under the reformed health service, will we see waiting lists reduced, not just for cataracts but all procedures? In December last year, my colleagues in the Rural Independent Group and I raised a motion on home care packages in which we called for the home care packages scheme to be established in law to allow everyone an automatic right to the service. Census 2016 recorded a 35% increase in the number of carers aged 85 and over. Carers provide over 6.5 billion hours of care per week in Ireland and, on average, they care for their loved ones for almost the equivalent of a full 40-hour working week. Almost 9% of them provide full, 24-hour unpaid care with no break at all. Last Friday, a constituent of mine from the Clonakilty-Timoleague area told me he cares for a loved one and gets carers allowance but he ends up being paid just €1.59 per hour for all he does. Many carers have to wait for over six months, which is an outrageous attack on our elderly and nothing short of abuse towards the person who cares for them. The first day it is proven by medical evidence that a loved one requires care, a social welfare payment should be made to the carer. This would cut out the shambolic carry-on of leaving a carer for five or six months without any payment, which is also outrageous. The increased privatisation of community care is a clear indication that the public system is not working for some people. The fair deal scheme is the most unfair scheme that has existed in this health service, with people who have worked tirelessly all their lives being robbed of all they have saved by the system. Ireland has an ageing population and 30% of the population will be aged over 65 by 2030, which creates significant challenges and opportunities for Irish society, in particular the Irish health service which is in crisis and looks to be worsening. I cannot imagine how it might be in ten years if we do not begin to change it. In west Cork we have the largest population of elderly people in Ireland and we need extra beds for respite care and more supports for families which provide care for loved ones with dementia and Alzheimer's disease. We need to support and recognise the wonderful work the home help service provides, not only in west Cork but across the country. In most cases, only 30 minutes per day, five days per week is given by the home help service, which is utterly unfair. According to the Healthy Ireland survey 2015, 9% of the Irish population over the age of 15 have probable mental health problems. 
#DannyHealyRae	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-party	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-dob	unknown-#DannyHealyRae-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2018-05-08 00:00:00	Death of Former Member: Expressions of Sympathy	350	I thank Deputy Michael Harty and Mairead and David in Deputy Mattie McGrath's office for putting the motion together for us. It gives me the opportunity to speak on a few very important matters. Waiting times for beds in Tralee General Hospital are unacceptable, with people waiting for two or three days. It is ridiculous. Front-line staff are an issue and we do not have enough nurses. The hospital is overcrowded and Dingle Community Hospital is only half-opened, as is the new hospital in Kenmare. We need a new facility in Killarney because the population doubles and triples at certain times of the year. We are waiting for it and have been told we are getting it but it cannot come soon enough. In the case of St. Mary of the Angels, decongregated settings have to be reviewed. One size does not fit all. Two patients were moved out in the past three years and in June last year one of them was so agitated they kept giving him anti-psychotic drugs. He cannot talk but can lip read and they gave him 28 doses in June last year, with the result that he is now blind. He cannot talk, hear or see now and that is what the decongregated model has done to him. His family has no problem with me naming him but I will not do that. His life has effectively been ended by this. St. Mary of the Angels is being closed by stealth. St. John of God will not take in any more patients and it will close because the patients will die off. The group is trying to do its best but HIQA is changing the goalposts and saying there is not enough room for the patients, so that they now have to fundraise and need to collect €180,000 to build three chalets so that they can keep the patients they have. Parents and friends are doing this work and they are hoping they will get money out of the Ring of Kerry charity cycle. While that is happening, €750,000 is being spent on a house in Cromane to take one patient out of St. Mary of the Angels but no one is fit to go there at the moment, so grass is growing around the house. Someone is being paid to maintain it but nobody is inside. There is another patient in another town in Kerry and no one knows what it is costing. It is costing an unreal amount of money to pay all the nurses and everyone else to mind one patient when they were getting on fine in St. Mary of the Angels. We have five Ministers in the Department of Health and a Government but I know of one poor lady who has an adult son with autism and when she goes to bed every night she locks her door because she is afraid of him. Two or three years ago a son killed his mother and it will happen again if the Minister does not wake up. There was another Minister in Kerry spouting about what money he had got from the Government to deal with these things but on the eastern side of Kerry there is no place to deal with an adult autistic child, who is still a child despite the fact they may be aged 23 or 24 and very strong. This poor woman is afraid and I ask the Minister to address these issues. He should get on his bicycle and go around to listen to the people. When I highlighted the young fella who went blind at St. Mary of the Angels, the only thing St. John of God wanted to know was who told me the story. In other words, it should not have been raised at all. These people want to keep these things in the dark but we are talking about real people, human beings who are not being looked after. They are the most vulnerable people and I appeal to the five Ministers in the Department of Health to do something about it. They know about these things and it is time to act.

We are all aware of the pressures facing our health service on a daily basis and it is important that we, as elected representatives, make the reform of our health service a priority in the months and years ahead.The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, has spoken about our commitment to health service reform. This Government has committed to increasing and improving the capacity and infrastructure of our health service. However, it is clear to everyone that expansion must go hand in hand with reform. The Sláintecare report gives us the platform for a coherent and ambitious reform programme. We are committed to working with all parties across this House and with the health service itself to make the vision outlined in the Sláintecare report a reality. It is clear from the contributions from everyone today that health service reform is and will remain a top priority for this and future Governments. The last couple of weeks have revealed the trauma and agony that can face patients and their families when our health service does not work as it should. We can all agree we are united in our desire to deliver significant improvements, not just in the case of cervical screening but across the health service more generally.  The Minister set out clearly this evening the actions he and the Government are taking in respect of the issues that have arisen with the CervicalCheck screening programme in the last couple of weeks. The Minister has acted quickly and decisively. The announcement today of a scoping inquiry, to be led by Dr. Gabriel Scally, is an important step in getting answers to the many questions we all have. The Minister also announced today that the Government had approved the drafting of a patient safety Bill which will provide for the progression of a number of key initiatives including requirements in respect of mandatory open disclosure.  The issues that have been revealed in respect of CervicalCheck have happened against the backdrop of growing momentum for fundamental and wholesale reform of our health services. This culminated in the establishment of the cross-party Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Future of Healthcare and the publication of its Sláintecare report last year. Again, we are all united in the view that this provides a unique opportunity to bring about real improvements in our health and social care services. Earlier this evening the Minister, Deputy Harris, outlined the actions that have already been taken in response to the Sláintecare report. Claims that the Government has failed to take forward the committee's recommendations are simply not true. An implementation office is being established and a recruitment process for the person to lead that office is almost complete.  Legislation to introduce a governing board for the HSE will be brought forward this year and an independent group is undertaking an impact assessment of removing private practice from public hospitals - one of the key recommendations in the Sláintecare report. The group will report later this year and will provide essential guidance on how this can best be achieved. We know this will not be easy but it will be a fundamental step forward in bringing about a fairer public health service for our citizens. Finally, the Minister is committed to bringing his proposals for a Sláintecare implementation plan to Government in the coming weeks. This will set out a concrete programme of reform for the next decade arising from the report's recommendations and will include a more detailed programme for the immediate years ahead.  As the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health services, I am glad to say that mental health continues to be a priority area for this Government. It committed an additional €57.5 million for mental health services in the budget this year. The mental health budget now totals over €900 million, an increase of 28% since 2012. The Government has recognised the need to further develop early intervention mental health services for those under 18. That is particularly the case in light of the 26% increase in demand for CAMHS service between 2012 and 2016. A sum of €3.4 million has been provided for the recruitment of 114 assistant psychologists in primary care. Of these posts, 111 are filled. This will enhance the primary care response and help to reduce waiting lists for child and adolescent mental health services. The Government remains strongly committed to modernising all aspects of our mental health services in line with the framework for Ireland's mental health service laid out in a Vision for Change. The implementation of a Vision for Change was undoubtedly affected by a number of factors since 2006. These include the changed economic context, public spending constraints and a moratorium on recruitment. I am pleased, however, that in recent years we have been able to increase investment in this area and significant advances have been made in the reconfiguration and delivery of mental health services.  Our focus continues to be on building the capacity of community mental health teams across all areas to facilitate the move from the traditional institutional-based model of care to a more patient-centred, flexible and community-based service. While much of a Vision for Change remains relevant, it is important to ensure we are addressing the current mental health needs of Ireland. As many Deputies will be aware, a process is ongoing to review and update the current policy framework. Developing and improving services for older people - a growing cohort of our population - is also a significant priority for the Government.  My experience of speaking to older people around the country, and of meeting with organisations which represent them, is that they want to live in their own homes for as long as possible. For that reason I am strongly committed to ensuring that older people can continue to live in their own homes surrounded by their family and friends for as long as possible. The Government is fully committed to the development of a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care in order to support the shift towards community services and help people live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes for as long as possible.  Developing a new statutory scheme for the financing and regulation of home care will be an important step in supporting people to live with confidence, security and dignity in their own homes. This scheme will ensure that the system operates in a consistent and fair manner for all those who need home care services. An important milestone in this process was the public consultation which concluded in October last year. The response rate was very high, with about 2,600 submissions received. A report of the findings is currently being finalised and will be published later this month. Further consultation with stakeholders, including service users, will take place later this year.  However, we are not standing still in this area. While the new home care scheme is under development, the Department of Health and the HSE are continuing efforts to improve existing home care services. This includes the provision of an additional 754,000 home support hours in 2018. I would also like it to be noted that this Government recognises the outstanding work done every day by carers throughout the country and the need for further supports for those caring for the most vulnerable in our society. That is why we are committed to delivering new legislation in 2018 to enable people in receipt of full or half rate carer's allowance or carer's benefit to qualify automatically for GP care without fees.  Before I finish, I would like to re-emphasise a number of points made by the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, this evening in respect of additional resources and capacity. As we have seen over the winter months this year, capacity across our system is constrained. While reform is absolutely essential, so too is continuing investment in our services. We know the additional pressures that will arise in the years to come as a result of an aging and growing population. I see this day in and day out in my role as Minister of State with special responsibility for older people. This Government has increased investment year on year for health services. It has committed to a substantial €10.9 billion capital programme to upgrade, modernise and expand capacity across all aspects of the health system.  The health service capacity review showed how much demand on our health services will increase over the next 15 years and made a clear case for the expansion of capacity in the system to meet this. However, I doubt that anyone thinks we should expand capacity around the current design of the health system. It is important therefore that increases in capacity go hand in hand with system reform in order to achieve the health system the people of this country deserve. The Minister, Deputy Harris, and I are committed to working with colleagues across Government and the political spectrum to bring about meaningful reform in our health services. As the Minister previously noted, development of the Sláintecare report, and the cross-party support it enjoys, is unprecedented in the history of the State.  As demonstrated by our debates here today, we all recognise how unique an opportunity we have to make sustained reforms to our system and therefore we must ensure the chance does not pass us by.

I thank all the parties that pledged their support to this motion - Fianna Fáil, Sinn Féin, Labour, Independents 4 Change and Solidarity - People before Profit. I welcome that. The fundamental issue is loss of trust. There has been loss of trust in our health service not only by patients who are seeking care but also loss of trust in those who supply the care, our doctors, our nurses, our home help providers and our care assistants. They have all lost trust in the capacity of this health service to supply efficient and effective care to our patients. That is a deplorable state of affairs. Looking across at the UK, the National Health Service, NHS, even having many problems as it has, is still held up as an icon of social and professional care in the UK. Here, however, the HSE is viewed with derision unfortunately. Many people in the health service are trying to do their best. I know that myself. However, the system is letting them down. The lack of health reform is underpinning this lack of trust. The Minister, Deputy Harris, spoke of personal care. Who delivers personal care? Doctors and nurses deliver personal care. However, they have lost trust in the service. The Minister talked about working together. We worked together on the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on the Sláintecare report. I believe it is a blueprint for reforming our health service. There is no resistance to health reform on this side of the House. The resistance to health reform is coming from the Government. The slowness in responding to Sláintecare underpins that. The Minister of State said that he could not engage in health reform until Sláintecare reported, and yet one year after it reported nothing has happened. There are prolonged appointment systems. There are prolonged review groups. This is a ten-year vision for our health service, and if we continue at the rate we are going it will be ten years before we start reforming the health service. There is no resistance to health reform from this side of the House. We have lost trust in the Minister because of his tardiness in delivering health reform. Demographic changes are going to overwhelm our health service. We are facing huge difficulties down the line due to our ageing population. If we do not reform the health service and expand capacity, we are going to be in very serious trouble. We are in very serious trouble as it is, but it will get worse as years go on. I was taken by Deputy Donnelly's reference to the fact that not only are we the biggest exporter of doctors and nurses but also the biggest importer. That is an extraordinary situation to be in. I fail to understand the Government's lack of curiosity about that position. How can we educate our brightest and best and allow them to go abroad only to trawl the world trying to replace them? It is ludicrous. We have to set timelines on how we address the recruitment and retention issue. We must have timelines for expanding our hospital bed capacity. Intensive care unit, ICU, beds are at a premium now, which is preventing people from having very urgent surgery. We need transitional funding to get over the hump and to meet the unmet need in our service.

It is a pity the Government could not see fit to accept it, but it knows that it will be beaten tomorrow anyway. It will also be bitten by the people when it goes to them to ask for a reaffirmation of support. Why would they not bite? The Government is presiding over a failed system which is rotting at the top. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, should resign. In Britain, Prime Minister May has lost four ministers and no one died. Here, 19 people are dead and many more are seriously injured and let down by a dysfunctional and unaccountable health service. The Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, is present, and I do not dispute his bone fides. I am sorry too that Deputy Neville has left, because his father was so passionate about mental health. The Minister of State knows the system is not working. Today I pointed out that the HSE spends about €400 million every year on medication for the treatment of mental health. A mere €10 million a year, however, is spent on psychological and counselling services. How can that be right? A kindergarten child would know that there should be some kind of balance and that conditions should be treated with therapists and counselling services. I am not being critical of Deputy Harty, but the system seems to function on a prescribing basis. It creates more problems. We need huge accountability. The Minister of State might say that we spend €917 million on mental health, but that is a mere 6.3% of the total health budget. It is dysfunctional. We raised the issue in the House this evening, but the Minister of State was not here. The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, was here instead. It is an awful habit of the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly. Is rud an-salach é. Different Ministers are sent in to take different debates. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing us to discuss the Topical Issue matter again about a meeting we attended in Clonmel last week. There were harrowing, heartbreaking stories. The Minister of State himself met one of those people some months ago, Ms Caroline Lonergan, who told the story of her brother. He pleaded for help. He cried out for it. He was clinging on by his fingernails but was rejected by every service. He eventually took his own life. There are countless other cases of people in the same situation. There were 400 pairs of shoes at the top of the stairs in memory of all the loved ones in Tipperary who have lost their lives in recent years. It is shocking. There is an epidemic and we have a dysfunctional, uncaring system that is unable to account for itself. Why would it, when there is no political accountability? I am not going to dwell on Mr. O'Brien. He should be gone, and good riddance to bad rubbish as far as I am concerned. He has a chequered history of breaking and flouting the law. He did it with the Irish Family Planning Association a few years ago, and despite it all got a promotion from the Minister of Health, Deputy Harris. He is now mixed up in another gold-linked chain of board memberships. He was allowed to go and get other jobs when he had a job here that he could not do. The Minister of Health does not know the system. He does not have the experience and he is inept and unable. He should run away somewhere else and not deny the people what he promised. There are excellent people working in the health service, including the Home Carers Association. Richie Molloy is the manager of that organisation in south Tipperary. There are so many people who give front-line service, and they are jaded. GPs are voting with their feet to leave. They have contracts that are almost half a century old that the Government will not renegotiate. They are constantly threatened. They are then told by the Minister that they are going to be the front line in delivering abortion care. Some 70% have said that they will not have anything to do with it, yet the Government believes it will force them into it. If the eighth amendment is passed, we will see Marie Stopes-type enterprises popping up. Many of the Government's cosy friends are involved in this. Fundraisers have been held for the Taoiseach. The whole thing is a stinking, rotten, murky cesspit, and the Government has no respect for the people. People are going blind, and Deputies Danny and Michael Healy-Rae and Deputy Michael Collins are helping busloads of people to get to Belfast because their cataract operations cannot be performed in the Republic. They can be done in Belfast, however, and paid for here. What kind of dysfunction is the Government presiding over? Each Member of the Government has been through the political process. They should know that if they went back to their constituencies and said they were as dysfunctional as they are, they would never be seen again. To allow this malaise to grow is incredible. There is a hospital in Cashel that is empty. Some €22.5 million was spent on it. It is a patient-free and bed-free zone. They even took out the lift. There are managers galore. They were hired right through the recession. It is dysfunctional and it is giving the electorate and the Opposition the two fingers. It did it when it had a massive majority, but it is worse now that the Government is being supported, aided and abetted by the confidence and supply agreement. The great leader of Fianna Fáil, Deputy Micheál Martin, set up the HSE. What will he say about it? There cannot be a vote of no confidence in Minister Harris now because of the referendum, where a cosy cabal will bring a gross, desperate industry into this country to perish our people again and to banish our young people and our future generations. To hell with the Government. It is a disgrace to humanity and it does not deserve to be sitting in this House. We are going out tomorrow morning to apprehend the Taoiseach. I am not going next to nor near the place. He should be ashamed of himself, going out there in the name of our dead generations and what they did for us. To hell with the people. Stand on them every way possible. Lock them out. Post office masters are being made to sign contracts saying that they cannot speak out. Is the Gestapo operating in Ireland? A man in Germany once carried on in this way and told the people that they could not think or do anything for themselves. We are going in a very dangerous direction in this country. Democracy is being subverted. We have spoken about terrorists. The Government is the real terrorist. Mr. Tony O'Brien is an emotional terrorist, with the bullying and intimidation of the parents of sick children. This Government will go down in history for terrorising the people of the country from whom it got a mandate, and a seal of office from the President so that it would help them. This Government is not helping the people and it does not care about them, but the people are waiting in the long grass with their pinn luaidhe in the ballot box and many egos will fall. This Government deserves no better.
