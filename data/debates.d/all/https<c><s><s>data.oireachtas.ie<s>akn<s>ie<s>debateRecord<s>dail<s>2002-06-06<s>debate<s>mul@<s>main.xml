          <p eId="para_109">Ba mhaith liom an Teachta Ruairí Ó hAnnluain a ainmniú mar Cheann Comhairle. I wish to nominate Deputy Rory O'Hanlon to the position of Ceann Comhairle. Deputy O'Hanlon brings a vast range of experience to the position of Ceann Comhairle, having been Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the previous Dáil and having served as a Minister and a Member of this House for many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">In making this nomination I pay tribute to the outgoing Ceann Comhairle. Chairing the Dáil is a demanding task and often poses considerable difficulties in maintaining order amid the cut and thrust of daily business. Deputy Pattison has always responded with unfailing courtesy and impartiality and I express my appreciation on behalf of all the Members of the previous Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_111">I take the opportunity to inform the House of my intention to nominate Deputy Pattison for election in due course under Standing Order 9 to become Leas-Cheann Comhairle.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">On behalf of the Labour Party, and that of the House, I pay tribute to the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, Deputy Séamus Pattison, who is father of the House where he has given more than 40 years of service. Naturally, on this side of the House, we would have liked him to be re-elected to the post of Ceann Comhairle, but we recognise that the numbers have changed following the general election. Accordingly, we will not be opposing the nomination of Deputy Rory O'Hanlon to the post of Ceann Comhairle. I acknowledge the generosity of the Taoiseach, notwithstanding the numbers on this side of the House, in signalling that he intends to nominate Deputy Séamus Pattison to the post of Leas-Cheann Comhairle. In the circumstances, we will not be opposing the nomination of Deputy Rory O'Hanlon to the post of Ceann Comhairle.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">Glacaim comhgairdeas le gach uile Theachta atá anseo inniu tar éis an toghcháin. Gabhaim buíochas freisin le Séamas Pattison, iar-Cheann Comhairle na Dála. Ainmním Pádraig  Mac Cormaic mar Cheann Comhairle. I do so in the spirit of the reforms of the House that have been ongoing for some years. The Government published the Houses of the Oireachtas Commission Bill, 2002, part of which is to ensure the independence of the Chair of this House from the Government. In respect of the appointment of Ceann Comhairle, as the Government will expect the smooth running of Government to be complemented by the granting of pairs from the Fine Gael Party, as the major opposition party, it should have shown a gesture of independence from Government. I, therefore, propose Deputy McCormack as Ceann Comhairle. He is chairman of the Fine Gael parliamentary party, has represented his constituency for many years and shown quite a degree of competence in dealing with many complex matters.</p>

I welcome the proposal that Deputy Pattison would be honoured with the role of Leas-Cheann Comhairle in the new Dáil.

          <p eId="para_124">A Theachtaí, ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a gabháil libh as mé a thoghadh mar Cheann Comhairle Dháil Éireann. Is mór an onóir domsa é. Fellow Members, it is a very great honour indeed that you have bestowed upon me. I wish to thank you all for the confidence you have demonstrated by electing me as Ceann Comhairle of the 29th Dáil. I am privileged to have been given the opportunity of serving the Members of the Dáil. Having served as Leas-Cheann Comhairle of the last Dáil, I have a good feel for the rules and traditions of this noble House. All Members can be assured of my full support to enable them to fulfil their duties as Deputies in accordance with Standing Orders as laid down by the House. Members can rest assured that their rights in this House will be safeguarded by me. However, I cannot fulfil my obligations as Ceann Comhairle without your support and co-operation. As Leas-Cheann Comhairle I had that support which I am sure will be forthcoming in this Dáil as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">By its long-standing tradition, this House has achieved its place as the cornerstone of our parliamentary democracy which is ever changing and  presenting new challenges, not alone to each of us as Members but also collectively to the Dáil as an institution. In order for the Dáil to be as effective as possible in serving the people, the House and its administration must be efficient and must be modernised. I look forward to playing my part in meeting that challenge.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">In seeking to uphold the best traditions of the House, it is important to remember my many illustrious predecessors. It would be remiss of me if I did not refer in particular to my immediate predecessor, Deputy Pattison. The outgoing Ceann Comhairle made an invaluable contribution in upholding the dignity and decorum of this House. He performed his duties as Ceann Comhairle in exemplary fashion and is worthy of the support of all of us in the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_127">I must now perform my first official duty as Ceann Comhairle. In accordance with Standing Order No. 8 of the Standing Orders relative to Public Business, I wish to make the following declaration:</p>
          <p eId="para_128">I do solemnly declare that I will duly and faithfully and to the best of my knowledge and ability, execute the office of Ceann Comhairle of Dáil Éireann without fear or favour, apply the rules as laid down by this House in an impartial manner, maintain order and uphold the rights and privileges of Members in accordance with the Constitution and the Standing Orders of this House.</p>

I also pay tribute to Deputy Pattison for his sterling work, sometimes in difficult circumstances, over the course of the last Dáil.

          <p eId="para_162">Enda's good humour and warm heartedness are recognised throughout the House and the goodwill towards him is evident on all sides. I nominate him for the post of Taoiseach. As a party, we are not so fanciful as to believe that we have yet earned the right to that post. This is, however, a clear statement of our intentions for the future. Enda Kenny would bring immense capabilities to the post that is now vacant. He knows that politics is the art of resolving conflict as he demonstrated in his chairmanship of the world trade talks in Singapore in 1996, talks that have since descended into a difficult and divisive debate. Enda managed those talks with consummate skill and a deft approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">The strength and character of a leader are demonstrated in adversity. Deputy Kenny has greeted  both the disparagement of defeat and the adulation of success with the same equanimity, showing great strength of character, displaying steadfast good humour and determination in the face of both. Politics demands huge endeavour, but it is not the lonely activity of the solo runner – it requires the capacity to mould a team and motivate people. Enda has galvanised a new Fine Gael around him today after his success yesterday. In the future he will earn the right to occupy the position of Taoiseach. Perhaps it will not be today, but that is what he is determined to do and I am delighted to nominate him today.</p>

          <from>Mr. Howlin:</from>
          <p eId="para_164">I begin by congratulating Deputy O'Hanlon on his election as Ceann Comhairle to the 29th Dáil and thank him and the outgoing Ceann Comhairle, the father of the House, our colleague Deputy Séamus Pattison, for the integrity, dedication and understanding both men brought to their offices during the 28th Dáil. I also congratulate and wish well the new leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Enda Kenny, in the new role he has been given by his party.</p>
          <p eId="para_165">I propose the leader of the Labour Party, Deputy Ruairí Quinn, for appointment by the President as Taoiseach. Deputy Quinn is eminently qualified for the position of Taoiseach of Ireland having served in the House for 25 years and having shown exceptional ability in several Cabinet portfolios he has held with distinction, including the Department of Labour and Department of Enterprise and Employment. He was one of the most competent and successful Ministers for Finance in the history of the State and the exceptionally healthy financial position he left to his successor is in stark contrast to the position the new Minister for Finance will meet today.</p>
          <p eId="para_166">For many in the House and those watching, this whole process may seem like an irrelevant gesture; the outcome of the election of Taoiseach is already a foregone conclusion. The nomination by the Labour Party of Deputy Quinn, our leader, to be Taoiseach is a mark from the outset of this new Dáil of a difference of ideas and policy and an alternative view of politics that is unashamedly of the left. In the coming weeks and months we, in the Labour Party, will place our alternative critique to the House and the State on each policy issue as it arises. There are many new views, new Deputies and new shades of opinion in the House. Each of us in future debates and votes will have to decide where we stand, either in support of the centre-right Government which will be elected today or of developing an alternative. For the Labour Party, the building of that alternative begins here and now.</p>

          <from>Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Ms Harney):</from>
          <p eId="para_167">I begin by congratulating all the 54 new Deputies who have been elected to this Dáil. It is a wonderful privilege to be returned by one's constituents to serve them in this Assembly. For all the families,  friends and supporters, it is truly a wonderful day and I genuinely wish them well.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">As somebody who has been in national politics for 25 years and a Member of this House for 22 years, I have had my ups and downs. In the last election the Progressive Democrats had a terrible result. We lost seats and good people. We were written off until this election by virtually all the commentators and pundits. I suppose it is a long lonely road that has no turning and I say that today because there may be others feeling the way we felt five years ago. It is important to maintain a fighting spirit.</p>
          <p eId="para_169">I pay tribute to the outgoing leader of Fine Gael, Deputy Michael Noonan, for the manner in which he conducted the election campaign and the manner in which he resigned as the leader of his party. He displayed great dignity in the way he handled that particular matter. I wish him and his wife, Florence, every success.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">When I telephoned the new leader of Fine Gael yesterday to congratulate him, I welcomed him to what I called the lonely leaders' club. I genuinely wish Deputy Enda Kenny every success. He probably has been one of the most popular figures in this House for many years. I am not so certain he can maintain that popularity and be a successful leader – I just want to tell him that in case he is in any doubt about it – but he is young, energetic and enthusiastic and I genuinely wish him well. In our democracy diversity and choice are very important and in this election the electorate returned a very diverse group of citizens to represent them. Yesterday I had the privilege of launching an exhibition for the Irish Patchwork Society and I said that I was delighted to be there because I was looking forward to looking at the patchwork that was going to make up the Opposition in the 29th Dáil. It is a diverse group of people and the leader of the alternative government in opposition is extremely important in our democracy and has a very onerous role.</p>
          <p eId="para_171">The Progressive Democrats went into this election as an independent party with independent policies. We advocated a coalition government as the most appropriate form of government for this country. We sought a mandate to participate in a coalition government and we were prepared to participate and work with like-minded parties to deliver effective and stable government.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">It became clear during the general election that there was only one coalition option that had any realistic chance of being elected. I am very honoured and privileged to have served for five years in the outgoing Government. What happened in this election was unique. It was a very decisive result. It is the first Government since 1969 to have been re-elected. It is the first coalition Government ever to have been re-elected and the Taoiseach is the first Taoiseach since 1966 to have been re-elected. I assume he will be re-elected Taoiseach shortly – perhaps I should not be so presumptuous. However, one of the things I liked about Deputy Kenny was that he did not call a vote regarding the election of the Ceann Comh airle when he knew the result was obvious and that augurs well for the 29th Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_173">The new Government has enormous challenges ahead of it. In particular, how do we remain at the heart of Europe and avoid drifting into isolationism and becoming marginalised? How do we ensure that Ireland has a meaningful role and that we are central in the decision making that will take place? How do we put in place the appropriate infrastructure to enhance the quality of life for all our people and how do we maintain full employment and continue to provide incentives to working people and reward them? These are major challenges and I believe that the programme for Government negotiated between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats over the past few weeks provides the framework to deal with those challenges. These are major challenges but they are not insurmountable and, as leader of the Progressive Democrats, I look forward to participating in that new Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">I have had the privilege of working for the past five years with Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach. We have had a good and solid working relationship. He is perhaps the most skilful negotiator ever elected to this House. It is not easy to do a second deal or negotiation with somebody like me and the skills he brought to that were remarkable. As the Minister for Finance said, what he achieved in this election was remarkable. Notwithstanding the high office he holds, he is never far removed from the people who have elected him. I think he genuinely has not forgotten those who have elected him to this House and that has been the key to his success.</p>
          <p eId="para_175">I am very proud to lead a larger Progressive Democrats Party. There are now 22 female Deputies in the House, an increase of only two, unfortunately, but I am particularly proud to lead the only gender balanced party in this House and I encourage others to see if they can have more gender balanced parties in the future.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley:</from>
          <p eId="para_176">A Cheann Comhairle, I warmly congratulate you on your election as Ceann Comhairle. There were times in the last Dáil when there were difficult periods. I think on one occasion you saw fit to throw me out of the House because of an argument about tax on plastic bags. I am glad that tax was introduced. I look forward to a very fruitful and harmonious relationship with you.</p>
          <p eId="para_177">The Green Party cannot vote for a Taoiseach who supports the political apartheid in this House, a political apartheid which means that small parties and Independents are treated as second class legislators. The Tánaiste talked about diversity. There is diversity in this House but we should respect that diversity by respecting the electoral mandates of those individuals.</p>
          <p eId="para_178">Therefore, it is my honour and privilege to propose Deputy Sargent as our nominee for Taoiseach. Deputy Sargent is a man who respects democracy. As a party that has been disenfranchised in this House, we can identify with those  in society who have, effectively, been disenfranchised, the homeless, those with a disability, the poor and those who tonight will have to sleep on trolleys in hospitals in the most demeaning of circumstances. We want to be a voice in this House for future generations. We want to be a voice in this House for the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_179">Mahatma Ghandi once said that the earth provides enough to satisfy every man's need but not every man's greed. The choice this morning is very stark. We have a choice between the politics of greed and the politics of need, and Deputy Sargent represents the politics of need. It was Deputy Sargent who, in 1993, stood up in Dublin County Council, held up a cheque and asked, "Did anyone else receive one of these?" It was a cheque from a developer. He was physically attacked, verbally abused and told that he had impugned the integrity of the county council, but he has since been proved right.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">Deputy Sargent is someone who will always do the right thing. I will conclude by quoting E. F. Schumacher who wrote <i>Small is Beautiful</i>, a book that has proved inspirational to the Green Party. Schumacher said we must do what we conceive to be the right thing and not bother our heads or burden our souls with whether we will be successful because if we do not do the right thing, we will be doing the wrong thing and we will become part of the disease and not part of the cure. We, in the Green Party, want to become part of the cure. We want to do the right thing. This Government is part of the disease and that is why I oppose Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach and I propose Deputy Sargent of the Green Party as Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">Ba mhaith liom ar dtús buíochas a ghabháil leis an phobal i gContae an Chabháin agus Contae Mhuineacháin, i gContae Lú, i gCiarraí Thuaidh agus i mBaile Átha Cliath a thogh cúigear Teachta Dála de chuid Sinn Féin. Is onóir dom seasamh anseo le mo chomrádaithe Seán Crowe, Martin Ferris, Arthur Morgan agus Aengus Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Tá Sinn Féin anseo anois mar pháirtí níos láidre, páirtí atá ag fás ar fud na tíre, páirtí uile-Éireann. Tá sé mar chuspóir againn an t-ionadaíocht is fearr a thabhairt don bpobal agus clár polaitiúl Sinn Féin a chur chun cinn taobh istigh den Dáil agus sa tír. Ar bharr an chláir sin tá próiséas na síochána, athaontú ár dtíre agus cothromas dár bpobal uile.</p>
          <p eId="para_183">I wish to thank all those people who voted and worked for our party in the election. I especially want to thank the people of Counties Cavan, Monaghan, Louth, North Kerry and Dublin who elected five Sinn Féin Deputies. After five years as the lone voice of Sinn Féin in this Chamber, I am joined by my colleagues Deputies Seán  Crowe, Martin Ferris, Arthur Morgan and Aengus Ó Snodaigh. I welcome and congratulate them and all new Deputies. I regard it as a special honour and responsibility to have been selected by Sinn Féin to lead our group in the Oireachtas. I look forward to the challenge of working with my colleagues in effective and constructive opposition in this Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">The Sinn Féin group represents the only all-Ireland party in this Dáil and in the country. Some 300,000 people now vote for our party throughout the 32 Counties. Last night, Councillor Alex Maskey became the first Sinn Féin Mayor of Belfast, Ireland's second city. When I took my seat for the first time in 1997, my two colleague MPs, Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, were here in Leinster House. Today, our party of five Sinn Féin Deputies is joined by our MPs, Gerry Adams of West Belfast, Pat Doherty of West Tyrone and Michelle Gildernew of Fermanagh and South Tyrone. Due to executive commitments, the Minister for Education in the Six Counties, Martin McGuinness and the Minister for Health, Bairbre de Brún, cannot be with us. In 1997, I said that I looked forward to the day when Sinn Féin MPs would take their place in a Dáil with full representation from the 32 Counties. I believe we are moving closer to that day and we in Sinn Féin are determined to make it happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_185">Advancing the peace process and the cause of Irish unity and sovereignty will be a priority for us in the new Dáil. It should be the priority of other parties also. We look forward to working with others of all parties to create a new political dynamic on this island. Four years ago the Good Friday Agreement was endorsed in referenda. The Agreement involved difficult compromises for all concerned but it provided the basis for political progress. It has yet to be fully implemented and Deputies in the new Dáil should focus on this need. The Agreement and the Constitution as amended provide for the reunification of Ireland on the basis of "the consent of a majority of the people, democratically expressed, in both jurisdictions on the island". Common efforts are necessary to pro-actively seek and achieve this consent and to prepare for the future unity of our people and our country. That task should begin now and a Green Paper on Irish unity would be just one element of such a programme. This should be undertaken with urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">It is true to say of the general election that the people did not change the Government, they changed the Opposition. The Opposition benches in the Dáil have been transformed. Part of that transformation was the historic election of five Sinn Féin Deputies. A new reality in a new Dáil must be recognised in the procedures of this House. In common with the Green Party which made its position clear earlier, my view is that  Dáil Standing Orders must be changed if the mandate of the electorate is to be respected. Current Standing Orders severely restrict the ability of smaller parties and Independents to fully represent their voters. This is totally undemocratic and must not be allowed to continue. The Government should take the lead in having Standing Orders amended. I urge whoever is elected Taoiseach today to give a commitment to move forward with such a project with speed. With a renewed mandate, Sinn Féin is determined that the rights of our electorate will be fully vindicated.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">There needs to be an effective and constructive opposition in the Dáil. There should also be co-operation among all parties in advancing progressive legislation on which they can agree. This is often forgotten in the heat of inter-party rivalry. The Dáil as a whole is elected to legislate for the people as a whole. Government should be open to accepting legislation brought forward by Opposition parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_188">What shape will opposition take in this new Dáil? The Deputies of the Labour Party, the Green Party and Sinn Féin now outnumber the Deputies of Fine Gael. There are also more Independents elected on manifestos of equity and equality on a range of issues. The incoming Government, if what is presented is to succeed, will be conservative and right-wing in character, especially given the increased representation of the Progressive Democrats. A real alternative of the left is, therefore, both necessary and possible. Fine Gael cannot provide such an alternative. While I join in congratulating Deputy Kenny on his selection as leader of Fine Gael, it is my view that that party offers only a choice between shades of conservatism.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">A new challenge for all Deputies, regardless of their party affiliation, is whether they will stand for equality for all our people or whether they will stand against equality. Sinn Féin's commitment is to equality and we are ready to work with others who share that commitment. Of course, each party must take its own counsel and pursue its own agenda. As an independent political party, Sinn Féin is committed to both the social and national principles of James Connolly; we are for political freedom as well as social and economic equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_190">When I took my seat five years ago I recalled the pledge of the democratic programme of the first Dáil Éireann to provide all citizens with an adequate share of the produce of the nation's labour. One of the themes of the past five years has been the demand to share the wealth, to ensure the equitable redistribution of the prosperity generated during that period.</p>
          <p eId="para_191">The outgoing Government had unprecedented resources at its disposal. It had opportunities never available to any previous Government. Regrettably, it failed to use those opportunities to create a more equal society. It had five years to begin the transformation of the health service and end the shameful two-tier system, but it  failed miserably. It had five years to address the housing crisis, but it failed even to recognise that there was a crisis while it presided over record local authority waiting lists. It failed to develop effective strategies for the regeneration of rural Ireland. It brought this State into NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace without the referendum promised by the leader of Fianna Fáil and has failed to implement the decision of the electorate on the Treaty of Nice. It failed to ensure the wealth was shared and presided over a widening gap between the privileged and the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_192">The programme for Government is for the continuation of these policies. That is not acceptable. For that reason, my party and I will not be supporting the nomination of the leader of the Fianna Fáil Party, Deputy Bertie Ahern, as Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_193">I fully acknowledge the major contribution made by Deputy Bertie Ahern to the peace process and the achievement of the Good Friday Agreement, the implementation of which remains the single biggest task facing us all. There is still a lot of work to be done. Regardless of whether this relates to policing, demilitarisation, equality, human rights, the all-Ireland institutions and the ongoing need to take all the guns out of Irish politics, the peace process must remain our single overall priority. I look forward to working with the new Taoiseach and his Government and with all parties in advancing the peace process in what may be difficult days ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">In 1997 I pledged that I would speak and vote on each issue on its merits. On most key questions over the past five years I strongly opposed the course taken by the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government. That Government is returning in greater numbers and, as its programme for Government shows, set to continue the legacy of inequality of the past five years. My role and that of my colleagues, therefore, is as a party of constructive opposition inside and outside the House.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_37">
          <from>Mr. Gregory:</from>
          <p eId="para_195">Ba mhaith liom i dtosach mo chomhghairdeas phearsanta a chur in iúl don Cheann Chomhairle as ucht an phoist thábhactaigh atá bainte amach aige. Tá súil agam go leanfaidh sé le traidisiún an neamhspleáchais sa Teach seo mar baineann an neamhspleáchas go speisialta leis an stádas atá aige anois. I gcónaí nuair a bhí sé ina Leas-Cheann Comhairle thug sé cothrom na Féinne domsa agus níl dabht orm ná gur mar sin a leanfaidh sé sa Dáil nua seo.</p>
          <p eId="para_196">I wish to refer briefly to my position on this vote on the nominations for Taoiseach. Before doing so, I take the opportunity to express my thanks to all those who voted for me in my eighth successive general election campaign. I am particularly thankful to those who worked tirelessly with me during the course of the election campaign. Without their efforts, I would not be here today. I also welcome the growing number of fellow Independents elected to the 29th Dáil and wish them well in the work ahead. All the Inde pendents trust that Standing Orders will be changed to reflect and respect our numbers and those of the Green Party, Sinn Féin and, not forgetting my comrade, Deputy Joe Higgins of the Socialist Party, and the mandate we have received.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">On this occasion five years ago I stated that against a background of a booming economy, the then incoming Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, would have the greatest ever opportunity to concentrate resources in areas of most need and make a genuine attempt to end social exclusion and create a more equal society. I pointed out that the record of the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fianna Fáil Party did not inspire confidence in me that this would happen. Nonetheless, I expressed the hope that Deputy Ahern would not preside over the continuation of an unequal society and would not allow the great opportunity presented by the then booming economy to be squandered. Regrettably, that unprecedented, perhaps not to be repeated opportunity, was wasted and misused for the most part in the interests of the affluent in our society resulting, as recent reports have pointed out, in one of the most unequal and divided societies in the developed world with an ever widening gap between rich and poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_198">During the past five years, under the tutelage of the nominee of the Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats parties, Deputy Ahern, successive budgets directed the bulk of the benefits of the so-called Celtic tiger to the wealthiest sections of our people, those least in need. As the CORI justice commission pointed out, "Despite the unprecedented prosperity of recent years, poverty and social exclusion have not been tackled on anything like the scale that was possible given the available resources". Government budgetary strategy was most certainly not aimed at the redistribution of wealth and did not seek to create a more fair or just society. Quite the opposite; it was a calculated strategy which has resulted in even greater social divisions and, as a consequence, deeper alienation among many of our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_199">I refer, for example, to those unfortunate enough to experience the torturous queues and inequities of the two-tier health service in which access is based on affluence rather than need. Are any of those who seek high office today obliged to experience the chaos of the public hospital emergency wards? I think not. If they were, the two-tier system would not last very long.</p>
          <p eId="para_200">In some parts of the constituency which I and Deputy Bertie Ahern represent, a scandalously low 1% to 5% of young people reach third level education while in Dublin 4 the figure can be ten to 20 times greater. The same alienation, therefore, pervades the education system. Despite this scandal, the request of concerned community groups to set up an education task force was ignored. At a time of huge budgetary surpluses the response to appeals from parents, teachers  and management in the disadvantaged primary schools was inadequate. Had the resources been given to them, a significant step would have been taken to counter many of the ills in our society.</p>
          <p eId="para_201">In the area of housing, the ability to obtain one's own home is increasingly beyond the reach of many of our people. The unattainable cost of buying a house is yet another feature of this divided society. Homelessness, in particular among young people, has never been more widespread. The blanket and the cardboard box in the doorways of our shops and offices presents us with the darker side of the Celtic tiger.</p>
          <p eId="para_202">The drugs crisis continues to escalate. Heroin is once more beginning to be sold openly, even across the street from the monument in Buckingham Street in Dublin's north inner city erected to commemorate the many young victims of drugs in the 1990s.</p>

          <p eId="para_203">I am reluctant to intervene, but this debate is about the suitability of a person to be Taoiseach. While passing references to political considerations are appropriate, detailed debate to the exclusion of the main point is not in order.</p>

        <speech by="#TonyGregory" eId="spk_39">
          <from>Mr. Gregory:</from>
          <p eId="para_204">With respect, a Cheann Comhairle, what I am saying is as relevant as what many of the other speakers have said. I am referring to the record of the nominee for the position of Taoiseach, which is most relevant. As I do not have much more to add, I ask you allow me to complete what I have to say.</p>
          <p eId="para_205">Drug users, their families and communities on the ground still live with the same devastation every day of their lives. In recent weeks, a frightening increase in the number of young men taking their own lives has shocked the north inner city community. Against this background people on the margins in community employment schemes have become the target of cutbacks. Very valued community based projects organising crèches, youth activities, homework clubs, care for the elderly and even meals for vulnerable schoolchildren are all under threat. These communities need increased investment, not cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_206">While the people of the docklands have had to find the means to defend themselves against the richest and most powerful of property syndicates, the Government's response has been to remove the representative of the people of North Wall from his position on the Dublin Dockland Authority's council. I call on the incoming Government to reinstate Mr. Gerry Fay on the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_207">Another semi-State body, CIE, refused to recognise the rights of the North Strand area forcing them for weeks to maintain a round the clock vigil at their homes. It is high time the very reasonable concerns of these citizens were properly addressed and legally protected. All of this is hardly evidence of social partnership or a fair, just or inclusive society. It fails to recognise that we are a republic of equal citizens with rights as  well as responsibilities. This is the legacy of the partnership of the Progressive Democrats Party and the Fianna Fáil Party which had the opportunity and the resources during the past five years to address many of these issues. I will oppose their nominee, Deputy Ahern, in the vote today.</p>

          <from>Mr. G. Mitchell:</from>
          <p eId="para_208">A Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you on your election and thank the outgoing Ceann Comhairle for the service he has done to the House. I join the Tánaiste in welcoming new Members of the House and I hope we will all get to know each other in a proper way. I would like also to remember all those who lost their seats and are not with us this morning. They made the ultimate public service by allowing their names to go forward, on this occasion without success.</p>
          <p eId="para_209">I was very surprised to hear Deputy Gregory get through such an eloquent speech without once mentioning Mick Rafferty and the great work he does in the inner city. However, since I usually take up the flag for Mick, I will mention him here this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_210">In speaking in support of the nomination of Deputy Kenny, I want to mention a few concerns I have about the re-nomination of Deputy Bertie Ahern for Taoiseach. From what I have seen of the programme for Government, the indications are that there is no plan whatsoever to end the apartheid in the health services. That apartheid was deliberately and wilfully extended by the Minister for Health and Children from secondary care hospitals into primary care last summer when people on €138 per week, living alone, were left without medical cards while wealthy people were provided with them. Nobody in the press gallery has taken up this issue – the wilful extension of apartheid in the health services – which would not have been tolerated in Alabama in the time of George Wallace. We have allowed it to occur here practically without comment.</p>
          <p eId="para_211">I have misgivings about the re-nomination of Deputy Bertie Ahern as Taoiseach given the housing problem that we have, not just that a married nurse and garda cannot afford to purchase a house, but the fact that when prime sites become available in this city, such as the Clancy Barracks site or the Office of Public Works site in Inchicore, they are not offered to the local authority for house building – not at all, they are offered to anybody and everybody because the Government has no sense of the housing crisis that this city and country face. If it did have a sense of that, every site coming up would first be made available to the local authority to alleviate pressure in the housing market. Instead, we have local authorities chasing houses and forcing young people into ever-increasing upward bids which they cannot afford. Homelessness in this city and country is at an unprecedented level. Has there been any attempt, in a time of unprecedented wealth, to deal with that? It is one of the greatest shames the outgoing Government faces.</p>
          <p eId="para_212">There is talk of a new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform who will make great progress on the issue of justice and equality, but one cannot go to Mass in many parts of my constituency and put one's hand in the holy water fonts because they are sealed over to stop people cleaning their drug needles in them. That has gone on for some considerable time. One cannot go upstairs on a number of buses in this city because people are openly smoking drugs. That is a fact.</p>

          <p eId="para_218">We have a tradition of missionary and NGO work abroad. We have had the very sad history of a famine. Who do we leave to lead the cause of world hunger? We leave it to Bono, not a Minister or Minister of State with responsibility in this area. We leave it to Bono. Why are we not leading the cause? This country, with its history of famine, should lead the cause of world hunger and the debt burden that has been imposed on people instead of leaving it to rock stars who have made great progress on the issue.</p>

We know that the deal between Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats is based on the fact that they know the real state of the public finances. Fianna Fáil could not leave the Progressive Democrats outside because those on the Independent benches would not have the stomach for the sort of things that are coming our way. I ask the Government not to ask poor people to take any more of the burden in any fiscal management it has to under take. I ask it not to ask people on €138 per week to do without a medical card. Please give those who are least well off a break and do not ask them to carry an unfair burden.</p>

          <from>Ms Lynch:</from>
          <p eId="para_222">I will genuinely be very brief. I rise to second the nomination of my party leader, Deputy Quinn. The Labour Party enters the 29th Dáil with a renewed sense of vigour and ambition. It is our task, in the first instance, to provide strong opposition and ensure that the incoming Administration will be held accountable to the people of Ireland. We will do this without fear or favour. However, the Labour Party's goals go well beyond this. The Labour Party has a unique vision of Ireland. Our challenge is to communicate this vision in a clear and distinctive voice. The Labour Party, as re-elected, is well capable of this task.</p>
          <p eId="para_223">We wish in the Labour Party to harness the talent and energy that is clearly in abundance in this country. However, we wish to use that talent, which we have seen in recent years, to the benefit of all, not just the privileged few. It is a goal which is well worth fighting for and it is that task that the Labour Party has set itself over the coming months and years.</p>
          <p eId="para_224">In seconding Deputy Quinn for the position of Taoiseach, I do not believe there is any Member of this House or any person in Ireland who would question his credentials. Throughout his political career, Deputy Quinn has dedicated himself to public service, social justice and progressive politics. In this instance, he has been second to none. He is undoubtedly one of the leading politicians of his generation. It is an honour and privilege for me, on this very special day, to second his nomination to be Taoiseach. He would carry out that role in an honourable and forthright fashion.</p>

          <p eId="para_225">First, I welcome the formation and coming together of the 29th Dáil. It is another important day in our history and it is a particular honour for me to address this House today. We may all have our political differences and may disagree with the way the country is being run, but the bottom line is that the Dáil is the result of our democratic process and we are all eternally grateful for the opportunity to work and live in a democracy. There is nothing wrong in reminding ourselves about this now and again, particularly when one sees so many other countries without this choice. The PR system is fair, equitable and, above all, democratic. The election of our Taoiseach is a very important part of this day. It is a great honour to be elected Taoiseach and despite some strong and differing political views, I wish him and his family well.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">Over the past five years we have seen many changes in our country and economy and I welcome the progressive developments in the areas of the economy, education system, health services, investment in poor areas and the momentum of the peace process. However, we have all  seen the downside of the Celtic tiger too – the greed and the mé féinism that has developed in our society. This is where I feel we have to draw a line in the sand and ask ourselves some serious questions. Have we spent the extra finances and resources in a meaningful way? Have we really shared the wealth with the vast majority of ordinary people, particularly the huge numbers of people that feel excluded from our society? For example, is it correct for the State to spend €1.8 million in legal costs fighting families of children with disabilities in the courts while the same services for those children would cost in the region for €420,000? When will all this madness end? What about the waste of public funds and the trauma caused to all families of children with disabilities? Is it correct to spend €313 million on consultancy fees while a small, but very efficient, hospital in Clontarf is being denied an additional €2 million for an extension to its building?</p>
          <p eId="para_227">It is time to get real in this House and call a spade a spade. This not the way to run a country or a society. Sadly, Ireland now seems to be like a company or economic unit, not a society. This is a wake-up call for all our people. Every day we see antisocial behaviour, violence, abuse of our elderly and a developing cynicism amongst sections of our society. What kind of a country do we have when we see elderly people locking and barricading their doors each evening at 7 o'clock in the months of May and June simply because they are afraid? What kind of society do we have when young men and women can no longer walk home without being attacked? Most of these attacks are unprovoked and appear to be carried out without logical reason.</p>
          <p eId="para_228">We now have a mé féin first society where people put themselves before the common good or the good of the local community or country. It is a throw-back to the Thatcherism of the 1980s, and we all know how that affected people here and in England. We cannot let that happen again. That is one of the reasons the people of Dublin North-Central gave me a democratic mandate, for which I thank them. They voted for change, equality and justice, not charity, and for a more caring and compassionate society. The people want to work for the country, but they want their leaders to work for them. That may be simple, but it is the only way forward.</p>
          <p eId="para_229">We cannot allow carers to work for a maximum of ten hours and to get €7 per hour to look after three elderly disabled people. That is not a compassionate health service or a response to the needs of our elderly. It is not right or good enough. We are aware of the crisis in our health service. Our system is sick and we must make it better. Successive Governments, including the parties in opposition, have failed to provide the necessary infrastructure for our most vulnerable citizens. The recent Disabilities Bill did not include rights for those with a disability. We need to eradicate waiting lists for residential care and to provide improved services through better funding. We also need an approach based on  rights. We need support for elderly carers in the family and a comprehensive plan must be devised to deal with waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_230">We also need accountability from our decision-makers. The Independent group will look for that in the next few years. Extra money must be provided and tough decisions will have to be made. I challenge Deputy Gay Mitchell who spoke about the Independents. The Independents will not be afraid to make tough decisions in the interests of the people and the poor.</p>

It belongs to the people and it must be nurtured and developed every day. I thank the Taoiseach and all the participants in the process.

I challenge the Opposition parties and the Government to do something about that. I will continue to fight on this issue in the interests of the people of Marino, Fairview and Santry.

          <from>Mr. J. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_238">As regards your appointment, a Cheann Comhairle, as you fairly interpreted the rules of the Dáil as Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I hope you will join us in advocating a change of the rules in the 29th Dáil to give full recognition to the small parties which are represented here and to those Independents who have been returned to represent the genuine views and grievances of their constituents. I warmly thank the people of Dublin West who have given me the privilege to represent them again in the 29th Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_239">The first motion is that Deputy Bertie Ahern, leader of Fianna Fáil, be elected as Taoiseach. I oppose the motion. For the past five years Deputy Ahern has presided over unprecedented growth in the economy, but the Government widened the gap between the wealthiest 20% and the poorest 20% in society. The Government saw the speculator reap obscene profits, while countless young workers saw the price of a house move beyond their means. The Government did not lift a finger to protect those in rented accommodation from the outrageous rack-renting of private landlords, despite almost monthly pleadings by me to the nominee Taoiseach.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">The Government copperfastened the robbery of the fabulous resources in the Corrib gas field off the west coast. The people did not get one penny in royalties as it all went to a multinational corporation. As regards the waste management crisis, the Government singularly failed under Deputy Bertie Ahern's leadership to tackle the vested interests of large scale agricultural, construction and industrial groups. Instead it pushed on communities the environmentally reprehensible policy of incineration and it pushed on PAYE workers and pensioners a parallel tier of local taxation in the form of refuse charges.</p>
          <p eId="para_241">In recent days the candidate for Taoiseach did not raise one word of objection as the management of Aer Lingus emulated the tactics of the hated William Martin Murphy, one of the despised figures in our history, in its drive to push down the working conditions of its workforce. Management sought to lock out its workforce with the objective of ensuring that our crucial national asset would be privatised to its profit but to the detriment of the taxpayer and the Aer Lingus workforce. I must also mention the silence and shameless hypocrisy of the media, which did  not raise a whimper. One can only imagine the hysteria if a group of workers had caused the airline to close for five days. It is consistent for the nominee Taoiseach to wave on such privatisations since his party presided over the calculated robbery of the tens of thousands of people who were dupes in the process of transferring Telecom Éireann, a crucial national asset, from public ownership to a multinational corporation.</p>
          <p eId="para_242">Deputy Bertie Ahern has again taken the Progressive Democrats to his bosom. They wish to see every vestige of public ownership extinguished and every public asset transferred to the ownership of faceless multinationals in Bonn, Berlin, New York or Tokyo. It is not as if these multinationals are not taking enough out of the country. Approximately €20 billion was repatriated in profits last year alone by these multinationals.</p>
          <p eId="para_243">Although it seems likely that Deputy Bertie Ahern will be returned as Taoiseach today to preside over another Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government, there are a number of other motions to be dealt with which purport to give us alternative Taoisigh. As regards the Fine Gael nominee, unfortunately, Fine Gael is neither alternative nor radical in its opposition to Fianna Fáil. Its stated commitment to root out sleaze in the State by banning corporate donations lasted only a few months.</p>
          <p eId="para_244">In the face of the first sign of a financial crisis, Fine Gael is found again with its hands abjectly outstretched to big business seeking donations as if the planning corruption, the revolving cheques and the horror of what happened on the interface between business and politics in this country had not happened. The Labour nominee is also posing as an alternative but Labour has long since abdicated responsibility for constructing a radical alternative politics, and that will be the case so long as it opts instead to seek to prop up one or other of the main conservative parties in government.</p>
          <p eId="para_245">The peace process in Northern Ireland, which Deputy Bertie Ahern and other political leaders have taken credit for, is now showing all the limitations of an agreement among political leaders based on the institutionalisation of sectarianism rather than the unity of people on the ground. The sectarian fighting of recent days, with clear paramilitary involvement on both sides, shows that a real peace process is urgently needed. The possibility of that was seen on 18 January last when 100,000 workers in Northern Ireland, Protestant and Catholic, demonstrated together in revulsion at the sectarian murder of a young worker. That is the peace process that must be pushed forward, with working class people, Protestant and Catholic, coming together and addressing the crucial issues that fuel sectarian divisions at present, rampant unemployment in many areas, appalling housing conditions and serious social problems.</p>
          <p eId="para_246">Deputy Bertie Ahern has said that he will put the Nice treaty in front of the people again despite its rejection. Apart from institutionalising a two-tier Europe, the Nice treaty copperfastens a drive towards militarisation within the EU and underwrites the monstrous situation where €70 billion is spent each year within the EU on the creation of weapons of mass destruction. A little sentence coming from Seville in a few weeks, saying that this country will be happy to stand aside while the militarisation process goes ahead and the armament industry drives on, will not satisfy the aspiration of a majority of our people which is to see a complete end to militarisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">In this Dáil, I narrowly failed to be joined by my colleague in Dublin North, Councillor Clare Daly, and am the sole representative of the Socialist Party. I will join those Independents and small parties genuinely representing an anti-establishment view in this Dáil. I caution Deputy Ahern, if he is elected today as Taoiseach, not to think that he will have a smooth five-year period of power. That period may be far more like that of his predecessor, Jack Lynch, who was elected Taoiseach in 1977 with a 20-seat majority, yet within two years was in dire trouble due to a huge movement of organised working people. Based on the programme for Government, which proposes to privatise and slash areas of the public sector, Deputy Ahern may well find himself in the same position.</p>
          <p eId="para_248">I particularly want to see the abolition of bin taxes, the reversal of the privatisation of local authority refuse collection and real measures to compel a reduction of waste at source as well as major projects on reuse and recycling.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Dá bhrí sin beidh mé ag cur in aghaidh na n-iarrthóirí atá ainmnithe ag na príomh pairtithe. Is é atá i gceist ag na pairtithe úd ná leanúint ar aghaidh le polasaithe a thugann omós, thar aon ní eile, don margadh caipitleach agus a leathnaíonn an bearna idir lucht an rachmais agus na gnáth daoine.

Deputies have an opportunity today if they want a Fine Gael Taoiseach, a west of Ireland Taoiseach and a Mayo Taoiseach. I call on all those sent up from the west to march into the division lobbies today and vote for a west of Ireland Taoiseach. We have been sent here to make sure that we do the best we can for the west. There are many defects in the west such as infrastructure, roads and, as Deputy Joe Higgins mentioned, gas. The gas is coming out of north Mayo but the people of Mayo are not getting a lot from it, as the people of Ireland are not getting a lot from it.

As one of the new Members, it is a historic day for me and my family. In the interests of the best governance of this country and of my county, the peace process, the unity of our country some day down the road and a just conclusion to the 1970 Arms Trial, I will be voting for the outgoing Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern, to be elected today as Taoiseach.</p>

          <p eId="para_261">Gabhaim comhgairdeas leat, a Cheann Comhairle, as ucht do phost nua a bhaint amach. I ask the Ceann Comhairle as a priority issue to ensure that the election result is represented in the House. There is a totally new political scenario with a large number of Independents and an increased Green Party and Sinn Féin presence. Standing Orders of this House should be amended to ensure that all Members have additional and proper speaking rights. I thank the people of Tipperary South who have re-elected me to Dáil Éireann. When one is elected in a by-election, one has a sense of unfinished business until one has been returned in a general election and I thank the people of south Tipperary for doing that.</p>
          <p eId="para_262">The Taoiseach has chosen Boston rather than Berlin. Fianna Fáil has 81 seats in this Dáil, the same number held by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats at the inception of the last Dáil. The Taoiseach also has the support of the three independent Deputies who supported the outgoing Government for five years. As this gives the Taoiseach an overall majority without the Progressive Democrats, the decision to include the Progressive Democrats in Government is a deliberate political choice by the Taoiseach. He has decided to form a Government of the right rather than the centre. This choice bodes ill for working people, the poor and the deprived and for the provision of well-funded public services, including health and education. I will be voting against Deputy Ahern's nomination.</p>
          <p eId="para_263">I ask Fianna Fáil Deputies and supporters to consider the implications of Deputy Ahern's choice. He has given over the direction of Government policy to eight Progressive Democrat Deputies out of 166. These Deputies were elected in some of the wealthiest constituencies in the State. It would be possible for Fianna Fáil Deputies to remove the Progressive Democrats from office without bringing down the Government. For this reason Fianna Fáil Deputies must take full responsibility for the policies of this new Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">At present, there is no economic crisis and growth rates are healthy by international standards. However, there is a crisis of Government finances. The outgoing Government has undermined the tax base. This is not due to an error or miscalculation. It is part of deliberate policy plan espoused by the Progressive Democrats and the McCreevy wing of Fianna Fáil. In this plan, tax reductions are handed out to the super rich under cover of an unprecedented boom. The extent of the boom ensures that revenue continues to increase for a time but when growth rates shrink to a still healthy 5%, a gaping hole opens in the public finances. This hole is then used to justify more right wing policies. State companies must be sold off, service charges increased, public servants penalised in their pay packets and pensions and much needed improvements in health, education and welfare delayed. When the temporary injection of privatisation proceeds is exhausted,  charges and cuts must be increased further. Development of infrastructure through public private partnerships gives the wealthy risk-free profits guaranteed by the taxpayer and the gap between rich and poor widens further. We are in the poorer areas of Boston rather than on the streets of Berlin. Market forces are unleashed on the delivery of health and education while human co-operation, community solidarity and collegiality are devalued. Greed is king. This is the policy the Taoiseach has chosen.</p>
          <p eId="para_265">A political means must be found to resist and defeat these trends. In previous Governments the Labour Party helped the rich down this road and tax amnesties for criminals and budgets for the rich were the order of the day. Nevertheless, the people found ways of expressing their dissent. Left wing independents, health independents, regional independents, Sinn Féin and Green candidates were elected in significant numbers. Fine Gael is now in a minority in the Opposition. Independents, Sinn Féin and Greens are more numerous than Labour Party Deputies. The political landscape has changed. Those of us who have been elected as representatives of the discontented have an obligation to show a new way forward which attacks poverty, protects pay and workers' rights, defends and enhances health and education services and protects the principles of human solidarity and cultural values against principles based on greed. Neither the dollar nor the euro must be king in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_266">There is a widespread lack of confidence in all the main political parties on health issues. This has resulted in the election of several health independents and the excellent performance of Ms Kathy Sinnott. This Dáil must address the deficiencies in the health service as a matter of urgency. I appeal for an immediate doubling of the financial threshold for eligibility for medical cards to enable people of modest means to attend a doctor. There are major gaps in health provision in the regions and I call on the Government to announce a radiotherapy service for the south-east, based in Waterford, without delay and the extension of BreastCheck to the regions.</p>
          <p eId="para_267">The Dublin media and certain politicians have taken to describing independent candidates elected in protest at the neglect of their constituencies as mere parish pump politicians. The privileged will always find voices to justify their privileges. The election of several regional independent candidates is simply a public response to the failure of all recent Governments to address the extreme imbalance between the regions and within regions. We demand the decentralisation of Government jobs and Departments to the regions. In south Tipperary we have been omitted from two previous rounds of decentralisation. We want our fair share, which amounts to 750 decentralised jobs for County Tipperary. It now appears that central Government is about to impose a monopoly local radio service on my county and to bring about the  demise of Tipp Midwest radio. This is a community based, non-profit making local radio service. Why can two successful radio services not continue? Surely big brother should not have the power to impose such decisions? Any attempt to downgrade either of the two stations will be resisted. I will be co-operating with the regional Independents and other Deputies to end the complacency which exists in the main political parties on regional issues. The real parish pump politicians are those who keep the bulk of the public service in Dublin and send the balance to ministerial constituencies. The fake decentralisation of 300 civil servants to Celbridge by the previous Government shows the cynicism that exists in the Government parties on this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_268">I add my support to the nomination of Deputy Kenny as Taoiseach. The last speaker referred to the number of independent candidates elected in the recent general election. One of these was elected in my constituency of Cavan-Monaghan and I welcome Deputy Paudge Connolly to the House. The people of Cavan-Monaghan elected Deputy Connolly because the Government refused to give the necessary help to Monaghan General Hospital. In the knowledge that he will be appointed in spite of Fine Gael's nomination, I use this opportunity to beg Deputy Bertie Ahern to ensure that the needs of this hospital, which is situated in a Border region, are looked after and the rightful services provided for the people of the region. More than 7,000 people have spoken out on this issue and I ask Deputy Ahern to ensure that their rights are addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_269">I question the Taoiseach's leadership of the past five years, during which time five agricultural colleges closed. I worry about what will happen to the six remaining colleges in the next five years. Little has been said in the new Government's programme about agriculture and, given the make-up of the team which drew up this programme, I find this surprising. Unless aid is given to young farmers to encourage them to attend agricultural colleges the future of agriculture is in grave danger.</p>
          <p eId="para_270">I question the Taoiseach's lack of commitment to the peace process in the Border region, given the plans for the dispersal of funds on infrastructure in the region between now and 2006. Three bypasses were promised on the N2 and N3 in counties Cavan and Monaghan but no money has been provided for these projects in the past 12 months. We must use the EU BMW funds between now and 2006 and the Taoiseach will be judged by the way he deals with these funds in the next five years.</p>

          <p eId="para_274">Well pointed out, Sir. Before I list Deputy Sargent's evident qualities I will state some of the reasons I will not be supporting the other nominees for Taoiseach. While I congratulate Deputy Kenny on his election as leader of Fine Gael, I could never support his nomination as Taoiseach. Given the fact that Fine Gael does not know where it is going, how could that party know where the country will go?</p>
          <p eId="para_275">If Deputy Ahern was a brave man, he would refuse to accept this nomination. He made promises he did not keep. Five years ago he promised a referendum on Partnership for Peace, but this did not happen. We are now being asked to elect a Taoiseach, who has failed to live up to his promises, for another five years. That is one reason I will not be supporting Deputy Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_276">Another reason for not supporting his nomination is the privatisation of Eircom. The Green Party believes privatisation should be examined on its merits and should not be an issue of principle. I will not offer concessions to the people who lost money because they were encouraged to be greedy. However, any chance this country has of unbundling a proper local loop throughout the country has been severely diminished. If we want to keep a young well-educated workforce and a country that can attract proper foreign investment, we need to be able to offer the best that IT can provide. We cannot do that if it is in the hands of a company which does not even belong to anyone in this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_277">I am happy that Deputy Sargent has appointed me as spokesperson on education and science. The gap between primary and secondary education is widening. There is more money spent on infrastructure at second level than at primary level. Even the most basic infrastructure, that of school places, has not been provided. In my constituency of Dublin Mid-West there is an example of Griffeen Educate Together which seeks temporary approval from the Department of Education and Science without which it cannot proceed with a planning application to build a school in Lucan. There will be a shortage of about 150 places in Lucan next September. There is no point in having a so-called decentralised Department of Education and Science outside Dublin when what is needed is proper decentralisation in order that people can see what is happening on the ground. I will not speak about sport because I have already stated the original Sports Campus Ireland was a monumental testament to vanity rather than what is needed for the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_278">My last reason for not supporting Deputy Ahern for Taoiseach is based on the policies pursued by Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats in coalition. They bewildered the electorate with their betrayal of voodoo economics. They take every opportunity to ridicule the Green Party's economic policies without even knowing what is contained in our party's economic policies, yet they profess economic policies that rob from tomorrow to pay for today.</p>
          <p eId="para_279">Without a quality of life indicator, how can the well-being of society be measured? It cannot be done. When I studied economics for my leaving certificate, I was told that if I mowed my neighbour's lawn and my neighbour cut my hedge, no GNP is created, but if we charge each other €5, there is €10 of GNP. That stands for nothing if our well-being and quality of life have diminished. Unless we take into account the environmental and social consequences of any economic activity, we are playing voodoo with people's minds. It is sheer voodoo economics. Robin Hood robbed from the rich to give to the poor, the Government has robbed and intends to continue to rob from the poor children of tomorrow to pay for the rich parents of today.</p>
          <p eId="para_280">In the past five years the gap between rich and poor has widened. In seconding Deputy Gormley's nomination of Deputy Sargent as Taoiseach I point out that the first speech that had any element of vision or policy was that of Deputy Gormley. The Green Party is one which knows where it stands, what vision it wants to portray and has increased its mandate in Dáil Éireann based on that vision. We want to be part of the cure, not part of the disease. We want to see measures that increase people's quality of life, rather that just increasing the money in the pockets of an elite few. Unless the gap between rich and poor can be diminished and the quality of life of people living in disadvantaged areas can be visibly improved, the next five years will be another failure.</p>

          <from>Mr. Connolly:</from>
          <p eId="para_281">The people of Cavan and Monaghan have honoured me by choosing me in the recent general election to represent their views and concerns on a number of issues, in particular the battle for the retention and upgrading of a fully equipped, fully staffed and properly funded hospital in Monaghan. I thank the people of Cavan and Monaghan who voted for me. It is obvious that Monaghan General Hospital is top of the agenda in Monaghan. I thank my election team, headed by my friend and colleague, Brendan Casey, for the vast work they did in having me elected to Dáil Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_282">My support for the election of Taoiseach is contingent on a number of factors, including the retention of Monaghan General Hospital's accident and emergency department beyond the previously announced deadline of 4 July. Major trauma cases are currently forced to bypass Monaghan General Hospital and must be brought to Navan, Drogheda or Dublin. I want to see the  provision of a CAT scanner in an enhanced accident and emergency general hospital in Monaghan. In relation to CAWT, I welcome the development of the co-operation between Craigavon Hospital and Monaghan General Hospital. I would like to see an increase in this type of cross-Border co-operation to serve the people of the Border region.</p>
          <p eId="para_283">Incineration or, as it is euphemistically known, thermal treatment is another of my major concerns. The emphasis should be placed on recycling in the interests of the preservation of the environment. In relation to third level education, I would like to see outreach facilities provided in Monaghan. This works in other parts of the country and I would like to see Monaghan or Cavan town being given the opportunity of providing them. It would make it much easier for the students and their parents who are at a disadvantage in rural Ireland to continue their education.</p>
          <p eId="para_284">While I wish the new Government a fair wind and the Opposition a constructive and fulfilling role, I shall remain eternally vigilant in the interests of the preservation of services at Monaghan General Hospital. I will be supporting the motion and hope my support will benefit the people of Cavan and Monaghan who elected me to Dáil Éireann.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. Breen:</from>
          <p eId="para_285">A Cheann Comhairle, I congratulate you on you election this morning. It is a great privilege and honour for me to stand in this House today and give voice to the mandate given to me by the people of Clare. This mandate is one not to be ignored or dismissed by the incoming Government. I, as an Independent candidate, without the support of a party organisation, in the traditional heartland of Fianna Fáil, Dev's own county, was the first person elected with nearly 10,000 votes leaving two of the sitting Fianna Fáil Deputies to be elected without reaching the quota. My mandate from the people of Clare is loud and clear and the incoming Government will ignore it at its peril.</p>
          <p eId="para_286">After a period of enormous economic prosperity, what has been delivered to Clare is a damning indictment of the last Government. Ireland has been "Dublinised" and "easternised" and the Pale reinstated. The Ennis bypass project has been postponed even though the road is a vital infrastructural link for Clare and the west. The future viability of Shannon Airport has not been guaranteed. Shannon Airport is the key to economic development in Clare and the west. It must be maintained as an international airport and the negotiation of the bilateral agreement with the United States kept in the hands of the Government. It is not and never will be on the table for the European Union to meddle with.</p>
          <p eId="para_287">Without improvements in rail and road infrastructure the future for tourism and industry in the region looks bleak. The health service in Clare is in a shambles.

Babies are being born on the side of the road because parts of west Clare are over 70 miles from Limerick, and there is no dedicated ambulance service in Kilrush. County Clare needs a CAT scanner and qualified technicians to operate it.

          <p eId="para_306">Is cúis mhór áthais domsa seasamh anseo inniu os comhair na Dála mar Thaoiseach ainmnithe ar phoblacht na hÉireann. Is mór an onóir, an phribhléid agus an dualgas atá orm an cheart a dhéanamh ar son mhuintir na hÉireann agus luífidh an Rialtas nua seo chun oibre le fuinneamh. We have been sent here by the people as their Deputies to this, the 29th Dáil. In being elected by the people to public office, we have been accorded the highest honour possible in this republic.</p>
          <p eId="para_307">Politics is a noble calling. It is, first and last, about public service. Public life is something of which we, our families and the organisations who support us can be proud. We can take pride in the fact that we have been given the trust of our neighbours and communities to represent them here in Dáil Éireann. However, the justifiable pride we all feel here today must be matched by a sense of duty and by the determination to earn our place by hard work and with integrity.</p>
          <p eId="para_308">We began our business today, Sir, by electing you Ceann Comhairle. We have entrusted to you the ordering of our parliamentary affairs and I know that we can do so with great confidence. I offer my congratulations on your election and I assure you of the respectful co-operation of my colleagues and I in the discharge of your important duties.</p>
          <p eId="para_309">The people have been well served by the many Members of the last Dáil who are not here today. Some retired from public life after long years of fine public service while others endured the heartbreak of losing their seats in the general election. On behalf of the people whom they all served, I thank them for their contribution to politics and wish them well for the future. It is appropriate that we think not only of former Deputies but of their families and supporters.</p>
          <p eId="para_310">Every Deputy elected to this House comes here not only because they have worked hard for the people but because, in turn, so many others have worked hard for them. It is the people who put themselves forward for election, as well as their family members, supporters and party workers, who are the stalwarts of our democracy. I take this opportunity, on behalf of us all, to pay tribute to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_311">This is a day of great achievement and pride for the many Deputies who take their seats in the House for the first time. I congratulate them, their families and supporters, many of whom are with them in the Visitors Gallery. Many more, who are disappointed that they could not get tickets for the Gallery, are in the precincts of Leinster House. Among them are future Taoisigh and Ministers and upon them lie the hopes and expectations of the rising generation. I know the trust and hope put in them will not be misplaced. My only advice to them is to remain true to themselves and close to the people who elected them.</p>
          <p eId="para_312">I owe a special debt of gratitude to the people of Dublin Central, who have elected me to this House nine times in the past 25 years, and to the local party members who have worked so hard for them. I pledge to continue to work hard for the people with whom I grew up, the community in which I have lived all my life and the neighbours who have rewarded me with their trust.</p>
          <p eId="para_313">With your permission, Sir, I wish to address some remarks to Deputy Noonan. It is my first opportunity to do so since he announced his decision to resign as the leader of the Fine Gael Party and the Opposition. The Deputy and I have been political adversaries for a long time. He has served in the front rank of Irish politics for 20 years and with distinction in a number of important Departments. He marked my cards when I was Minister for Finance a decade ago and, again, in my period as Taoiseach I learnt to respect his abilities as a Minister and his forensic capacity as an Opposition spokesperson. The general election campaign he fought has deepened my respect for the man and the politician. He never gave up and, not even for a moment, did he give the slightest comfort to his opponents. He campaigned to the end with great dignity and composure in the face of increasingly adverse odds. I take this opportunity in Dáil Éireann to pay him tribute and to wish him, his wife, Florence, and their family every happiness in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_314">I also salute the other Deputies who served as party leaders in the 28th Dáil. Deputy Quinn and Deputy Sargent continue to lead their parties. Deputy John Bruton and former Deputies Spring and De Rossa served their parties with distinction. Political leadership is difficult. Not only is it a great honour but it is also a great and sometimes lonely responsibility.</p>
          <p eId="para_315">Today Deputy Kenny takes his place in Dáil Éireann as leader of the Fine Gael Party. I congratulate him on his election and I look forward to a constructive exchange of views with him and the representatives of the other parties in the House. Deputy Kenny has been a Member of the House for a longer period of time than me and he has worked hard in many offices and responsibilities. Today is a great day for him.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">I am deeply honoured that, in accordance with the Constitution, Dáil Éireann has nominated me to the office of Taoiseach. It is a great honour and I know from personal experience that it is also a great responsibility. It is a responsibility to all the people of Ireland, in every community and in every part of the country. It is a responsibility to reach out and to listen, to be available and to take account of the people's concerns. It is a responsibility to remain close to the people and rooted among them. This is a responsibility I set for myself and my Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">High office does not, however, confer upon its holder either the monopoly of wisdom or the benefit of hindsight. The office of Taoiseach brings with it not just political responsibilities but personal challenges as well. It is a challenge to remain calm in the face of political turmoil and to remain humble in the midst of public honour. We must never forget, and I in particular must never forget, that we were sent here by the people for a limited time and we are here on their account alone. It is my duty and it will be the duty of those Deputies whom later today I will nominate to serve in the Government to lead this republic by example.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">Inevitably in the most human of professions, mistakes are made. They are made in the public eye in Government in a way that is unparalleled in any other walk of life. The humility to recognise a mistake has been made and the wisdom to learn from it make real political leadership. That is what I myself aspire to and that is what I ask of my colleagues in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_319">I thank the Tánaiste for the support and partnership she has offered over the past five years. I believe, and the people showed by their support, that we did a good job for Ireland. I believe that our political partnership and good personal relationship have provided good government for this country. I look forward to working with her and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats over the next five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">As Deputy McCreevy said this morning, for the first time since 1969 a Government has been re-elected, and with an increased mandate, and I am conscious that for the Tánaiste and me it is the first time since 1966 that two people have the honour that we have today. The Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrat Government I will nominate later today comes into office at a time of unprecedented opportunity to build a fair society of equal opportunity and sustained prosperity on an island at peace with itself. That is our ambition for our country and our mandate from the people. No one in this House does not believe  that it is for the people who are less well off and face difficulties, for health and for education, that we are here. I have never met a Deputy who has not had working for the people as the foremost of his intentions. Sometimes we talk about right, left and centre, but on the ground Members of the House might work with different philosophies but they all work for the people because it is the people who support them and elect them. The Irish people have a great sense of justice and while people want to see their own area or sector helped, everyone wants to see justice and equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">The Irish people can be proud of the achievements of peace, prosperity and progress of the past five years. The challenge now is to sustain these achievements and ensure they are lasting. Too often in our history we have seen the promise of peace, only to see it wither away again. Too often we have enjoyed the beginning of economic progress only to see it disappear. It is the historic challenge of the Government that takes office today to ensure the Good Friday Agreement is not a false dawn and that our economic development does not prove to be fool's gold.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">It is not enough to sustain what we have; much more remains to be done. In Northern Ireland there are those in both communities who remain to be assured of their place in an inclusive settlement as well as those who have yet to fulfil their commitments to that. Building a lasting and just peace on this island is my great political goal, the priority that I have and will continue to put above all else.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">We also have the great task of not only extending prosperity in time but expanding it in scope to reach all our people. We must manage the economy prudently not only to meet the needs of today but to safeguard our welfare for many years to come. We must build up our infrastructure and public services so that our economic growth is matched by our quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">These are the social and economic goals of this partnership Government and, through the elected representatives in Dáil Éireann, the Irish people have conferred upon me again the highest political responsibility in the land. I will repay the trust of the people with all my energy and all my commitment. I pledge to work ceaselessly in their interest and never to give less than my very best.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">With great pride and a sense of great responsibility, I accept the nomination of Dáil Éireann for the office of Taoiseach.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_79">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_326">On behalf of Fine Gael, and on my own behalf, I warmly congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern on his re-appointment as Taoiseach to lead the first Government to be re-elected since 1969. While the Taoiseach's re-election and the appointment of his Government will be uppermost in his mind, he should be aware of the enormous tasks that lie ahead. The public finances are facing a period of major difficulty and concern. The jobs of thousands of people are far from secure in the current uncertain economic climate.  Many people, including those with disabilities and their carers, feel voiceless and excluded. The concept of the dignity of public service has been annihilated in many cases.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">This will not be a golden age for the Taoiseach and the incoming Government. I promise him that Fine Gael will offer vigorous and energetic opposition. We will be constructive in the national interest and will support when it is right to do so. We will oppose when the needs of these people and all Irish citizens are not being met.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">I thank the Taoiseach for the sentiments expressed about Members who are not here, about their families, about my own appointment as leader of this party and, in particular, his sentiments in respect of my immediate predecessor, Deputy Michael Noonan. In a recent public opinion poll, the Taoiseach was rated around 75%. Someone remarked to me that it was a pity he was not at 95%. When I asked why he replied that if he slipped three points, people would say he was on his way down.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">I wish the Taoiseach luck. We will oppose him when we should do so and will support him in the national interest when that is necessary.</p>

        <speech by="#RuairiQuinn" eId="spk_80">
          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_330">I congratulate the Taoiseach on a remarkable political achievement. The scale of the vote the Taoiseach received and the fact that this is the first time an outgoing Government has been re-elected since 1969 is a testimony to his extraordinary popularity and the dedication he has given to politics and public life since we first served together on Dublin City Council back in 1971. This is the Taoiseach's moment and that of his party in Government. It would be ungenerous for any of us not to recognise that and not to salute the victory he has achieved. The fact that we disagree with the victory and the fact that we failed to carry the people on this occasion is not something upon which we will dwell today. There will be many other days on which we can return to that matter and to the other issues that will arise.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">On behalf of the Labour Party I congratulate the Taoiseach and, indeed, his partner, Celia Larkin, who has worked so closely with him all these political years. I wish the Taoiseach happiness in the five difficult years ahead. As Deputy Kenny has said, there will be difficult years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">I pay tribute to Deputy Noonan for the work he did as leader of the Fine Gael party, and prior to that, to Deputy John Bruton. In particular I salute my former party leader, Dick Spring, who sadly left this House in a manner that would not be of the choosing of any of us. His dedication to public life, his commitment to the peace process and his commitment to the people of north Kerry, in particular, were quite extraordinary. He has set a standard that will be very difficult for those who follow him to emulate.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">In that context, I also extend my sympathy to the former deputy leader of the Taoiseach's party, Mary O'Rourke. To lose a seat in the con text in which her party was being re-elected to Government is a double twist and a double injury, and this cannot be easy. Any one of us who has been elected to this House, and, more importantly, those of us who have had the experience of losing a seat only to regain it, know just how difficult on a personal level that is, not only for the individuals involved but also for the families who surround them.</p>
          <p eId="para_334">I now want to talk to the Lazarus party of Irish politics. I want to talk, in particular, to the incoming Tánaiste, Deputy Harney, and her colleagues in the Progressive Democrats who have performed a feat that defied all our expectations. In particular, I pay tribute to my constituency colleague, Deputy Michael McDowell, who has finally got the timing right and managed to get into Leinster House at the same time as his party gets into Government. It took him three times to do it, but I wish him well in respect of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">For my part, the Labour Party will provide a critique of the politics of choice, this centre-right Government which has pursued a deliberate political ideological agenda masked in the cosy populism of a very popular man, who sincerely believes what he says but allowed his Minister for Finance to contradict him at every twist and turn in terms of the policy that was implemented. We will provide that critique and analysis as we did in the past. It is my sincere hope our critique will be sufficiently convincing to enable the public at large to support our alternative view of Irish society.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">I say to all of the new Deputies elected to the House that I wish them well. I wish them happiness, contentment and fulfilment. I share with the Taoiseach the view that politics is about public service. It is about doing the people's business publicly, transparently and honestly in this Republic. I salute all our predecessors who have made this democratic Assembly a reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">We will provide vigorous left opposition during the next five years. We will do what we have been elected to the House to do, that is, provide vigorous, sustained and honest opposition to this right of centre Government.</p>

          <p eId="para_338">Ar dtús báire, ba mhaith liom comhgairdeas a dhéanamh leis an Uasal Ahern as téarma eile mar Thaoiseach a bhaint amach. Déanaim comhgairdeas freisin leis an Teachta Enda Kenny mar cheannaire Fhine Gael agus guím "Gach rath agus go n-éirí leat", ar an Teachta Noonan tar éis an méid oibre a rinne sé.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">Is lá sásúil é do Fhianna Fáil agus don Pháirtí Daonlathach ach, dar liomsa, is lá dainséarach é don tír seo agus go mór mhór do dhaoine bochta na tíre agus don domhain ar fad. This Government is going to claim, when it returns after a sumptuous lunch, that the people are adequately housed and adequately fed, but the facts, to anybody who examines them, are that homelessness and malnutrition make Ireland one of the worst performers in the European Union. The level of homelessness in Dublin alone is greater than in a  number of British cities put together. Poor diets and high alcohol intake are creating the kind of health crisis which would not respond to even twice or three times the amount of money being invested in the hospital system. The Government, under the Taoiseach, by its policy in the last Dáil has created a sick and divided society.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">The Green Party of Deputy Gormley, Deputy Boyle, Deputy Gogarty, Deputy Ryan, Deputy Cuffe and I will apply logic, force of argument and the voices of experience to pressing the case for building sustainable communities. The first step on that road is to ensure the Government – I urge the Taoiseach to take this on board – measures more than financial capital. Ireland needs measures of social capital, natural capital, physical capital and human capital, without which the Taoiseach's claims of peace, progress and prosperity are little more than a rubber stamp on a brown or, indeed, white envelope issued by An Post. In spite of our differences I wish the Taoiseach well because he has certainly earned the mandate of the people, but I urge him to reflect on and reform the undemocratic and disproportionate nature of this Assembly which is in sharp contrast to the parity of esteem shown in Stormont for which all of us have called and worked through the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I hope he can accept the points we make, as they are made, not out of a yearning for personal gain, but for the sake of satisfying need, not greed. I urge him to work in that spirit of co-operation in this Dáil.</p>

I assure him of our intent to provide constructive opposition throughout the course of the 29th Dáil and reaffirm what I said earlier in my contribution to the debate on the nominations for the position of Taoiseach, that my colleagues and I look forward, both inside and outside the House, to working with him in pursuit of the realisation of the promise and hope of the Good Friday Agreement. I wish him and all those committed to that realisation well in that pursuit.</p>

          <p eId="para_345">It is not agreed to. The Taoiseach outlined very clearly one of the problems that has and will increasingly become a feature of this Dáil, that is, the failure to recognise smaller parties and Independent Deputies. He has outlined an Order of Business which relates to parties of seven members or more. He is, therefore, essentially disenfranchising the other groups in this Dáil which are considerable and numerous. I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, to try to ensure there is order in the House, that it is not characterised by any disruptive behaviour by those who need to have their voices heard, which under the current rules are being denied to them. The Taoiseach might reflect on this and consider making some time available to groups which he has not included in the order as read by him.</p>

          <p eId="para_401">I propose to nominate Rory Brady S.C. for appointment by the President to be the Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">The programme for Government which has been agreed between the Government parties sets out the agenda and priorities for the next five years. I have started implementing that agenda today in my nominations for the next Government by bringing together a team with an unparalleled range of experience and wealth of abilities. I am also proposing to make key changes in the current allocation of responsibilities among Departments, to better focus resources on achieving the key strategic results to which this Government is committed. As a result of this reallocation of functions, a number of Departments will have new titles to reflect the grouping of functions.</p>
          <p eId="para_403">In reviewing the responsibilities of Departments I am acutely conscious of the ever-increasing pace of change in needs and priorities in the modern economy. This is reflected more and more in how the division of responsibilities is shaped and reshaped among Departments to respond most effectively to those challenges. We are fortunate in having a public service which has proved flexible and adaptive in these circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_404">The development of the integrated transport policy to which we are committed in the programme for Government calls for vigorous and determined efforts during the lifetime of the Government. It requires concentration of resources and alignment of policies to put in place a network of tightly integrated facilities. The Government's commitment is to the creation of high quality transport services to tackle existing bottlenecks and congestion and to support a vigorous programme of spatial development to rebalance growth more equitably among the regions. The building of a modern, quality transport network will best be achieved by bringing together the relevant functions under a single Department dedicated to resolving those issues. This Department will be titled the Department of Transport. It will have responsibility for roads other than local roads, traffic, rail and bus, aviation and road safety. The full details will be worked out in the coming days. I am assigning this Department to Deputy Seamus Brennan.</p>
          <p eId="para_405">The Government is committed to a vigorous programme of environmental protection and renewal. Throughout the programme for Government, policies and initiatives have been informed by environmental concerns and by the Government's commitment to protection and preservation of the built and natural environment. The Department of the Environment and Local  Government, while continuing to retain its responsibilities in respect of local government, will oversee implementation of a wide range of initiatives arising from the prioritisation of environment friendly policies by the Government. There will be a renewed focus on environmental sustainability. Initiatives will be taken to improve the quality of our air and water. There will be greater emphasis on recycling in waste management and we will continue, and intensify, our efforts to tackle our litter problem. New enforcement mechanisms are to be put in place to drive the agenda for a cleaner, greener environment and we will continue to make our contribution to international actions designed to mitigate and reverse the impact of modern development on the global climate.</p>
          <p eId="para_406">With its increasing focus on environmental issues, it is appropriate that the Department of the Environment and Local Government also be given responsibility for the protection of our natural heritage and for heritage policy generally. Accordingly, I intend that responsibility for heritage policy and Dúchas be transferred to that Department, while responsibility for the management and other operational aspects of our built heritage will be exercised by the Office of Public Works. The Meteorological Office will also come under the aegis of the Department of the Environment and Local Government as will responsibility for nuclear safety issues, including policy on Sellafield and the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. I am assigning this Department to Deputy Martin Cullen.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">There are a number of other changes in responsibilities of Departments which I believe will be beneficial in providing structural support to Government in its programme for the next five years. This realignment of responsibilities will also help to exploit the synergies which will be generated by the more dynamic grouping of departmental functions which I am proposing.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">One of the important underpinnings of economic development in the years ahead will be to ensure that the core services of a modern economy and our natural resources are developed to the full. Accordingly, I propose to bring together these important economic activities which include telecommunications, broadcasting, energy, marine and natural resources in a Department of Communications and Natural Resources which will also have responsibility for the Geological Survey of Ireland. I am assigning this Department to Deputy Dermot Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">As well as securing economic development, the Government has to address issues of regional and social balance in a more effective way. The  changes I am proposing are designed to produce a more co-ordinated engagement by the State with communities around the country, especially in the western part of the country as they pursue their own development. A Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, is therefore being set up. It will be given responsibility for community and local development, including drugs, volunteering and the CAIT initiative, and rural development, including Leader, CLÁR and western development. The Department will also have responsibility for the islands. I am assigning this Department to Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív.</p>
          <p eId="para_410">In consequence of these changes, the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs will become the Department of Social and Family Affairs and the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development will become the Department of Agriculture and Food. I am assigning these Departments to Deputies Mary Coughlan and Joe Walsh respectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">Some key areas of our national life are not easily designated as economic or social, but they have dimensions of both. To reflect those important areas in a more appropriate way, a Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism will take responsibility for progressing Government commitments in those areas. I am assigning this Department to Deputy John O'Donoghue.</p>
          <p eId="para_412">Pending the making of the necessary orders to give effect to these changes, I propose to announce the assignment of Ministers to Departments based upon the existing departmental configurations and division of responsibilities. Those assignment, in full, are as follows:</p>

          <p eId="para_434">Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to Michael McDowell.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"/>

          <p eId="para_439"/>
          <p eId="para_440">Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs to Mary Coughlan.</p>
          <p eId="para_441">It is customary at this time also to announce the intention to nominate for appointment by the Government a small number of key Ministers of State. I propose to nominate Deputy Mary Hanafin for appointment by the Government as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and as Government Chief Whip.</p>
          <p eId="para_442">Considerable progress has been made in building the foundations of an information society in Ireland which will be inclusive and dynamic and which will harness all the benefits of the new information and communications technologies. However, there is a vast programme of change and innovation which must be undertaken if the Government's ambition to position Ireland at the leading edge of technological change is to be realised. Comprehensive new structures have been put in place to lead this process of change and I intend that the Government Chief Whip should be assigned political responsibility for co-ordinating policy in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_443">The Government is committed to the process of enlargement and, with all others who are convinced about Ireland's future in the European Union, will be seeking the approval of the people for the Nice treaty on enlargement on the basis of addressing the concerns expressed during previous referendums and in the National Forum on Europe.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">In addition, preparations must be commenced now for Ireland's Presidency of the EU in 2004. I have decided therefore to create a post of Minister of State for Europe to co-ordinate on these and other issues. The Minister of State is being assigned to the Departments of the Taoiseach and Foreign Affairs. Accordingly, I also propose to nominate Deputy Dick Roche as Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach and at the Department of Foreign Affairs with responsibility for European Affairs.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_447">The formal beginning of the 29th Dáil has been marked by an ignominious slur on Members of the House in view of the fact that  the entire population of Ireland has been made aware of these announcements and appointments before Members of the House. Despite the world-class operation of much of the Taoiseach's and Government's public relations offices, this is an enormous slur on Members of the House, a point which must be made very strongly.</p>
          <p eId="para_448">One of the most frustrating things about politics is the giving of effect to and the translation of political decisions into service and efficiency. While the changes recommended by the Taoiseach to some Departments and the changes in responsibilities are welcome, there will probably be a long hiatus before effect is translated into service.</p>
          <p eId="para_449">It is obvious that there are a number of people on the far side of the House who are disappointed with the appointments. I congratulate those who have been appointed and wish them well on what is a very special day for them and their families. I hope they will do well in their Departments despite the onerous task that faces them.</p>
          <p eId="para_450">One of the more interesting appointments will be that of the Minster for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell. We will be waiting with bated breath to see whether the streets will be cleaned up, the prison reforms he will introduce and whether safety will abound on our streets instead of fear. I wish him well in what is an enormous Department. I am sure his predecessor, Deputy O'Donoghue, he of the zero crime legacy, will find a welcome change in the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_104">
          <from>Mr. Kenny:</from>
          <p eId="para_452">No doubt the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism from Kerry will do very well and will be lobbied intensely by his compatriot Independent, Deputy Healy-Rae. Obviously, there are some great survivors. Deputy Michael Smith is still there. Deputy Walsh must have taken out full shares in the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development at this stage. To quote Milton to Deputy Roche, "They also serve who only stand and wait."</p>
          <p eId="para_453">In congratulating the Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the Government, I assure them that the performances and activities of the Ministers in this Government will be carefully followed, monitored and challenged by Fine Gael. We will provide vigorous and constructive opposition and we will not tolerate inept or incompetent performances, which were the hallmark of some Ministries in the last Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_454">The task facing the Government is truly a daunting one. There are many social and economic challenges facing this country, none of which can be tackled unless we have sound public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_455">The performance of the outgoing Government was marked by a series of broken promises and economic mismanagement. It promised to control public spending. What was the result? Spending  is now rocketing at twice the projected level and the year-end deficit could be well over €1 billion. What unseen and unannounced cutbacks are being secretly planned to bring this spending under control?</p>
          <p eId="para_456">It promised to introduce a policy of zero tolerance of crime. What was the result? Violent crime, particularly street crime, has grown dramatically. It promised to reduce the price of housing. What was the result? House prices have more than doubled and home ownership is now beyond the reach of most young people. It promised to end hospital waiting lists. What was the result? After five years of unprecedented prosperity, waiting lists stand at more than 26,000 people. It promised to bring forward a national spatial strategy and a national decentralisation programme. What was the result? Both of these critical regional development initiatives were shelved for electoral reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_457">The Exchequer returns released yesterday provide further evidence that the outgoing Government lost control of the public finances. Having been elected five years ago on a solemn promise to control public expenditure, it has allowed current spending to increase at a totally unsustainable level.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">Five years ago the Taoiseach promised to limit the growth in current spending to 4% per annum. What was the result? Spending has grown by over 40% in the past two years alone. Realising that it's original target could not be achieved, the Government set a more modest target last December of 14% spending growth for 2002. The new statistics to hand show that, in the first five months of the year, spending has grown by 27%, almost double the target set by the Government. This level of spending has been reached before any provision for public pay benchmarking has arrived in the public domain.</p>
          <p eId="para_459">If these unsustainable rises in spending are not bad enough, the Exchequer returns also reveal that income tax revenues were down by 15% on the same period last year. That means that if these trends continue, there will be a yawning gap of up to 1% of GDP in the public finances by the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">Virtually all economists agree that for the first time in over five years the Government will end the year in deficit. This represents a shocking indictment of the economic management of the outgoing Government. Five years ago, it inherited a sound economy from the rainbow Government, which had achieved the first surplus since 1972. In the meantime, these vast resources have been squandered with very little to show for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_461">During the recent election campaign, Fianna Fáil in particular refused to acknowledge the growing crisis in the public finances. It managed to conceal the true position from the public, but the evidence of its mismanagement is now there for all to see.</p>
          <p eId="para_462">I call on the Taoiseach as a matter of urgency to set out in detail for the House and the public  how he plans to bring the public finances under control. This must be the first priority of this new Government. Otherwise, many of the promises and commitments entered into in the new programme for Government will be meaningless. For instance, with regard to Stadium Ireland, work will start on a world-class national stadium, but there is no timescale and there are no costings or details of capacity, size or location.</p>
          <p eId="para_463">The Taoiseach said we would submit the Nice treaty to the people in a referendum to be held later this year in a way which seeks to address the concerns of the people, as "expressed during previous referendums and in the National Forum on Europe."  He was not able to do this last year so why should we believe that he will be able to do it this year? There is no detail in the programme as to how the Government will address the real fears of the people. Since the defeat of the Nice referendum, no road map has been devised that will deliver a clear "Yes" vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_464">Some of the election promises of Fianna Fáil have already been sidelined. Having spent most of the election campaign challenging all other parties on the costings of their proposals, it is interesting to note that the programme for Government contains no costings whatsoever. It also fails to mention prioritisation or timetabling of the proposals. It is full of vague aspirations which are clearly designed to make it difficult to measure the performance of Ministers.</p>
          <p eId="para_465">The programme for Government does not inspire confidence that the new Government has either the capacity or the political will to tackle the many problems that have been allowed to fester for the past five years. For example, the new Government is proposing to implement fully the national development plan, a plan which is already seriously behind time and over budget. When one considers that only 33 km of new roadway were built last year, with the Government having promised 330 km, it is difficult to take this promise seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_466">Perhaps the most alarming deficiency of the programme for Government is that it fails to set out a coherent plan for the future of our economy. The Government has taken its eye off the ball in terms of securing continuing economic progress. Its failure to develop an adequate infrastructure or to implement any worthwhile regional policy will hamper future job creation, particularly in the regions. Escalating insurance costs and an inflation rate which is double the European average also threaten the competitiveness of the economy and of jobs.</p>
          <p eId="para_467">Fine Gael in opposition will provide vigorous, effective and constructive opposition to the Government. We will reclaim the centre ground in Irish politics. Our policy positions will be driven by our core beliefs. Fine Gael's political philosophy is based on values rather than on opportunism. A strong economy and sound public finances are the bedrock of a successful country. We support the provision of quality public services and stress the need for better value for  money in their delivery. We support enterprise and we believe that efforts should be rewarded. However, the interests of the community should take precedence over the interests of the individual. As a party, Fine Gael has always put the national interest first and that will continue to be a core principle under my leadership.</p>
          <p eId="para_468">We must question the value of spending in our public services. When one examines the state of accident and emergency wards at weekends, the traffic chaos and the situation in many schools around the country, particularly at first and second level, one will see that health and education, the two areas which make a nation tick, have been seriously under-resourced and, where resourced properly, have been ineffectively managed. I hope the Ministers and the Ministers of State, who have yet to be appointed, will take their responsibilities seriously and that they will drive aggressively towards the goals set out in the programme for Government. The Taoiseach can rest assured that we will support the Government in the national interest, but the Members on this side of the House will harry and relentlessly pursue the Ministers if they fail to live up to their priorities and the aspirations of their remits.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_471">If the Deputy regards being called slick as a compliment, he is welcome to it. For the efforts of all the Deputies who got elected and their families who ensured they got elected and for the efforts of all the new Deputies who have come to the House for the first time, the House was, probably inadvertently, treated with contempt, and that contempt stands until it is purged. I invite the Taoiseach to formally apologise, but not in the way he just did.</p>

When I stood up today, the script was circulated, but I was reading a note on the time motion, not the speech. That is where the mistake was made. I thank the members of the press who held it. I know the national broadcaster had already moved on it. I apologise to the House.</p>

          <from>Mr. Quinn:</from>
          <p eId="para_473">I thank the Taoiseach. I congratulate the members of the Cabinet who have been  reappointed and those who have been appointed for the first time. I wish them well. On behalf of my party, I understand the sense of achievement, responsibility and excitement which they must feel. In so far as this is a democracy where the power comes from the people, they have been given the mandate to exercise it and I congratulate them. As regards those Members of the House who have publicly lost their jobs, it may be one thing to be fired by the electorate, but it is another to be fired in the House by their party leader for whatever reason. That cannot be easy. We would all be less than human if we did not empathise with those colleagues and their families and friends who find themselves in that position. Nobody gets elected to the House on their own. Every family, many of whom are in the Visitors Gallery, knows the cost of the achievement of electoral success. I congratulate those in the Cabinet and I send my condolences to those who find themselves outside it on this occasion.</p>
          <p eId="para_474">We have had five years of prosperity on the back of three or four years of emerging prosperity. In the lifetime of the State no general election has taken place against the background of sustained prosperity. To that extent, a rising tide lifted all boats. However, the tide was lifted in such a way and fuelled in such a manner that many boats remained rowing boats, while many others were turned into luxury yachts. I deeply regret that the electorate chose to make the decision they made in the general election. As a socialist, I believe that they took a desperately wrong turn in the way they chose to cast their vote but as a democrat, I accept it. The people who voted for the continuation of prosperity as they perceived it and for the continuation of the promise of services should brace themselves for bitter disappointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_475">I do not share the view that the public finances are out of control or that our public finances are in disarray. That view was expressed by some Members of this House as recently as this afternoon and by many of our commentators. We have seen a sustained splurge in public expenditure over the past 18 months to two years. It was deliberate, considered and carefully measured down to the timing of its delivery. We are now about to get a reversal of that splurge. The signs are already there and the indications have already been leaked to the media. The commentators who have access to briefings have been told they will get the correction which is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_476">Against that background, it is not possible for the Minister for Health and Children to eliminate waiting lists in 700 days, as he promised. He did not say that as a naive backbencher who had been elected to the House for the first time or as someone who did not have the experience of office, but in the full frontal knowledge that what he promised was impossible. It is only one of a number of promises which will be impossible. To suggest, as was suggested by one of the members of the Progressive Democrats, that there is a differ ence between an election promise and a programme for Government is to fuel the flames of cynicism, which resulted in many people not bothering to vote in the last election. We will hold the Government to its promises which are manifest in the manner in which they were delivered around the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_477">Our task will be, as we did during the election, to say that one cannot have the level of public services proffered by this Government, comparable to what is available in other parts of Europe, at the level of proposed expenditure as a percentage of national income and as indicated in the budgetary figures published by the present Minister for Finance, who will be confirmed in that position again later today. It is not possible and every one of the experienced Ministers know that.</p>
          <p eId="para_478">The people who do not know it are those who have been conned into voting for them and those depending on community employment schemes for the delivery of basic services in deprived and working class communities. The number of community employment schemes is to be drastically reduced, even below the level of the social partnership programme. Market forces will not rush into places like Neilstown, Darndale, Ringsend and the city quays to take up the slack and to provide the level of services required.</p>
          <p eId="para_479">We have seen what has happened in education. Deputies know what has happened to schools that have lost their community employment caretakers or minders. Deputies also know what is going to happen in the health sector, and have been lobbied in their constituencies. That will be done unashamedly by the Tánaiste and leader of the Progressive Democrats, Deputy Harney.</p>
          <p eId="para_480">That is what we now face and the task of the Labour Party and others who share our values and views is to hold up the candle and show clearly where people have been duped and where this Government cannot deliver on what it promises. The 700 days to eliminate waiting lists will become the totem of so many other promises that cannot be delivered if the budgetary figures, which the Minister for Finance has already published and put to the Commission in Brussels and discussed in the House, are to be adhered to. We should be clear that the public finances are not out of control. There was a sustained binge to achieve this election result and that binge is now over. The people who will pay the price of that binge are those who depend exclusively on public services for a minimum quality of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_481">I want to turn to some of the changes proposed in the structure of Government and to ask the Taoiseach when we will get the details of the allocation of different functions and responsibilities, and when he anticipates that the various alignments of sections from different Departments will fit into place and will be available. What is proposed here, as I see it on first reading, is a comprehensive reallocation of different responsibilities. I want to turn firstly to transport. It appears  that a significant section of the Department of the Environment and Local Government, that responsible for roads and presumably the National Roads Authority, will be transferred to the Department responsible for transport. We would like to hear, if the information is available, whether the responsibility for the national spatial strategy will also be transferred to that Department. There was speculation as to whether we would have a Department responsible for infrastructure and transport, or for transport on its own. In support of the objective of giving this country the kind of infrastructure it desperately needs, whether in the west, the east coast or the midlands, one must align transport with the national spatial strategy. I urgently ask the new Ministers in the various Departments not to immediately become territorial and hold onto components of their Departments at the behest of permanent civil servants who will never have to stand for election. If it is not yet agreed, the Minister with responsibility for infrastructure and transport should have responsibility for the national spatial plan or it will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_482">In relation to broadcasting and where responsibility for it will lie, the Department of Communications and Natural Resources has been assigned to a very able Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern. However, unless there is absolute clarity as to the future of the national broadcasting corporation, RTE, and its economic survival including an increase in the licence fee, we will not have the kind of broadcasting service that we require.</p>
          <p eId="para_483">In the course of his reply, the Taoiseach should outline the timetable for departmental responsibilities. I say this as one who has had direct responsibility. If this cannot be done by the end of this month, it will not be done over the course of the five years of this Administration. While I dispute some of the things the Taoiseach has done, and fundamentally disagree with his political philosophy as outlined in his programme and what we now see, I hope he makes the best of what it is he intends to do. From my experience, which I shared with the Taoiseach – we both recall the territorial turf war that was the Office of Public Works for nearly four years – unless this problem is addressed with all the experience at the Government's command, the Taoiseach will not achieve the targets he has set.</p>
          <p eId="para_484">Finally, I turn to the Progressive Democrats. "No to single party Government" was the slogan magnificently hoisted on the poster.</p>

What we have is not a party that is a watchdog but a party that has become a lapdog. I wish the Progressive Democrats well. In the past, they  were to be about power and not just office. They have now got the offices and I wish them well. However, let us see what they deliver. My fear is that they will deliver what they promise. My fear is that we will see the decimation of the community employment schemes and the implementation of the cutbacks promised in the various sectors of our public services. I fear that those who can least afford it, the most vulnerable in our society, will carry the cost of the pre-election splurge that was so successful on 17 May.</p>

That was five years ago and Deputy Quinn has still not come to terms with the outcome of this election. Whatever about lapdogs, no man has tried harder than Deputy Quinn to get to the position that I will hopefully hold this evening. He will have to accept that the vote of the electorate in May was decisive.</p>

          <p eId="para_514">When we took office in 1997 a person earning £70 a week was liable for tax. The current figure is £168 and in the next number of years people earning the minimum wage will be removed from the tax net altogether.</p>
          <p eId="para_515">I am proud that Ireland is the seventh largest contributor to overseas development aid. We have sought to deal with the problems of this country but we have not forgotten our wider obligations to impoverished people in many disadvantaged regions of the world.</p>
          <p eId="para_516">The world's largest bio-pharmaceutical plant is being built in Ireland by Wyeth. Intel is building its new wafer fabrication plant in Ireland. These large companies are not building plants here for sentimental reasons but because this country has talented and skilled people and a terrific education system, providing the competitiveness which allows us to compete globally and produce good products. This is something of which we should be proud.</p>
          <p eId="para_517">Above all else, when people choose a Government, they want political stability. Over the next five years the Government will tackle the issues which pose the biggest difficulties for the country. We will soon have to decide whether we want to stay in the mainstream in Europe and be part of the decision making process in the heart of Europe or drift into an isolationist or marginal position. Our people must make that choice. If we want to protect jobs, our economy and the living standards of our people, we will have no option but to vote in favour of the ratification of the treaty. There is no future for this country as another Iceland.</p>
          <p eId="para_518">Much of the realignment of Departments is done with a view to delivering more effective Government. Changes are not being made for the sake of change. There is no point making changes unless there will be a positive outcome. Administrative changes can be difficult to accomplish and there is no point wasting time and money on them if there will not be a positive outcome. It is important to have a Department with responsibility for transport so that all the national trans port needs of the economy, from aviation to rail and road, can be dealt with in a single Department with one political head. Bringing telecommunications and communications together is also important. It makes sense to give that new responsibility to the Department of Communications and Natural Resources, under Deputy Dermot Ahern. Many of the community based activities previously the responsibility of the Department of Tourism, Sport and Recreation will be assigned to a new Department under Deputy Ó Cuív. These changes make sense. If other changes are required they will be made, but only on the basis that they make sense and deliver better Government and more effective decision making.</p>
          <p eId="para_519">Some people will not continue to be members of the Cabinet. Mary O'Rourke, for example, lost her seat in the recent general election. I pay tribute to Mary O'Rourke. On an occasion when her party did particularly well, it was sad that some people lost. Mary O'Rourke worked extremely hard despite a personal bereavement in the past year. I wish her well. Deputies Jim McDaid, Síle de Valera, Frank Fahey and Michael Woods are no longer members of the Cabinet. I had the pleasure of working with them over the past five years and I wish each of them well. Making decisions is never easy for political leaders but change must be made. Those who lose out and their families suffer feelings of disappointment and we feel for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_520">I welcome the appointment of Deputy Séamus Brennan as the new Minister for Transport. He was an outstanding Chief Whip who skilfully and efficiently kept a minority Government in power for five years. His appointment is well deserved. I do not know if anyone would be a more popular choice than Deputy Mary Coughlan. If her popularity continues after she has held ministerial office it will be quite an achievement, but throughout the House people are pleased that she has finally become a member of the Cabinet. I wish Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív well. He has new and onerous responsibilities and I know he will do a terrific job. Deputy Martin Cullen will take on responsibilities at the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Our environment was clean and green in the past when the country was not industrialised or densely populated. That will not remain the case in the future unless we put in place policies and approaches that enhance and protect our environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_521">I do not know of a precedent for an Attorney General going directly to a place in the Cabinet. There have, of course, been Attorneys General, such as the former Deputy Declan Costello and the late Deputy John Kelly, who have been Members of this House.</p>

          <p eId="para_524">In selecting new members and realigning positions the Taoiseach has made very wise choices. I wish everybody well in their posts. The Taoiseach has appointed the first woman Chief Whip. On the last occasion I was the first woman Tánaiste and understand the first female head of the Government Information Services has been appointed. This morning I referred to the fact that the number of women in the House had only increased by two. We have not made much progress in that regard since 1992. However, it is significant that women are now going into key positions in the Government. This is important because women who hold key positions can be good role models to encourage other women into politics. Any assembly or government which does not have a critical mass of men and women does not make objective decisions.</p>

          <p eId="para_537">The Government has set out as its first priority in its programme for Government that we should see low inflation, responsible fiscal policies and effective investment policies as central to rebuilding the economy. This public finance crisis – although I heard Deputy Quinn say it is not a crisis, most others call it a crisis – is entirely of the Government's making and in that I agree with Deputy Quinn. Successive years of spending growth in excess of 20% have created this crisis. Moreover, the Government has grossly mismanaged tax revenues, which have only seen low single digit increases in the past two years. We are facing into a serious situation where there is a large black hole that is unexplained by the Minister for Finance or any Government spokesperson. We cannot proceed to spend money at a growth rate of 20% per year with tax returns this year in decline and think we are on a sensible road to long-term competitiveness.</p>
          <p eId="para_538">Where were the Progressive Democrats when these decisions were made? Deputy McDowell is now a member of the Cabinet. Perhaps this will bring greater financial rectitude to the Government. Where was the Tánaiste when these decisions on spending were being taken? Where is the budgetary framework for the next five years in the programme for Government? The Government and its handlers during the general election campaign excoriated Opposition parties for the way they planned the public finances for the next five years. Here they are with the full resources of the State behind them, drawing up a programme for the next five years without saying from where the funding will come. Not only is that sharp political practice, it is also irresponsible. It is throwing the compass out of the ship at a time when the water is getting choppy. We need a budgetary framework or else we will face into the abyss.</p>
          <p eId="para_539">The Government has stated it wants to see investment for the future. Does it not realise that by not having a clear budgetary framework, we are undermining the resources to provide investment for the future? There was a really slick  compromise by producing a two-headed monster for funding investment for the future. We are to have two bodies, a national development authority, to suit the Taoiseach and his party colleagues, and a national transformation fund, to suit the Tánaiste and her colleagues. What is the point of these funds? Is it not just to distort the fact that the Government does not have a plan for the amount of money it will spend on this important infrastructure? That is the reality of this sad programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_540">As Deputy Kenny said, the silence on pay is deafening. We face into benchmarking, not two years hence, but next month when we will have to pay 25% of the total. Surely this warranted mention as we approach the future. The Government needs to look, not only at its spending, but the quality of its spending. Anyone expecting to see reform in this programme would be sadly disappointed. There is no reform, just as the past five years have been characterised by high spending but no reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_541">Education is perhaps the most glaring example. <i>The Irish Times</i> generously described it as a very cautious document. I would go further. It has no vision and states nothing about the direction in which it will take education. No mention is made of the huge hole created by the reduction in the number of science students in our education system. People are leaving science in droves, but the Tánaiste tells us we will have all these new jobs in technology. Where is the response? Where is the response to the need to have a school improvement process that addresses literacy, for example? One in six of our children leave school not able to read the side of an aspirin package. What has this programme to say about that problem? The answer is nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">There is no reform of the examination system which condemns many. A crude examination system based on memory retention is not the way for the economy of the future that the Tánaiste and her colleagues espouse. We need an educational development and improvement process to build our education system to world class standards. There is no glimmer of a thought showing that is the way we need to go.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">This programme has ignored the need for a real benchmark to stake out the progress we need to make in the next five years. There are laudable aims such as cutting the cost of employer's and public liability insurance. By how much will it be cut? What does the Government want to achieve in this area? What is the benchmark it is setting? What about the social housing programme? In Dublin waiting lists doubled under the last Government. What does it hope to achieve in relation to housing? Once again these seem to be items for the future and no targets are set.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">We know the target for hospital waiting lists set during the general election campaign has now been abandoned and there is to be none for a number of years. There is to be no target in relation to the ending of the two tier health service, only that it is to be encouraged. There is  nothing solid or reforming in this programme. It is more of the same and will be a bitter disappointment to those who expected more.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">I commend the decision to create a unified Department of Transport. However, the failures of the previous Government have been ones of ineptitude. Once again we see the same promises rolled out in the transport section, on which it failed to deliver in the past five years. Again we are promised a greater Dublin transport authority. Why was it not delivered in the past five years? There is to be integrated ticketing. The last Minister had three studies of integrated ticketing undertaken and again the programme simply promises it for the future. Bus competition was to have been provided for years ago, but this programme now merely refers to reforming the Transport Act at some time in the future to make that possible.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">This programme is not the basis for reform. It is more of the same complacency. That is not good enough for our economy and society. We face real challenges, not only in our economy to be modern, have good communications infrastructures and a good education system, but also in society. Let us be brutally honest. The social fabric of our society has changed massively in recent times and it needs to be rebuilt for a new generation. This programme for Government is deafeningly silent on the future needs of children, for example, and there is no indication that parents will receive greater supports for the difficult task of parenting. The programme refers to rebuilding social capital at a time when it is being undermined by developer-led growth which has dictated traffic and development patterns. The programme is high on aspiration but low on targets, reform and real commitments.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I congratulate the Taoiseach and all the new members of the Cabinet. I hope I will be pardoned for congratulating in particular my constituency colleague, Deputy Walsh, who is still looking after the Agriculture brief. In the few minutes available to me I wish to focus on one issue and would appeal to the Taoiseach and the new Government concerning it. This country will face the greatest crisis in its international relations if, by the end of this year, we are seen to be delaying or impeding the enlargement of the European Union. If that happens we will be entirely isolated from the mainstream of Europe and will be operating against an historic imperative to join in the enlargement of the European Union. Europe was artificially divided by 50 years of Communist domination but since joining the EU we have gained much.</p>
          <p eId="para_548">The Government's record on this issue, however, is not reassuring. We witnessed the appalling failure of the Government to campaign properly for the Treaty of Nice last June, and since then we have had heard very little from the Government to compensate for that failure. The interest of the Taoiseach and his Government in the subject over the past five years has not been  reassuring. Five years ago, there was a botched attempt to appoint a Minister for European Affairs at Cabinet level. When that failed on constitutional grounds we did not even have a Minister of State appointed. Some compensation has been made today and I wish the new Minister of State, Deputy Roche, well. I hope he will be able to put his talents to constructive use in his future role. It is too little too late, however.</p>
          <p eId="para_549">The Government's record shows that over the past five years Ministers have been continually absent from important European Council meetings. I want an assurance from the Taoiseach that if Ministers are unable to attend such meetings they will be represented by their Ministers of State. Many EU directives that were agreed by Fianna Fáil and PD Ministers have not been implemented. Infringement proceedings have been taken against Ireland and we have been hauled before the European Court of Justice on 31 occasions over the past five years. Our interests in Europe have been neglected and, above all, apart from the humiliating withdrawal of the O'Flaherty nomination to the European Investment Bank, the Government has failed to explain properly the provisions of the Treaty of Nice. It is important that we should not impede or delay enlargement. What are we going to do for the future? The Government should demonstrate a real sense of urgency and a united approach to the Treaty of Nice. To some degree, I am reassured by the fact that the Tánaiste referred to this matter in her speech. She wants us to be in the mainstream of Europe and I hope the focus over the next 12 months will be on Berlin rather than Boston. I hope there will be a united effort by the Government. I have no problem with the Taoiseach opening pubs, but he should make an effort to open the minds of the people to the huge importance of this issue. He must provide the lead in this regard and he must have his entire Cabinet behind him.</p>

          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe:</from>
          <p eId="para_555">I have no interest in making personal comments about Deputy Ó Cuív. He worked hard as a Minister of State and tried to do a good job, but he certainly did nothing from the point of view of the European effort. After the last referendum on Nice, if I recollect rightly, he publicly proclaimed that he had actually voted against it. I hope the Taoiseach will ensure that Deputy Ó Cuív will take part in a united campaign to ensure that the Treaty of Nice will not be defeated the next time. Since that defeat, we have not used the last 12 months properly. We have not put in place changes in Oireachtas procedures to allow, for example, MEPs and European Commissioners to appear before the Seanad. We have not provided sufficient powers or resources to Oireachtas committees to properly vet EU legislation or appointments.</p>
          <p eId="para_556">To a large degree, over the past 12 months, we have been sleep-walking towards another defeat on the Treaty of Nice. We have not confronted the issue of neutrality or the phoney slogan "No to Nice, No to NATO". The Government has not taken the necessary steps to address the concerns of the people about the last referendum. Unless we ensure these issues are properly addressed in the short time available before the next referendum, the penalty will be paid not just by the Government but by this country. Let us not repeat this awful mistake. Let us not be the one country in Europe to impede the enlargement of the European Union. Let us not put ourselves in total isolation from Europe. That is the main job confronting the Taoiseach and his Cabinet colleagues over the next six months.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_159">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin:</from>
          <p eId="para_557">I wish to share my time with my party colleague, Deputy Ó Snodaigh.</p>
          <p eId="para_558">I congratulate the Taoiseach on his re-election. I and my colleagues in the House and, indeed, in the rest of the leadership of Sinn Féin, look forward to continuing to work with the Taoiseach and his Government colleagues in advancing the peace process and fully implementing the Good Friday Agreement in all its respects. That must be the priority of all parties and, indeed, of all Deputies. The cause of peace and justice, and the unity of the Irish people, is a cause that transcends party politics.</p>
          <p eId="para_559">The Taoiseach has nominated his Cabinet and I wish the nominees well, both as fellow Deputies and as individuals. However, to vote for this proposed Cabinet is to vote for the programme for Government which has been agreed by the Fianna Fáil Party and its coalition colleagues the Progressive Democrats. It is a flawed programme in which the Government signals its intention to carry on regardless of its failed approach over the past five years. There is a contradiction at the very start of the proposed programme: the incoming Government intends to put the same Treaty of Nice before the people in a replay of the first referendum. Having failed to implement the decision of the electorate and request the other EU states not to proceed with ratification,  the Government now intends to insult the electorate by telling them to get it right this time. We have just heard such an appeal. Incredibly, the programme for Government goes on to state that "the broad institutional balance, as it currently exists" serves the European Union well. Yet, the Nice treaty fundamentally alters the balance within the Union, as referred to. It sounds the death knell for the democratic power of veto of sovereign states. It expands qualified majority voting and takes away the right of each state to nominate a commissioner. It represents, in our view, a further significant step away from a partnership of equal states towards a militarised European Union totally dominated by the larger players – the larger states.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The programme to which the incoming Cabinet is committed continues the inequitable taxation policies of the outgoing Government. Those on the national minimum wage will have to wait another five years before they are removed from the tax net, if they are lucky. In total contrast, the reduction of corporation tax to 12.5% is to be completed next year. The low paid must wait while major corporations who export their profits enjoy the lowest tax rates in the EU.</p>
          <p eId="para_561">One of our principal reasons for opposing this programme and this incoming Government is the inclusion of the privatisation agenda of the Progressive Democrats. That agenda may have been smuggled into the programme under the coat of Deputy Charlie McCreevy but, none the less, it is unmistakably there. We are told that revenue from the sale of State assets will be used to create a national transformation fund. We saw the fiasco that ensued from the flotation of Eircom. We in Sinn Féin will vigorously oppose the privatisation of State companies, such as Aer Lingus and the ESB and the destruction of these vital pillars of our economy. We will campaign in defence of the jobs of workers in the State sector and against the stripping of national assets for the enrichment of a handful of private individuals for whom the national interest counts for nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_562">During the general election campaign, Fianna Fáil promised to end hospital waiting lists within two years. That was a promise with no credibility, given the massive waiting lists presided over by the Government for the past five years and the fact that it took most of that time for the Government to produce its health strategy, let alone implement it. In the new programme for Government, this commitment to end waiting lists in two years is not even mentioned. Having served its purpose during the election campaign, it has now been binned and is surely the most glaring omission from the programme to which this incoming Government is ostensibly committed.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">One of the commitments in the programme is to the development of acute hospital services on a balanced regional basis. The experience of the people of County Monaghan has been one of massive regional imbalance and the downgrading of services in our general hospital. The needs and wishes of the people of County Monaghan have  been repeatedly ignored. The people of Dundalk have the same experience and I and my party colleagues know at first hand the deplorable state of the health services as they affect the people of our respective constituencies. Every Deputy in this House knows that health was a primary issue in the general election and I urge the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Micheál Martin, to listen to the voice of the people, which he has heard repeatedly over a number of years, and to work with everybody in this House, with the health service workers, service users, community groups and representatives and with the health boards to transform our health system. Nothing less will do and if we are to have services based on health needs and not on wealth and ability to pay then the two-tier system must be ended.</p>
          <p eId="para_564">I deplore the lack of priority given to housing by the programme for the incoming Government. For five years, the Government presided over rising house prices and rising local authority waiting lists. That situation is worse now than in 1997, when I came into this House as a Deputy for the first time. Those on average incomes are priced out of the housing market. They continue to join lower income families on the growing waiting lists. Only a major public housing programme can really address the housing crisis, a crisis the outgoing Government failed even to acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_565">The programme for Government has, of course, some positive new commitments which I welcome, including the section on motor insurance. We await the detail of these proposals and look forward to the long overdue relief for those who are being fleeced by the insurance companies, and not only on motor insurance. A new Department of Transport is positive but we must ask why this was not done before. Public transport was not given the top priority it needed by the outgoing Government. I hope the new Minister places it at the top of the agenda and delivers. I very sincerely wish Deputy Séamus Brennan well in his new posting.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">While there are some positive elements, as I have said, the overall programme which this new Cabinet will seek to implement is more of the same – more of the same inequality, more of the same division in our society between the privileged and the marginalised and, clearly, looking at the line up here earlier this afternoon, more of the same Ministers also. There is little vision and little sense of real commitment. It is no wonder that the outgoing Government spent an unprecedented €313 million on consultants. There was no real commitment to the public services as the cutting edge for delivery of real change. What we had was indecision and a lack of ideas and determination on the part of an Administration which had to run to expensive consultancy firms at every turn to look for inspiration.</p>
          <p eId="para_567">In conclusion, I and my colleagues in the Sinn Féin team wish the individual nominees well and I extend special good wishes to the new Government Chief Whip, Deputy Mary Hanafin. I hope she will move speedily to resolve the injustice of  the denial of due recognition to Sinn Féin, the Green Party and the body of Independent Deputies in this House. We look forward to working with each of the new Ministers. That said, we will not be supporting this Cabinet on the basis, as I have already outlined, of its flawed programme for Government.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus:</from>
          <p eId="para_577">I congratulate you, Sir, on your election as Ceann Comhairle. I also congratulate my colleague, Deputy Roche, on his appointment. When he looks to Europe I promise him encouragement so that he will not lose sight of the needs of those in County Wicklow.</p>
          <p eId="para_578">The programme for Government has been finalised, the Taoiseach has been appointed to office and the members of the Cabinet have been nominated for appointment. The process has taken some time but we are now at the point where it is possible to assess what it has offered those who participated in the election and who now look to the Government to see what it has to offer.</p>
          <p eId="para_579">What does the Government's programme offer the public health patient who is waiting for hospital treatment? What does it offer an over-stretched nurse who is trying to cope in a maternity or accident and emergency ward or a carer who feels ignored, neglected and taken advantage of? The answer is a lot of hype but not much hope.</p>
          <p eId="para_580">The Government is made up of the two parties that comprised the previous Government, led by the same Taoiseach and Tánaiste and coloured by the same centre right bias as the previous one. A few changes to the make-up of the Cabinet do not constitute real change. Most of those on the outside looking in would recognise that the changes in departmental arrangements do not mean that the Cabinet changes have been significant. Today could be described as a political version of Groundhog Day in that there is the same outlook, leadership and opportunism.</p>
          <p eId="para_581">It may be true to say that the Government cannot be faulted on the grounds of inconsistency, but the record shows that the previous Government showed a consistent disregard for the promises it made to the people. Already, with remarkable speed, consistent disregard of the promises made to the people has become the hallmark of this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_582">In its programme the previous Government promised to tackle hospital waiting lists but it failed to do so. Far from shortening, the waiting lists increased from 29,000 people in March 1997  to almost 37,000 in January 1999. Even the latest figure of over 26,000 people waiting for hospital procedures has been shown to be false. New statistics published by the CSO have exposed the under estimate, whether deliberate or otherwise, of the number of people waiting for in-patient treatment. A shocking number – 1.6% of the population – is waiting for in-patient treatment. As far as it can be calculated, that amounts to approximately 44,800 people. Apart from a major discrepancy in that number, the service also shows that over 100,000 people are waiting for out-patient appointments, while over 100,000 are waiting for an appointment to see a consultant. These are the hidden numbers of those waiting to get on a hospital waiting list. That is the record of the previous Fianna Fáil and Progressive Democrats Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_583">Often those waiting are in pain. They include the elderly who suffer as they wait for a hip replacement, those who cannot see properly because of eye cataracts and cancer patients waiting for treatment. They all created enough pressure during the general election campaign to make health the big issue. The Labour Party responded to this challenge by spelling out the investment in the reforms needed to tackle hospital waiting lists and to end the two tier health system, which discriminates in favour of the affluent against the sick and the poor.</p>
          <p eId="para_584">Fianna Fáil responded by making a firm commitment to the people. Its general election manifesto stated: "In Government, Fianna Fáil will permanently end waiting lists in our hospitals within two years." On 6 May, the Taoiseach repeated this undertaking at a press conference, yet a few weeks later he has, like a previous commitment, jettisoned a solemn promise made to the people that those in pain and suffering will no longer suffer needlessly while they wait for hospital care. With the general election over it is clear these people no longer matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_585">Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats have returned to power but they have torn up their manifesto promises and replaced them with fudge. There is nothing in the programme for Government which will meet the suffering and pain experienced by those waiting for treatment. The apartheid within the health service will endure. That is thanks to Fianna Fáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_586">The development of a world class health service, described as a core objective in the programme for Government, is a sad joke. It is not possible to provide such a service unless the nature of the present service is confronted. Nor is it possible to tackle the waiting lists unless the service is changed to one providing care on the basis of need and not income.</p>
          <p eId="para_587">I wish the Minister for Health well. He will need all the luck he can get. In the previous Government he simply had to talk about delivery but he must now do the business. As Minister for Health and Children in the previous Administration Deputy Martin increased rather than reduced inequality in the health service. We on  this side of the House and in the Labour Party will ensure that the issues relating to health and the rights of people, regardless of income, will not be forgotten in this new Dáil.</p>

I had the opportunity to be his opposite number when he was Minister for Labour and Minister for Finance and to serve under his benign hegemony for the last five years. I am a long-time admirer of his political skill and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_589">There have been a number of fall outs from the Cabinet. I do not know why I tend to compare Deputy Michael Woods to Zsa Zsa Gabor. Members will remember that Zsa Zsa Gabor once said she was a great housekeeper; she had been married five times and kept the house on each occasion. Deputy Woods is like that – he has been through five Governments and has managed to hold on each time. Inevitably, however, it would come to this. Deputy Smith now seems to be taking up that mantle and I wish him well.</p>
          <p eId="para_590">I wish the new Ministers well. If the arts flourish under Deputy O'Donoghue in the manner that crime flourished during his time as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, there will be a blossoming of the arts the like of which we have never seen before. The Taoiseach promised us a new direction on Nice and a more successful referendum, but that was before Deputy Roche was given responsibility for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">Much of the Tánaiste's contribution concentrated on the economy. For all the criticism of consensus politics, there is very little difference in the House on industrial strategy and the factors that contributed to the economic boom, including investment in education. It is inappropriate therefore to single out the performance of the Progressive Democrats and Fianna Fáil. The Tánaiste said it is a matter of great pride when she goes abroad and I can understand that. The problem is that many Irish people cannot afford to come home and for those who emigrated in bad times and who have fallen on hard times abroad, the last Government, in a time of plenty, did very little for them. We could have done more and ought to do more.</p>
          <p eId="para_592">The main missed opportunity of the last Government was the failure to tackle inequality. There were considerable achievements – I do not deny that. The general election is over. In a time of such economic prosperity there could not be other than considerable achievements. Unfortunately division and inequality increased and there was no decision to transfer significant resources to marginalised communities where there is multifaceted deprivation.</p>
          <p eId="para_593">Deputy Bruton dealt with education. Education is still the great transmitter of privilege in this society. In parts of my constituency the school drop-out rate is higher than 20% and the extent of school non-attendance is over 20%. Those kids have little chance in the modern economy. The extent to which these communities are plagued by antisocial behaviour cannot be exaggerated. These inequalities persist after five years of economic boom and, therefore, in more uncertain economic times, I am not clear how the Government will tackle these issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_594">Reading the programme for Government, it appears the Progressive Democrats are guests in power. There is nothing distinctive from the party in the programme. There is nothing explicit about privatisation, benchmarking, Abbotstown or tax cuts for the better off. They are guests in power because the Taoiseach has other options open to him. Being the Taoiseach, with his innate caution, he has put a small number of Fianna Fáil minded Independents in the position of a spare wheel in the boot in case he has to rely on them if anything happens with the Progressive Democrats.</p>
          <p eId="para_595">The area where the Progressive Democrats can bring influence to bear on Government is at the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which is overdue for reform. I welcome the appointment of Deputy McDowell to that Department. The Garda Síochána must recognise that reform is in its interests as much as it is in society's interests. I regret that there is an evolving mood that suggests the Garda Síochána is the prerogative of one political party. That would be bad for society and bad for the gardaí. The alienation evident in working class communities from the Garda Síochána is a very serious matter and we must examine why there is such alienation among the young and if any share of the blame is attached to the manner in which the gardaí are managed and do their job. The new Minister has an onerous task.</p>
          <p eId="para_596">I am not sure what the distinction is between a Garda inspectorate and a Garda ombudsman. The phrase in the programme for Government states that there will be a Garda inspectorate with the powers of an ombudsman. Does that just mean that one cannot leave these decisions to one person and there should be more than one person involved? It is, however, an area in urgent need of reform because there are entire tracts in urban areas that are alienated from the Garda Síochána and that is bad for this society and especially bad for the unfortunate people who live under the ferule of young thugs and antisocial behaviour that pockmark parts of this and other cities. I hope the new Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will tackle that.</p>
          <p eId="para_597">I am not clear how wide the remit of the unified Department of Transport is, although I welcome it. It is evident that the national development plan was not politically driven in the lifetime of the last Government. It has fallen behind by as much as 18 months, has not had the necessary driving force behind it and has not pro vided for inflation. It will fall short of its targets. Public transport has been left in chaos, with no visible evidence of improvement. Does the new Minister have any remit in that area? It does not seem he has and that is regrettable.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">The return of the same parties to Government has implications for our democracy and society. I have concerns about the hegemony of Fianna Fáil over Irish politics. The continued presence of Fianna Fáil in office is bad for this polity and I do not detect from the Tánaiste's remarks that it will act as a counterbalance within the Government. Former Deputy O'Malley's exit from the House also removed the counterbalancing factor from the Progressive Democrats. The Tánaiste went out of her way to say she never raised the question of trust in politics.</p>

          <p eId="para_616">I am delighted to have this opportunity at the commencement of the 29th Dáil to urge Dáil Éireann to ratify the proposed members of the Government. Each and every one of them is an experienced parliamentarian and there is no doubt that each of them shares the passion and enthusiasm for public service that the Taoiseach so eloquently spoke about this morning.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">The recent election gave all of us and the public a chance to participate in a debate on the vital issues affecting the nation. These issues include the economy, the health service, the education  system, law and order, the environment and community development. I must report that while there was widespread praise of and satisfaction with the outgoing Government, concern was also voiced about many of the issues discussed in the Chamber today. For example, people are concerned that we should have an efficient, modern, humane and equitable health service and everybody will agree that the level of patient care should always improve and develop. However, people also clearly understand that huge extra financial resources have been put into the health system in recent years and they also understand that there is a direct link between public expenditure and taxation. Shortly stated, to increase one, one must increase the other.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">I strongly urge the House to support the nomination of Deputy Martin as Minister for Health and Children. As Minister in the previous Government, he displayed extraordinary flair and professionalism in mastering every aspect and detail of the health brief, from new developments in health to dealing with the various professional bodies and trades unions, his campaign against tobacco advertising, successfully obtaining the large increase in public spending in the health service and the implementation of the health strategy.</p>
          <p eId="para_619">I reject out of hand Deputy Quinn's assertion that Fianna Fáil needs a watchdog but now has a lapdog in the form of the Progressive Democrats.

          <p eId="para_625">It is arrogant in the extreme for Deputy Rabbitte to speak of the political hegemony of Fianna Fáil in office. It is arrogant because it second guesses the choice of the people in the recent election. As the Taoiseach so clearly set out this morning, the plain fact of the matter is that nobody in this House has a monopoly on caring. Is it being suggested that simply because Fianna Fáil has the capability and honesty to make clear-headed decisions for the betterment  of our society and the most practical use and distribution of our resources, it is somehow uncaring? I would say the opposite is the case, that those who do not have the courage to make courageous decisions on behalf of their constituents are the ones who would in the end do their constituents a grave disservice.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">On the Taoiseach's proposal to set up a new dedicated Department of Transport to fully integrate transport policy, the commitment to provide high quality transport services and to tackle existing bottlenecks and congestion is a mighty task and I am sure the House agrees that Deputy Séamus Brennan is more than equal to the task.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">As a member of a local authority since 1985, I congratulate Deputy Cullen on his appointment to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We can all be confident that Deputy Cullen will expand and develop the initiatives started by the previous Government and, in particular, by the previous Minister, Deputy Dempsey. The introduction of waste management strategies, the tax on plastic bags and the introduction of directly elected cathaoirligh of local authorities in 2004 are some of the hallmarks of the last Government's achievements in this area. The Taoiseach has made it clear that Deputy Cullen, as Minister for the Environment and Local Government, will actively pursue policies in support of environmental sustainability, the fight against global climate change and the fight against Sellafield, issues which concern every person in this House.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">I also add my voice to those of others wishing Deputy Cowen well in his second term of office as Minister for Foreign Affairs. The introduction of a special Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs to assist a "Yes" vote on the European treaty is a very good idea. There will be a very big debate in this House on the Treaty of Nice, but the comments made by Deputy Ó Caoláin in regard to the treaty would send a shudder down the spine of every decent person in Poland, Hungary, Cyprus and other would-be members of the European Union who should be fully supported in their attempts to become members of the European Union. If that is what Sinn Féin is talking about in terms of principled decision making, it has a long way to travel.</p>

        <speech by="#ConorLenihan" eId="spk_185">
          <from>Mr. C. Lenihan:</from>
          <p eId="para_631">I suppose I should begin by congratulating my colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, on his prescience in recognising some months, or perhaps even a year ago, that there was no point in him offering himself to serve within a Fianna Fáil coalition Government. He obviously saw before everybody else that the Labour Party would not be in power and would not form a coalition with Fianna Fáil and he decided, rightly or wrongly, that he would refuse to serve in a Fianna Fáil Government should my party offer to form a coalition with the Labour Party. He is a great and very prescient observer and analyst of the political scene and well done to him. He spotted that we would not need the Labour Party in the end and that the public did not want the Labour Party in Government. In a profound sense, it wanted Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats back in power and those are the basic arithmetic results of this general election.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">A very unfortunate phrase used by one of our Ministers was that the people voted out the Opposition in this election. It was an extraordinary result. Fine Gael, as we see opposite, is in totally reduced circumstances and occupies two benches of this House when it proudly occupied three or four benches previously. This is an appalling situation for a once great party which could have pretensions to being an Opposition party on its own and, indeed, under Garret FitzGerald, it came dangerously close to it from a Fianna Fáil perspective. Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats are back in power and that is what the people voted for. Some of the speeches this afternoon failed to recognise that underlying reality of politics in 2002. The people voted for this Government and Fine Gael is still struggling with that basic problem. It does not understand how it can oppose this Government. I feel a certain sympathy for Fine Gael because there are lots of more radical voices, far more radical than it, sitting to its right and left, be they Independents, Sinn Féin, Greens or, indeed, the Labour Party, which have clear policies and a clear identity. Fine Gael has no identity whatsoever and that is the chief cause of its failure in the general election. It has nothing to do with its leader, with Deputy John Bruton or Deputy Noonan and it will have nothing to do with Deputy Kenny either when it fails again in the next general election. It has to work out where it stands. Half the party are social democrats and the other half are right of centre types calling themselves Christian democrats. It will not survive in the long run. It should iron out its view on where it stands and should then come up with a decent line of opposition to this Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">I congratulate the Taoiseach on the manner in which he has appointed different people to this Government and has brought in new faces – people who have served their time as Ministers of State and know exactly how the process of Government works. I particularly congratulate him on the innovation as promised in our election manifesto of integrating transport and traffic into  one Department. That was an excellent idea. The other idea, which is very good and is a great portent for the future, is the appointment of Deputy Ó Cuív as Minister responsible for community and local development. These are areas about which Deputy Rabbitte would know, that is, the whole area of local development and its interaction with the development of the drugs task forces. It is an area which needs full Cabinet recognition and it has received that with the appointment of Deputy Ó Cuív. Now the drugs issue is top of the agenda, and at the Cabinet table, where it rightly belongs. The other innovation, and I speak as someone with some interest and expertise in this area as an adviser to Esat Digifone, is the new ministry which Deputy Dermot Ahern will hold with an emphasis on telecommunications and the development of broadband infrastructure and the energy and resource issues which flow from that. This is another innovation which was badly needed and well overdue.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">I bring my remarks to a conclusion by addressing the issue of Deputy McDowell and his marvellous stroke during the election which managed, in some people's minds anyway, to deprive Fianna Fáil of a majority. If he did, it was a great stroke and we have to applaud it. I trust and hope that as this Government develops in the next few years, he will curtail his rhetoric about the Taoiseach and Fianna Fáil and be a good and loyal servant of the Government as he was as Attorney General. I hope he tackles the problems of street crime and the rising levels in certain categories of crime. I know he will put his mind to that and that rhetoric about Ceausescu is now at an end.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnBruton" eId="spk_186">
          <from>Mr. J. Bruton:</from>
          <p eId="para_635">I wish to share my time with Deputy Crawford. The key weakness in the Government programme, as the Fine Gael leader, Deputy Kenny, pointed out, is that it has not been costed. The American writer Henry Adams once said that practical politics consists of ignoring facts. The reality is that as far as the nation's finances are concerned, the practical politicians of the last Dáil ignored the facts. If current trends are maintained, the opening current budget deficit for next year will be €3 billion, coming close to 2.5% of GDP and to the growth and stability pact limit of 3%. My first challenge to the Taoiseach, therefore, is twofold. What is the Government's present estimate of the opening current budget deficit for the 2003 budget which it will have to introduce four months from now? What is the Department of Finance's costing of the programme for Government? If the Department of Finance has not been asked to do an estimate of the cost, why was it not asked to do so given that the Government parties were so happy to use the Department of Finance facilities to devise questions about the costs of the programmes of the parties in Opposition during the general election campaign?</p>
          <p eId="para_636">It has been said by a noted United States economists, John Kenneth Galbraith, that politics is  not the art of the possible, it is that of choosing between the disastrous and the unpalatable. Because of its weak handling of the nation's finances, this spendthrift Government will soon have to introduce a budget which makes a choice between the disastrous and the unpalatable. I hope it will have the courage to choose the latter. I also hope that if forced to face the unpalatable, this Government does not start to blame the European Union or Ireland's solemn commitments to the EU under the treaties in respect of the growth and stability pact for the unpalatable things it may work up the courage to do in the national interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">I read through the programme for Government, which is a very patchy document. I commend the Government for the ambitious objectives it has set itself in respect of reducing insurance costs. The attack on exaggerated claims, on no foal, no fee advertising by solicitors and the proposal for mandatory mediation and control of legal costs are most welcome, but will some of these changes require an amendment of the Constitution? If so, why has that not been stated in the programme for Government?</p>
          <p eId="para_638">On other topics, however, the programme is exceptionally weak. The national spatial strategy which would have chosen some towns but not others for development of vital urban facilities has been postponed for reasons of political cowardice. How, for example, is it possible to plan our hospital, road and rail network if we do not know which towns are being chosen for development? The failure to make those decisions has facilitated the election of local interest Independent Deputies in unprecedented numbers to this House, a development which, notwithstanding the merits of the individuals concerned, is bad for Irish democracy. As Edmund Burke said: "parties must ever exist in a free country". Parties organise opinion, take the national view and ensure equality of sacrifice and fairness of distribution of its fruits across the whole nation while Independent local interest Deputies cannot do so because of their mandate.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">There is another aspect of the general election result on which other Members of this House have been strangely silent, that is, the election of five Deputies from a party which is linked to a private army. I realise Sinn Féin got votes from many young people – young people who do not remember Enniskillen, Tom Oliver and Jerry McCabe. We are, the programme for Government tells us, to have accountability for the murders of Pat Finucane, Robert Hamill and Rosemary Nelson, and rightly so. Why then are we not to have accountability for all the killings committed by the Provisional IRA, the UVF and the UDA? Why not have a truth and reconciliation commission like in South Africa for all the killings of the last 30 years? That said, I hope Sinn Féin's success in the general election – it was a considerable success – will give it the confidence at last either to get the IRA to disarm or to disown and disavow it. It was the great Irish patriot,  John Philpot Curran, who said: "the condition upon which God hath given liberty to man is eternal vigilance". As far as the political paramilitaries and their allies in this House are concerned, I for one intend to provide that vigilance.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I note the Government is proposing a constitutional amendment to limit the right of people born in Ireland to Irish citizenship reversing a provision of the Good Friday Agreement to curb third country immigration.</p>
          <p eId="para_641">I note that it wants to draw the Opposition into this with it. I warn the Government that it is its duty to govern and come forward with specific proposals. Given that we offer generous citizenship rights to people of Irish ancestry who are born abroad, it will be extremely difficult to devise legislation aimed at curbing the citizenship rights of people who are born in this country unless we introduce a specifically ethnic element to our Constitution. Other countries, such as Germany, have done this. However, the Government should be fully aware of the difficulties involved in drafting such legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">The Government wishes to promote the concept of voluntarism in sport. How is this reconciled with the extension of outrageously generous tax relief to extremely rich professional sports people in the most recent budget? What message did that send to volunteers?</p>
          <p eId="para_643">The wails coming from the Green Party and other small parties in this House regarding speaking rights are entirely bogus. Every Deputy elected to this House has an equal mandate. Some 31 Fine Gael Deputies have five times the mandate of six Green Party TDs. On that basis, Fine Gael is perfectly entitled to five times as much speaking time. That is democracy.</p>

          <from>Mr. Crawford:</from>
          <p eId="para_644">I congratulate the Taoiseach and all those who have been nominated to high office today and I commiserate with those who have, for whatever reason, been deemed no longer suitable for such positions. As one who was on the brink of defeat in the election, I understand how it feels to be left out at least for a short few hours anyway. I thank those Ministers who have lost their positions for the work that they have done over the past five years.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I have a great interest in the Department of Transport. That Deputy Séamus Brennan has been appointed Minister of this Department causes me some anxiety. There is a major transport problem in Dublin. In recent times, the bulk of the money available to the National Roads Authority has been spent in this city. Over the past five years, no money of any consequence has been spent in the BMW region. The new Minister, Deputy Brennan, must take account of the needs of this area, particularly the Border area, which has suffered so much as a result of the trials and tribulations in Northern Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_646">The environment is also an important issue. In the 1990s, some laws were passed in Europe that have had a major impact on rural Ireland, especially on farmers. Very little has been done  about these laws. While I welcome Deputy Martin Cullen to the Department of the Environment and Local Government, I warn him that he must work closely with his colleague, Minister for Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, Deputy Joe Walsh and the farming population as a whole in order to determine how nitrate objectives are reached. As far as commercial farming is concerned, these are very serious issues. Given the numbers of families who are leaving farming today, we cannot ignore the needs of these people while working within the European levels. The European Community is coming down hard on us because we failed to deal with these problems. They are insisting that we now implement rules that we should have implemented over the past 12 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs is a new Department. Having been briefly involved with Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív in his capacity as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development, I see him as a person committed to this sort of development. However, I am concerned by the Taoiseach's reference to "western development" in his speech. The CLÁR programme deals mainly with the West, as does the LEADER programme. What is to become of the Border region? Is it going to be left out and made to suffer again? I put the Government on notice that I will ensure this does not happen because the Border region has suffered more than any other in recent times.</p>
          <p eId="para_648">I wish to raise the issue of long-serving Ministers, notably Deputy Joe Walsh. He has been at the Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development for a very long time, both as a Minister of State and as a senior Minister. He is a very nice man with whom we worked closely during the foot and mouth crisis although he got all the credit. Nevertheless, a good job was done and I do not take that from him. However, I question the Taoiseach's judgment in leaving anyone in the same Department for so long.</p>

          <p eId="para_650">As I said earlier today, five of the 11 agricultural colleges in this country have been closed in the past few years. There are six left but how many will remain at the end of the next five years if we do not have some new thinking in this area? Who is going to carry a commercial agricultural industry into the next ten to 20 years if colleges continue to close? There is no forward thinking in this area. We hear many pious comments in the programme for Government and I feel sorry for Deputy Walsh that this programme offers nothing for agriculture. It is obvious that the media realised that there is nothing substantial—</p>

          <p eId="para_653">In the programme for Government, it is stated that there is to be a Government and diplomatic offensive to open and re-open world markets.

          <p eId="para_655">We have not seen much benefit from that policy. Is this the best that Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats can come up with in a programme for Government? As a former leader of the IFA, Deputy Tom Parlon was very close to Minister Joe Walsh, yet no real commitment is given to farming in this programme. For the past five years, we have listened to promises to tackle red tape and now we are hearing the same promises again. Last November, the Minister, Deputy Walsh, told us of the great advances he had made in Brussels. However, as he himself said, he returned with greater fines and more bureaucracy.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The disadvantaged areas are to be extended to the whole BMW region, which of course takes in Laoighis-Offaly. However, there is no mention of the rightful needs of County Monaghan, for instance. The Ceann Comhairle knows this. There is no word of extension of resources to areas in which they are most needed. No doubt Deputy Parlon had a major role in that.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">I am delighted Deputy McDowell has been appointed Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. I hope he can redress the things that happened in that Department in recent years. It is clear that a policy of zero tolerance was not practised there. We look forward to Deputy McDowell's involvement not only in cleaning up the streets of Dublin, Limerick and elsewhere but also in ensuring that people in rural areas can live in safety and comfort.</p>

          <p eId="para_661">Having been honoured by the people of Galway East to represent them in the 29th Dáil, it is my intention to bring forth at every opportunity the issues affecting my constituents. While abiding by the wishes of the Chair, it is appropri ate that the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and incoming Government should be put on notice of those concerns and, despite what Deputy John Bruton said about Independent Deputies, I make no apologies for doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_662">The issues to which I refer involve basic requirements and rights, many of which have been ignored for a long period. Adequate water and sewerage services, decent national schools and decent national secondary roads are necessities which many communities take for granted. That is not so in Galway East where there has been a disgraceful lack of investment in those basic requirements. At the same time, however, infrastructural developments such as telecommunication masts and landfills are being foisted on the people without proper regard to their health and welfare. I call on the incoming Minister for the Environment and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, to examine the contents of a recent report, carried out by Trinity College, on the harmful effects of landfills on people's health and to put in place appropriate safeguards.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I represent a rural community and I wish to place on record, for the benefit of the incoming Government, the need for a structured, integrated rural development programme to lift rural Ireland out of its time-warp. In doing so, I acknowledge the inherent merits of the CLÁR programme put in place by the previous Government and nurtured by the outgoing Minister of State, Deputy Ó Cuív. However, this programme was so restricted in scope and so inadequately funded that it proved largely ineffective. The Taoiseach, the Tánaiste and the new Government owe it to rural Ireland to discriminate positively to address the infrastructural deficit experienced by rural communities. In that regard, I congratulate Deputy Ó Cuív, who represents the neighbouring constituency of Galway West, on his elevation to high office. The Deputy's feet are firmly rooted in rural Ireland and he understands the concerns and issues affecting rural communities. I look forward to his input into the deliberations of the Cabinet. I can say with all sincerity that rural Ireland will be much better off as a result of his inclusion in Government. I also welcome the establishment of the new Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">I am glad the programme for Government contains a commitment to the introduction, as a matter of urgency, of measures to implement the recent recommendations contained in the motor insurance industry report. It is time that the penal level of premiums charged to young drivers was brought to an end. More attention needs to be paid to the business insurance sector, because the increase in premiums for employers and the self-employed is putting job creation at risk.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">People with disabilities and carers in the home are continually striving for changes to be implemented in order to improve their quality of life and standard of living. If the incoming Government wishes to nurture the image of Ireland as a caring society, it needs to address the  deficits relating to people with disabilities and carers as a matter of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">I say to the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, that the programme of decentralisation has been on the back-burner for too long. It is time decisions were made and implemented. The decentralisation programme should again be used to address the regional imbalance and areas which have experienced neglect should be given priority. I refer, for example, to Tuam and Ballinasloe in my constituency which were recently identified as being among the ten most disadvantaged towns in the country and are prime locations for decentralisation.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">As a Deputy representing Galway East, it would be remiss of me not to bring to the attention of the Taoiseach, Tánaiste and the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, the position of Tuam hospital which has been closed for a year. Taxpayers' money has been invested in the hospital but it remains closed. I ask that the Government give priority to making resources available so that it can be re-opened as a matter of urgency.</p>

          <from>Ms Harkin:</from>
          <p eId="para_669">I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment and I wish him a successful term of office. On a personal level, I congratulate Deputy Bertie Ahern on his re-election as Taoiseach and Deputy Harney on her nomination as Tánaiste. I wish the Government well during the lifetime of this new Dáil. I also congratulate Deputy Kenny on his election as the new leader of Fine Gael. I earnestly hope that the realisation of balanced regional development, incorporating western development, will figure high on his list of priorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I am conscious of the honour and privilege bestowed on me by the people of Sligo-Leitrim, who elected me to serve as their Teachta Dála or messenger to the Dáil. I thank them for this opportunity and I will undertake my task with enthusiasm, commitment and a genuine sense of purpose.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">As an Independent Deputy for my constituency, promoting the economic and social development of Sligo and Leitrim will be my priority, although I believe that many of the issues I intend to pursue, contrary to Deputy John Bruton's assertion, will be of national significance as well as of local importance.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">I call on Deputy Brennan, if it falls within his remit as Minister for Transport, immediately to publish the national spatial strategy. The latter must promote and guarantee the development of all regions and include measures such as decentralisation, the naming of Sligo town as a gateway or conduit for development of the north-west – in conjunction with the programme for the economic and social regeneration of smaller towns – and the provision of infrastructure and access to Leitrim and Sligo. It must also ensure that the balance between urban and rural development is  promoted and must pursue a positive approach to the issue of planning permission in rural areas. Such a strategy would benefit Sligo and Leitrim and would equally benefit all other regions in this State.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">Other issues of national importance and local relevance include the means test for carers which, in my opinion, should be abolished and I call on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, to deal with this immediately. I call on the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, to provide immediately a guarantee to every community that adequate primary and secondary facilities will be put in place and that primary education will be provided on a needs basis for all children. I also call on the Minister for Health and Children to abolish the two-tier health system and provide adequate health services at regional level.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I have a number of concerns regarding some of the items included in the programme for Government, but today I will mention just two. The first of these is the possibility of the privatisation of State companies. I am not persuaded that privatisation of public utilities is a positive step. However, if the incoming Government is determined to press ahead then, at minimum, public service obligations must be put in place so that peripheral areas will be guaranteed access to the services concerned. The second matter to which I wish to refer is the establishment of a national waste management advisory board, which must not impose centralised decision-making regarding waste management on local authorities and local communities. The agreed programme for Government contains a number of positive proposals and I look forward to their implementation during the lifetime of the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">At local level there are many issues of concern but in the context of today's business I will refer briefly to three. There must be an immediate and fully guaranteed resolution to the matter of funding for the inner relief road in Sligo. In addition, a timeframe and immediate financial commitment must be put in place in respect of the provision of a natural gas supply to Leitrim and Sligo. Farming and agri-business are essential to the economies of Sligo and Leitrim and the maintenance of the maximum number of family farms is essential to the future economic and social development of both counties.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">I am very pleased to see a significant number of Independent Deputies representing constituencies in all parts of Ireland. This is a positive development, not an anti-democratic one, which expresses the wishes of the people and delivers a very strong message to all political parties. Perhaps the foremost message it sends is that my mandate and that of all the Independent Deputies and members of smaller parties must be recognised as equal to that of members of any other political party. In this context, I ask the Government to amend Standing Orders appropriately in the interests of democracy in order to  reflect the democratic outcome of the general election.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley:</from>
          <p eId="para_677">Gabhaim comhgairdeas leat, a Cheann Comhairle. Tá súil agam go n-éireoidh go hiontach leat ins an post nua atá agat. I am honoured to be here. Tá mé an-bhródúil as bheith anseo mar Theachta Dála do Mhaigh Eo agus gabhaim buíochas le muintir Mhaigh Eo as an vóta mór a thug siad dom. By returning me first past the post with a very high vote the people of County Mayo sent out a very strong message, which could not and would not be diluted, that after 80 years of neglect they are no longer prepared to tolerate it. My election is about equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">As a general practitioner, I witness terrible deprivation. I see how elderly, very ill people are forced to leave home at 5 a.m. to take the long trip to Galway for orthopaedic and rheumatology services. Even Croatia has more rheumatologists than we have. A mark of a society is how it treats its ill and older people. We do not treat our sick people very well. What is happening is criminal. The indices for deprivation in County Mayo show that we are more likely to die on the cardiac waiting list or have serious complications following surgery.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">As regards BreastCheck, it has been well known since 1998 that mortality from breast cancer, a terrible disease which kills about 650 people here every year, can be cut by 20%. This means 100 people could be saved each year. The programme needs to be extended and I ask the Government to do so immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_680">While money certainly has gone into the health service, it will be a waste of time without reform. There is too much duplication in the health system. We have ten health boards when we need only one. If one looks at other systems with similar populations, they have only one health board. In terms of the people being recruited in the health service, where are the doctors and nurses? In our general hospital we have 60 staff fewer than what we should have. We have a very efficient hospital which is being penalised for the very good work it is doing. The problem is capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_681">As regards the health strategy, why not employ consultants? In Castlebar where we have consultants in medicine and surgery we have little or no waiting list. Why not have these services locally, given that they would put a complete end to waiting lists? The money should be invested in this, rather than sending people abroad or supporting private enterprise. This is not just about health, even though it is the most immediate issue. The bottom line is that we need resources such as power, the ESB, the N5 and other roads and the decentralisation of Government, all the things necessary to put us on an even keel. Because we do not have them, we have not been able to make use of Objective 1 status.</p>
          <p eId="para_682">Many of our farmers have left the land because of CAP reforms and other matters. They need help. The national spatial strategy should be pub lished because the sterilising statutes in the area of planning serve only to further depopulate rural Ireland and deprive immigrants and landowners of the right to stay in their own area. They are doing what Cromwell could not do.</p>
          <p eId="para_683">Insurance for young drivers is a very important issue. Why not give people no claims bonuses until they have their first accident? Business insurance is in major crisis. Al Capone would be very proud of the degree of racketeering taking place. The fact that the legal profession receives 40% of claims is also remarkable.</p>
          <p eId="para_684">The people of County Mayo have shouted "stop" and are refusing to be taken for granted any longer. We have paid a heavy price for our political predictability in the past. It resulted in bad roads, no gas, no broadband and no commitment to improve County Mayo's ability to create jobs. Everybody else is getting gas from County Mayo, which is ours. There should be a public service obligation to provide gas for the towns and I ask the Government to do this immediately. It is past time for real change.</p>
          <p eId="para_685">I make no apology for my presence here. I will challenge the Government and everybody else at every opportunity. I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste and the members of the Government and wish them every success. I also congratulate my colleague from County Mayo, Deputy Kenny, and wish him every success. We are here to fight for County Mayo. It is a good fight and, while it will be hard, we deserve equality and are on the march for it.</p>

I congratulate the Taoiseach and the Ministers who have been appointed to Government. It is a great occasion for them, in particular, for those appointed for the first time. I wish them well, particularly Deputy McDowell on his appointment to the position of Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. He has been very involved, not only in the legal world for a considerable period, but also politics. I suppose he often wondered if this great day would come. He will continue the tradition his family has upheld going back to the foundation of the State. He has a strong link through the institutions of the State to what is good. The post he will hold is very dear to the hearts of the members of the Fine Gael Party and his ancestors.

          <from>Mr. Hogan:</from>
          <p eId="para_690">I know my place. The south east has not been properly represented and I will watch what Deputy Cullen will be able to deliver for it. He is the first senior Minister from the region since the rainbow Government when Mr. Yates and Deputy Howlin were members of the Cabinet. I am glad the Taoiseach has seen the error of his ways in the past five years by sorting out the regional imbalance in Cabinet responsibilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Deputy Ó Cuív's appointment will be welcomed, particularly by those involved in rural and western development. While he will break their hearts, they will be glad that somebody as tenacious and with a good grasp of detail is getting the job. He will ensure Deputies Michael Higgins, Ring and others will no longer have to make so many direct representations to sort out the problems of rural and western development. From 6 a.m. he will torment his tormentors to such an extent that they will go away in frustration. Personally and for his family, it is a good day.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">It is also interesting to note the survival of some of the dinosaurs of the Cabinet, namely, Deputies Michael Smith and Walsh. I cannot fathom the reasons for this. Deputy Walsh has been a member of the Cabinet through thick and thin. The reappointment of someone who has been in the post for so long is a vote of no confidence in agriculture and implies that no new or fresh thinking required in the sector. The commercial agriculture sector, which in Kilkenny still depends on the weather for its survival, will not welcome the decision to allow Deputy Walsh to continue in office. While I wish the Deputy well on a personal level, the Taoiseach's judgment in this matter leaves a little to be desired.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">As others have mentioned, it has been a difficult day for some other Ministers, namely, Deputies Fahey, de Valera, Woods and McDaid. However, they have to face up to the political reality that there is only one boss, the Taoiseach, and in the rough and tumble of politics we all have disappointments from time to time. I share the difficult day they and their families are experiencing and hope they will be rewarded in the days ahead by taking up new responsibilities and challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I agree with the Tánaiste that the stability of the Government is very important. The challenges that lie ahead will be extremely difficult. They were ignored by the last Government, particularly in the last budget. If we are to progress as a country, we must have a solid economic foundation. That is no longer the case. We are dangerously close to having the public finances out of control. I am surprised that Deputy McDowell, who was the Attorney General in the last Cabinet, would have allowed that to happen.  Now that he has a more robust involvement in the Cabinet I am sure he will put Deputy McCreevy back on track in respect of the over-expenditure, waste and unaccountable nature of our public finances in many of the public services. We need much more scrutiny in the public services and value for money. Fine Gael will be examining in detail over the next while the manner in which money has been allocated and spent. It will examine the inefficiency and lack of accountability that we see in so many of the services. It is more evident than ever before, at a time when we need to get back on an even keel in respect of our public finances.</p>
          <p eId="para_695">With regard to benchmarking, the ATM will have to be closed down and pulled out of the wall, because it is no longer available to the extent that people talked about and in the manner in which it was negotiated. We do not want any open cheque books at a time when a perilous financial state is beckoning. We need a competitive economy and we need costs to be kept as low as possible. That is nowhere more evident than in the cost of insurance, for example, for small businesses. I refer not only to young people who are seeking insurance, but to working people who need and want to get rewarded for their day's efforts. The costs they face, be it for child care, transport or insurance, are out of control. An immediate task for the Government is to try to reduce and contain costs and give a greater competitive edge to the economy in the future to sustain employment.</p>
          <p eId="para_696">Equality of opportunity for all in education must be considered. It would be great if the children of the well off and those not so well off could go through all levels of education without having to worry about the means at their disposal to do so. That is the essence of economic activity, the essence of alleviating poverty. Self-esteem and self-worth would obtain if people were given real access and opportunity in our education system.</p>
          <p eId="para_697">One of the crucial issues facing the country this year will be the Nice referendum. Every one of us has to get on board to ensure that it will be a success. Fine Gael and other parties in the House will be of assistance to the Government if we can negotiate measures that will benefit all sides of the House so we can put a proper proposal to the people that will be successful on this occasion. The Government should think long and hard and negotiate with everybody to see if we can reach common ground to achieve that objective.</p>
          <p eId="para_698">The national spatial strategy has been mentioned and promised for a long time. We have had a lot of studies, statistics and censuses, but no action. For many people of Dublin, quality of life, if it means anything, is defined by their getting out of Dublin. I would recommend a place called Kilkenny as one of the growth centres for decentralisation in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_701">I congratulate the people who were appointed by the Taoiseach. I know that Deputy Walsh got credit last year for keeping foot and mouth disease out of this country. I did not know that he put a barrier around Agriculture House to let nobody in. He has been here for about 17 years out of the past 20 and agriculture is going down the drain on a daily basis. Today, hundreds of farmers were marching outside this House. Next week, more farmers will come to protest about the prices in the agricultural sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">My following point concerns the Progressive Democrats, particularly Deputy Parlon. When I heard he was negotiating the programme for Government I was delighted. I said "This man is going to put agriculture on the top of the agenda." When I got the programme for Government I read every page. The Deputy was in the Gallery thousands of times telling us – the elected public representatives – what we were doing wrong in agriculture. When he had the opportunity to look after the farmers of this country and when he was at the table arranging the programme for Government, he forgot them. Is that not amazing?</p>

          <p eId="para_709">I want to know what part she had in it. I want a clear message from the Tánaiste as to what is happening with the FÁS schemes. Is it Government policy? Is it the policy of the Progressive Democrats? Is it Fianna Fáil policy or  was it the policy of the Independents, because they were the people supporting the last Government? They were in Government longer than Fine Gael. The Independents were in Government for the past five years. We were in Government for only two and a half years out of the past ten.</p>
          <p eId="para_710">What is the position regarding the FÁS schemes, which have given many deprived people an opportunity to work? The schemes, which worked, gave them and their families a sense of pride and an opportunity to be retrained for work. They also did some valuable work for the community, in relation to which the county councils had failed the people and taxpayers. The FÁS schemes did vital work. They trained unemployed people in carpentry and all kinds of work. They got people back into the workplace. I want the Tánaiste and her Department to make a clear statement on the FÁS schemes, maintain them, retain them and put the necessary funding in place to make sure that the people on those schemes, working in the health services and all forms of social life, are treated appropriately.</p>
          <p eId="para_711">I am sorry Deputy McDowell, the watchdog – I would say the rottweiler – has left the House. I got bitten by a dog during the election campaign. I hope it was a small bite and I hope, in respect of the Minister, that it will not be a small bite for the Government because he got elected and told the people he would be a rottweiler. We will now see if he is a lamb or rottweiler. One must remember that a lot of things will happen in the coming months. With regard to finances, the tax returns are not matching what the Government indicated a couple of months ago in the budget. Do not be surprised if the Government has to bring in a mini-budget in the next few weeks to make up the difference. We in the Opposition will be watching it every step of the way.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">Deputy Martin, the Minister for spin, had more spin doctors than medical doctors and more consultants than medical consultants. He is back in the job again. He told us during the election campaign that he did not realise there was a problem in the health service. He now tells us that all waiting lists will be gone within two years. I compliment and congratulate him because I will be the best supporter he has, but I will be monitoring him every single week. I will table questions to see what is happening in respect of the medical consultants and the spin doctors. We will want to know the true record.</p>
          <p eId="para_713">How is it that the chief executives of the health boards did not know they had a budget overrun until after the general election? That is outrageous and an interference with the political process. The chief executive of the Western Health Board brought in the Western Health Board members and told them that she was £4 billion over budget, but she did not tell them the week before the election. She brought them in the week after the election. That is political propaganda at its worst. I wish there was a change  of Government because there should be a change in a lot of the Departments. Political interference is not right. The chief executives of the health boards should tell the people the truth regardless of who is in Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_714">I am both glad and sorry for Deputy Woods. He is not a bad fellow. He was a great singer – I heard him sing down in Westport. His tune ran out today. I feel sorry for him because I liked him. Like Deputy Quinn and his colleagues, I have spent the past 12 months trying to get figures from the Department of Education and Science. If the Government is open and honest, it should give me those figures. I have tabled questions for the past six months about the list of schools seeking grant aid. However, the Department has not given me that information.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I ask you, a Cheann Comhairle, as the chairman of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges, to protect me as a Member of the House. I have tabled parliamentary questions and I am entitled to that information. Department officials should not keep that information from me. A parliamentary question is sacred and I should get the answers, but not when the election is over. I ask that the information be sent to me immediately. I will table more questions if the Dáil resumes next week, which I hope it will as that is what we are elected to do.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Deputy Ó Cuív will be the only Minister in Connacht. I am disappointed there will not be a senior Minister in Mayo. Deputy Ó Cuív has said he will take on An Taisce. He will have my full support. I want him to introduce new planning laws and to make it easier for the people of rural Ireland to get planning permission. As regards decentralisation, we have the people and the space for them to work in the west.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent:</from>
          <p eId="para_719">I congratulate those who have been appointed to ministerial office today, particularly the Taoiseach on his personal achievement. When one lists a number of jobs, it gives the impression that the country can be governed in compartments. However, it is good that recognition has been given to the need to cross-reference many responsibilities through the establishment of a Department with responsibility for transport. I hope that will be developed as it was missing in the last Government. Many errors were made and gaps were not addressed because they fell between different stools. That must be addressed in the interests of sustainability. The Green Party called for the establishment of a Department for transport. It is good that it is being established. It is unfortunate, however, that the programme for Government suggests that two thirds of transport expenditure in the national development plan will  be on roads rather than on public transport. We will work to change that in the new Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_720">Some Departments suggest business as usual. Deputy Martin could probably be called the Minister for sickness rather than the Minister for health. He said he finds it difficult to cope with the fact that each year 90,000 more people than the year before present themselves for health services. That is a rise of 6% every year. It seems to be an admission of failure, but he now has time to get to grips with that issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">I congratulate the Tánaiste on retaining her position. However, we must ensure that we have sustainable enterprise and not just trade, but fair trade. We also need a guarantee of meaningful employment. Many jobs are of a low grade and do not satisfy people's basic needs. I also urge her to work closely with the Department responsible for community, rural and Gaeltacht affairs. The Green Party called for the establishment of such a Department during the election campaign. I hope the new Department will measure up to that for which we called. It will be tested on its ability to build local sustainable economies and communities. That will be a new phenomenon if it happens.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">Deputy Walsh is also staying at his old office. However, will agriculture benefit from that lack of movement? I fear for the future of many farm families. I met some of them outside Leinster House at lunch time and they were not happy with the prospect of Deputy Walsh continuing in office. They fear the growth of a cartel in the meat industry and cheap milk imports. They also fear his endorsement of incineration. I share that fear. They feel it will be the death knell of the food industry, regardless of how the waste problem is sorted. The Government must take that on board. The Swiss study, which was done 21 years ago, proves that ecological and organic farming is more efficient. I ask the Government to take that on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">Deputy McCreevy must clean up the mess he made in the public finances. It may give satisfaction to some, but it is not satisfying for us to see the same Deputy who presided over a fiasco in the public finances continuing in the job. He must measure more than financial capital.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">Deputy Cullen is to succeed where Deputy Dempsey failed in rebalancing taxes. He did not make the argument sufficiently well at Cabinet to have eco taxes instead of income taxes. The Taoiseach told us that we will continue to make our contribution to international action on environmental problems. If that is the case, God help us because the contribution made to date has been horrendous. I hope it will be a change and not a continuation of that contribution. Yesterday was world environment day and in late August the Johannesburg Earth Summit will be held. That will blow the Government's game plan out of the water because the radical changes needed are not in the programme for Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">I welcome the movement of Dúchas to the  Department of the Environment and Local Government. We do not have a wildlife rehabilitation centre in this country. We should avail of opportunities in this year of eco tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Deputy Roche will be appointed a Minister of State. He is well used to being used and abused by Fianna Fáil. He has been sent to appear on programmes to defend the indefensible, whether that is scandals or defeats in Government. He has now been called to sell the unsaleable, namely, the Treaty of Nice with the new meaningless declaration attached. I presume he will be well able to explain its defeat when the time comes.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">As leader of the Green Party, I look forward to pursuing the full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. I understand some of the feelings of minorities and I can empathise with and, I hope, facilitate reconciliation and progress. As a member of a minority faith in a minority party and an advocate of a minority language, tá áthas orm a fheiceáil go bhfuil Éamonn Ó Cuív ins an Rialtas faoi dheireadh. Is é an duine a thabharfaidh isteach an Bille Teanga. Le cúnamh Dé beidh sé sin os ár gcomhair gan mhoill.</p>

          <from>Mr. Eamon Ryan:</from>
          <p eId="para_728">Deputy John Bruton was right when he said the Green Party could not get the same speaking rights as Fine Gael because of the numbers. However, I would have liked the opportunity Deputy John Bruton had to type out a nice speech. I got a telephone call 15 minutes ago to tell me I could speak for five minutes at a certain time. That is one of the problems we are arguing about because we want to be able to best serve our time in the Dáil.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">I am sorry Deputy McDowell has left the House because I want to give him some of the lectures on economics he delivered to us in the months leading up to the election. The first debate we need to have is about sustainable economics. People should not assume the Green Party is anti-business or anti-enterprise. Our philosophy comes from the book mentioned by Deputy Gormley, <i>Small is Beautiful</i>, by Schumacher. We believe in business where it has a soul and in economics which treat people and the environment as if they matter. The philosophy is about promoting small and indigenous business. Small and indigenous businesses have criticised the Government for making it incredibly difficult to do business in this country. It has looked after Intel, the multinational companies and IBEC, but it has not looked after small Irish businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The first law of economics in UCD – Deputy McDowell's brother could probably tell him if he gave him a call – is that one does not pump an overheating economy. The last Government did that over the past five years and, as a result, we have high inflation. We have twice the inflation rate of our European competitors. That makes it difficult for small businesses. There is house inflation which is causing friends of mine to leave the country because they cannot afford to live in Dublin and do not want to drive from Carlow or Kilkenny to Dublin. Certainly, Kilkenny should  be developed but we should not have a country where house inflation is so high. Six months ago the Government brought the investors back in to pump inflation further and make it even more difficult for young people to purchase a house.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">There is wage inflation because there is house price inflation. There is inflation in insurance and in the compensation culture that the previous Government oversaw for five years. We saw the development of a cartel in the insurance industry despite Government Departments espousing free competition. The compensation culture and the insurance costs that come with it create a huge difficulties for small businesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">There are also huge costs to small businesses in the area of transport. The provision of motorways will not solve that. They will do nothing except facilitate people to drive for an hour and a half from Carlow to Dublin every day or turn the whole country into a commuter belt for the greater Dublin area. Motorways will not alleviate the huge costs for employers and the difficulties for employees in getting to work. Public transport is the only way. I was worried, when Deputy Quinn raised the issue of whether the spatial plan would be a part of the Department of Transport and Public Enterprise, that Deputy Martin Cullen indicated it would not. That is ridiculous. Transport and planning cannot be separated.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">The Government is maintaining the same kind of gambling instinct in the Minister for Finance, who has been kept in his post, and I will watch to see that the Government does not use public private partnership as a kind of illusory way of solving the crisis. We do not want public private partnerships where the State takes all the risk and private corporations get the benefit or where financiers decide what sort of hospital or railway system we get. That will not work.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The outgoing Government has given us many lectures but it has dug us into a deep economic hole. I hope that the Government is willing to listen to the Opposition who will help it to change tack and dig us all out of that hole.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#DanBoyle" eId="spk_214">
          <from>Mr. Boyle:</from>
          <p eId="para_735">It was Abraham Lincoln who came up with the aphorism that you can fool all of the people some of the time, some of the people all of the time but you cannot fool all of the people all of the time. The maxim of the Government in the last Dáil, and what it seems willing to pursue in this Dáil, is that you can fool enough of the people enough of the time. That adds to the very real cynicism that exists about Irish political life.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">Elements of this Government have expressed through their pronouncements and their policy initiatives a doubt as to whether they identify with the notion that, as Margaret Thatcher has said, there is no such thing as society. This will be most seen in how the Government squares a difficult circle now that we seem to be heading towards breaching the Maastricht treaty criteria of 3% for the debt-GDP ratio in terms of our budget balance.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">Cuts have been put in place across the board in various Government Departments. This is already seen in proposals on the community employment schemes and, despite the obvious pride that the Tánaiste has taken in her stewardship of her Department, there will be many who are disappointed that she still has that portfolio. Despite the Tánaiste's belief that these schemes are a labour market measure, they are instead a real means of maintaining the under-resourcing that successive Governments have been responsible for in terms of voluntary social services. Any attempt to undermine the basis of volunteerism and voluntary activity will come back to haunt this Government and the Green Party is putting down a marker that it is willing to argue the case for proper resourcing of communities and to speak on their behalf.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">As part of the reorganisation of Government, the establishment of a Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs – which was first proposed by the Green Party and which I welcome – should see the administration of community employment schemes carried out by this Department rather than the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment. If we believe in community employment schemes playing a valued role in resourcing communities throughout the country, that is the proper place for it to be.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">In relation to some of the other appointments, the integration of public enterprise in the Department of Transport is something that we welcome. However, if it is a Department that merely talks about administering transport in the way that has been done in the past it will be a fairly useless innovation.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">We are beginning to see the start of a campaign in relation to a second referendum on the Nice treaty. It has been pointed out in this debate that the Tánaiste has talked about anyone who intends to vote "No" in such a referendum as being isolationist and willing to work against the real interests of this country. I say to her and to members of the Government that it is time we took on board a critique of the European Union that refers to where the people want to see the European Union going. We are very much a part of the European Union, will remain so and will get benefits from our membership in terms of the Single Market. However, if it is a European Union that is not people-centred, is undemocratic, centralised and has decisions made by small cliques, then the people of Ireland will not support it. In a referendum to discuss the nature of that direction, the people of Ireland will take the opportunity to oppose it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelDHiggins" eId="spk_215">
          <from>Mr. M. Higgins:</from>
          <p eId="para_741">I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle on his appointment and wish him well. I also offer my compliments on a personal level to the holders of office and those who have departed from office.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">I regard the nomination of this Government by the Taoiseach as a disaster for the country. The  views that the members of the Government represent – with a Taoiseach who went to the country, secured 81 seats, and decided to surrender his party to the views of the Progressive Democrats – will have the consequence of revealing an appalling vista. Why should the people trust those who inherited a good economy and had massive surpluses, and who exhausted those surpluses on deepening every inequality – in housing, health, income and social protection? Why should the people expect anything from them now in conditions of scarcity?</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Earlier today, the phrase "centre right" was used. It was the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy who used that phrase first as a badge of honour. He said in an interview with the BBC that he was proud to be a "right of sinister" Minister for Finance and proud to introduce Reaganite and Thatcherite policies in this country. Now he is to be joined in Cabinet by Deputy McDowell. Members of the Cabinet should open a new page in their diaries entitled "Tuesdays with Michael". They will hear from him a kind of asocial individualism close to an amoral individualism that expressly states that there is no such thing as universal rights on an egalitarian basis. In everything he stands for, from jurisprudence right through to the economy and to social policy, his is the law of the fittest. There is no such thing as a citizenship which would automatically grant equal rights in health, education and in relation to participation in society. This bogus republican party is a republican party that stands for the law of the strongest.</p>
          <p eId="para_744">Deputy McCreevy said that he will publish a book on his five budgets, despite one budget after another distributing all the fruits to those who already had. Coming towards the end, and facing a crisis on the capital side, he decided to hand close to €2 billion back to those who already had through his savings scheme. When history comes to be written, it will look at the outgoing Government and the surpluses it had. How did that Government end? I remember the general election and colleagues of mine going to meetings saying to people suffering from disability, for example, that they agreed that the legislation should be on a rights basis. Where is that legislation in the programme for Government? It is not in the programme.</p>
          <p eId="para_745">Another issue is the classic antipathy of the Fianna Fáil Party to the word "culture". I was the first Minister for Arts, Culture and the Gaeltacht. When I left, the word "culture" was removed from the title. In the current programme,  responsibility for heritage is now scattered back to the Department of the Environment and Local Government. The dangerous buildings sections of many of the local authorities were those I had to take court action against to stop them demolishing heritage buildings.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Where is the Irish language in this programme and who has responsibility for broadcasting? Broadcasting is buried in communications so that the destruction of the national broadcaster can continue. It is mentioned in the programme that we will have Bille na Gaeilge. However, it is not indicated which Minister will have responsibility for it. Why this Fianna Fáil antipathy to the word "culture"?</p>
          <p eId="para_747">In introducing his new team, the Taoiseach said: "in reviewing the responsibilities of Departments I am acutely conscious of the ever-increasing pace of change in needs and priorities in the modern economy." Perhaps someone will tell him in the next five years that we are not prisoners of the economy, as the Tánaiste believes. Are we to bring back the 70 year olds in case the economy needs them and then, when we have a shortage of jobs, send back those who have been allowed to come here and work without certificates?</p>
          <p eId="para_748">We are members of a society. That is the difference. When the claptrap of Deputy McDowell and the others is examined analytically by economists it will be shown to be a pale version of things that have failed elsewhere. Deputy McCreevy knows that, but he does not care. I disagree with his market model. He is using the model as an instrument of oppression in relation to the economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_749">On this side of the House we will not moan about the state of the finances or speak as though the economy and finances were separate from politics. We will be submitting the Government's Reaganism and Thatcherism to scrutiny and offering a different model based on social economics, inclusion, rights, citizenship and all the things people might expect in a republic. The republican Taoiseach got 81 seats and then surrendered, via Deputy McCreevy, to the Progressive Democrats in order that we could have more of the same. Disgrace.</p>
