        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T12:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_1">Children with physical and sensory disabilities need all the supports that are humanly possible to be made available to them so they can have as independent a life as possible. Volumes of research show that children who receive intervention as early as possible benefit enormously from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_2"> The Irish Wheelchair Association administers a personal assistant scheme using a person-centred approach. It has pioneered the way the service is meant to be delivered. It connects with each individual and has a direct input into his or her needs and assessments.</p>
          <p eId="para_3"> There is no need for me to outline the considerable benefits that have accrued for children with intellectual, sensory or physical disabilities because of their having personal assistants. Unfortunately, however, there are many children who are not receiving this vital support. I am sure the Tánaiste and every other Deputy has had to fight for services, such as personal assistants, for children with special needs in preschools, national schools and secondary schools.</p>
          <p eId="para_4"> The maximum number of hours allowed through the Irish Wheelchair Association is four to six hours. This is absolutely inadequate. The programme for Government refers at length to commitments to improving the lives of people with disabilities, and it goes through all that should be done to help them. The HSE’s plan for 2016 alone contains a target of 1.3 million hours. This compares with 1.4 million actual hours in 2015. Therefore, before we start at all, there has been a reduction in the service by 100,000 personal assistant hours, despite the constant growth in the number of children who need personal assistants. It is grossly hypocritical to include a commitment in the programme for Government to having better supports and access for those with disabilities, particularly children, if the number of hours referred to in the 2016 plan is lower than the number granted in 2015. The Government has given various commitments in this regard. I challenge it to consider very seriously the provision of personal assistants, particularly through the Irish Wheelchair Association. I have encountered many cases throughout my constituency of families seeking supports, as has every other Deputy.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">It is hypocritical to claim the Government is seeking to improve the lives of people with disabilities through better access to supports and increased independence when the number of personal assistance hours has been cut this year. Will the Tánaiste confirm that these cuts will be reversed and the allocation of personal assistance hours will be dramatically increased in 2017? </p>
          <p eId="para_6"> Children starting preschool education and primary school are being allocated four or six hours of personal assistance. If this figure were increased to eight or nine hours, it would give them a major boost as they face the challenges of the future. I ask the Tánaiste to acknowledge that services have been cut this year, confirm that they will be reversed and recognise that the Irish Wheelchair Association must be shown greater flexibility in providing additional hours to children who require them at preschool and primary level. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_2" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_7">The Deputy raises a very important topic. I agree with him that early intervention services are critical, particularly for children with special needs who require either intellectual or physical supports. The programme for Government commits to supporting children in these circumstances. For the first time, children with a disability who are attending preschool education will receive supports under the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme. This major new initiative to ensure children have access to services will mean, for example, that special needs assistants will be made available in preschool settings. The Government recently agreed to provide an additional 860 special needs assistants. This will be of considerable help to the children the Deputy describes both in preschool and primary education.</p>
          <p eId="para_8"> An additional €500 million has been allocated to the health service, including €31 million secured by the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to support and improve disability services. This funding will be used to deal precisely with the group of children the Deputy describes, as well as adults who are in need of support, particularly those making the transition from school to day care centres. This money will ensure services are available to this group. The Government is, therefore, committed to early intervention and providing supports for the children the Deputy describes. Under the previous Government, the then Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, also announced extra funding for speech and occupational therapy. </p>
          <p eId="para_9"> The Deputy indicated that the Irish Wheelchair Association has some concerns regarding personal assistants. I will convey the points he raises to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and ask him to respond directly to the Deputy. The general context is one of increased funding for health services, with a special focus on extra funding for disability services, and increases in early years supports for children with special needs, whether intellectual or physical. The Government is committed to this in the programme for Government. I will ask the Minister to respond to the Deputy directly on the personal assistance scheme. I expect that supports will be made available to children who need this kind of support given the commitments made in the programme for Government and the focus and priority the Government has given to increasing funding for the health sector. </p>
          <p eId="para_10"> As I stated earlier in the week, demand for health services is increasing and attendances are higher. Thankfully, the needs of many of the children in question are being identified at earlier in life. We must provide supports to children with special needs at an earlier time in life. For this reason, I welcome what the Government is doing in ensuring that children with disabilities have access to supports in preschool and primary education. </p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMoynihan" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Michael Moynihan<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T12:05:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_11">The parents of children with physical or intellectual disabilities must continuously fight the system for services for their children. The Tánaiste stated that more special needs assistants will be provided.</p>
          <p eId="para_12">I am sorry to say that is not what is happening on the ground. The Tánaiste referred to speech and language and occupational therapy. A whole series of questions could be brought in these areas. There could be hours of debate on these matters and every Deputy could bring their own experience to bear. The waiting list for occupational therapy, speech therapy and all of that produces extraordinarily difficulties. There are huge waiting lists. Parents come to me with stories of waiting lists of a year or a year and a half but the services are needed now.</p>
          <p eId="para_13"> The Tánaiste made a point about special needs assistants. Will she tease out the point? We have all signed up to UN conventions and so on and the theory is correct, but the reality is that there is extraordinary concern among people and there is a lack of supports for children with either physical or intellectual disabilities. This applies whether they are trying to access the services in primary school, preschool or in second-level education.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FrancesFitzgerald" eId="spk_4" as="#Tánaiste">
          <from> The Tánaiste<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_14">Parents of children with special needs, whether intellectual or physical, should not have to fight the system in the way Deputy Moynihan describes. Our intention is to improve the services. Let me give an example of what is happening. Under the Health Service Executive 2016 national service plan, the priority is to protect the level of services provided in 2015 and to provide 1.3 million hours of personal assistance services as well as 2.6 million hours of home support to over 2,000 adults with a disability. These are precise figures on the improvement in personal assistance hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Historically, parents of children with a disability in this country have had to fight too hard for services. We know that. In an improving economic situation we are now in a position where more services are being provided. That is the reality. There are 850 extra SNAs. Parents who need special needs assistants in schools for their children will see the benefit of this in the coming school term. Extra money has been allocated with over €1 billion in our budget for special needs assistants.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#CarolNolan" eId="spk_5">
          <from>Deputy Carol Nolan<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T12:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_16">I wish to highlight the absolute failure of this Government to manage the care of citizens with intellectual disabilities. They are vulnerable citizens. It is totally inappropriate and unjustifiable that these citizens have been left in this manner. They are citizens who have rights, like all of us.</p>
          <p eId="para_17"> The Tánaiste will remember the scandal last year surrounding the investigation into Áras Attracta. Unfortunately, that scandal was quickly followed by too many more scandals. For example, a HIQA report into St. Patrick's Centre campus in Kilkenny found that it was understaffed, poorly maintained, unclean and lacked an adequate fire safety plan. That is a basic necessity in any care centre, but it was not in place. In recent years a number of HIQA reports have highlighted major non-compliance in residential centres for adults and children with intellectual disabilities. The centres have failed on multiple grounds in respect of non-compliance of regulations. Last April, the HIQA chief executive Phelim Quinn told a conference hosted by Inclusion Ireland that the standard of care in some residential centres was disturbing and appalling. Last summer HIQA gave notice to 20 disability services that their registrations would be refused or cancelled if they did not make necessary improvements within 28 days.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> The HSE revealed in June last year that more than 20 staff were being investigated for abusing residents with severe intellectual disabilities throughout the State - and this is a small state. This year the problem has continued. For example, the centre at St. Mary's in Drumcar run by St. John of God's was closed because inspectors from HIQA found significant and ongoing levels of non-compliance and were not assured that the services being provided were safe. In recent weeks we have seen the additional scandal of St. John of God's withdrawing funding from St. Augustine's in Dublin while 14 of its senior managers received secret top-ups to the tune of €2 million. That is disgraceful and cannot continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_19"> There is a crisis in the provision of care for citizens with intellectual disabilities. While many care homes provide excellent services, many others do not and they need to be dealt with. Does the Tánaiste accept that the failure of Government to fully register residential services, provide for proper and regular inspections and monitor these care homes is a disgrace and requires urgent attention?</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Will the Government agree to establish as a matter of urgency a fully independent root and branch inquiry into all care facilities for citizens with intellectual disabilities?</p>

          <p eId="para_21">The Government appointed a Minister of State with particular responsibility for people with disabilities, which was the right thing to do. We are all aware of the poor standards that historically have prevailed in many residential institutions. I welcome the work HIQA is doing which the Government wants to support. Many of these facilities remained hidden and there was bad management behind closed doors. We are now seeing independence being brought to bear in examining the standards in residential homes through the work of HIQA. I welcome its work in ensuring various residential services reach the proper standards. I agree with the Deputy that it is extremely disappointing that we continue to hear about poor standards in residential services; it is not good enough. That is why we support HIQA's work and have dedicated €300 million to ensuring residential disability services reach the proper standards and will be fully compliant. The Minister of State with responsibility for people with disabilities is absolutely committed to ensuring residential facilities reach the appropriate standards. He is dedicated to doing this, while the Government is dedicated to providing the funding required both for HIQA and the various service providers to ensure it will happen. Those running services have a responsibility to ensure their staff and facilities reach HIQA standards. If not, they will be exposed and action taken. Recently, the HSE took over responsibility for a number of facilities.</p>
          <p eId="para_22"> On St. Augustine's, the Minister of State met the families. The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, was also involved. As the Deputy knows, a decision has been made in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> The money use to make top-up payments should be returned. The Ministers for Public Expenditure and Reform and Health are actively involved in analysing the matter, including the pay guidelines which should have been met. They will ensure action is taken in order that, if money is due to the State, it will be recouped.</p>

          <p eId="para_24">We are talking about the regulation and registration of a care centre. These are very basic requirements. The plan was to have 1,000 centres registered by HIQA by October this year, but that will not happen. I would not sing HIQA's praises by any means, but the Government needs to take responsibility for this matter. Registration is a basic requirement, but it has not happened. The health (amendment) Bill will be brought to the Government, but we are just kicking the can down the road in terms of registration in allowing a further two years to complete the process. This is a very small country and we are only talking about 1,000 of these centres; it should not, therefore, be a major task. People cannot afford to wait for another two years for these issues to be addressed. It is further evidence that the Government is failing to properly manage the care of vulnerable citizens with an intellectual disability. I repeat my question. Will the Government establish as a matter of urgency a fully independent root and branch inquiry into all care facilities for citizens with intellectual disabilities?</p>

          <p eId="para_25">It is important to ensure the various residential institutions reach the standards laid out. They have not been granted an extension of time by HIQA to reach them. What is most important is that they be independently inspected, that the work being done is independently examined by HIQA. That is where our focus should be to ensure the services being provided and the care being given are of the very best standard. The staff who are working in the services need to be able to do their job in appropriate facilities and provide the care we would expect to be provided for adults - it is primarily adults who are involved - in need of residential care.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">That is the Government's intention. That is the direction those services are moving in. I agree with the Deputy it is critical that they move as quickly as possible. As I have said, we know the standards have traditionally not been good enough. Now that this is out in the open, HIQA is inspecting and the money is available to ensure there is compliance. The services have been given the necessary amount of time, but not an undue amount of time, to reach the outlined standards they should meet.</p>

          <p eId="para_27">The Minister, Deputy Coveney, met representatives of the bin companies in Athlone last month following the public outcry and concern about huge increases in waste charges as a result of the introduction of the pay-by-weight system. There was a collective sigh of relief nationwide when the Minister said after the meeting in Athlone that waste charges would be frozen for 12 months, that people's waste charges would not increase and that he would take action if waste companies did not comply. One of the companies in question, Greyhound, is now giving two fingers to the Minister by requiring people to opt out of the pay-by-weight system. In other words, if people do not contact the company, they automatically go under the pay-by-weight system, which means an increase in their charges. Greyhound is also insisting that its customers have to take out new 12-month contracts from 1 August and have to pay by that date.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> I will give an example. I was recently contacted by an old age pensioner from my constituency who receives €198.60 per week. In December of last year, she renewed her yearly contract with Greyhound for the 12-month period from 1 January to 31 December 2016. The annual charge was €59.99, with additional pay-per-lift payments to be made. This woman received a letter from Greyhound asking her to contact it and informing her that the mandatory pay-by-weight system was gone. When she contacted the company, she was told she would have to pay €140 per year, with this payment to be received by 1 August next. This is going to be the case even though her current contract has not yet expired. She will have to make a full payment by 1 August, or alternatively pay in two instalments of €70 each. Another person in the same situation contacted me by e-mail and asked me to call for Government intervention regarding the so-called price freeze that has been brought in. She said that after she phoned Greyhound to ensure her service charge, which was prepaid until December 2016, and her charge per lift would not change, she was contacted to say that there would be changes in those charges. Like thousands of customers of Greyhound, I would like to know in light of what I have said whether action is being taken. What action, if any, is the Minister proposing to take to address the situation at Greyhound?</p>

          <p eId="para_29">The Government believes the significant progress that has been made with recycling rates and diversion from landfill has been very positive for our environment and our communities. As the Deputy knows, the Minister has actively engaged with representatives of the waste industry with a view to agreeing a way forward that results in customers paying no more over the next 12 months than they are currently paying for waste. The approach that was agreed with industry involved a price freeze to the end of June 2017. The Minister has every intention of monitoring very closely the agreement that has been reached. He has said he will take action if there are breaches in this regard. He has been in contact with the company mentioned by Deputy Collins and he will be in further contact with it. He has made it clear that he will introduce legislation if necessary. If the agreement he reached with the waste companies is being broken - he will continue to monitor this very carefully - he will take action. I want to say clearly that situations like those described by Deputy Collins will be dealt with by the Minister as long as they are out of line with the agreement. He will take action with the particular company. He has already engaged with it on some of the issues raised by the Deputy. He has publicly expressed his dissatisfaction with a particular company regarding the manner in which it required customers to opt out of the pay-by-weight system, as opposed to being offered the opportunity to opt in.</p>
          <p eId="para_30">The Deputy can be assured that the Minister is monitoring the situation carefully. He is engaged and will continue to engage on the matter. If the agreement is being broken and action is necessary, he will take action.</p>

          <p eId="para_31">I thank the Tánaiste for her reply, but the point is that it is being broken. It has been broken for the last two weeks. The company has written to every customer telling them that they must contact the company about their renewed contract. The Minister should not be monitoring it for the next two weeks. This is 14 July and the company is saying that people must pay in advance by 1 August. What will the Minister do now to take this company to task and to maintain the price freeze which he said was in place? What choice does Eva have? She has been told that she must pay €140 by 1 August if she wishes to maintain her service with Greyhound. I ask the Minister to be a little more urgent on this. We are familiar with Greyhound. The company has a reputation of contempt for its workers, such as the lock-out of 2014. Now it appears to have the same contempt for its customers and for the Minister. I urge the Minister to come to the Dáil quickly to state that he will introduce the legislation necessary to deal with this issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_32">The Minister is extremely alert to this issue. When he was discussing this in the Dáil on previous occasions he said that he had engaged with the industry and had come to an agreement with it. He said he would monitor it and act on any breaches of the agreement. He also said that if legislation was necessary, he would introduce it. The Deputy can raise the points she raised this morning when the Minister is taking questions or on other occasions, but I assure her that he is alert to this situation and is engaging individually with companies. If there is a breach, he will respond and deal with it. I will bring what the Deputy said today to his attention.</p>

          <p eId="para_34">Last week I outlined how a US vulture fund structured its Irish subsidiary, Mars Capital, to avoid paying taxes in Ireland on its Irish profits. I believe these vulture funds are about to pull off the largest avoidance of tax on Irish profits in the history of the State. The scale is likely to be in the tens of billions of euro in missed taxes. These are taxes being avoided by Irish companies on Irish domestic profits earned off the backs of distressed Irish families. Irish charities are being used to play a key part in this tax avoidance. Mars Capital is owned by a registered charity, the Matheson Foundation. The stated mission of the charity is to help Irish children to fulfil their potential. It contributes to causes such as the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, Barnardos and Temple Street Children's University Hospital. The charity does not mention its ownership of Mars Capital. One reporter I spoke to believes that the charity might own more than 200 companies. At a time when public faith in the charity sector has been rocked yet again, a children's charity is being used to help a vulture fund avoid paying taxes to the Irish State on its Irish profits.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> It is very effective. In spite of annual revenues in year one of over €14 million Mars Capital paid total corporation tax to the Irish State of €250. Companies such as Mars Capital are known as section 110 companies. Section 110 was introduced in 1997 to allow the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, win global securitisation deals. These involve global companies structuring global assets in Ireland. Their profits were not earned here, so section 110 helps these companies avoid paying taxes here on those profits. The vulture funds are now using section 110 companies to avoid paying taxes in Ireland on Irish profits. Section 110 companies were not created to re-route Irish domestic profits to offshore locations. However, my understanding is that almost all of the vulture funds whose profits are generated in Ireland have section 110 status.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> How big is the scale of the tax avoidance by these vulture funds? Irish companies typically pay approximately 30% tax on their profits, between corporation tax and dividends tax. Vulture funds typically target minimum returns on their Irish investments of 15% to 20% per year over seven to ten years. That means a €100 million investment by a vulture fund should generate €100 million in taxes for the Irish State.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">To be clear, the level of taxes being missed by the Irish State is likely to be well over half of the total value of all of the distressed loan books sold by NAMA, IBRC and private banks.</p>
          <p eId="para_38"> Will the Government direct Revenue to cancel section 110 status for all vulture funds in Ireland? Will it provide Revenue with the extra resources to execute this quickly and to reclaim back taxes? Will it direct the Charities Regulator to pull charity status where that status is being used to help avoid Irish tax on Irish profits? Will it direct NAMA to not sell assets to vulture funds if these funds are structured to avoid Irish taxes on Irish profits?</p>

          <p eId="para_39">I thank the Deputy. Section 110 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 sets out the taxation regime for securitisation and other structured finance transactions. Under the Taxes Consolidation Act, a qualifying section 110 company is chargeable to tax at 25% but has its profits computed by reference to the rules available to trading companies. As a result, the companies are generally structured in such a way that they are effectively tax-neutral. A company must notify the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in advance of its intention to fall within the scope of section 110. The companies are required to pay their taxes and file their tax returns in the same way as all other companies and are subject to the same monitoring by the Revenue Commissioners, an important point to note.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> I understand that officials from the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are currently examining recent media coverage concerning the use of certain physical vehicles for property investments - indeed, Deputy Donnelly has raised this issue before, as has Deputy Pearse Doherty. Should these investigations uncover tax avoidance schemes or abuses which erode the tax base and cause reputational issues for the State, then appropriate action will be taken and any necessary legislative tax changes that may be required will be put forward for the consideration of the Minister for Finance. Therefore, I can confirm that the Department of Finance and the Revenue Commissioners are examining this issue with a view to taking action.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I would also respond to the Deputy's point in regard to charitable status. Clearly, this issue needs examination by the Charities Regulator. I have been in contact with the Charities Regulator and asked him to examine the particular issues which the Deputy has raised about the granting of charitable status and how it is being used by certain companies at present.</p>

          <p eId="para_42">I thank the Tánaiste for her reply. I am very glad to see the Government is taking this seriously. We could be looking at missed taxes to the Irish State to the tune of €1 billion to €2 billion a year, or even more. If it is €1 billion a year, that equates to some €20 million a week in missed taxes. The section 110 structures were set up for a legitimate reason in 1997 under the Taxes Consolidation Act. They are now being used by nearly all of the vulture funds to take profits generated in Ireland and, very frustratingly, to take profits generated in Ireland by ordinary, decent families trying to pay their way out of negative equity and distressed mortgages. Section 110 was never intended to be used to pull Irish-generated profits out of the country. This is happening on a scale that is potentially worth tens of billions of euro.</p>
          <p eId="para_43"> I acknowledge what the Tánaiste said about the Revenue Commissioners. Will she come back to the House on this issue as a matter of urgency, ideally before the recess? What we should be doing in the finance Bill which is coming up with the budget, or even before that, is shutting this down.</p>

This is clearly an issue of concern, particularly the point the Deputy raised yesterday in regard to the use of charitable status, which I believe needs investigation. The Minister for Finance will take note of the outcome of the investigations that Revenue and the Department of Finance are undertaking at present on this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_45">There is no doubt that, if it needs to be addressed, he will address it in a comprehensive way in the budget. It is important that we first have a full analysis to have the entire picture put on the table and see what the results of the investigations are to determine whether changes are necessary.</p>

They had to hand it to the porter at the front gate. They came from every county, including Northern Ireland, to oppose the construction of the national children's hospital on the site chose. Will somebody examine the madness of the decision that construction go ahead on the site which will be inaccessible? There will not even be a helicopter pad. It is utter madness.</p>

It is a suitable site and the building and development of the hospital will go ahead on it. It will be a state-of-the-art national children's hospital which is long overdue and badly needed. It will provide an excellent service for the parents described by the Deputy because it will have state-of-the-art facilities for the children of the country. The site has been examined and recommended and the decision taken to go ahead. It has received planning permission. I hope that in the next couple of years we will finally have a state-of-the-art natinonal children's hospital.</p>

The Minister for Health will meet the director of the HSE again this week to discuss the very issue raised by the Deputy. There will also be a new initiative which is part of the agreement in the programme for Government whereby the National Treatment Purchase Fund will be used. There will be an allocation of €15 million in 2017 for an initiative targeted at those who have been waiting the longest. It is part of the continued investment of €50 million a year to reduce waiting lists.</p>
          <p eId="para_54">The Department is engaging with the NTPF and the HSE in planning a dedicated waiting list initiative, which will be rolled out later this year. It is important to note that more than 60% of patients on waiting lists wait less than six months for their required care and 94% wait less than the maximum waiting time of 15 months, so we are determined to address the issue. The €500 million given to the Department of Health and agreed in this House last week will ensure that those waiting times are reduced further.</p>

          <p eId="para_58">The previous Government published the first ever national strategy for people with disabilities in terms of access to employment. That strategy is now being implemented. There is work to be done but the policies are there and Government is implementing them. In regard to the particular case that the Deputy has raised, I know that both the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, and the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, are actively engaging with the people who are involved in the WALK PEER group to seek a solution to the issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_59">In light of the commitment in the programme for Government to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis, I want to ask the Tánaiste about one specific issue. Last week the Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced an increase in the rent allowance across the country but, unfortunately, in a couple of counties, including my own county of Kerry, it was in the region of 5%. I went to the trouble of looking at the Daft first quarter average rents for the country. The average rent in County Galway is €618 per month and in Kerry is €623 per month. Both counties have similar populations and very similar demands regarding tourism activity, etc. Why did the Minister apply such a meagre increase to Kerry when he applied a 25% increase to County Galway? He applied an equally meagre increase to Mayo. While I understand he might have a reason for not giving Mayo a decent increase, I cannot understand why he did not give Kerry a decent increase. This should be reviewed and changed immediately.</p>

          <p eId="para_60">The Department of Social Protection recently carried out a review of the rent limits, as the Deputy knows, in line with the commitments contained in the programme for a partnership Government. Increased limits for rent supplement have been introduced in all areas of the country with recent effect and the increases that have been given reflect the pressures on rental properties in each particular location. All I can say to the Deputy is that the review was based on the examination done and the data collected by the Department of Social Protection and the increases reflected that data and those pressures for each county.</p>

          <p eId="para_62">Yesterday my colleague, Deputy Noel Grealish, correctly raised the issue of the imminence of the review of the bail legislation. The question was answered by the Taoiseach and I listened with interest. Is there now an intention to prioritise the introduction of the required legislation in this House, with particular reference to the need to combat recidivism?</p>
          <p eId="para_63">Given the continued acts of crime by a well organised and large group of people while out on bail, I ask that the legislation be prioritised.</p>

          <p eId="para_65">I acknowledge the substantial amount of money made available in the programme for Government to deal with flooding. However, I refer to the appalling situation in south Roscommon where the level of the River Shannon has increased by 7 in. during the past two weeks. Yesterday I received a number of calls from people affected. Flood waters are beginning to come out onto the land and we are only in July. However, the problem can be solved. I have spoken to people and gained much local knowledge. The weirs at Meelick and Parteen are holding water. The weir at Meelick is controlled by the Office of Public Works, OPW, while the weir at Parteen is controlled by the Electricity Supply Board, ESB. I am told that if the water held there - a number of gates are closed - was released, the flooding that will occur in the region could be alleviated. I am asking the Tánaiste to get into a conversation with the ESB and the OPW to see if some of the water could be released in order to stop a major problem in July.</p>

For the first time, we have all of the agencies working more effectively together. Various actions are planned and whatever action can be taken will be taken.</p>

          <p eId="para_67">I refer to people in receipt of respite care grants. In the case of carers who are looking after people with disabilities and have been overpaid, arrangements have been made to sort out the matter, including stopping their respite care grants in part payment. This is very unfair. Everybody knows that the respite care grant is paid to carers to support the people for whom they are caring, to improve their living accommodation or to take them on a holiday. I would like the Tánaiste to ask the Minister for Social Protection to examine this issue.</p>

It is my understanding that the committee on implementation of this has only met twice. Would the Tánaiste consider an all-party approach to the issue of the implementation of the employment strategy for people with disabilities, taking on board the spokespersons on health and disability with a view to ensuring that strategy is implemented and that this Dáil will be a champion for disability?</p>

          <p eId="para_77">On the same matter, would the Tánaiste commit to a cross-departmental approach in this regard? Unfortunately, the families explained to us this morning that when they ask the question of the Department of Health, they get kicked to the Department of Education and Skills and when they ask the Department of Education and Skills, they get kicked to the Department of Social Protection. Realistically, we need all of the relevant Departments involved to focus on this. It is not only about the WALK PEER - Providing Equal Employment Routes - programme but about that model and where it can be rolled out. It does fantastic work. I hope the Tánaiste takes the time to have a look at it at first hand. It does great work with families, with people who otherwise would really struggle.</p>

          <p eId="para_134">I move:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_135">That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Planning and Development Act 2000 to provide for an increased percentage of social and affordable housing in private residential developments and in strategic development zones.</p>
          <p eId="para_136">Deputies are aware that the housing and homelessness is getting worse. Tonight 6,000 people will sleep in emergency accommodation and 2,000 of those are children. Many of those families will spend up to two years in emergency accommodation. There are more than 130,000 households on local authority housing waiting lists and increasingly, the average waiting time in large urban areas is ten years. The total increase in local authority and approved housing body stock last year was 2,000 units, yet the Dáil Committee on Housing and Homeless recommended that we needed an increase of 10,000 units annually. That committee also recommended greater use of strategic development zones for the delivery of social housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_137"> One of the decisions made by the previous Government under the former Minister, Deputy Alan Kelly, which has made the crisis worse, was the reduction in the Part V requirement from 20% to 10% of private housing for social use. The former Minister made a case at the time that the 20% requirement was prohibiting private developers from submitting planning applications and that reducing it to 10% would result in a significant increase. However, that has not happened and we have seen a reduction in the past 12 months. </p>
          <p eId="para_138"> The Bill I am introducing seeks to restore and increase the Part V requirement to at least 25% in private developments and to 30% in strategic development zones such as the one in my constituency in Clonburris on the former Irish Glass Bottle Company site in Ringsend. This would be good for developers. It would give them a guaranteed income stream through pre-agreed sales that they could use to assist in getting development finance. It would be good for the families who would get off the housing and homeless list and into social housing and it would also be good for social housing policy because it would increase the level of income mix, which is what Government policy requires. On that basis, I commend the Bill.</p>

That subsection provides that the special liquidators should comply with all directions given by the commission under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004. It is intended to remove any doubt as to the requirement on the special liquidators to comply with the directions of the commission issued under the 2004 Act. As there is also power under section 2 of this Bill for the commission to give directions, the amendment clarifies that the special liquidators shall also comply with all directions under this Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_501"> I thank Members for facilitating the passage of the Bill and particularly those who contributed to the debate on Second Stage, which was very interesting. The provisions of the Bill will ensure that the commission can conduct, to the greatest extent possible, an efficient, effective and timely investigation into issues of significant public concern which have arisen regarding certain transactions conducted by the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC. It is evident that this aim is shared across the House. I thank the Members involved in the consultations which led to this provision.</p>

          <from>Minister for Justice and Equality (Deputy Frances Fitzgerald)<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T14:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> The Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, and the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 were developed in response to a deep crisis 20 years ago.  If Veronica Guerin's murder marked the low point in the depravity of Irish criminals, the coming together of politicians on all sides to create the CAB and pass the Proceeds of Crime Act was a high point in the political life of the country.  Despite differences between parties on so many issues, we were, as one, horrified by the viciousness of organised criminals, but quickly moved beyond rhetoric to a swift, effective and unified response.  It must be hard for her family and friends to be constantly reminded of their loss at times like this, but they can remember her with great pride as a journalist who took a stand against malevolent forces and who inspired the entire political class to concerted action.  Six weeks after her murder the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was enacted.  Two months after that the Criminal Assets Bureau Act was passed.  In doing so, the Oireachtas created an innovative model for depriving murderers and drug pedlars of the proceeds of their crimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_504"> Since 1996 our model for depriving criminals of the proceeds of their crime has been envied by many countries and has even been copied by some.  The CAB has retrieved hundreds of millions of euro in proceeds of crime, unpaid taxes and fraudulently obtained welfare payments.  It has been an undeniable success, even to the point of driving some gang leaders overseas, leaving other gang members here to run their criminal operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_505"> Recent months have seen those subordinates of the offshore drug barons bring murder to our streets in an unprecedented way.  Our response today must be as swift, effective and united as it was in 1996.  Working with local communities, the Criminal Assets Bureau and all law enforcement agencies, the Government and Parliament must again say "No" to the men of crime.  We must comprehensively reject their message of greed and misery, their subjugation of people with addictions, their attempts to terrorise localities, their nihilistic rejection of community, civilisation, order and the rule of law, and their violence.  Our message must be one that rejects all their wrongdoing and all that flows from it, but one which is a part of a positive and comprehensive message of hope and real practical support for the communities affected.</p>
          <p eId="para_506"> This Bill is part of the law enforcement element of that response, but we must go beyond law enforcement.  The Taoiseach and I, and other Government colleagues, held various meetings with community representatives from Dublin's north inner city in recent weeks to hear their concerns about the broader socioeconomic issues affecting the area.  The community representatives were very appreciative of the visible Garda presence in the area and sought reassurance about continuing resources for local policing, particularly community policing in the longer term. Other concerns raised related to tackling the scourge of drugs, including the illicit sale of prescription drugs, as well as early intervention programmes for children, educational disadvantage, job creation and apprenticeships in the area, improving the physical environment, social housing provision, and community development including family, youth and recreation activity.  The Taoiseach intends to establish a broader task force to address socioeconomic and community development issues in the north inner city. The outcome of those meetings helped inform the preparatory work on the proposed task force and we are determined to make progress on this in the near future. Of course, there are lessons for other areas as well in terms of dealing with similar issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_507"> Five weeks ago I secured the agreement of the Government to a package of measures to increase the pressure on organised criminals. The package includes the establishment of a special crime task force by An Garda Síochána which will have an ongoing and relentless focus on persons involved in gangland activities. The Government is committed to funding whatever measures are needed for An Garda Síochána to best tackle the critical and unprecedented challenges it faces and has recently approved additional funding of some €55 million for An Garda Síochána.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> There is already a wide range of strong legislation in place to deal with gangland activities. Deputies will be familiar with the Criminal Justice (Amendment) Act 2009 which brought forward provisions to respond to the reality of intimidation by criminal gangs; the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009 which provided for covert surveillance; the Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 which addressed the use of weapons; the Criminal Justice (Mutual Assistance) Act 2008 which was brought forward to enhance international co-operation; and the very important Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010. We now need new legislation focused, in particular, on the criminal proceeds held by gang members locally. Last week the House approved the reduction from €6,500 to €1,000 of the prescribed sum under section 38, under which cash suspected of being the proceeds of crime may be seized by gardaí or Revenue officers. The Bill which has been developed following consultation with the Garda Commissioner and the Chief Bureau Officer will help to improve the legislative powers we have available and gardaí on the front line. The Government approved the drafting of the Bill as a matter of urgency and I thank Members across the House and in the Seanad for their support for it. </p>
          <p eId="para_509"> The Bill has been quickly but carefully crafted to provide additional powers for the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, to target the proceeds of crime. The CAB has no power under the Proceeds of Crime Act to seize and detain the proceeds of crime without making an application to court. When we met members of the CAB and the Garda, they made this point and said they needed something stronger to deal with the issue. Section 2 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 allows for the CAB to make an <i>ex parte</i> application to the High Court for an interim order which can prohibit any person from disposing of or dealing with any property if the court is satisfied it constitutes the proceeds of crime. To seek such an order, the CAB must have marshalled all of the relevant evidence and be in position to establish that the property derives from criminal conduct. Given the level of scrutiny applied by the court to such an application, particularly as it is an <i>ex parte</i> application where only the applicant is heard by the court, this is a challenging task for the CAB. The new power will allow CAB officers to move quickly to seize property and they will have 21 days to prepare their court application. The Bill will also allow for the mid-level proceeds held by gang members to be targeted by reducing the threshold which applies under the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 from €13,000 to €5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_510"> The Bill is being brought forward as an urgent measure in order that these changes will be available to the CAB without delay. While Deputies may have other proposals for reform, I ask that such proposals not delay the rapid passage of the Bill but be considered as part of the wider review of the proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term.</p>
          <p eId="para_511"> The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 operates as a piece of civil law. The applications made under it to the High Court rely on the civil standard of proof, that is, the balance of probabilities. As the lawyers say, it operates <i>in rem</i>, not <i>in personam</i>, to target property, not persons. No finding is made on the guilt of a person, as happens in a criminal trial. Instead, a finding is made on whether property is the proceeds of crime. Provision is made for the belief of a Garda chief superintendent to be admitted as evidence. The Act allows for an interlocutory order to be made, where the court is satisfied, on the evidence from the CAB, that property is the proceeds of crime and, to an extent, shifts the onus to the respondent to disprove the case. The Act contains no criminal offences and no penal sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> Early on in its operation, the civil status of the Act was considered in litigation. In Murphy <i>v</i>. G. M. and Gilligan <i>v</i>. CAB the then Chief Justice, Mr. Justice Keane, noted that the legislation was "unquestionably draconian" and then addressed the key point of whether proceedings under the Act were civil or criminal in nature. Following an extensive review of the case law on the factors which differentiated criminal and civil actions, he found that the appellants had failed to establish that the Act amounted to criminal proceedings. It is possible to maintain the special provisions of the Act because they amount to civil proceedings. Any addition to the Act, therefore, must not tip the balance of the Act in order that they become criminal proceedings. It is for that reason that I emphasise the care which has been taken to ensure the Bill is not only constitutionally sound but also sustainable in the special civil context of the Proceeds of Crime Act. The Attorney General has not only reviewed its provisions herself but has also had external senior counsel consider it twice, first when the scheme was being developed and then when the final draft was being prepared. The Chief Bureau Officer and the bureau legal officer were also consulted on a number of occasions by my officials. I thank them for the urgent work they have done on the Bill. We consulted them to ensure their knowledge, experience and expertise would be brought to bear.</p>
          <p eId="para_513"> This is the other key reason I ask that more extensive proposals for change be considered as part of the wider review of proceeds of crime legislation which can deliver further reforms in the medium term. I would like all such proposals to undergo the same rigorous checking by my officials and the Attorney General's office and for the CAB to be consulted on them. The Proceeds of Crime Act has served us well for 20 years and been tested time and again in the courts. We want to be sure changes to what is carefully honed legislation do not blunt or break it in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_514"> Let me turn to the provisions of the Bill. The first sections deal with various definitions. Section 3 inserts new sections which provide for the administrative seizure and detention of property.</p>
          <p eId="para_515"> The new section 1A allows for the fact that, if a bureau officer is in a public or any other place, he or she is permitted to seize any property he or she has reasonable grounds for suspecting is the proceeds of crime. It is intended to provide for the seizure of the suspected proceeds of crime, both where the property is discovered opportunistically as part of general CAB operations and as part of a focused operation targeting particular suspected proceeds. The bureau officer must have reasonable grounds for suspecting that the property, in whole or in part, directly or indirectly, constitutes the proceeds of crime and is of a total value of not less than €5,000. Once these criteria are met, the bureau officer may seize and detain the property for up to 24 hours. This represents a serious interference with the property rights and potentially other rights of individuals, hence the need to limit the period in which it can have effect. Any further detention beyond 24 hours must meet the additional criteria set out in subsection (2) which allows the Chief Bureau Officer to authorise the further detention of the property for up to 21 days if the criteria outlined in paragraphs (a), (b), (c) and (d) are cumulatively met. The key purpose of the entire section is evident in paragraph (c) which is to allow the CAB time to prepare an interim or interlocutory application to the High Court. Subsection (3) requires the Chief Bureau Officer to give written notice to all affected persons unless he or she is satisfied that it is not reasonably possible to attain their whereabouts. The notice has to include the reasons for the authorisation and inform the person of the right to make an application under section 1B. Subsection (5) allows details, the disclosure of which might prejudice the investigation, to be withheld.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> The new section 1B outlines the protections for affected persons by allowing them to apply to the courts to vary or revoke an authorisation. The new section 1C provides for an application for compensation for losses incurred by the owner of a property if the CAB fails to apply for or obtain an interim order from the court. The Bill then outlines the relevant provisions which reduce the value of the property involved from €13,000 to €5,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_517"> The Bill received the strong support of the Seanad. That support is a sign of the unity of purpose we share in seeking to defeat crime and support the communities affected by it. It is an echo of the message sent from these Houses 20 years ago. The Criminal Assets Bureau carries that message in a practical way to those involved in organised crime by taking their illgotten property from them. I hope that today we can further equip the CAB for the new challenges it faces every day. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#JimOCallaghan" eId="spk_115">
          <from>Deputy Jim O'Callaghan<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T14:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_518">I welcome the legislation which has been brought to the House by the Minister. It was supported by Fianna Fáil in Seanad Éireann and we will also support it in this House. It is important to echo and emphasise what the Minister stated in her remarks about the importance of the Oireachtas sending out a strong united message to individuals involved in crime. This message will be sent out if we can get agreement on this legislation, get it passed, signed and brought into force before the recess.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> Legislation in many instances is a response to actual events that have happened. This is why it is always important to be able to look at legislation with the knowledge of the historical events that gave rise to it. Somebody who looks at the 1996 Acts on the Criminal Assets Bureau and on the proceeds of crime will not know what gave rise to their introduction. As we know, the Acts were introduced because of the terrible murder of journalist, Veronica Guerin. They were a united and effective response by the Oireachtas 20 years ago to what was a serious threat to people in our community as a result of organised drug trafficking and gangland crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> Similarly, this legislation has been introduced by the Minister as a response to actual events that have happened. The events to which the House seeks to respond in legislation are the terrible murders that have taken place in the city and beyond a result of an unacceptable gangland feud that has targeted individuals in those gangs but has also brought terror to very vulnerable communities in the city and beyond. It is extremely important that we, as an Oireachtas, send a united message in response to this.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The legislation brought forward by the Minister is effective in proposing one of the solutions to deal with the problems that have arisen as a result of gangland crime. We need to challenge these criminal activities in a multifaceted and varied way. The response we need is not just limited to amending the proceeds of crime legislation. We also need a response in terms of changing how the Garda polices, more effective Garda policing and greater resources.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> We also need education in respect of the issues driving these gangland feuds. The bedrock on which gangland crime is built is the drugs trade. We need to educate and remind young people and parents of the dangers of getting involved in taking drugs. Nothing good comes from individuals getting involved in and taking drugs. Sometimes we send out ambiguous messages to young people. We need to send out a strong message. We have strong messages about how it is unacceptable and dangerous for children and adults to use drugs which are legalised, such as alcohol and tobacco. We also need to have an education programme for young people about illegal drugs and the danger of using them. At present we do not have an education programme in this respect, which is something the House needs to consider.</p>
          <p eId="para_523"> Other responses to gangland crime must include changes to our criminal law to make it more effective. It is obvious, although it is regrettable, that our criminal law in certain instances finds it difficult to deal with gangland crime, where individuals who appear before our courts to give evidence against individuals involved in gangland crime face the threat of being killed or seriously injured. Our criminal law is able to deal with this but we must recognise there are threats to the effectiveness of our criminal law as a result of the extraordinary violence being used by certain individuals to protect their wealth and themselves. This is why the legislation introduced 20 years ago was so effective. It is not, as the Minister said, criminal law. It is, however, a change to the civil law. It provides that the proceeds of crime may be seized. What is proposed, we believe, is an effective and appropriate extension of the legislation which has been in existence for 20 years but which needs to be used more by the Criminal Assets Bureau.</p>
          <p eId="para_524"> When I was appointed as the Fianna Fáil Front Bench spokesperson on justice, the first visit Deputy Micheál Martin and I paid was to the communities in north inner city which, at the time, were extremely fearful of the ongoing gangland crime. The people there said to us, and I know they probably said the same to the Minister and the Taoiseach when they visited subsequently, and to other Deputies from the constituency who met local groups, that what they really wanted to see was a mini-CAB. They explained this term as wanting to be able to have in their communities an effective deterrent whereby individuals who are able to go around showing the proceeds and wealth of crime could have their assets seized by an administrative or judicial decision, provided it could be established that what they had was, in fact, the proceeds of crime. I am pleased to say the proposal contained in the legislation and in legislation which I drafted and sent to the Minister, and I commend her for considering it, provides for this mini-CAB because it reduces the minimum threshold at which proceeds can be seized from €13,000 to €5,000. This will have an impact in the areas where there are proceeds of crime and gives an opportunity for them to be seized, provided it can reasonably and accurately be established they are the proceeds of crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> One of the substantive and most interesting sections of the Bill put forward by the Minister is the change whereby if the law is passed we will have a new power of seizure and detention of property. The purpose of this is that a bureau officer who encounters an individual and notices immediately the individual is in possession of property he or she believes is the proceeds of criminal activity and which exceeds €5,000 can be seized and held for a period of 24 hours. It is extremely important in the legislation we introduce to have measures and provisions in place to ensure these powerful and draconian statutory provisions are not abused. For this reason, the power is only given to a bureau officer to seize the property for 24 hours. After this, it can be held for a further of 21 days provided the chief bureau officer is satisfied there are reasonable grounds for suspecting it is the proceeds of criminal activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> There is also the safety mechanism that an application can be made to the court, which is the place where the rights of individuals are vindicated. I hope it will not occur but it is possible that individuals will have property wrongfully seized under the legislation. The protection and safety net is there because an application can be made to the court, which can make an order reversing what is provided for. It can also make an order paying compensation if it is shown to be the case the property was not the proceeds of crime and had been wrongfully confiscated.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> This is a very powerful tool and something that would be very useful for the Garda and the Criminal Assets Bureau. It is important the Criminal Assets Bureau is sufficiently resourced so the legislation is fully used to its potential. There is no point in the Oireachtas passing legislation which is then not used as effectively or fully as it can be.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The Minister mentioned in her speech that she wants to have a unified response from the Oireachtas and I hope and believe she will get it. However, she indicated there may be other proposals for reform in respect of proceeds of crime legislation and I welcome this. I note the Department has been conducting a review of proceeds of crime. This review needs to be expedited. It also needs to be expanded to hear opinions from others. A number of other proposals could be introduced in respect of legislation. We do not propose to table them by amendment now but they could be introduced to make the proceeds of crime legislation more effective. For instance, the Minister knows that at present a disposal order requires CAB to hold onto property for a period of seven years. I believe CAB would prefer if this were reduced to a lesser period. I know there are constitutional and legal concerns about reducing it too much below seven years but it is an issue we need to consider. I and, I am sure, Deputy O'Brien would be happy to engage with the Minister on this.</p>
          <p eId="para_529"> Another matter worth considering is that in Australia, which has similar legislation, the money seized is put into a confiscated assets account.</p>
          <p eId="para_530">The money that goes into the confiscated assets account is then used exclusively in communities which have been affected by drug use and criminal activity so that the people in those communities can see that money is being put back into the community and that the money is a consequence of, and derives from, the proceeds of crime which have been seized. I know that there is a hesitancy or reluctance on the part of the all too powerful Department of Finance and other associated Departments to allow separate funds that go into the Exchequer to go into separate funds. However, we need to consider doing so in respect of this legislation because it would be to the benefit of those communities if the proceeds of crime seized could be used exclusively in order to educate children in those communities about drugs and build better projects and provide better services in those communities. All these factors are important in ensuring that the threat of drugs to our communities is properly and adequately dealt with. As I said, however, we will support this legislation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JonathanOBrien" eId="spk_116">
          <from>Deputy Jonathan O'Brien<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T14:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_531">We will also support the quick passage of this legislation through the House. On Committee Stage in the Seanad, we tabled an amendment, which I will come back to in a minute, but it was ruled out of order. We have said previously that we will always support legislation which we feel is progressive and will deal with the issue of organised crime. For this reason, we supported the changes that the Minister brought forward the week before last, I think, regarding section 38 and were happy to do so. As a party, we will also support the changes being brought forward under the amendment to the Misuse of Drugs Act, even though I personally have some concerns about that legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> I take this opportunity to raise the issue of the proceeds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau because it is a bugbear of mine. I have always said that there is a need to show communities that the proceeds of crime are being pumped back into organisations in these communities where people have been the victims of these organised criminals who have devastated their communities. Currently, that is not the case; it goes into the central Exchequer and then may trickle back into communities through various Departments that fund local projects. For the sake of transparency, however, we should consider the possibility that those proceeds be allowed to be put directly back into communities, so that one can track what has been seized and what is being pumped back into local communities through funding. That was the aim of the amendment we tabled in the Seanad last week which I know was ruled out of order. I probably will not table an amendment on Committee Stage because it will be ruled out of order again and I do not want to waste anyone's time, considering that this legislation needs to be passed as quickly as possible. I know it is scheduled to come back before the House next Tuesday for a resumption of Second Stage but, with any luck, we may even finish Second Stage today, which would allow Committee Stage to be taken next week. </p>
          <p eId="para_533"> As part of the wider reforms that the Minister mentioned in her speech, we need to look at that element of the proceeds of crime which are confiscated. Over the past ten years or so, the proceeds have amounted to around €14 million. A sum of €14 million would go a long way to funding some of the front-line community and voluntary organisations which in recent years, because of the economic collapse, have had their funding drastically reduced. If there is an opportunity to try to show them solidarity in their daily fight in their local communities, we should consider that very seriously.</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> On the Bill itself, I know there were concerns about the lowering of the threshold. It is proposed to move the threshold from the ability of the court to seize assets to the ability of bureau officers to seize them once they are not below the limit of €5,000. They do not even need to see those assets during a search warrant. They can seize them if they see them on public display. There is a balance here between property rights and the constitutionality of the provision. I am glad that the Minister outlined in her speech that not only has the Attorney General considered this but that she has also got senior counsel to consider it. Senior counsel are satisfied, so we are happy with that analysis. That balancing act is needed so that a case is not transferred from civil to criminal. It is important to say that anyone who has his or her assets seized under this legislation is not necessarily guilty of a criminal offence. Only the courts can decide whether somebody is guilty of a criminal offence. There are also safeguards put in, as Deputy O'Callaghan has said, in subsections 1B and 1C of section 3. Subsection 1B allows somebody to make an application to the court to revoke an order which has been made previously after the 21 days. Subsection 1C also allows that individual to receive compensation if an interlocutory order has not been made or has failed when the application has been made to the court, which is also an important provision. As Deputy O'Callaghan said, I hope we do not see any case in which a person has goods seized and then, eventually, when it gets to a court order within that 21-day period, the court decides that the assets were not the proceeds of crime. However, there is always that possibility, so it is important to have those safeguards in the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> It is proposed to lower the threshold to €5,000, which is pretty low. I can see the rationale and the reasoning behind it. I am sure every Deputy in this Chamber represents, as I do, a constituency in which there is huge deprivation in some areas. One of the most frustrating things for law-abiding citizens in those communities is to see the local drug dealer or organised criminal driving around in flashy cars and dripping with gold jewellery. For young people growing up and seeing that, sometimes it can be an incentive for them to get involved in criminality because they see these individuals in their gold chains and driving around in their flashy cars and they aspire to have that type of wealth. Unfortunately, when one is dealing with communities ravaged by deprivation, and there are not many economic opportunities for young people, some individuals will go down that path of criminality. Anything that helps prevent that is to be welcomed. I think this legislation will help to prevent it because now, if a local person is engaged in criminal activity and is driving around in his flashy car, he needs to be put on notice that flashy car will be confiscated from him at the side of the road and will be taken from him for 24 hours, with the possibility that it will be taken for 21 days and a further possibility that it will be confiscated for good. Therefore, the days of local criminals being able to flash their wealth around the place, I hope, will be addressed by this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_536"> The only other area I want to touch on very briefly is that of racial profiling. We do not have racial profiling legislation in this State. I am not saying that this will happen but we have to safeguard against it happening. There have been cases where members of the Roma community and the Traveller community have been racially profiled in the past. I do not want to see a situation where somebody, just because he or she is from a minority community or the Traveller community, is targeted because of his or her ethnicity. I hope that does not happen, and I think it is very unlikely to happen, but we need to safeguard against it in case it does happen. We cannot have a situation where somebody is targeted because he or she may drive around in a nice car or might have a nice trailer and is from a particular ethnic background. I do not know whether the Minister can address that in an amendment or whether it is the case that we have to implement the legislation in a commonsense fashion. I hope that the latter would be the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">I do not want anybody to be racially profiled under the legislation. It is being proposed for a very particular reason, namely, to target people involved in criminality and who are decimating local communities. For this reason, we support it.</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> I have not yet made up my mind about the amendment on Committee Stage. I do not see the value in proposing it, given that it will be ruled out of order. In 2003, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, of the Minister's party, brought forward a Bill to allow the proceeds from CAB to be redirected to local drugs task forces. We need to have this conversation as part of the wider reform. If we are asking communities to co-operate with us and to see the value of legislation, which we know will help them, there must be a clear line of sight. There must be a transparent connection between the confiscation of assets from the local drug dealer or organised criminal and the money being put back into the community to help educate people and prevent them from going down the wrong path.</p>

          <from>Deputy Brendan Howlin<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T14:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_539">I am very happy to have the opportunity to speak on the Bill. With one or two caveats, my party and I strongly support the Bill and will vote for it. We agree with the proposal to reduce the threshold value of property subject to removal from €13,000 to €5,000. We also agree with the new short-term administrative power of seizure and detention at CAB officer level envisaged. We have all had discussions with local communities on the matter and the strongest demand or requirement from the community groups we met was that there be a "mini CAB" to address the frustration and almost provocation of seeing people, as Deputy Jonathan O'Brien said, parading around with no visible means but dripping with material goods.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> The Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 was the initiative of the rainbow Government, of which I was privileged to be a member. It was probably brought about, more than anything, in response to the brutal murder of Veronica Guerin. The Act and its sister Act, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, brought in by former Deputy Ruairí Quinn, has been heavily litigated in the courts and has survived robust challenges during the intervening 20 years. The system of civil restraint and forfeiture of assets which we introduced back then has been adopted in other jurisdictions, as the Tánaiste said. It has proven to be a genuinely effective weapon in our response, which we always must be thinking of improving, to the threat of organised crime.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> The vital aspect of CAB is that a conviction for an offence is not a precondition for a confiscation order. This was the new departure which was embarked upon 20 years ago. CAB uses purely civil procedure. A former legal officer of CAB put it well when he said its fundamental purpose is "disruption and discouragement", rather than enforcement in a criminal law way. The current proposal to reduce the threshold value of property is a direct response to the calls which many of us have heard to address the new phenomenon that is so evident in some communities across the country and I welcome it.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> The Bill comes to us from the Seanad. My colleague in the Seanad had sought to make amendments there, as the Tánaiste knows. As other Deputies have touched on, one amendment proposed was the dedication of the proceeds of crime seized by CAB to investment in areas of social or economic deprivation. If I were still speaking from the Government benches, I would be strongly briefed by my former Department officials to oppose such a motion.</p>

          <p eId="para_544">It is the Merrion Street way. The notion of hypothecated taxes, as they call them, is anathema to them. When I was Minister for the Environment 20 years ago I wanted to ring-fence a particular income source for local government. I had to do a side deal with former Deputy Ruairí Quinn and bring it directly to the Cabinet without going through consultation, given that bureaucracy would have killed it off. I am sure things have improved immeasurably since then. I understand it, having been in a Department for the past five years. One cannot have a situation in which taxes are ring-fenced. While the plastic bag tax worked and is used for environmental purposes, it is a small sum of money. If we had ring-fenced taxes all over the shop, we would not be able to do joined-up government.</p>
          <p eId="para_545"> However, in this instance, there is a very coherent and cogent reason to allow it to happen. I would return to the colleagues in both Departments housed in Merrion Street and tell them there is a consensus view in the House. When the most vulnerable communities see criminals being stripped of their ill-gotten gains, if there were a direct benefit to them from it in education funds, better social provision, better play facilities or whatever, it would be a double merit.</p>
          <p eId="para_546"> It may be true that areas with severe social and economic deprivation generate more crime, at least the sort of crime that attracts most public attention. We do not always draw attention to the white-collar crime that exists in some suburbs, which we do not notice as readily. It is also true that people living in the most deprived areas are also the people most likely to be the victims of crime. Drug crime, alcohol abuse, public order offences and anti-social behaviour make life misery for many citizens living in all our areas, but particularly the areas that are least well-equipped to respond effectively to such offences. I have said here before there is insufficient appreciation at political or senior Garda level of the corrosive effect on communities besieged by anti-social behaviour. The last time I was an Opposition spokesperson on justice I tried to focus on it. In many ways, anti-social behaviour impacts more on people's quality of life than any other criminal activity. Our most marginalised communities have particularly suffered in their quality of life due to lawlessness, vandalism and anti-social behaviour.</p>
          <p eId="para_547"> Confronted with the true scale of the problems which face communities, the temptation is to blame others or reach for a quick fix solution. However, it is not just an issue of bail, sentencing or the need for ever more criminal laws. Practitioners tell us we have enough law; the way to reduce crime is by enforcement of law and looking beyond the law for the other supports the communities need. We need to tackle the phenomenon of criminal, anti-social and anti-community activity directly and on the ground. Dedicating resources to it from CAB resources would be a good start.</p>
          <p eId="para_548"> What we are experiencing is, to a large extent, a consequence of decades of underinvestment in or neglect of some of our areas. As I have done previously, I confess my own part in this. During the past five years, we did not do enough for vulnerable areas. While we need a legislative response - this is what the Bill is - we need more, and that is why I raised the issue of the north inner city task force with the Tánaiste on the Order of Business this morning. I hope it is up and running before the end of the Dáil term.</p>
          <p eId="para_549"> At least equally importantly, we need a policing response that is drawn up in co-operation and agreement with the communities whose neighbourhoods so badly need effective policing. The relationship between the Garda Síochána and some local communities is not good, as the Tánaiste will acknowledge.</p>
          <p eId="para_550">In some areas it is deteriorating. We need to rebuild confidence in the relationship between police and community. We need to establish community structures, with a degree of control over Garda policy at community level. In short, we need to reconnect policing with communities. That is simple to say and challenging to do. We have - we all have met them - excellent members of An Garda Síochána, both at junior and more senior level, who understand what needs to be done in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> An important aspect of the policing response is to ensure that the policing service is modernised in terms of technology, operation and management. The Tánaiste will be aware of my views on these matters. Are the Garda Inspectorate reports being implemented? I hope they are. Is there still a commitment to act on the myriad of recommendations that we discussed over recent months?</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Will we, to take the most relevant example, see the establishment of a Garda serious and organised crime unit to tackle criminal networks? We need to see it happening. The Garda Inspectorate describes this as providing an agile multi-disciplined investigation team to follow the criminal, not just the crime type. They complained in an earlier report that there was very little clarity about what some of the national units do and do not investigate. They said that there was too much duplication and not enough clarity. They say that there were opportunities to amalgamate functions and units to create clearer protocols about what crimes each unit is tasked to investigate and they say that the formation of a serious and organised crime unit would allow several current units to come together, reduce overlap and provide more resilience for the long-term investigations required in some instances. Perhaps the Tánaiste, in her reply, can tell us if this repeated recommendation has been accepted and when will we see this unit established.</p>
          <p eId="para_553"> We are all agreed we need a socioeconomic response. We talked about that in this House. There is much anger, frustration and annoyance at community level and not only in the north inner city. Deputy Jonathan O'Brien would instance parts of his own constituency and we all could different parts of the country. Alongside that anger, there is a willingness to be involved in resolution. People have enormous energy. They want their communities, their streets, their parks and their cities and towns to function and to underpin rather than diminish the quality of life of their own people.</p>
          <p eId="para_554"> This enormous resource must be included in both framing and delivering solutions, such as those underway in the north inner city. That is why I place so much emphasis on the task force that I pursued, initially with the Taoiseach and, up to today, with the Tánaiste, and it is against that backdrop that I invite the Tánaiste to reconsider and go back and fight, as I know the Tánaiste can do effectively, with the Minister for Finance and whoever else the notion of ring-fencing the proceeds of crime to be demonstrably used to tackle deprivation. Crime has heaped further affliction on already blighted areas. It would be a visible sign of good intent and a practical commitment if the accumulated proceeds of crime could be used to physically reinvest in communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_555"> My colleague, Senator Bacik, proposed in the other House another amendment to this Bill on our party's behalf. It is slightly convoluted since it sought to reference a change in the law which is well signalled but which has not yet been made. It is trying to be prescient. At present, soliciting in a public place, either by a client or by a prostitute, is unlawful but the act of buying or selling sex is not unlawful. The published proposal that I understand the Government is proceeding with is that in future, the purchase of sex will be unlawful but the sale of sex will not, but criminalising the purchase of sexual services has one peculiar consequence that, perhaps, has not been thought about. The purchase money will become the proceeds of crime, the crime committed by the purchaser under this new offence because we will make it an offence to purchase sexual favours. It will be caught because the proceeds of crime is defined under the legislation that we are amending today as meaning any property obtained or received by or as a result of or in connection with the commission of an offence. The payment for sexual services will be received by the prostitute as a result of an offence committed by the client.</p>
          <p eId="para_556"> It seems that this new reality has produced a somewhat schizophrenic response on behalf of the authorities. There is an agreement across the House that many prostitutes are victims of exploitation and criminalising these women is wrong. The alternative approach, of criminalising the clients while ensuring that women selling sexual services are not criminalised, has largely been met with approval. If we have a situation where the money received by prostitutes is now a criminal asset, it can be seized and, while I do not have time to elaborate on it, there have been cases where that has been used in an exploitative way by An Garda Síochána. We need to rethink the matter because, as somebody put it to me, we might be taking women out of the prison cell but putting them into the poor house. That might not be the best response.</p>
          <p eId="para_557"> I am conscious that my time has expired. We will have a chance on Committee Stage to develop these matters in more detail. I welcome this Bill and look forward to its speedy enactment.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JamesLawless" eId="spk_120">
          <from>Deputy James Lawless<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T14:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_558">I welcome the Bill and I understand the situation which it seeks to address. It amends a well-established Act, the Proceeds of Crime Act which, as has been mentioned, has been in operation for perhaps 20 years. I also understand the imperative of a speedy passage through this House and I will give my full support to it, as my colleague, Deputy O'Callaghan, outlined.</p>
          <p eId="para_559"> However, I want to reflect the fact that the sanctions proposed are all of a pre-trial nature and, indeed, as has been said, are civil rather than criminal in nature. We must not lose focus on the imperative of the criminal justice system being sufficiently resourced and the Garda having the investigative powers and the resources to do the job it needs to do and go through the full rigours of the criminal justice system in the pursuit of crime. While the measures in the Bill are necessary and imperative, they are not a substitute for full detection, investigation and going to trial, as is required.</p>
          <p eId="para_560"> It is important to consider that those subject to or targeted by this legislation have not been found guilty of any crime. The presumption of innocence is, of course, a fundamental principle of the criminal justice system. While I recognise and support the imperative of the Bill, I welcome the Minister's comments at the outset that there will be a wider review in due course of the Proceeds of Crime Acts. That is wise. This is not the time to do it but, as that arises, there are checks and balances that could be introduced to augment, support and enhance what has being proposed to date. I will touch on some of those briefly.</p>
          <p eId="para_561"> In the context of that broader review, I have a couple of observations, queries and suggestions to the Minister and to the Department that they may take on board. The composition of the Criminal Assets Bureau is part civilian and part gardaí. There are a number of officers drawn from different arms of Revenue, Social Protection and the Garda. It is not apparent, at any rate it is not clear to me, what is the relationship say, with GSOC or the Policing Authority, and whether there may be some lines of communication or lines of reporting provided for in that context. It may be something that can be returned to, not at this stage and not in this Bill, but when that wider consideration takes place in due course.</p>
          <p eId="para_562"> Along the same lines, while we understand the imperative of it, there are other pieces of legislation of a similar nature which would have checks and balances in place in the form of review. Of course, such provisions have not been without controversy.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I allude, for example, to the Criminal Justice (Surveillance) Act 2009, which contains measures that provide for a review to be conducted at certain stages of the operation of the legislation with respect to how it is performing. A five-year review is built into the Defamation Act. Every five years, the Minister initiates a review of the operation of the legislation to consider if its implementation is successful, if changes are required and if simple checks and balances are in place. I understand the European Convention on Human Rights Act has a similar provision. I believe a report on its operation is laid before the House on an annual basis. It would be useful to have a similar measure in this case to ensure good governance and best practice, not for now but for down the line.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> Those are some suggestions in terms of the wider context of the legislation, which I support. This issue has ravaged communities and nothing frustrates people more than seeing people blatantly flouting the law and benefiting from it openly within their communities. That is a problem which must be tackled. It was tackled successfully by CAB, which has had many successes in the past 20 years. With those few caveats, I wish the Bill a speedy passage through the House, hopefully before the recess. It is welcome and necessary legislation and on a future date, we might return to the points I made.</p>

          <p eId="para_566">I congratulate the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on his appointment. I did not have an opportunity to say that earlier. On behalf of the Minister, I would like to thank all Deputies who contributed to this debate and welcome the support expressed for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Crime, in particular organised crime, is a cause of deep concern to all of us and to people across the country. All Members of the House can look to our work here today and say we are doing our part as legislators. We are providing the Criminal Assets Bureau, CAB, with the legislative powers it needs to tackle organised criminals.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> For its part, the Government is committed to providing the resources to tackle crime wherever and however it occurs. We are investing in vehicles, technology and new legislation but, most importantly, in people. In addition to the €5 million previously announced in February, a further €50 million is to be provided in 2016, €15 million of which is to come from projected savings in the justice and equality sector, with the balance coming from the Exchequer. This funding is being made available to maintain the necessary policing response to the current situation on an ongoing basis. This will allow for concentrated policing targeting of gang-related crime, in particular; continued targeting of burglaries and related crime via Operation Thor; and continued support for measures against terrorism.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> A new Garda special crime task force is being established under the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau. It will augment the response to organised crime at a local level through concentrated policing and through a multi-agency approach to targeting the proceeds of crime. The Garda Commissioner will have oversight of the task force and its operations. The task force will be sustained for as long as is necessary and it will adapt to the prevailing organised crime situation at local level. It is expected to be operational by the end of the year, with approximately 50 people contributing to its work. There will be a core of dedicated officers working under the auspices of the Drugs and Organised Crime Bureau as well as staff from the Criminal Assets Bureau and divisional asset profilers.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> I can assure the House that the Minister is committed to making sure the necessary resources are made available to the Criminal Assets Bureau from within the available public finances. Budget levels for the bureau have been maintained over recent years. The resources made available to the bureau are kept under ongoing review by both the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Department of Justice and Equality.</p>
          <p eId="para_571"> Arising from the establishment of the special crime task force, some additional resource requirements have been identified by the bureau and progress is being made in addressing this. As I said, the matter will be kept under review by both the bureau and the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_572"> A dedicated armed support unit, ASU, for the Dublin area is in the process of being set up and trained. Pending full establishment of the new unit, arrangements have been put in place so that armed support is being provided on an overtime basis.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> Underpinning all of these measures is the Government’s intention to increase Garda numbers to 15,000. While in the short term substantial funds are being made available for overtime, measures are being considered to accelerate the planned Garda recruitment programme, along with the recruitment of further civilian and specialist staff.</p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I listened with interest to the suggestions Deputies had for other amendments which could be made to the Proceeds of Crime Acts. In the Minister’s opening remarks, she explained the need for the measures contained in this Bill to be enacted without delay to give the Criminal Assets Bureau the power to seize property quickly and to target the assets of lower level gang members. She also noted the delicate balance of the Proceeds of Crime Act as non-penal legislation. While the proposals for further amendments put forward today cannot be readily taken on board in the timeframe with which we all wish to see this Bill enacted, they can be considered as part of the wider review of the legislation in the medium term, as Deputy Lawless alluded to earlier.</p>
          <p eId="para_575"> This Bill will empower the CAB to move quickly to seize property and detain it for three weeks. It will give it the time it needs to prepare an application to the court. The proceeds of crime of moderate value, which were previously out of reach, will now be captured by the Proceeds of Crime Act. This Bill forms part of a wider Government response to the recent acute problems of organised crime. The response is comprehensive and will be sustained.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> Deputy Howlin mentioned the area of sexual services. There is a concern that proposal could have negative implications for persons who offer sexual services and offer an opportunity for those who would exploit the law and exploit those who are vulnerable. For instance, the exemption of the purchase of sexual services from criminal conduct for the purpose of proceeds of crime could lead to sex workers being pressurised into holding moneys as legitimate fronts for pimps, traffickers and other organised criminals. It might also make it more difficult for the CAB to pursue proceeds of crime held by pimps or traffickers. These are matters that need to be considered further.</p>
          <p eId="para_577"> The response in this Bill is comprehensive and will be sustained. It includes law enforcement measures, investing in policing, new legislative powers and the deployment of specialist units but it also addresses the socioeconomic issues and investment in services to support resilient local communities. This response is being further developed in partnership with those local communities and everyone, including the Oireachtas, the Government, local representatives and local communities, has a part to play in defeating crime and tackling the factors that allow crime to develop. We will achieve more by working together in this way than we could ever achieve alone. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

            <p eId="para_592"> The national broadband plan is a priority for the Government. The plan is being delivered through a combination of investment by telecommunications operators and a State intervention in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming. This is reflected in the high-speed broadband map at <i>www.</i><i>broadband.gov.ie</i><i>. </i>The area marked blue on the map is where commercial providers have previously indicated plans to deliver high-speed broadband services. These represent 1.6 million premises.  The area marked amber is the State intervention area and represents more than 750,000 premises. Individuals can check whether their premises is in a blue or amber area by entering their address or Eircode. They can also e-mail the Department, quoting their Eircode, at <i>broadband@dcenr.gov.ie.</i></p>
            <p eId="para_593"> Last week, I announced that a further 170,000 premises will need to be covered by the State intervention.  Further analysis is being undertaken by my Department to identify the exact location of these premises and to adjust the high-speed broadband map. The Department has moved to the next stage of the procurement process and three qualifying bidders will commence dialogue with the Department next week.  This will be followed by the issue of final tender documents.  The current schedule envisages contracts being awarded by June 2017.  The timing of each stage of the procurement is dependent on several factors, including the complexities that may be encountered during the process. Once contract or contracts are in place, a prioritisation programme will be put in place in consultation with the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht. A detailed roll-out plan for the network will be published and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is establishing regional action groups, working with local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies to help accelerate the broadband network build.</p>
            <p eId="para_594"> In line with European Union state aid rules, the process must be "technology neutral".  Bidders will be asked to propose solutions which meet the national broadband plan service requirements, which will include a separate solution for businesses and evidence that the network will be future-proofed to meet the ongoing demands and keep pace with developments elsewhere in the market.  It is recognised that a significant fibre build will be required, regardless of the technology used to provide services to individual premises.  Once the successful bidder or bidders are chosen, the technology to be deployed will be made clear.</p>

            <p eId="para_595">As indicated, the Minister intends seeking a solution that provides a minimum of 30 Mbps for the connection speed. Europe has set a target of having a baseline of 30 Mbps connection speed across member states by 2020. It is now clear we will not meet that target as the indication is the national broadband plan will not be rolled out fully until 2022. Does the Minister believe, in light of this, that it might be better to jump ahead to what the European Commission has indicated is the premier benchmark, which is 100 Mbps connection speed by 2020? Rather than going for the baseline, could we be a bit ambitious as we will miss the base deadline anyway? I put to the Minister that he consider in his discussions with the three potential bidders that the 2020 target should be the premium benchmark, as established by the Commission, of 100 Mbps. We might dispense with the underachievement of the level now being spoken about.</p>

            <p eId="para_596">The Deputy's initial question relates to the amending of the blue areas on the map. We announced last week that we would include another 170,000 homes and premises in this. We were given a commitment by the commercial operators which, in fairness, have put a significant amount of money - approximately €2 billion over the past four years - into rolling out the network. Nevertheless, it was clear that most of the approximately 170,000 premises identified by us as in the blue area might have had fibre passing the head of the road but the homes would not be able to get 30 Mpbs broadband. For example, it could be that the exchange is within 1 km as the crow flies but the copper wire could go in a circuitous route. That means the premises would not get those speeds. These are mainly areas within the vicinity of towns and we do not see an additional cost being involved as the build-out will already be taking place.</p>
            <p eId="para_597"> We could have a significant amount of the rural areas covered in time for the EU objective for 2020. I will not commit to a threshold of 2020 until the contractor or contractors are appointed but from what we are told, many of them seem to be determined to get this rolled out far quicker than we envisage. I do not want to promise people they will get broadband by a specific date but it is not achieved. Deputy Dooley and everybody else knows that we, in rural Ireland, are sick and tired of being promised dates for high-speed broadband only for it not to happen.</p>
            <p eId="para_598"> On the question of whether the 30 Mbps threshold should be increased to 100 Mbps, we picked 30 Mbps as the minimum required. We have indicated that a higher threshold is required for businesses, which are scattered right across rural Ireland. The solutions put forward by the three preferred bidders are likely to involve much higher speeds than the minimum threshold. It is important that the public understands that currently, there are operators promising up to 100 Mbps but, in reality, the speeds available are dramatically lower. We are saying that 99.95% of the time, people will get a minimum of 30 Mbps. That is a significant threshold and on top of that, businesses will require a much higher threshold. In reality, speeds will be significantly higher. There is a mechanism in the way the contract is structured to review this threshold every three to five years if the requirements exist for higher speeds. That will come about over the 25-year contract.</p>

            <p eId="para_599">I accept the Minister's amenable approach to my request but the facts remain that the legal document will request a minimum of 30 Mbps. I accept that contractors are capable of delivering higher speeds but does it not make sense to request what is ultimately required rather than making it something that is nice to have or an option that will probably be taken? The truth is that all they will deliver is the minimum speed with the capacity to scale in time. My concern - I am sure it is shared by the Minister because of his understanding of rural Ireland, which nobody could question - is that we must ensure the people in the rural area covered by this scheme have exactly the same capacity to remain in step with people in the more densely populated areas, where there is greater competition and higher speeds can be delivered much more cheaply. If we are putting in resources now, let us force the companies to deliver the higher speed. Even if the Minister indicated the minimum would be 30 Mbps at the beginning before setting a target by which they had to reach 100 Mbps, I would find some solace in it. We must push the contractors and there is only one opportunity to do that, which is before they sign up.</p>

            <p eId="para_600">The European Commission target of delivering 30 Mbps by 2020 is non-binding. Nevertheless, I hear what the Deputy is saying and he is making a strong point.</p>
            <p eId="para_601">In fairness, there is unanimity in this House. We might disagree on some minor aspects regarding it but there is unanimity in the House that we need to get this rolled out quickly and that it is future-proofed in terms of the requirements. A tendering process is currently under way. We want to see the highest possible speeds available in the shortest possible time in as many communities as possible. It is our intention to make sure that when the network is being rolled out, it is to every county simultaneously. It is not a case that because Roscommon has the largest proportion of the population which requires high-speed broadband, it will be first or because Monaghan has the second highest proportion, it will be second.</p>
            <p eId="para_602"> Coincidentally, the two Ministers who are in charge of delivery of this programme come from Roscommon and Monaghan. We are determined, as is every Member of this House, whether from an urban area or a rural area, to roll out a network that is future-proofed and which meets the current and future requirements of home owners and businesses. I am taking note of the Deputy's comments.</p>

            <p eId="para_606">I thank Deputy Stanley for the question. The programme for Government contains a specific commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects. The White Paper on energy policy published in December 2015 also includes a commitment to introduce a new renewable electricity support scheme designed to encourage the development of Ireland's abundant, diverse and indigenous renewable energy resources, including solar photovoltaic technology.</p>
            <p eId="para_607"> It is widely recognised that solar photovoltaic, PV, technology has become more cost effective for electricity generation over the past few years not only compared to other renewables such as wind energy but also compared with conventional forms of generation. With these significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar PV technology in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets and support economic growth and jobs. It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar PV technology has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_608"> The REFIT, Renewable Energy Feed In Tariff, electricity support schemes are the principal means of supporting renewable electricity generators for renewable energy exported to the grid. These schemes support electricity generated from a range of renewable sources, including small scale hydro, biomass and wind. Small scale renewable micro-generation is eligible to apply for support under the REFIT schemes. My Department is currently undertaking in-depth economic analysis to inform the cost of a new renewable electricity support scheme. While no decision has yet been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, and the appropriate level of tariffs are still under consideration, the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies, including solar PV technology, is being assessed.</p>
            <p eId="para_609"> Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year. Before these details are announced, my Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to input into the design of the new scheme.  Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and state aid clearance by the European Commission.</p>

            <p eId="para_610">I thank the Minister for his reply. Under the public service obligation, PSO, the current projection is that nearly 3,000 MW of renewable energy will receive €335 million in support in 2016-2017 while only 250 MW of fossil fuel will receive €140 million. The fossil fuel industry benefitted from €386 million in subsidies in 2015. That includes the PSO and the fuel allowance scheme. We support the fuel allowance scheme but we need to transfer that and move it on to renewables. When one considers these figures, it is €11,000 per megawatt for renewable power and €56,000 per megawatt for fossil fuel which is five times as much per megawatt. There is no support or subsidy in the State currently, of which I am aware, for solar energy. Wind, biomass, anaerobic digestion, hydro and biogas all receive feed tariffs but solar does not. Solar is the only established renewable technology to not benefit. It is a technology that is most suited to community and local participation with small ownership by local individual farmers or co-operatives. As a result, the solar energy industry is practically non-existent. Compare the situation to that which exists in Germany where 1.5 million German people generate solar energy from their own properties. I ask the Minister to take this consideration on board.</p>
          </speech>
          <speech by="#DenisNaughten" eId="spk_140" as="#Minister_for_Communications,_Energy_and_Natural_Resources">
            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T15:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_611">I understand the point being made by Deputy Stanley. As he is aware, a large part of the fossil fuel PSO is close to my heart, namely, peat fired energy generation in our three midland power stations. In fairness, I believe it is only because a predecessor of mine, Mary O'Rourke, happened to be in this job, we would not have those three peat fired power stations in the State. The intention is to convert those stations over to biomass and I am working quite closely with Coillte, Bord na Móna and the ESB in that regard and we hope to make progress. Bord na Móna has already given the commitment to be out of electricity generation with peat as a feed stock by the end of the next decade.</p>
            <p eId="para_612"> The issue is the PSO and at the last Question Time, Deputy Stanley's colleagues, as well as Members on the opposition benches, gave me a lot of grief over the cost of the PSO to consumers. In regard to the last analysis done in 2015 by KPMG on the cost of solar PV in Ireland, while the costs of solar have come down significantly, it is now costing in nearly €150 per megawatt. Wind costs €69.72 per megawatt for a large wind farm while it costs €72.16 for a small wind farm. Hydro costs €88 per megawatt. Under REFIT 3 biomass combustion costs €89 per megawatt and small biomass, in a combined heat and power system, costs €147 per megawatt. That is probably more congenial to communities getting involved in energy generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_613"> The problem has been that solar was far too expensive to produce up to now. However, the costs are coming down and I had a meeting last month with some manufacturers in China which are driving down the costs even further. Solar will definitely be part of the new scheme but exactly how that will be structured will have to be weighed up against meeting the targets which must be achieved and in finding a balance so that consumers are not paying an excessive PSO.</p>
            <p eId="para_614">That is a fine line which must be drawn and I am being rightly criticised that there is no support for the solar energy industry because the Commission for Energy Regulation is increasing the price of the PSO to consumers. In this regard I see exactly where Deputy Stanley is coming from. The challenge is about trying to strike the right balance.</p>

            <p eId="para_616">In regard to the PSO for the power stations, I recognise that reality. Until such time as we can supply them with biomass we have what we have. On the issue of the cost of solar, some people in the industry would question it. Other countries have more sunshine than Ireland and do not need sophisticated systems to get the benefit. We do have substantial sunshine and we have substantial potential. That area has not received enough attention from Government and the Department in the past.</p>
            <p eId="para_617"> The Minister of State is a fresh pair of hands in the job. He will receive the reports from his civil servants and the wind industry. I ask him to be his own person in regard to this issue. There are good examples of its success in London. London does not have that much more sunshine than Ireland. I lived in Edinburgh which is not the sunniest place in the world and it is much colder than here in winter. We should look at the examples from those areas to see how they do it. At the Select Committee on Communications, Climate Change and Natural Resources this morning the Minister of State mentioned the example of Scotland. That is one of the issues he might discuss with them. We need to keep this issue to the fore and to broaden it out. There will not be one or two large sources, there will be thousands of generation plants, small, medium and large, in ten to 20 years' time.</p>

            <p eId="para_620">The difficulty with the UK model is that the level of subsidy involved has been significant. As a result the UK has dramatically reduced the level of subsidy for renewable energy so it is not actually a good model. I think there are good models abroad and we need to be open to those. I am open-minded to all of the technologies.</p>
            <p eId="para_621"> The Deputy is correct when he says there will be a range of solutions. I do not think we should put all our eggs in one basket. If the industry can come forward with better figures than those I will be open to them. Recently, the industry has been engaging with my officials in the Department who are working on the new support scheme. Given that we are talking about the issue of peat and the semi-State company that is close to both our hearts, Bord na Móna is exploring the co-locating of wind farms with solar farms to take account of the counter cyclical nature of these technologies. Wind is very strong during the short winter days and solar prevails during the longer summer days. Given that Ireland is so far north in relation to the hemisphere we have a significant amount of daylight. Daylight is what is important rather than sun. Perhaps the cost-benefit analysis needs to be tweaked to take account of that. I am open to the idea. I want to see different technologies being developed but I need to ensure I am not placing an unnecessary burden on consumers.</p>

            <p eId="para_624">Under the amended Competition Act 2002, proposed mergers or acquisitions meeting certain criteria must be notified to the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC. The CCPC must then examine the notification and decide if the merger may proceed on competition grounds. Media mergers which have received the CCPC's determination to proceed must also be notified to me as Minister. </p>
            <p eId="para_625"> Upon notification, a phase 1<i> </i>examination of the merger is carried out by my Department. This examination is guided by the relevant criteria laid out in the legislation and by the Guidelines on Media Mergers, both of which are available on my Department's website. Following this examination, I have three options under the legislation, which are to allow the merger to proceed, to allow the merger to proceed with conditions or to ask the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, to conduct a more in-depth or phase 2 examination of the proposed merger. If the latter is the case, then the BAI will provide me with a report detailing its recommendations on the matter. It is also possible for me, as Minister, to establish an advisory panel to provide an opinion to the BAI on the application of the relevant criteria to the media merger in question.</p>
            <p eId="para_626"> Following receipt of the BAI's report and recommendations, I must then make a decision either to allow the merger to proceed, to allow it to proceed with conditions or to refuse to grant my consent. I am aware that the case referred to by the Deputy is being considered by the CCPC, however it would not be appropriate for me to provide further comment at this time until the process is completed.</p>

            <p eId="para_629">I acknowledge the work of the Minister of State on broadband since taking office. Another issue I wish to discuss is the lack of mobile telephone coverage. There are very serious issues, in particular, in rural Ireland where mobile telephone coverage has reduced considerably in recent months instead of progressing. Masts have been taken down in several parts of west Cork, leaving areas without any mobile telephone coverage. I would appreciate if the Minister of State would comment.</p>

            <p eId="para_630">Telecommunications service providers operate in a fully liberalised market under licences provided by ComReg. The management of the radio spectrum is a statutory function of ComReg. Notwithstanding the independence of ComReg, I am critically aware of the frustration currently being experienced across Ireland, where mobile networks are not always delivering the services people expect. There are a variety of reasons for this. Data usage in Ireland has increased by 500% in the last five years; current 3G and 4G upgrades have resulted in temporary outages in some areas; there are planning and siting issues for mobile masts and antenna; there are issues with the performance of individual handsets and particularly smart phones; and there is the issue of in-house insulation.</p>
            <p eId="para_631"> The telecommunications sector has invested over €2 billion in the past four years, in modernising networks including significant upgrades to 3G and 4G services. Notwithstanding this investment, the programme for Government recognises the ongoing frustration of consumers with the quality of mobile telephone and broadband services. In line with the programme for Government my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, and I will establish a mobile telephone and broadband task force in the coming weeks. This will consider immediate measures to address telecommunications deficits in rural Ireland. The task force will involve a number of Departments and agencies, as well as engagement with ComReg and telecommunications operators. I encourage members who have suggestions to submit them to me. I have received some very useful submissions and contributions from Members of this House. Measures arising from the task force will be implemented by the Government as a matter of priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_632">I expect we will bring these proposals to Government before the end of 2016 on foot of the task force's report.</p>
            <p eId="para_633"> Under the programme for Government, the Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, is also establishing two regional action groups. Working with local authorities, local enterprise offices, Leader groups and other relevant agencies, these groups will help to accelerate the roll out of broadband and mobile telecoms services at local level.</p>

            <p eId="para_634">I welcome the news of the establishment of this task force but a recent merger of two major mobile phone companies in this country will result in a loss of 880 masts. That is a serious loss, especially in rural communities. I ask that the Minister urge ComReg to step in to stop the taking down of those masts. One company had 1,880 and the other had 1,300, totalling more than 3,100. Now there will be a loss of 880, which is incredible. There has been a major loss of mobile reception and people who were experiencing difficulties in quite a number of areas prior to this, now have no mobile reception. West Cork, in particular, has been hit very badly. I refer to places such as Corran, Skibbereen, Bantry, Kilbrittain, Bandon and the towns throughout that region. It has not only impacted on one area, the three peninsulas of Mizen, Sheep's Head and Beara have also been hit. I presume the experience has been the same in other parts of rural Ireland. I urge the Minister to get ComReg to step in to stop this. There are planning issues around erecting masts but existing masts are now been taken down.</p>

            <p eId="para_635">The Minister, Deputy Humphreys, is establishing two regional action groups. These new structures at both national and local levels are designed to address, as far as possible, immediate frustrations about the quality of mobile phone and broadband coverage as well as the roll out of the national broadband plan over the next 12 months. My Department is liaising closely with the industry and the other relevant Departments and agencies to assist in the commercial deployment of telecommunications networks. The key focus in the short term will be on the mobile phone and broadband task force.</p>
            <p eId="para_636"> To answer the Deputy's question, with respect to 4G roll out, Vodafone has 98% 3G coverage and 95% 4G coverage; Meteor has 99% 3G coverage and 75% 4G coverage; and 3 has 96% 3G coverage and 73% 4G coverage. However, the difficulty is that this is coverage of the population rather than of the geographic area of the country. Approximately 70% of premises are on about 4% of the landmass of the country and therein lies the problem. There is an issue with the way the current licences are structured. It is all about population coverage rather than geographic coverage. This is historic problem not only in Ireland but right across Europe. We will have to examine this issue when it come to the next round of licences.</p>

            <p eId="para_637">I thank the Minister for his response. I look forward to working with the task force or in any other way to help improve mobile phone and broadband coverage. I am strongly of the view that those issues, broadband and mobile phone coverage, should be discussed at the same time as there can be solutions around both areas. I look forward to that happening in the coming months.</p>

            <p eId="para_638">The Deputy is right. It is my intention to deal with the mobile phone, wireless and broadband issues in the short term. As soon as we get recommendations from this group, I intend to start acting on them. It will not be a case of waiting until December to do it. However, an issue that cannot be ignored is that some local authorities take a very different approach to the issue of antennae and mobile phone masts. For example, in my constituency, the development contribution in County Roscommon for the construction of a telephone mast is zero while across the River Suck in the other part of my constituency in County Galway, it is €20,000. The levels of refusals in the Deputy's adjoining county of Kerry have been significant. First time grants in County Kerry for telecommunications antennae from Vodafone, which are the lowest in the country, are 25% and yet in Cork, the figure is 87%. Surely the planning process in County Cork is not that different from County Kerry.</p>

            <p eId="para_642">I thank the Deputy for his question on an issue that exercises many people in different parts of the country.</p>
            <p eId="para_643"> In coming to a view on whether unconventional gas exploration and extraction could be permitted in Ireland, it was considered necessary in the first instance to establish if this technology could be carried out in a manner that would not negatively impact on the environment and human health. Having consulted publicly on the terms of reference for a research programme, the issues identified on foot of this process have been included in the scope of the research programme being administered by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, with oversight from a broad based steering committee that includes my Department.</p>
            <p eId="para_644"> At the beginning of this year, the steering committee took the view that it was an appropriate time to reflect on the overall timeline for the delivery of the research programme. As the original timeline envisaged that the entire programme, including work carried out under a supplementary tender, would conclude by late 2016, it was considered that were the supplementary tender process to be commenced, that the overall research programme would now not report until 2018 at the earliest.</p>
            <p eId="para_645"> As the request for tenders through which the CDM Smith consortium was appointed did not envisage an interim report, a revised scope of work was agreed with the consortium to combine all of the work to date into a meaningful synthesis report.  It is anticipated that this report will be published by year end.</p>
            <p eId="para_646"> I would like to reiterate that no application to engage in unconventional gas exploration and extraction has been received in my Department, nor would any such application, if submitted, be considered until the research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings. Any policy decision will be taken in the context of the objective of achieving a low carbon energy system by 2050.</p>

            <p eId="para_647">I do not think it is necessary to go through this process of a research programme and report. I understand Friends of the Earth and others have criticised the process by which it is being done. The evidence is quite strong already with the result that countries, including France, Tunisia and, Bulgaria, have already decided on nationwide bans on fracking. We have evidence from America where fracking is the most developed and where state regulators have documented at least 1,000 instances of water contamination, which would be one of the serious risks here, posing threats to our rivers, streams and ground water and to people's health and livelihoods. Separately but connected there is the question of carbon emissions in that the average fracking well releases an estimated 110 lbs of methane, which obviously contains plenty of carbon. It does not tally with our having any attempt of reaching the EU target in terms of carbon emissions.</p>

            <p eId="para_648">Obviously, a decision was made by the Department in conjunction with other bodies to go down the route of a report. The report will gather together all the available data and information on the issue of unconventional gas exploration and extraction. The report is due by the end of this year at the latest, and possibly earlier, but we are saying by the end of this year. I believe the right thing to do is to wait for this report. Perhaps the Deputy will be pleasantly surprised when it is published. I am not going to pre-empt its contents but there has been a wide public consultation on the terms of reference and a number of bodies, including my Department, the EPA, and the Northern Ireland Department of Energy and others, have been engaged in this report. It is prudent to await the outcome of it.</p>

            <p eId="para_649">I will give a very concrete reason the Government should not wait until the end of the year and the answer is CETA, the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement with Canada, which is likely to come into force in a preliminary way before the end of the year. That includes an investor-state dispute settlement, ISDS, mechanism.</p>
            <p eId="para_650">Under a similar ISDS, the Lone Pine company has sued Canada precisely because Quebec has introduced a moratorium on fracking. The claim is for $250 million. If we do not put a ban in place in advance of CETA and ISDS coming into effect, any future decision to introduce one could cost the State a significant sum in a private court for what is seen as indirect expropriation and an interference with the right to profit.</p>

            <p eId="para_651">It has been decided that it is best to gather the information necessary to make the best informed decision. It was fast-tracked in terms of the synthesis report. Rather than waiting until the end of 2018, it was decided, based on the best scientific evidence internationally, to produce a synthesis report before going further to phase 2, if that is what the report suggests should be done. I am sure the Deputy would prefer to see a report by the end of 2016 rather than 2018. The report could say there is a role and to go ahead or it might say we should not go down the road of unconventional gas exploration. I am not going to pre-empt what the report will say but it will be published in the next number of months. It will be imminent when we return from the recess, so I ask that we wait for that.</p>

            <p eId="para_655">The programme for Government contains a commitment to facilitate the development of solar energy projects. This commitment builds on the energy White Paper published in December 2015 and recognises that solar photo voltaic also has the potential to provide a community dividend thereby enhancing citizen participation in Ireland's energy future. It is widely recognised that solar photo voltaic technology has become more cost competitive for electricity generation over the past few years not only compared with other renewables but also compared with conventional forms of generation. With the significant changes in the cost of the technology, the deployment of solar photo voltaic in Ireland has only recently become a potential cost-effective option to increase energy security, contribute to our renewable energy targets and support economic growth and jobs. It is also recognised, however, that while the cost competitiveness of solar photo voltaic has improved, it would still require a subsidy in order to be developed on a commercial basis. In depth economic analysis is under way to inform the costing of a new renewable electricity support scheme. While no decision has been taken on the precise renewable technologies to be supported, the cost and technical viability of a range of renewable technologies is being assessed, including solar photo voltaic.</p>
            <p eId="para_656"> Designing and implementing a new scheme is a complex task and it is expected that the broad details of the new scheme will be available early next year. Before these details are announced, the Department will run a second public consultation, which will give all interested parties an opportunity to have an input into the design of the new scheme.  Ultimately, the introduction of any new scheme will be subject to Government approval and state aid clearance by the European Commission. While there are no specific targets in relation to any individual renewable energy technology, any renewable energy technology that is built and connected before 2020 can contribute towards Ireland's 2020 renewable energy target. This may include solar photo voltaic.</p>

            <p eId="para_657">I am interested in the citizens' dividend the Minister mentioned. I have an interest in the area of microgeneration where citizens erect their own solar photo voltaic generators to power their own homes and business, which is what I think the Minister was referring to. There is also a concept of offset whereby they can contribute back to the grid where they produce excess energy. This has been very successfully achieved in Germany and Portugal in recent months. They actually achieved negative pricing at one stage. The utility companies might not be too happy about that but it works very much for the consumer. I was informed by a constituent recently that the microgeneration scheme run by the ESB had been withdrawn. This individual had a number of panels on his roof and was benefitting from participation in this very beneficial scheme. It goes back to citizens and their obligations and opportunities to benefit from this technology. I ask the Minister to look at that and, in particular, the withdrawal of the service by the ESB with a view to bringing it back on stream.</p>

            <p eId="para_658">I am actively looking at that at the moment. I am concerned that Electric Ireland has withdrawn the scheme for new customers. I am surprised the other operators never offered it. Electric Ireland was the only company that offered access to the grid for microgeneration. Deputy Eamon Ryan noted during the debate on the Energy Bill 2016 that there are issues in regard to microgeneration having regard to stability on the grid where significant numbers of projects are involved. We do not have a large number of microgeneration projects currently. No more than the discussion we had at the select committee earlier on today, this is something we are looking at actively and it is something we are going to look at next Wednesday when we discuss the Energy Bill again. Access to the grid is only one aspect of this. Another aspect is the stability of the grid when one has a large number of generators on it. There is also the cost aspect and the requirement for smart metering of the income to be generated. There are a number of complexities which we are actively looking at.</p>

            <p eId="para_659">I appreciate that this is a complex area with many facets. It is essential to incorporate solar as part of our mixed basket. I was interested in a recent SEAI report which identified a number of measures to be adopted, including electric vehicles, insulation, renewable heat sources and the usual targets. It focused on wind at the expense of the inclusion of solar in the report. We know wind has its difficulties, which we discussed before. Solar is late to market but perhaps it can learn lessons from the experience with other renewable sources which may be less attractive.</p>

            <p eId="para_660">During the debate on the Energy Bill 2016, a number of the Deputy's colleagues mentioned concerns at community level in regard to solar. Deputy Thomas Byrne mentioned it and I asked him to come back to me in regard to these issues because we need to ensure that if guidelines need to be put in place, they are put in place at the start and are practical, possible to implement, reasonable and take into account the need for community engagement. I do not mean bringing the community together to tell it what is going on. It is about bringing the community together to talk about what the options are, how they can be involved and the give and take in regard to these projects. It should not be a matter of one-way traffic. That is important. The difficulty with solar photo voltaic up to now has been the KPMG study which showed that the subsidy it required was roughly €150 per megawatt. Large-scale wind is currently subsidised at approximately €70 per megawatt while I am told at European level that offshore wind is subsidised at approximately €100 per megawatt. The costs are the problem. I had a meeting recently with a Chinese manufacturer who said that the costs are being driven down, so it may be that we can meet somewhere in the middle.</p>

            <p eId="para_662">I have previously raised the possible application of a universal service obligation on telecommunications companies to provide broadband. I am concerned that rural, thinly-populated and isolated communities will not get the service they need and that companies will cherry-pick the populated areas. As such, an obligation should be placed on them to provide a universal broadband service throughout the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Denis Naughten<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_663">I thank the Deputy for his question. Currently, there is no universal service obligation, USO, in respect of high-speed broadband provision. The USO in place relates solely to voice telephony and functional Internet access to a level of 28.8 kbps and is provided for under the EU regulatory framework governing telecoms. The introduction of a USO would give a legal right to individuals to request a broadband connection from a provider at a minimum speed that would have to be defined. The USO provisions in respect of voice telephony have ensured voice services are available nationwide. Where high-speed broadband networks are available, a USO could provide a useful tool to ensure all premises within a network area would have a connection.</p>
            <p eId="para_664"> While the current EU regulatory framework only provides for a basic broadband USO, the review of the regulatory framework which is due to commence later this year will give member states an opportunity to include a high-speed broadband USO as part of any new framework. I have already raised this issue with my ministerial colleagues at the Council of Ministers. The national broadband plan, NBP, intervention will effectively act as a USO by ensuring every home, school and business in the intervention area is capable of having an affordable high-speed broadband connection for the entire period of the contract.</p>
            <p eId="para_665"> The question of a USO in rural areas may arise when the 25-year contract expires but not until then. This could provide a useful regulatory vehicle so as to ensure affordable services continue to be provided for all consumers in the area. Effective regulation such as the introduction of a USO can deal with many of the concerns that may arise in the coming years and on the expiry of any contract awarded by the State. My officials and I are also discussing with ComReg the possibility of introducing a broadband USO as a future-proofing measure so as to ensure no premises will be left without a service in areas not covered by the NBP intervention.</p>

            <p eId="para_666">I thank the Minister for his response and indicating that he will provide for a USO. I hope his departmental officials, in their discussions with ComReg, will stress the urgency of this matter. The Minister has mentioned that he has raised it with his colleagues at the Council of Communications Ministers. I hope progress will be made more quickly in this instance than in the case of roaming charges. I had exchanges with the Minister's predecessors a number of years ago on the prolonged time it was taking for the roaming charges decision to be implemented. The target date was the middle of 2014, but it was postponed. I stress the urgency of ensuring the regulatory framework is put in place so as to ensure a USO will be placed on telecoms companies. Whatever must be done at EU level should be progressed rapidly. Unfortunately, we are all aware that issues can be dragged out at European level for a long time before decisions are reached.</p>
            <p eId="para_667"> As the Minister well knows and as he will see from the other questions I have submitted for answer today, in the counties of Cavan and Monaghan there is an inadequate broadband telecommunications infrastructure. This is hurting farming, businesses and households.</p>

            <p eId="para_668">To deal with the Deputy's specific concerns about the USO, we have 26 years to get this right and neither he nor I will need to worry about the issues he has raised. It is my intention to have matters set in train long before then. The USO will not affect 96% of the country, geographically, for 26 years. In the intervening period the NBP will effectively provide for a USO. It is our determination to ensure every premises outside the blue areas which are mainly urban will have direct access to high-speed broadband within the next five years. The issue will arise in the shorter term in urban, or blue, areas. Even within a couple of miles of where we are standing, individual homes and premises are unable to secure a high-speed broadband connection. We hope that in providing for a USO we will deal with that issue in the short term, but it will not arise for the people of Cavan and Monaghan until the contract under the NBP expires. It is my determination and that of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys, to ensure premises in Cavan, Monaghan, Roscommon, Galway and everywhere else will have a high-speed broadband within that period.</p>

            <p eId="para_671">It is not included. Although I am broadening the question, people nowadays remove landlines from their homes because of the costs involved and their daily business is transacted on mobile phones. Will the Minister consider trying to ensure telecoms companies which generate significant revenues from their mobile phone services will provide an adequate service? Regardless of where I travel in my area along the Border, the coverage is dreadful and mobile companies have refused to make the necessary extra investment. I recently read a report about eir planning on investing, but a dramatic upgrade of the mobile telephony infrastructure is urgently needed.</p>

            <p eId="para_672">The Deputy is right about mobile telephony. There is no plan to introduce a USO in respect of mobile telephony. If we have one in respect of broadband and fixed line services, it will address the issue for every business. Part of the problem in respect of mobile telephony is obtaining planning permission. In the Deputy's county of Cavan the development contribution in the case of a mobile phone mast is €15,000. In County Roscommon there is none.</p>

In fairness, approximately 86% of applications in County Cavan are granted initially, but let us consider the costs involved in terms of site rental; development contributions; in building the mast; linking with fibre services and servicing.

            <p eId="para_680">I ask this question in the light of the fact that the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, and the European Commission's country report have shown that Ireland is falling short in meeting its 2020 targets.

            <p eId="para_681">Achieving our climate and energy objectives requires a whole-of-government approach and I am working closely with relevant colleagues in this regard. The White Paper on Energy Policy in Ireland sets out a vision of a low-carbon energy system in which greenhouse gas emissions from the energy sector will be reduced by between 80% and 95% of 1990 levels by 2050, 400 months from now, and where alternative and renewable energy sources will play a dominant role in our future energy mix. In addition, the programme for Government sets out a range of priority climate actions and interventions, a number of which have a direct bearing on the energy efficiency and renewable energy sector. In combination, these will help to increase and diversify Ireland's renewable energy mix across the electricity, heating and transport sectors.</p>
            <p eId="para_682"> The EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy demand from renewable sources by 2020. Ireland is committed to achieving this target through meeting 40% of electricity demand, 12% of heat demand and 10% of transport demand from renewable energy sources, with the transport target being legally binding. The Government has a range of policy measures and schemes to incentivise the use of renewable energy sources and although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging.</p>
            <p eId="para_683">The renewable energy feed-in tariff schemes support the development of a range of renewable electricity technologies, including those associated with hydroelectricity, biomass combustion, biomass combined heat and power, landfill gas and onshore wind energy projects. It is estimated that 25.3% of electricity was generated from renewable sources in 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_684"> Work is ongoing in my Department on the development of a new renewable electricity support scheme to encourage the development of Ireland’s abundant and indigenous renewable energy resources. The scheme will examine the viability of supporting a range of new renewable energy technologies in Ireland, including solar, bioenergy and ocean energy technologies, and will help to further reduce emissions in the electricity sector.</p>

            <p eId="para_685">My experience so far of the plans and strategy of the Government, which experience is borne out by many in this Chamber and also by reputable organisations such as Trócaire, is that there is no genuine, concerted, holistic plan using joined-up thinking to take on the considerable challenge of reducing our carbon emissions. In order to meet targets set for 2020, policies and plans have to be developed with understanding, ambition and targets that will increase consistently and persistently in the next decade. Given that we found it so difficult this morning even to secure a legislative commitment that an environmentalist would be included in the board of SEAI, I would not be too hopeful, unless the Minister can convince me otherwise. So far, experience shows that it will be like pulling teeth. I will make a point which proves this when I get to speak again.</p>

            <p eId="para_686">In fairness, we are but 71 days in office. It is great that the Deputy has gained such experience in those 71 days to make a call like this on the matter. As she knows, I committed earlier today that we would actually appoint an environmentalist. We can talk about the theory all we like, but the reality concerns practice. I agree with the Deputy that we should have someone with environmental expertise in the SEAI. There is considerable merit in that suggestion and I am willing to do as proposed and work with the Deputy in that regard. I gave that commitment to the committee earlier today, just as I made a commitment to all colleagues earlier today in dealing with each of the amendments tabled and trying to come up with practical solutions within the confines and time limits laid down. The reality is that we are all anxious to have the legislation enacted and operable before the summer recess. As the Deputy knows, there has been a delay here by comparison with what has happened in Northern Ireland where legislation has already been passed.</p>

The NTMA Act allows the Irish Strategic Investment Fund which is to be reviewed to invest in fossil fuel production. One of the worst investments made was an investment by the State in a TransCanada pipeline from the tar sands in Alberta to the Gulf of Mexico. It involves one of the dirtiest means of extracting fossil fuels from the planet and we have a direct investment in it.

It is not just about making legislative change; it is also about real change, not just in the way we do things but in changing the attitudes and perceptions of the public. Part of the difficulty was that the last Government failed to recognise that while one could change the law, as it did in many areas - it was sometimes opposed by Deputy Bríd Smith from outside the House - it did not necessarily translate into real change on the ground that would bring people with it in working with it on legislation that would have a practical and real impact.

            <p eId="para_697"> On 4 July Inland Fisheries Ireland, IFI, published the timetable for the review of the national pike and brown trout policies. These policies deal with the established practice of controlling pike in waters which are designated as primary wild brown trout fisheries and where the principal predator, pike, is managed to optimise wild brown trout stocks for anglers.</p>
            <p eId="para_698"> Following the appointment of an internal IFI policy review group later this month, the review process will commence with a scoping consultation which will be open to all parties. As part of the policy development process, fish stock management methodologies, including gill netting and electrofishing, will be carefully reviewed. IFI will have regard to scientific advice and best practice internationally. It is working to ensure the completion of this process in as consultative a way as possible which will ensure all interested parties can have an input into policy formulation. It hopes to receive the agreed views of angler stakeholder groups, domestic and tourist anglers, tourism providers and the general public.</p>

            <p eId="para_703">I agree that there is certainly a divergence of opinion, but it is time, as part of the review process, that all sides were heard. There is also value to pike anglers. They have given me extraordinary figures which indicate a reduction in the number of visitors from 43,000 to 7,200 in the last year. There are issues arising and the anglers are looking for a process in which they will be heard and will be able to make submissions. The Minister is confirming that this will happen, but it concerns me that the deadline is next year. I would have thought this process could have been completed in a much shorter timeframe. The arrangement has not yet been set up and it will run until next year, until July, which seems to be a very long period in which to deal with this matter, given the implications for tourism and revenue generation in local areas.</p>

            <p eId="para_704">I will obtain a more accurate update in the coming weeks as the matter evolves. All of this is based very much on scientific advice and work.</p>
            <p eId="para_705">For example, the brown trout fisheries that are designated under the pike management include loughs Corrib, Mask, Carra, Conn, Cullin, Arrow and Sheelin, whereas previous research carried out by scientists from Inland Fisheries Ireland indicated that pike removal from waters such as loughs Inagh, Owel and Derravaragh was deemed unnecessary at the time. As a consequence, these operations were terminated and pike management in these waters currently involves the removal of pike by netting and-or electro-fishing. This approach is based on scientific evidence provided by appropriate scientists in Inland Fisheries Ireland. It is not done because a particular group wants it done but on the basis of scientific advice and the monitoring of the populations and predation levels on the trout lakes.</p>

            <p eId="para_708">The programme for a partnership Government commits to the delivery of high-speed broadband under the national broadband plan as a matter of priority. This is being achieved through private investment by commercial telecommunications companies and a State intervention under the national broadband plan in areas where commercial investment is not forthcoming.</p>
            <p eId="para_709"> On 5 July 2016, the Government selected the commercial stimulus model as the optimum ownership model for the network that will be part-funded by the Exchequer. The Government considered two ownership models, having narrowed down the options last December from five models. The two models are the commercial stimulus model under which the private sector finances, designs, builds, owns and operates the network, with contractual obligations to the Department, and the full concession model under which the private sector finances, designs, builds and operates the network with contractual obligations to the Department. In the latter model, assets funded by the State are handed back to the State after 25 years, while commercial assets that support the national broadband plan infrastructure would however remain in private ownership.</p>
            <p eId="para_710"> Both models will deliver the same network, with the same service specifications and controls for 25 years. In both models, the winning bidder or bidders will be subject to stringent contract provisions to ensure the network delivers quality, affordable high-speed broadband to all parts of Ireland that cannot access services.</p>
            <p eId="para_711"> The Department has completed detailed costings, down to every individual premises in the intervention area. On that basis, it has modelled the likely cost of each ownership model. It would not be appropriate to publish the expected cost of building the network, the likely cost to the State or the expected terminal value of the network while a major public procurement process is under way. I do not intend, therefore, to indicate the overall estimated Exchequer funding parameters or projected costs or values of the network.  Ultimately, the costs will depend on the price bidder quote in the tender process. The future capital value of the network will rely on a variety of factors, including the level of demand, technology developments over the next 25 years and potential alternative networks. Any estimation of the value of the network in 25 years' time would be highly speculative.</p>

            <p eId="para_712">The national broadband plan is a major undertaking which has been compared with rural electrification. It will certainly be as important as rural electrification from a social and economic point of view. As a representative of a rural constituency, the Minister will be aware that the lack of broadband has retarded social and economic development in rural areas. While Sinn Féin wants the network to be rolled out quickly and without delay, we also want taxpayers to obtain value for their investment. The potential return to the State of delivering high-speed broadband to rural areas will be quickly realised. As the Minister stated in reply to an earlier question, 26 years is a long time. However, it is not that long since the lads to my right on the Fianna Fáil benches privatised Telecom Éireann. I remember that decision clearly and we have lived with its negative effects. For this reason, we need to take a long view.</p>

            <p eId="para_713">I am conscious of the point made by the Deputy, and other Deputies in a Private Members' debate last week. I have the same inclination as the Deputy in respect of public assets. It is important to note, however, that the asset we are purchasing is not like the Telecom Éireann asset, which was a full copper network that covered every corner of the country. We are purchasing part of a network by building onto a network that is in private ownership. The private sector has spent €2 billion developing this network to which we will connect a further 1 million homes. This is akin to buying a car without an engine and part of the problem is that we are not buying a full car.</p>
            <p eId="para_714"> The Government weighed up the commercial stimulus model and had regard to the full impact of the full concession model on the Government balance sheet over the period in question. We made our decision based on this impact and the delays in the roll-out of broadband that would arise under the second model.</p>

            <p eId="para_716"> On the last mile - I cannot think of a better way to describe it - the private sector will own the mains infrastructure. Some private sector companies are concerned about this, as the Minister and I both know because they have raised the matter with us. </p>

            <p eId="para_720"> To respond to the Deputy's question on the last mile, 26 years from now, the last mile will be owned by the private sector. For the next 25 years, however, it will be controlled by the State and managed by a separate entity. However, we now have 25 years to put in place proper regulations, including a universal service obligation. It should be noted that we have a universal service obligation in place for voice services and we are not inundated with complaints from people who cannot get access to a telephone line. The universal service obligation on voice services is, therefore, working and we must ensure a similar obligation is in place in 26 years to ensure people have access to real and genuine high-speed broadband.</p>

            <p eId="para_722">I note the comment of the Minister of State in response to an earlier question from Deputy Catherine Murphy that he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of a report into hydraulic fracturing or fracking. It is not necessary to await the report because a large amount of information is available that allows a conclusive judgment to be made on the matter, namely, that we should not proceed any further with hydraulic fracturing on this island.

            <p eId="para_723">I thank the Deputy for her question. As she will be aware, the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, has commissioned a research programme into the potential impacts of unconventional gas exploration and extraction on the environment and human health. It should be noted that the draft terms of reference for this programme were the subject of a public consultation process which resulted in an amended and strengthened scope for the programme, including a key recommendation that the potential impacts from unconventional gas exploration and extraction on human health be considered as part of the project.</p>
            <p eId="para_724">In this regard, the tender documents refer specifically to potential health impacts deriving from impacts on environment parameters, including exposure to chemicals, vibration, light and noise as well as the potential pollution of environmental parameters such as soils, air and water. The experience in other countries in this regard will be considered as well with a view to making recommendations towards developing a protocol in an island-of-Ireland context.</p>
            <p eId="para_725"> However, I emphasise that any requirement for a health impact assessment into unconventional gas exploration and extraction would only arise if an application to carry out a development proposing the use of this technology were being considered. As I have advised Deputy Murphy previously, no application to engage in unconventional gas exploration has been received in my Department, nor would any such application, if submitted, be considered until the research programme has concluded and there has been time to consider its findings. It is anticipated that a synthesis report concluding on the findings of the research programme to date will be published by the end of this year. Any policy decision will be taken in the context of the objective of achieving a low-carbon energy system by 2050.</p>

            <p eId="para_726">There is a major problem with all of this. The former Deputy, Mr. Colreavy, accurately warned the Oireachtas committee last year that fracking was essentially taking on a momentum of its own against the backdrop whereby we still do not fully understand the extraordinary health impacts. That is frightening, especially given that in Antrim, the oil extraction company InfraStrata recently began test drilling on land owned by Northern Ireland Water without planning or environmental assessment and without any consultation. The sad thing is that occurrence has now set the precedent for these matters on this island.</p>
            <p eId="para_727"> I put it to the Minister of State that the Environmental Protection Agency does not have access to the medical experts who need to evaluate this matter. It is a fact now that in 80% of the peer-reviewed studies conducted since 2013 - a total of 226 were undertaken in 2015 - the results were of concern. In all of the areas where the studies have been done serious hazards have been identified. We really should call it a day at this stage before we get into even more serious trouble.</p>

            <p eId="para_728">A key question to be answered by the joint research programme is whether unconventional gas exploration and extraction can be carried out on the island of Ireland while protecting the environment and human health. Project C of the programme covers the regulatory framework for environmental protection. It will include discussion on approaches of other countries with regard to health impact assessments and will also include recommendations for a protocol for Ireland with regard to health impact assessments. Project B relates to impacts and mitigation measures. This project will address water and other potential impact and mitigation measures. It will examine the impact from unconventional gas exploration projects on human beings.</p>
            <p eId="para_729"> Deputy Daly asked whether there would be consultation. I have met any group that has sought to meet me since I became a Minister of State. I do not recall receiving a letter from the medical expert group. If Deputy Daly wishes to arrange such a meeting, I will be happy to listen. It only costs time and I have no problem doing it. The evidence will be taken into account. The international evidence taken into account in the synthesis report will be published before the end of the year.</p>

            <p eId="para_730">The scary thing is that the evidence is already available for us to be able to say that we really should not go any further. It is not unfair to say that the EPA study was probably compromised from the start. There is no great degree of public confidence in it given the involvement of an oil and gas provider in drawing up the terms of reference and given that some of the contractors are involved in projects which promote fracking. We have to be honest and say there is no political support for this whatsoever. At the same time, substantial bodies of scientific literature indicate serious and elevated hazards to human health.</p>
            <p eId="para_731"> For all of these reasons there is a need to be vigilant. Yet, we seem to be saying that there is no need to worry, that there is nothing to see and that we can be reassured and everything will be grand. Everything is not grand because we are moving nearer to the destination of this very unpopular health-hazardous practice being developed on this island. Nothing can assuage people of those concerns.</p>

However, the consortium that has undertaken the work includes CDM Smith, the British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster of University, Amec Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors.</p>
            <p eId="para_733"> The terms of reference went out on public consultation and there was change following that public consultation. The contract award process chosen for the competition was an open procedure process. A total of six tenders were received and the contract was awarded following robust evaluation. There was an evaluation panel consisting of 27 existing and retired personnel from various respected bodies, including An Bord Pleanála, the Commission for Energy Regulation, our Department, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Environmental Protection Agency, the Health Service Executive and the Geological Survey of Ireland. There has been a wide range of expertise available and public consultation. The synthesis report will collate all the information. As I said to Deputy Murphy, this has been fast-tracked. Instead of waiting until the end of 2018 there will be a synthesis report, an interim report, published by the end of this year and that will yield many answers I am sure.</p>

            <p eId="para_736">I think this is the first question I have taken from a constituency colleague. Deputy Murphy asked whether it is major challenge. Yes, it is. It is not only a major challenge globally but locally in our constituency as well. We saw the devastating impact last December of the flooding. We have had ongoing flooding in turloughs since then. We have had issues of flash flooding throughout our constituency as well. This is an issue for all of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_737"> The 2009 EU renewable energy directive set Ireland a legally binding target of meeting 16% of our energy requirements from renewable energy sources by 2020. To meet this target, Ireland is committed to meeting 40% of electricity demand by renewable sources, 12% renewables in the heating sector and 10% in transport. The Government has adopted a range of support measures designed to meet our binding targets. Although good progress towards the target has been made to date, meeting the 16% target remains challenging. Provisional data from the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland indicates we had reached 9.2% of the overall 16% target at the end of 2015.</p>
            <p eId="para_738"> In the electricity sector the primary support mechanisms introduced for renewable electricity are the alternative energy requirement schemes and the renewable energy feed-in-tariff schemes. These schemes have proved successful at incentivising the development of the renewable electricity generation capacity necessary to meet our 40% renewable electricity target. Provisional figures show that in 2015 some 25.3% of electricity demand was met by renewable sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_739"> In the heating sector my Department is working on the introduction of a new renewable heat incentive to support the deployment of renewable energy in the sector. The primary aim of the RHI is to build on the progress already made in heating and to help reach our 12% target by 2020. In 2015 it is estimated that 6.8% of heat was derived from renewable sources.</p>
            <p eId="para_740"> In the transport sector Ireland aims to meet our renewable target mainly through the increased use of sustainable biofuels, with electric vehicles making a small contribution as well.</p>

            <p eId="para_742"> What concerns me is that the Irish nation as a whole does not realise the challenge we are facing. The SEAI has estimated that the cost to Ireland may be in the range of €100 million to €150 million for each percentage point Ireland falls short of the overall 16% renewable energy target. In other words, financially it would be a disaster for this nation if we failed to meet the targets. We have to try to explain to people that we have to change and that fossil fuels are going to be a major problem in future. We are going to have to change attitudes. The financial challenges that will arise if we do not reach the targets are extraordinary.</p>

            <p eId="para_744">I wish to make a brief point. Deputy Murphy is right. There is an extraordinary challenge here. We have to take carbon out of our economy in the next 400 months. At EU level we are currently negotiating the targets for the next 160 months up to 2030. That means Deputy Murphy and myself must work together with the communities in our constituencies and in the adjoining counties of Longford, Westmeath and Offaly to provide alternatives to peat-fired electricity generation.</p>
            <p eId="para_745">I believe biomass is the solution to that by maintaining jobs within Bord na Móna as well as providing additional cash income to many local small farmers on marginal holdings.</p>

            <p eId="para_746">I am glad to have the opportunity to highlight this issue, which is a problem for many small counties. I will articulate the views of Carlow County Council, the area I represent.</p>
            <p eId="para_747"> Carlow County Council collected €3.85 million in local property tax, of which €3.08 million is retained as the 80% contribution for the local authority. It receives a contribution from the equalisation fund of €2.27 million, which brings its total fund from the local property tax to €5.35 million, a reasonably small amount when compared with other counties of a similar population.</p>
            <p eId="para_748"> Roscommon County Council's 80% contribution is €3.2 million, but it receives a contribution from the equalisation fund of €5.99 million, giving a total contribution of €9.11 million. Sligo, with a population similar to that of County Carlow, receives a total amount of €9.99 million in contributions from the fund. It is almost impossible for a county of Carlow's size to provide the services required without proper funding. I believe this fund needs to be redistributed to take into account the small counties that do not have the same ability to raise their own funds.</p>
            <p eId="para_749"> The main source of funding for local authorities comes from commercial rates and in Carlow's case the commercial rate base is quite small. Unfortunately, in recent years a number of large industries, including the sugar factory which historically was the largest contributor to commercial rates in County Carlow, have now closed. Other large contributors, Braun and Läpple, have also closed. That income stream has now gone.</p>
            <p eId="para_750"> The commercial water charges will transfer to Irish Water in coming weeks as that process started on 1 July. Therefore that funding stream has also gone.</p>
            <p eId="para_751"> With the introduction of the housing differential rent scheme a number of local authorities, including Carlow, are losing funding from that point of view. This has resulted in a loss of approximately €250,000 to County Carlow in the coming year.</p>
            <p eId="para_752"> I ask the Minister of State and the senior Minister to redistribute the fund so that everybody would be on a level playing field. I outlined cases of counties with similar populations to Carlow being treated more favourably. We also need to look at the overall funding of local authorities to bring the funding stream back to where it was in 2008, 2009 and 2010. As with other local authorities, the overall budget for Carlow County Council has reduced by approximately €4 million since 2008. That €4 million could provide many extra services and the only way a local authority such as Carlow County Council can provide extra funding is through increasing the local property tax, which is not always possible to do. A 1% increase in the local property tax in County Carlow would equate to €38,000, which will not provide much of a service.</p>
            <p eId="para_753"> In his reply I ask the Minister of State to address the two issues I raised - the redistribution of the local property tax fund and a new funding model for local authorities. There may be other initiatives which might help local authorities, including the scheme to encourage people to come back to live in town centres. I am delighted the Minister of State visited Carlow in recent weeks to investigate some of the issues that could be helpful to Carlow and other counties. I hope that next Tuesday's announcement might contain some initiatives that could be helpful in that regard.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government (Deputy Damien English)<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T16:40:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_754">I thank the Deputy for giving me the opportunity, on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to outline the importance of the equalisation fund for local authorities such as Carlow County Council in the context of the local property tax allocations.</p>
            <p eId="para_755"> I was lucky enough to be in Carlow recently to meet up with the Deputy, representatives of the local authority and some Chamber of Commerce members. Carlow is a town that is in a hurry to get itself back to the pace it was at a few years ago and restore itself to those glory days. I have no doubt Carlow is well positioned to avail of schemes that I hope we will be announcing in the action plan for housing in the weeks ahead and that we will be able cater for some of the demands there along with the issues around this fund. There are other schemes that we hope to announce that might address some of the issues that were raised during my trip to Carlow. It was nice to be there turning a sod on a housing development. Apart from having action plans we need to have action on the ground which I see in Carlow. We want to encourage more of that as quickly as we can.</p>
            <p eId="para_756"> The local property tax was introduced to provide an alternative, stable and sustainable funding base for the local authority sector, providing greater levels of connection between local revenue raising and associated expenditure decisions. This reinforces local democratic decision making and encourages greater efficiency by local authorities on behalf of their electorates.</p>
            <p eId="para_757"> At the time when local retention of local property tax was introduced in 2015 and became a key funding line for the local government sector, the Government decided that no local authority should receive less in LPT than it had received as a general purpose grant from the local government fund in the previous year, which was 2014. A similar approach was adopted in 2016. Therefore, Carlow’s LPT allocation in 2016 is in line with its former funding level, as is the case for all local authorities receiving equalisation funding.</p>
            <p eId="para_758"> As we all know, local authorities vary significantly from one another in terms of size, population, public service demands, infrastructure and other income sources, and their general purpose grant funding levels in the past have reflected this variety. It is not, therefore, possible to compare absolute levels of funding received in local authority areas as to do so could not reflect the vast differences that exist between them.</p>
            <p eId="para_759"> The 2016 local property tax allocations to Carlow County Council were made in accordance with Government’s decision that 80% of LPT is retained locally to fund vital public services, while the remaining 20% is redistributed to provide top-up funding to certain local authorities that have lower property tax bases due to the variance in property values across the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_760"> The estimated 2016 LPT yield in County Carlow is €3.85 million and so it follows that €3 million of this amount, representing 80% of the yield, is retained locally in accordance with the Government’s decision. The exact same rule has been applied to every other local authority in the State.</p>
            <p eId="para_761"> The Government also decided that no local authority should receive less income from LPT in 2016 than in the previous year. This decision, in effect, meant that the minimum amount of funding allocated to any local authority in 2016 would at least equal its general purpose grant in 2014. This was to ensure that no local authority would be any worse off from local retention compared with previous funding from the local government fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_762"> Carlow County Council received €5.35 million as a general purpose grant in 2014. Its locally retained LPT income of €3.08 million in 2016 is €2.27 million lower than its 2014 general purpose grant. Accordingly, it was entitled to receive €2.27 million from the equalisation fund in order to ensure that the year-on-year position of the authority is unchanged and the authority is consequently no worse off because of local retention of LPT. The same formula has been applied to all other local authorities that needed to receive top-up funding from the equalisation fund.</p>
            <p eId="para_763"> The overall level of equalisation funding required in 2016 is €108.3 million, of which €94.7 million is funded by local authorities from their 20% contribution, with the balance of €13.6 million from central State coffers. As the Deputy will appreciate, there is a finite level of funding available for redistribution to those local authorities, such as Carlow County Council, which require additional support to meet this requirement. It is important, therefore, that they are all treated in a comparable manner, which is the case currently. Any variation to that approach for one individual local authority would introduce an element of inequity and presumably lead to similar demands from all other authorities.</p>
            <p eId="para_764"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I - based on my trip to Carlow - are aware of the funding pressures there have been in recent years on all public bodies, including local authorities, and on the competing demands for improvements in services. Local retention of local property tax has now established itself as an essential alternative source of funding for the local government sector. LPT broadens the tax base.</p>
            <p eId="para_765">However, we recognise that the bodies in question are under pressure and we will do our best to increase the level of funding.</p>

            <from>Deputy Pat Deering<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_766">I thank the Minister of State for his favourable comments about County Carlow and the possibility of some helpful incentives being introduced in the coming weeks. I wish to return to my initial point that there should be a redistribution of the fund. While I accept the rationale behind the decision to distribute the funds as they have been distributed, I would like to compare the distribution to County Carlow to the distribution to counties of a similar size. I mean no disrespect to County Leitrim when I mention that its population is considerably smaller than the population of County Carlow. County Leitrim has a population of approximately 30,000 and receives a total contribution of €8.28 million from this fund. The population of County Carlow is almost twice the size of that of County Leitrim, but it receives just €5.35 million. The figures do not seem to add up. While I accept the rationale behind what the Minister of State is saying, I stress that there is a need to look at details such as the population in each county and the size of the county towns in each county. I suggest that such an examination will reveal that differing approaches are being taken. It is not quite a level playing field.</p>
            <p eId="para_767"> I would like to mention one of the mistakes that could be addressed at this stage. In the past, towns over a certain size that had town councils received block grants to enable those councils to look after certain issues. That has been gone for the last few years. We have seen a negative result from that. The funding that was previously available through the block grant, which was used to deal with issues in large towns, is no longer available because of the disappearance of the town councils. There needs to be a re-examination of the whole funding model. It is obvious that incentives are very important. I welcome any incentives that may come on stream in the next week or ten days. Overall, something more definite needs to be put in place so that local authorities can plan for the future. Such an approach would enable regional towns that have suffered in recent years as a result of the downturn to build for the future and look forward to attracting the businesses that are required. I hope such businesses will be coming down the line. I have suggested what we can do to give them the incentive to go forward over the coming period.</p>

            <p eId="para_768">I understand the point the Deputy is making. When I went into this Department, I noticed some of the figures he has presented to the House. It seems that some counties do well for historical reasons. This is constantly being monitored.</p>
            <p eId="para_769"> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, and I are very conscious of the pressures on the county councils. Councils in the greater Dublin region, in particular, came under a great deal of pressure from housing developments in previous years and might not have the right base to match that now. We are aware of that. As I have said, we are coming forward with plans. The housing action plan will be published next week. Other plans will be announced as well. We will try to tailor programmes to help to deliver more funding into county councils that want to try to rebuild their town centres, put their town centres to better use and make their town centres more attractive to business so that jobs will be created.</p>
            <p eId="para_770"> The whole idea here is that if we can get more industry into counties like Carlow, Wicklow, Meath and Kildare, that will help to generate rates and thereby increase the funding available to local authorities for the provision of services. There is a great deal of pressure on county councils. During the boom years, a great deal of additional housing was developed in areas where jobs were not being created. I understand the major pressure that comes on the delivery of services as a result. We are noting that. The census figures that were published this morning will also feed into our thinking in this regard. If one compares the level of funding received in many counties to the population in those counties, one will appreciate the difference it makes when services are being provided. That is something we will be monitoring as well. I hope we can work on this in the years ahead. As the economy improves, funding is also improving, thankfully. We need to make sure it is channelled into the right places through the right Departments.</p>

            <from>Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_771">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this item. I want to bring it to the attention of the Minister of State and the House as a whole that the process of transferring non-domestic water billing from local authorities to the entity known as Irish Water will commence by the end of next week. It has chosen counties Monaghan and Meath as the first counties to participate in the transfer process from local authorities. Irish Water will write directly to all non-domestic water customers in counties Monaghan and Meath shortly, after their account information has been transferred, to inform them of these changes.</p>
            <p eId="para_772"> It beggars belief not only that it has been decided to proceed with the transfer of responsibility from local authorities to the entity known as Irish Water now, but also that this change is coming into effect while the newly appointed water charges commission is readying itself to commence its work, which includes addressing the future of domestic water charges and the future of Irish Water itself. While some people would argue the toss on this decision and suggest it relates merely to the funding of Irish Water, I would contend that funding is the critical element of this entire issue. The question of whether to give Irish Water the oxygen of funding will determine whether it will continue to breathe as a structure into the future. The policy of proceeding in this manner at this point, thereby giving Irish Water what seems to be a lifeline, has not received any public attention of which I am personally conscious. I suggest that in light of this approach, it is no wonder that so many people have lost faith in politics and the political process. The process of allocating funding directly to Irish Water from the local authorities, which is getting under way, will be viewed by many people as a very inappropriate and underhanded move at this time, especially in light of the Government's decision to suspend the accruing charges for domestic water provision.</p>
            <p eId="para_773"> We have to recognise that the water charges commission is getting down to its work under its new chairperson, Kevin Duffy, who has replaced Joe O'Toole after his recent decision to stand down from that position. I agree with the views of those who have expressed understandable annoyance because they believe the so-called expert commission is structured to give a specific result. When the Minister, Deputy Coveney, commented on the appointment of Kevin Duffy, he said that the new commission will have "a wealth of experience in addressing complex, intractable issues". I suggest there is nothing complex or intractable about the issue of domestic water charges or the future of Irish Water. The people made their decision patently clear in February. I ask the Minister not to allow the transfer of the billing and accounting process to proceed at this point. We should await the outcome of the commission's deliberations and make an informed decision in the full light of what it may have to say.</p>

            <from>Deputy Damien English<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T16:50:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_774">I thank Deputy Ó Caoláin for raising this issue and giving me a chance to bring some clarity to it. This process will affect his county and my county in the first instance. As it is rolled out, it will affect other counties as well. Irish Water has been responsible for public water services with effect from 1 January 2014. The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that Irish Water shall collect charges from its customers in receipt of water services provided by it. Accordingly, the collection of water charges is now the statutory responsibility of Irish Water. Local authorities continue to bill for non-domestic water services as agents of Irish Water under service level agreements. Irish Water has recently begun the migration of account administration for non-domestic services on a phased basis from local authorities to its internal customer systems. Counties Meath and Monaghan are the first to migrate, with all others to follow on a phased basis.</p>
            <p eId="para_775"> The Water Services (Amendment) Bill 2016, which is currently before the Oireachtas, has been drawn up to legislate for water elements of the confidence and supply arrangement that was agreed with Fianna Fáil in the context of its decision to support a minority Government. It is clear from the arrangement document that Irish Water will be retained as a single national utility in public ownership for the delivery of water and wastewater services. It is very clear that Irish Water is here to stay. The Bill before the Oireachtas provides for a straightforward suspension of domestic water charges.</p>
            <p eId="para_776"> There is no question over how public water and wastewater services are to be delivered into the future. The approach is accepted and Irish Water will remain our national water utility. The Bill before the Oireachtas simply provides for the necessary space to allow an informed, balanced and rational debate on the funding of domestic water services to be undertaken, which is respectful of all positions. It does not have a predetermined outcome. The expert commission is there to examine international best practice and to advise members of a committee of this House on what is the best way to approach the delivery of water services and the costs involved in that. The Bill does not provide for any changes to the current water charging regime for non-domestic customers. Since 2001 national water pricing policy has required local authorities to recover the costs of providing water services from all non-domestic users of those services. This policy provided for charges based on actual metered consumption and is consistent with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive. Local authorities currently bill non-domestic customers on behalf of Irish Water and charges recovery rates are low.</p>
            <p eId="para_777"> Currently, there is variance across the country in how non-domestic customers are billed, both in tariff type and level of tariff. There are 44 tariff structures, with more than 500 tariff points in place for non-domestic water and wastewater services. The harmonisation of non-domestic tariffs should lead to greater certainty and simplicity for businesses and other non-domestic customers about the structure and level of charges. This will also help to make our economy more competitive. Harmonising tariffs should also ensure that businesses pay their fair share of the costs of providing water services in a fair manner across the country, not based necessarily on their address. However, it is a complex issue which requires considerable analysis and consultation. The Commission for Energy Regulation, CER, the economic regulator of Irish Water, will commence a public consultation on this matter in due course.</p>
            <p eId="para_778"> As I stated earlier, local authorities have continued to bill non-domestic customers for water services as agents of Irish Water under service level agreements. Irish Water is now commencing the process of migrating the responsibility for account administration for existing business customers from local authorities to the utility. This was always envisaged under the implementation strategy for reform of the water sector and having regard to Irish Water's statutory responsibility. Irish Water has engaged with relevant stakeholders and business representatives groups in advance of the migration and will continue to do so as the nationwide roll-out progresses. I also wish to reiterate that the draft legislation currently before the Oireachtas provides for a straightforward suspension of domestic water charges to allow time and space for informed discussion and deliberation on the future funding of domestic water services only. There is no question over the position of Irish Water as the national water utility, nor does the Bill propose any changes to the system of non-domestic water charging and billing.</p>

            <p eId="para_779">The Minister's response is not only disappointing but also revealing in some respects. He made it patently clear that the Water Services (Amendment) Bill currently before the Houses is indeed a product of the Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Government arrangement.</p>

            <p eId="para_781">What we are seeing now is the outworking of this in terms of the transfer of non-domestic water provision and billing from local authorities to Irish Water. It is no wonder it is happening now when one considers the figures for payments to Irish Water for the first quarter of 2016, which show a reduction of 45% on the previous quarter of paid accounts for domestic usage. In fact, in the first quarter of 2016, it only managed to secure a 27% payment rate. In other words, 73% of domestic users across the State have withheld payment. It is a very loud statement to the Fine Gael Government supported by Independents and, as the Minister confirmed in his reply, by Fianna Fáil, which campaigned clearly and unequivocally in the general election campaign in February for the abolition of water charges and Irish Water. Fianna Fáil has clearly rolled back on its position and the Minister is clearly indicating that the future of the Irish Water entity is guaranteed into perpetuity. However, it is not guaranteed. One of the responsibilities of the commission is to consider the funding of Irish Water. That is the oxygen for whether it survives. It should not, and I again call on the Minister not to allow this process to proceed.</p>

            <p eId="para_782">To be clear, the Bill before the House relates to water, not to the Irish Water utility. The single water utility remains, and the Government has no intention of changing that. We strongly believe in the concept of a single water utility delivering the service and infrastructure requirements throughout the country, for both the domestic and non-domestic sectors. I have no doubt that in time, when people review this, they will see it was the right decision to establish a single water utility such as Irish Water to deliver best practice, efficiencies and effectiveness in this area and to bring the infrastructure in the country for water and wastewater up to the high standard required to facilitate growth in business, jobs and housing supply. I wish the Deputy would not try to confuse the matter because there is no doubt. The Bill before the Oireachtas does not relate to the future of Irish Water, the single water utility.</p>
            <p eId="para_783"> It is quite correct to continue the process of collecting the non-domestic charges. The Deputy is trying to suggest that this is being done to improve its funds. The non-domestic water charges were being collected on behalf of Irish Water under a service level agreement with local authorities. The money was still coming in but now Irish Water will be billing directly for that service. That transfer begins with Meath and Monaghan.</p>

            <p eId="para_784">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for selecting this critical issue for debate. Local and national media reports over the weekend reported that a number of emergency departments were earmarked for closure. In fact, the first paragraph in the report explicitly stated that the emergency department in the Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar was one of nine departments earmarked for closure, despite the fact that a €5 million new accident and emergency unit is under construction. Workers are on the site and it is due to open later this year.</p>
            <p eId="para_785"> Scaremongering about this subject is totally out of place. It has a huge effect on people, their families and the nurses, doctors, health care attendants and staff working in challenging circumstances in those units. The Midland Regional Hospital in Mullingar has been earmarked for a cost-benefit analysis, which is almost complete, for an investment of more than €40 million for four new operating theatres, a new endoscopy unit, a rehabilitation unit and a new intensive care unit. There has been huge investment in the hospital under this Government.</p>
            <p eId="para_786"> The report concerned, which was on foot of the annual general meeting, AGM, of the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, examines very serious trauma, which accounts for less than 1% of all cases admitted to accident and emergency units. The hospitals in Tullamore and Mullingar are operating at capacity. These reports that a hospital unit will close are based on a report that has not been seen by the Minister or the Department. It is a report relating to one sector in the health service. The decision maker in this regard is the Minister. I telephoned the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, last Sunday night on foot of the rumours that were circulating and he was very clear that no accident and emergency unit in Mullingar is to be closed. The opposite is the fact. When the new unit is opened later this year, I hope people will eat humble pie.</p>

            <p eId="para_787">I am very concerned about the media reports that appeared last weekend about the status of the emergency departments in nine hospitals, including Cavan General Hospital. The huge number of people attending the hospital in Cavan every week clearly indicates the need for its emergency department to retain all services. Only last May, in parliamentary questions, I raised the need to provide new accommodation and additional facilities at the Cavan emergency department, given the large number of patients attending. Subsequently, the HSE replied to me and stated that Cavan and Monaghan hospital group is currently preparing a proposal regarding the expansion of adult and paediatric resuscitation space for the emergency department in Cavan General Hospital.</p>
            <p eId="para_788">Indeed, I had a Topical Issue debate on this subject with the then Minister, Senator James Reilly, in the middle of 2014. At that time, the Minister indicated to me that the figures available to him indicated there had been a 33% increase in the number of patients presenting in Cavan General Hospital. I know from my own contact with clinicians and other staff in the hospital that the number of people presenting has dramatically increased since then, as Deputy Ó Caoláin and other Oireachtas colleagues will know.</p>
            <p eId="para_789"> I want the Minister of State to give us a firm assurance that there will be no change to the status of the emergency department at Cavan General Hospital. The hospital has a catchment area of 136,000 people. Thankfully, the population of counties Cavan and Monaghan is growing, as recorded in this morning's census figures. As the hospital also covers part of north Longford, south Leitrim and south Meath, this means there is a total population of close to 150,000 in its area. Thankfully, in the period 2001 to 2011 there was major investment, with the provision of new and additional facilities at Cavan General Hospital, including a special care baby unit, additional bed capacity of more than 21 beds, an MRI unit, a CT scanner, other diagnostic facilities, major expansion of the renal dialysis unit and an upgrade to a very high standard of the intensive care unit. With all the additional activity at the hospital, it needs to retain its emergency department and it also needs additional services and accommodation.</p>

            <p eId="para_790">I propose to take Deputy Burke’s and Deputy Smith’s issues together given they both refer to the same recent media reports concerning trauma services. I thank both Deputies for raising the issue, which I know exercised many people over the weekend, not only in the counties the Deputies are from but also in others which are referred to in the report. I welcome the chance to update the House on the actual position in light of these recent reports. At the outset, I would like to reassure the Deputies that the work underway in developing a policy on a national trauma system is about getting the best outcomes for a particular, small category of patients who sustain traumatic injuries. It is not about closing emergency departments or diminishing services.</p>
            <p eId="para_791"> To put this in context, emergency departments provide 24-7 access for emergency and urgent presentations across the spectrum of medical and surgical conditions, and major trauma patients represent a very small percentage of total emergency department activity, as noted by the Deputies. A trauma patient needs access to the best service that has the right resources to match their often multiple and critical needs in the shortest time possible. The aim of developing national policy on trauma networks is to ensure that trauma patients are brought to the right place at the right time, for the right care, so they can make the best recovery possible. It is about building on the strengths of pre-hospital care so all of our acute hospitals and post-acute services can provide an optimal configuration of trauma services. The implementation of hospital groups provides an opportunity for hospitals to work together to enhance trauma services for patients and allows resources for trauma to be co-ordinated in a more focused manner.</p>
            <p eId="para_792"> The need for a national trauma system has been recognised for many years. Experience from other countries demonstrates that the establishment of trauma networks improves patient outcomes in terms of mortality and morbidity. In June 2015 the national clinical programme for trauma and orthopaedic surgery published the model of care for trauma and orthopaedic surgery and strongly recommended that a national approach to trauma services should be taken. The Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, the professional body representing all surgeons and emergency medicine specialists, also called for its establishment at its annual scientific meeting last year. As these are the experts in this field, we must listen to them carefully.</p>
            <p eId="para_793"> Last year, the then Minister for Health appointed a national steering group to develop policy on a major trauma system for Ireland. This is a joint initiative from the Department of Health and the HSE, developed in recognition that we do not at present have a co-ordinated trauma network structure in Ireland. The steering group has been working with the Department of Health, the HSE and all relevant HSE national clinical leads, including pre-hospital emergency care, orthopaedics and trauma, surgery and critical care, on the development of the policy. I want to emphasise that the group has not yet reported and neither the Minister, Deputy Harris, nor I have seen any output from its work. The group's recommendations are not expected until later this year and the Minister and I look forward to receiving the report at that stage. Let me reiterate that this is not about reducing services and it is certainly not about closing emergency departments.</p>

            <p eId="para_794">I thank the Minister of State. I welcome the clarification that this is not about closing accident and emergency departments or reducing services, which is critical. The health service is famous for reports. However, every report that comes out of the health service should not be taken as read or exaggerated in the manner in which this one was, because it causes significant and unacceptable heartache to people.</p>
            <p eId="para_795"> This sector is focused on getting the best outcomes for patients. In the catchment area of Mullingar Regional Hospital, if a person breaks a leg and is stable, the person is brought to Tullamore Hospital because it is the orthopaedic centre. Patients are not brought to a hospital where they cannot be treated. That is called a bypass protocol, and such protocols have been in place for a long time. If someone has a serious brain injury, it is important the person is brought to the proper centre as quickly as possible to ensure they have the best chance of survival and the best outcome.</p>
            <p eId="para_796"> I thank the Minister for clarifying this issue. It is very important that all politicians are responsible in terms of their approach to these reports.</p>

            <p eId="para_797">I thank the Minister of State for her reply. I take the opportunity to compliment the staff in Cavan General Hospital, many of whom I know personally. All the staff, regardless of the discipline they work in, work extremely hard under a lot of pressure and stress and they are diligent and committed to their patients.</p>
            <p eId="para_798"> As I said earlier, fortunately, there was major development and investment at Cavan General Hospital in the period up to 2011 but this extra capacity creates extra demands on the emergency department. An area I did not mention is the increased provision of oncology services, with linkages to the Mater Hospital. There have also been developments in the area of nephrology, with the development of a substantial dialysis unit.</p>
            <p eId="para_799"> It is extremely important that a message is given to the people through the Members of this House that there will be no diminution in the status of the emergency department at Cavan General Hospital. What we need, and what I and fellow public representatives have been arguing for, is an investment in new facilities at Cavan General Hospital because of the increasing presentation of patients. The hospital is under extreme capacity pressure. I hope the Minister of State will bring that message back to the Department and the HSE.</p>

            <p eId="para_800">I understand where both Deputies are coming from. Any person who heard this news at the weekend, whether one is a politician or not, was naturally concerned, not only for potential patients but also for staff and the people connected to the hospitals to which the Deputies referred. It is unfortunate there would be the type of confusion, concern and uncertainty raised as a result of a news report like this.</p>
            <p eId="para_801"> I very much welcome the comments of both Deputies about the fantastic care our front-line staff provide when any of us is unfortunate enough to have the need of the excellent staff in our hospitals across the country. They probably do not get enough recognition so I particularly welcome that both Deputies recognised the marvellous care we get when we need to avail of these services.</p>
            <p eId="para_802"> Given the fact trauma makes up such a small percentage of the overall care the emergency departments provide, it is critical we at all times have skilled people to manage the horrendous injuries people suffer as a result of, for example, a car accident or a fire. With regard to the information we need, we currently have difficulty in getting good, robust population based data.</p>
            <p eId="para_803">I very much welcome the fact a report is imminent and we will have it in the autumn. I know the Minister is anxious that the all-party committee on health will discuss the contents of the report. I look forward to the findings of the report. I reiterate this is absolutely not about closing or reducing services in emergency departments in any hospital in the country.</p>

            <from>Deputy Kevin O'Keeffe<recordedTime time="2016-07-14T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_804">I am delighted to have the opportunity to raise this important issue in the House. I thank the Ceann Comhairle. Just over a week ago, the Sonas Ward at St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy was closed by the HSE. The ward consisted of 12 beds, where eight patients were receiving either respite or convalescent care while the remaining four patients were long-term permanent residents of the hospital. Those who were receiving respite and convalescent care were taken in on a short-stay basis, which normally rotates fortnightly. The ward also provided for those who required acute patient care.</p>
            <p eId="para_805"> Staff at the hospital were informed that the closure of the ward would be temporary and that some element of a service may be resumed in September. However, many hospital staff believe this will not be the case, and the ward may remain closed for the foreseeable future and even permanently. This is due to the pressure on staffing levels that exists in the hospital. It was because of the lack of staff in the hospital that the Sonas ward was ultimately closed. St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy has experienced problems relating to a lack of staff for some time. Staff shortages have meant that many of the current crop of the hospital's staff have been forced to work extra hours, meaning they were overworked, tired and unable to perform to the best of their ability owing to the fatigue that many of them began to suffer. The crisis has worsened over the past 12 months in that when some staff requested that their hours be reduced, this was refused and some chose to take early retirement. This further added to staffing issues at the hospital. At present, only three nurses are working in each of the remaining wards. Everybody knows that many other small hospitals, similar to St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy, suffer from staffing issues. However, the concern of staff in Fermoy is that there has been no drive recently to recruit new staff.</p>
            <p eId="para_806"> The closure of the ward will have a serious effect on Fermoy and its surrounding areas. The closure of the ward will cause serious stress to full-time carers in the area who have relied on the ward's service for respite for the people for whom they were caring and for themselves. At a time when there is great pressure on home help services, the closure of the ward adds further unnecessary pressure on those who require these specialist services.</p>
            <p eId="para_807"> Any argument by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, that the ward is not fit for purpose is without foundation. In January 2016, the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch, allocated St. Patrick's Community Hospital €2 million in funding under the Government's capital spending programme from 2016 to 2021. This was to ensure that the best facilities were available for the residents and their families. I would like to know when St. Patrick's Community Hospital will be able to avail of this funding. Was it just a ploy during the election? Will the Minister of State give a commitment that the closure of Sonas ward at St. Patrick's Community Hospital is only a temporary measure and that it will be reopened at the earliest possible date? Will she will address the lack of full-time staff and staff shortages at St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy at the earliest date possible?</p>

            <p eId="para_808">I thank the Deputy for raising this very important issue. I also convey the apologies of the Minister, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, for being unavoidably absent. I hope the Deputy with be happy that I am responding. The overarching policy of the Government is to support older people to live in dignity and independence in their homes and communities for as long as possible. This is clearly what older people and their families want, and only those in genuine need of residential care should go down that route.</p>
            <p eId="para_809"> Short-term beds, including respite and rehabilitation beds, contribute to the provision of an integrated model of care for older people, enabling them to return home following a period of hospital care or postponing admission to a long-stay residential care setting.</p>
            <p eId="para_810"> The HSE is responsible for the delivery of health and personal social services, including those at facilities such as St. Patrick's Community Hospital, Fermoy. The community hospital provides long-term, respite, convalescent and palliative care. It was registered with the Health Information and Quality Authority on 28 June 2015 for a period of three years, with a maximum occupancy of 72 beds. The hospital normally caters for people over 65 years of age, but also provides care to young chronic sick patients and palliative care to adults.</p>
            <p eId="para_811"> Following a number of unexpected staff absences and early retirements, at present Fermoy community hospital does not have sufficient nursing staff to maintain safely the full range of services. Therefore, the HSE decided to close temporarily the 12-bed Sonas ward. The beds closed on 6 July. This temporary reduction will affect beds used for short-stay services and is expected to remain in place until the end of August. The nursing homes support office is working with local public health nurses in facilitating those patients who normally avail of respite in Fermoy to access respite in other facilities nearby.</p>
            <p eId="para_812"> The Minister and the Department have been assured by the HSE that this is a temporary measure only, which I know is the main point of concern for Deputy O'Keeffe. A recruitment campaign for nursing staff is in progress. Interviews which were originally to take place in early August have been brought forward to next week. Offers will be made to successful candidates as soon as possible, and it will then depend on how soon they are available to take up duty. I hope it will be as soon as possible after they are offered positions.</p>
            <p eId="para_813"> The director of nursing and the general manager have met staff representatives to explain why the decision needed to be taken and to outline the steps being taken to reopen the beds by the end of August. The House is aware the management of resources and service planning are matters for the HSE in the first instance. Quality care and patient safety come first, and the HSE is obliged to take the appropriate steps for the management of patient profiles and the staffing resources available. The HSE has confirmed there is no intention to close services at Fermoy, which I know the Deputy will welcome. This temporary measure was taken in the best interests of safety and maintaining services to long-stay residents and those availing of short-stay beds.</p>
            <p eId="para_814"> My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, will continue to monitor this situation carefully, and has asked the HSE to keep her and the Minister updated on progress. I hope this answer is helpful to the Deputy.</p>

            <p eId="para_815">I thank the Minister of State for her response. She hit the nail on the head with the last sentence of first paragraph with regard to ensuring we keep our elderly at home as much as possible. However, we need to give respite to the carers and family members who mind them, which is why we need the beds in the hospital to be kept open.</p>
            <p eId="para_816"> Fermoy has taken a hit with regard to the provision of community beds for elderly people. Under the previous Government we lost between 35 and 40 beds with the closure of the St. Francis Welfare Home. This was a big hit to the town of Fermoy and its catchment area. With regard to the loss of the beds, it is all fine to say we are moving to private nursing homes, but the Minister of State must admit the community hospitals also provide ancillary facilities such as physiotherapists and occupational therapists. This is why it is important to keep community hospitals up and running.</p>
            <p eId="para_817"> I am concerned, and I am open to correction, but I feel that as well as the staff being overworked, a conflict has arisen between staff, management and the HSE and that morale is a bit low. I would like the Minister of State to investigate this. More should be put in place because while the staff are working hard, they should have the goodwill of the entire HSE management behind them.</p>
            <p eId="para_818"> Previous Government investment in the hospital must be acknowledged. The first time I went to Fermoy community hospital was back in 1980 as a member of the Legion of Mary, and by God it was not somewhere one would have liked to have walked through.</p>
            <p eId="para_819">We used to visit other nursing homes in Fermoy, but Fermoy Community Hospital was the last choice on the list. However, down through the years - excuse me for the pun - people have been dying to get into St. Patrick's Community Hospital in Fermoy because the facilities have been so well upgraded. I thank the Minister of State for her response and her interest. I hope these wards can be opened and up and running again as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_820">The Deputy is right that the whole idea of respite beds is that the family at home, while they love their loved ones and want to care for them at home because that is their wish, needs a break. That is why it is critical that the HSE put in place alternative respite beds so that the families can continue to avail of the opportunity for respite. However, the other aspect of it is that there is a challenge in that older people like routine, they like knowing where they are going, they are used to it and they are used to the staff, so that certainly poses a challenge. That is why the HSE is committed to restoring the services so that people can get back to normal as soon as possible. The key thing here is the recruitment of the staff and getting the required number of nurses into the hospital as soon as possible. That is exactly the direction in which the HSE is going.</p>
            <p eId="para_821"> To make a general point on the kind of investment that has been secured for community nursing units, the Deputy put his finger on the title of it when he referred to community nursing units and public nursing unit. They are essential to the delivery of care for our older people and people who need palliative care or whatever across the country. We have secured €385 million in capital funding for a programme to replace and refurbish public nursing units across the country. I know the Deputy will welcome this because it will provide an additional 200 beds. The programme includes refurbishment works for Fermoy, the area about which the Deputy is most concerned, which should be finished by 2018.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">If there is nobody else here, I would like to speak for a longer time because there is no subject that frustrates and taxes me as much as this one, and it has done since I came into the Dáil in 2011. There has been much debate about this issue for a number of years. I will not start with the general picture, although I will come to that later but much of that ground has been well-trodden over the last few weeks and we will debate it again when the new housing strategy is published on Tuesday. However, I want to make a particular case for the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area, which is important not just for the people in that area, but is also, I want to argue with the Minister of State, relevant to solving the problem on a wider level. The reason I say that is very simple.</p>
          <p eId="para_831"> I am not a prophet but I was the first person in this Dáil in 2011 to warn the Government that a housing crisis was looming. In 2011, I brought homeless people from Dún Laoghaire into the Chamber, I suspect for the first time in its history, and warned that there would be a crisis. This was not because I was a prophet; it was because there was something about Dún Laoghaire that was ahead of the curve in housing, rent and property prices but which, if we had seen it, and we did see it, was a harbinger of what would happen everywhere else. At that time it seemed preposterous that rents and housing prices would skyrocket out of control or that there would be a shortage of affordable housing because, remember, in 2011 we were in the crash period. Rents were for a brief period falling, house prices were on the floor and there was, according to the census, a massive surplus of housing.</p>
          <p eId="para_832"> It seemed preposterous, therefore, that we would have a housing crisis, yet we had one in Dún Laoghaire, even then. It was building up and had been there for years but it was accelerating even then. The reason was that property and rental prices hardly fell in Dún Laoghaire at all. As they have climbed everywhere else, if that was true back in 2011, can Deputies imagine what the situation is like here? I am not, generally speaking, for arguing exceptionalism because this is a big, broad problem. What I am saying is the problem is worse in Dún Laoghaire but points to what will happen everywhere else. Just so Deputies understand the scale of the situation we now face in Dún Laoghaire, the average house price in Dún Laoghaire is €459,000. That compares with Dublin city, at €330,000; Fingal at €292,000; and South Dublin at €277,000. We are off the Richter scale in house unaffordability, with prices €120,000 higher than the Dublin city average.</p>
          <p eId="para_833"> Regarding rents, the average rent of a three-bedroom house, according to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council, in a report produced in the last few weeks, is €2,291. The average for a one-bedroom house or apartment is €1,800. Let us consider the new rent supplement limits. The newly increased rent supplement cap is €700 for one bedroom for a single person, not even half the average rent in Dún Laoghaire. The cap for one bedroom for a couple is €900, half the average rent. The cap is €1,150 for a two-bed and up to €1,200 for a three-bed, €1,000 short of the average rent. The increased rent caps will therefore not even scratch the surface of the rental, homelessness and accommodation crisis in Dún Laoghaire. They are not even in the same planetary system as the crisis that now faces us.</p>
          <p eId="para_834"> I went on <i>Daft.ie </i>yesterday, and I recited these points at the social protection committee yesterday. Guess how many houses are available on<i> Daft.ie</i> in respect of the cap in the different categories? For the one-bed for a single person: zero; for the one-bed for a couple: one in the whole of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area; for the two-bed: zero; for the three-bed apartment: zero; and for the three-bed house: zero, none. That is what we face. Anybody who leaves home and is looking for accommodation, evicted by a landlord because he put up the rent, whatever the circumstances are, is done for - not just people on social welfare, but also working people. It is a disaster. The number of people homeless in Dún Laoghaire has doubled in the last year alone. We have only one emergency accommodation residency in the whole of the Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown area for single people and one for families. We have 5,700 people on the housing list, with only 53 houses to be built in the next year. The figure of 5,700 is up from 4,584 two years previously. The crisis is exponential.</p>
          <p eId="para_835"> Let me give the Minister a few human examples. Michael and his partner had their home repossessed because of mortgage unsustainability. They have a daughter who is 18 and severely autistic. They were granted the right, which is very difficult to get in Dún Laoghaire, for self-accommodation, but the procedure is a total disgrace. They have to move from hotel to hotel every three or four days, into town and back out of town because we do not have any emergency accommodation in Dún Laoghaire. Each move means at least 45 minutes on their telephone, using up their credit to get through to the person with the credit card who pays for the self-accommodation in a hotel.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">Dónal, a 72 year old man, who does not have the right to self accommodate, is staying in the Brú Aimsir hostel in Dublin city. He has a walking frame. He has no rolling bed and cannot leave his belongings in the hostel during the day. He must walk around, on his walking frame, with his belongings every day. Thomas is another pensioner who is sleeping rough in Dún Laoghaire because he will not go into Dublin city and stay in hostels with drugs and drink. He is afraid of the city. The council will not even register him as homeless because he will not go into the homeless hostels in town and there is no homeless accommodation in Dún Laoghaire. Siobhán is a young woman in her early 20s who is terrified to go into a hostel in Dublin city and is couch surfing and sleeping in cars.</p>
          <p eId="para_837"> Although the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, is a central plank of the 2020 strategy in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, only 12 landlords have been signed up, and it is not a permanent home. I am dealing with three families who have disabilities and who are in RAS. They need permanent adapted accommodation. However, it is not being built. Lori and Fergus, for example, who have three children, are in their third RAS tenancy in a three-year period. Lori is on crutches and has Crohn's disease. Although she needs a bathroom on the ground floor, it is not available. They live constantly in this precarious situation. The stories go on. I do not have time to list them. It is an unmitigated disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_838"> What do we need in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown? We want the homeless executive to provide emergency accommodation in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. It is preposterous that pensioners, disabled people and people with children are being told to go into hostels in Dublin city when their family networks, support networks or schools are in Shankill, Blackrock or Dún Laoghaire. It is unacceptable. The council and central homeless executive must be instructed that people are to be kept in their localities.</p>
          <p eId="para_839"> We need higher rent caps in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown. The Government has a lower rank of rent cap increases for Fingal, given that rents are lower on average there. Could the Government please acknowledge that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, including the south Dublin area, has rents such as I have described? Although I do not agree with HAP and I do not think it will work, in so far as it is the policy we need a place finders unit in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, separate to the Dublin unit, to help people find HAP.</p>
          <p eId="para_840"> Can we have a particular programme for pensioners so that people on walking frames are not sent into hostels and hotels with drugs and drink far away in the city centre? Can we have extra staff to help the architects in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown to produce the Part VIIIs that will deliver? I do not know whether the CEO has asked for them, but I am asking for them. They are needed. While the council is doing some work on ramping up housing, we have been told the reason it cannot ramp up further is that they do not have staff for the Part VIIIs.</p>
          <p eId="para_841"> We have a big NAMA Part V development under construction. Under its original planning permission, we would have received 20% of the development. Given that the Government reduced the proportion from 20% to 10%, we will receive only 10%. The social housing is physically there. It is an insult to the people I have just described who are on the list if we do not receive at least 20% of the site. It is furthermore an insult that a significant portion of publicly owned land, such as Shanganagh Castle, which is to be developed and Cherrywood, the strategic development zone, are to be privatised, and we will not get 100% social housing on them. I understand this from the council and the findings of the Minister, and we will see the report next week. Against the background I have described, it is outrageous. I want a firm commitment from the Minister that we will get direct provision of local authority housing on the two sites on a scale that will deal with the scale and severity of the problem in Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown.</p>

          <p eId="para_842">Given that I had the opportunity last week to speak on this, I will not speak directly on it. Instead, I raise my concern about the draft proposed business for next week and acknowledge the work the committee has done over a nine week period. The Minister will launch his strategy next Tuesday. However, this forum has been given only two hours in which to debate the strategy, which is the single most important strategy to deal with the housing and homelessness crisis. Personally, I cannot accept this two-hour window. Fianna Fáil is not willing to accept a two-hour window. The schedule for next week is a draft. Our Whip has indicated that no agreement has been made on it. We will not accept a two-hour window in which to debate the most important strategy to come before the Chamber.</p>

          <p eId="para_849">I am glad for the chance to make some comments in closing. Many issues were highlighted in last week's debate, when the senior Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, and I spoke on it. We received a very good report from the committee. The committee Chairman is anxious that all the recommendations in it are adhered to and used, if not in the first action plan, then in the roll-out and as we go along. The draft action plan was a very early version, and it has been enhanced and increased during recent weeks. The Deputies' documents were a major part of it. Hopefully, we will have more than two hours to debate and discuss it next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_850"> The action plan for housing process is similar to that of the Action Plan for Jobs. It does not end next week; it only begins next week. The Deputies have all had a role in feeding into it. All of us have a role and a duty to ensure we start taking action and implementing actions and rolling things out with much more urgency. It is an evolving strategy. The success of the Action Plan for Jobs is based on the fact that it is an evolving document into which stakeholders and Deputies of all parties and none can feed with more ideas and actions as we go along. The process is being used and complimented around Europe. We will respond to suggestions. Much as we have tried, we will not have everything in it next week, and we need to keep adding to it. We need to focus on the area for the next couple of months and years to get it right and end the crisis. It is fixable. We must end it, one way or another.</p>
          <p eId="para_851"> This has been a very valuable debate about the insightful and far-reaching analysis and research that was undertaken in shaping the report of the special Committee on Homelessness and Housing. The committee used other reports and that expertise fed into it. The Government appreciates the time and effort that Deputies have put into the report and into their statements during these two days of discussion. I understand it is an important topic for most people, and it is important that people take the time to give us their ideas and concerns. Members attended stakeholder events in Cork and Dublin. They were worthwhile events, and they took time and commitment, which we acknowledge, given that Deputies have other issues on which they have to work.</p>
          <p eId="para_852"> From listening to the contributions from all sides, there is a shared view of the urgency and the need for swift and multi-stranded actions to tackle the housing and homelessness situation, although we might not all agree on the specific means of addressing them. This is why the action plan for housing, all going well, will be published next Tuesday, as the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, said in the Seanad. It has yet to be finalised and go through Cabinet. We want to reflect the mood from the Deputies that it is urgent and must be dealt with.</p>
          <p eId="para_853"> As the Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney, pointed out last Thursday, the Government is not at all shying away from the challenges the housing crisis brings, but is readying a comprehensive action plan for housing to be published next week, before the Dáil rises. This is well inside the ambitious 100-day target that was set down in the programme for Government. We will be delivering the plan within the first 80 days, a strong sign of our commitment to it, given the breadth and scale of actions proposed across the full range of housing sectors.</p>
          <p eId="para_854">This commitment reinforces the priority that the Government has given to addressing the homeless and housing challenge, and that this House has given because this is what people have demanded. We all are working here together on this issue and everyone demands that it be tackled as quickly as we possibly can.</p>
          <p eId="para_855"> While many important actions, including fundamental reforms in planning and housing policy, have been taken over the last few years to boost supply and address affordability, it is clear that such actions have not been at the level and indeed scale of ambition to resolve the challenges we currently face. That goes without saying. Efforts have been made and measures have been tried but they have not solved the problem and we still have emergency situations that we have to deal with as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_856"> As the Minister, Deputy Coveney, indicated last week, Construction 2020 - A Strategy for a Renewed Construction Sector and the Social Housing Strategy 2020, both published in 2014, include specific commitments, aims and actions to address constraints in the construction and development sectors and in the provision of a range of social housing outcomes. They are having a positive effect, but not quickly enough to address our urgent shortfall in supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_857"> We all know where we need to be in terms of significantly increasing housing output across all tenures — social, rented, private housing, student accommodation, accommodation for older people, accommodation for people with disabilities, and including urban regeneration and bringing vacant houses back into use - to meet current demand and also the pent-up demand from years of under-supply since the economic collapse. Deputy Casey and I discussed that this morning. I am not sure who won the debate on it but I think he would agree that more is being spent there because there is nothing worse than having vacant units or voids, call them what you like, when people are in emergency accommodation. It is just not on. A lot has been achieved there, bringing 5,000 units back in to play. Hopefully, this year we will see 1,300 more coming through that system as well. That should end those long-term voids, apart from the ones that are there for permanent reconstruction. It is not acceptable and Deputy Casey was correct in saying so this morning. I totally agree with him. We must acknowledge that the matter has been dealt with and put to bed this year. The funding is set aside. We will still have temporary vacancies and we must set a limit for what we believe is acceptable. In a commercial market, probably four or five weeks would be acceptable. If someone is in local authority housing, it will take six, seven or eight weeks. We need to agree on what is acceptable and ensure the funding is there. If everything is managed properly, there should be enough money coming through the rent system on a local basis to constantly turn those houses around and put them out there as well. I refer to the newly vacant ones rather the long-term voids that need €30,000 to €50,000 spent on them. I accept the need for the latter and that is why the limit has been raised to €50,000, as was called for.</p>
          <p eId="para_858"> It is easy to say that we need to deliver, but there is a major challenge for the entire system to be able to respond quickly by accelerating delivery of housing for the three key sectors. At the end of the day, our focus has to be on ensuring a sufficient, stable and sustained provision of housing that is affordable, is in the right locations, meets people's different needs and is of lasting quality.</p>
          <p eId="para_859"> On getting the correct percentages, I note the issues Deputy Boyd Barrett raised as well and I will come back to him formally through the Department. I am aware the Deputy is conscious of having the correct percentages of social housing and private housing. I note some members of the committee argued that we should not have Part V and the percentages. I disagree with that. It is important we get a mix. It should be a minimum of 10%. I note some members were unhappy that the 20% changed, but it was not delivering. The idea of reducing it to 10% is to make it practical and workable. It is also now houses rather than cash payments or land to get that mix of housing correct. I have no problem with agreeing that, ideally, it would be higher than 10%. The 10% is a minimum and that is what we have to achieve.</p>
          <p eId="para_860"> At the end of the day, it has to be also about delivering houses across the sectors but also that we get the quality of houses. All of us have seen from experience the poor quality of house that was built in the boom years in some areas. People were let down by a system that allowed that to happen. I believe that the regulations have been put in place that will prevent that. That is part of my area of the Department. It is certainly something we monitor quite well because we cannot have people buying houses that are below regulation level or below quality standard. We have achieved a lot in that area as well. I am conscious that also adds to the cost of building a house, but that cost will be recouped over a couple of years through other savings people will have as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_861"> With preliminary Census 2016 data being released today, it is clear that we continue to have one of the highest population growth rates across Europe and can expect to see further immigration as the economy recovers. This will further increase demand for housing above current levels and also shift the market requirements from the traditional family-size home to a wider range of types and sizes of homes, particularly in the city centres.</p>
          <p eId="para_862"> The Government’s action plan will set out a practical and readily implementable set of actions to increase housing supply to create a functioning and sustainable housing system, with a particular focus on providing homes for families in emergency accommodation, tackling the underlying causes of people living on our streets as well as providing options and supports to find them appropriate housing, and delivering more social housing much faster and putting in place financially sustainable mechanisms to meet current and future requirements for social housing supports.</p>
          <p eId="para_863"> At the end of the day, it is about providing enough houses to meet the spectrum of needs. Most analysts agree that we need to be delivering at least 25,000 houses a year, almost twice our current rate. Last year, there were over 12,000 delivered but half of them were one-off houses outside of housing developments. Currently, in Dublin, there are only 4,500 houses being developed. We are way off where we need to be. The idea of the action plan for housing is to focus on homelessness and social housing, but also on how we get the market delivering more houses so we can avail of them in different ways. We also must get the supply of housing back up. Some 25,000 is probably what we want to get as a sustainable construction sector but we probably need even to be ahead of that if we are to catch up on the under supply over the past couple of years.</p>
          <p eId="para_864"> At the end of the day, the housing action plan will be to deliver actions to fast-track the supply of housing, now and in the year or two years ahead, but also to bring us to a stop where we have a sustainable construction sector that people can have confidence in. The construction sector that became as much as 28% of GDP a number of years ago was not sustainable but one below 6%, 7% or 8% is not sustainable either. It needs to be in between, at 13% or 14%, which is approximately 25,000 houses. That is what we want to reach in a sustainable way, that we could all believe in and buy in to. It would give us the proportion of houses across the system, such as social, private, affordable and rental. We must keep that in mind as well.</p>
          <p eId="para_865"> This increased and accelerated supply should help to restore some balance to the market in terms of moderating the rental and purchase price inflation, particularly in urban areas, and addressing the growing affordability gap for many households wishing to purchase their own homes. We know that, to deliver housing more quickly across all tenures, we need to look at the State's procedures and processes - be they planning, approval of social housing or otherwise - and we are doing that in the action plan. In terms of improving the viability of construction, it is important to recognise the reforms already in place are beginning to have a positive impact.</p>
          <p eId="para_866"> I am getting a look from the Acting Chairman. Does that mean I am running out of time or do I keep going?</p>

          <p eId="para_868">I will not go into all the other issues. It is fair to say we recognise it is about putting in place a plan, but driving it. The officials in the Department and throughout the local authorities recognise that we must come at this with a sense of urgency. Members, including myself, flagged that this would happen, that it was coming down the tracks. It is here now. In my view, it is fixable. We will achieve that.</p>
          <p eId="para_869"> When we set a target of 100,00 jobs in the Action Plan for Jobs, commentators stated it could be done and it was laughed at. The target was not only achieved, but smashed. The process can work through the implementation of action by action with urgency as a major part.</p>

          <p eId="para_871">First, I thank the Minister and colleagues who contributed to this debate, both today and last week. In particular, I thank the members of the committee - I did acknowledge them last week - who, over an eight or nine week period, put in considerable effort to produce this report, and all of the various groups and witnesses who attended the committee for their recommendations and the evidence presented. We did not come up with this. The report and the recommendations were based on evidence that we gathered at the committee meetings.</p>
          <p eId="para_872"> I was pleased to hear, last week and today, that both the Minister of State, Deputy English, and the Minister, Deputy Coveney, are prepared to consider the recommendations in this. Those are the recommendations, not of me or my colleagues but of representatives from this House of all parties and none, and those recommendations are strongly evidence based.</p>
          <p eId="para_873"> In particular, I compliment the Minister of State and the Minister on bringing forward the date of the action plan. It was noted with some concern when the committee was launching its report that there was a drift on the date and it underpins the urgency, both we as Members and the Government must give this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_874"> The Minister of State correctly made reference to the fact that it will be a rolling programme. I acknowledge one of the first moves the Government made in terms of increasing the rates of rent allowance and HAP. Both were out of date by a number of years and the Minister has made a significant improvement in that regard. I agree with those who say it will not increase the supply of housing but what it will do is provide people who are dependant on those State supports with an equal and fair chance in the housing market which they did not have.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">Various arrangements were being made where people were paying cash top-ups which they could not afford to pay and so forth. By bringing these payments up to the level they are at now, people who are dependent on them have a fair and reasonable chance, and I want to acknowledge that.</p>
          <p eId="para_876"> Deputy Boyd Barrett highlighted that rents in some parts of Dublin are higher than the cap. We, as a committee, acknowledged that and said that the rental allowance and housing assistance payments should meet the market value. Instead of having only two regions for all of Dublin - a Fingal area and a non-Fingal area - it is probably necessary in some parts of the country to have more regions and the bands should be broken up in that respect.</p>
          <p eId="para_877"> I will not repeat everything that has been said but having glanced at the Central Statistics Office figures published today, it would be remiss of me not to mention that nationally, there are more than a quarter of a million vacant premises even though tonight people will be sleeping on the streets in every major city. We have people inappropriately accommodated. They are sleeping in hostels, in hotels and so forth where they go in the evening as they have no permanent homes To be precise, 36,732 of those vacant premises are in Dublin. If only 1% or 2% of those became available, it would start to have an impact on the people lives, particularly in the Dublin area but also across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_878"> Our report makes some clear recommendations based on our discussions with the Housing Agency. One recommendation is that an analysis should be undertaken, on a local authority area by area basis, of what properties are available, and why they are available and that a mixture of incentives, be they tax incentives or grants, should be introduced to fast-track bringing some of these back into habitable use. Some of those vacant properties could be brought back into use quicker than it would be possible to construct some new builds. Whatever incentives the Government might introduce should be short term and front-loaded and while a construction programme is under way, vacant properties in high demand areas should be renovated and brought back into use and that should be dealt with as a matter of some urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_879"> The Minister's housing action plan will also be published. I want to reiterate two of the major findings in our report. We set a target but I would point out that the number of social houses in the country, between local authorities and approved housing bodies, is approximately 9% of the total housing stock, which is low by European standards. We stand by the recommendation that it should be increased by approximately 50,000 and the Minister of State will have his own figures from the housing plan. That figure was based on the stock level and how we might go about increasing it in terms of new builds and acquisitions. We also believe it is important that there is some sort of national housing procurement agency to drive the housing programme over a number of years. In particular, if the State has to fund housing developments in different ways with off-balance sheet methods of funding, it is important there would be a procurement agency to work in tandem with local authorities and approved housing bodies to ensure that funding models are put in place and that they are not seen as a hindrance. In that regard, it should be noted that there will have to be different types of housing. It is not all about social housing and private builds. There is a cohort of people who cannot afford either and the rental market and so forth have to be opened up. We, as a committee, see a huge potential for the League of Credit Unions and the likes of pension funds to invest in some of those and some of them could be off-balance sheet transactions. There are many opportunities here which need to be considered with a degree of urgency.</p>
          <p eId="para_880"> The Minister's housing action plan will be published next week. I do not want to comment on leaks from it because that is unfair. As the Minister of State said, what has come out is an earlier draft of it. I reiterate the comments of some of my colleagues and I hope that the Government Whip will do likewise at the Business Committee. The time allocated for such a large report on such a defining issue is grossly inadequate. Approximately two hours is the provisional time allocation for its consideration. I know the Minister of State does not have the full say over it but I appeal to him, his party and those in government to look at the business again next week, as we are trying to do, to ensure this plan gets the scrutiny and the support it will require over many years. It will be launched next week but the Minister of State needs to garner support from all sides of the House to ensure that this programme can be delivered effectively.</p>
          <p eId="para_881"> This is not about another box-ticking exercise. There are people tonight who will be sleeping on sheets of cardboard in sleeping bags and they are within a 100 yd. of this House. There are people making their way from the part of the city in which I live where they have collected their children or visited their parents and who are now staying in hotels and hostels in Dublin city. People are dependent on the actions that we will implement on the back of this report. We have to show sincerity and support for it. I hope the report does not disappoint us. We are pinning a lot on it. There is a huge housing deficit which is causing untold hardship for many people and they are not the people we always see. We can see a person who is a rough-sleeper or a person going into a hostel but right across the suburbs of this city in particular, there are many houses accommodating multiple family units. That is the real scale of the problem with which we are dealing.</p>
          <p eId="para_882"> I hope the housing plan the Minister will bring to the House next week will afford us an opportunity to have a proper and real debate. I hope I am in a position to stand up here next Tuesday, if I am given speaking time, to support it. Like any good plan, when it is published, the Minister and the Minister of State need to establish a monitoring team or committee, or some mechanism around it, to ensure that it is driven and that the goals and targets set are achieved. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, said on the last occasion he was here that there were so many people that night homeless in hostels, bed and breakfast accommodation and hotels and that we would be able to see that number come down over time. We want to see it come down month by month. Over the past few years, the number has gone up month by month. There needs to be a mechanism in place so that the Oireachtas can monitor the progress and implementation of this housing plan and where it hits obstacles, roadblocks or does not achieve what is intended, solutions are found.</p>
          <p eId="para_883"> It is a defining moment for the Government. Many issues were raised with candidates during the general election campaign as well as with every Member who was elected following it but the most defining issue raised on the doorsteps was that of housing and that is the reason a housing committee was established.</p>
          <p eId="para_884"> I wish the Minister of State well. I hope this plan is as strong on the recommendations we have in our report and that it matches them or goes further. I hope it receives the support of the House and, more importantly, I hope it is implemented effectively and speedily, with particular attention to the short-term actions that could be taken to address the needs of those who are most in need, those sleeping rough and those in emergency accommodation. Again, I wish the Minister of State well and I look forward to contributing to the debate next week.</p>
