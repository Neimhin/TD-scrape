        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_1">The Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform have political responsibility for the administration of justice. Until last Monday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform was supremely confident that he was winning the war against crime, that the Garda had sufficient resources to do their job and that he had sufficient legislation on the Statute Book to enable justice to be administered properly. Monday's collapse of the trial and the revelations in a television programme about the true extent of the growth of gangland lawlessness were a wake-up call for the Government and there is now a crisis in the administration of justice across the land. I regard that as the biggest threat to the central core of our democracy since the murder of Veronica Guerin. In the aftermath of that tragedy, the rainbow Government set in place a clear and comprehensive strategy backed by manpower and resources which allowed the Garda to sit on these criminal gangs, remove them from their operations and put them out of business.</p>
          <p eId="para_2">Yesterday's response from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform is not a clear strategy and is not comprehensive. It is contradictory for him to say we do not need a knee-jerk reaction or changes in the law, yet we must change the law of evidence, that the Garda have sufficient resources and that he will provide another €2 million from his own Vote. That is neither comprehensive nor clear and it is not a strategy that will win the war on the streets.</p>
          <p eId="para_3">This crisis affecting our State will not be won in this House. It will be won by this House resourcing the Garda and giving it the opportunity to go into those communities and deal with those gangs where they have to be dealt with, removing their operations from the streets, thereby allowing the citizens of this State to know they are safe in their homes at night and free to go about their business. The cornerstone of this strategy should be the setting up of a special organised crime unit backed by resources, man power and firepower, if necessary, and giving the Garda the opportunity to sit on these gangs and put them out of business. I would like to hear the Taoiseach's response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_2">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_4">As I stated yesterday, I particularly want to sympathise with the family of Eric Leamy because they have suffered more than anybody else as a result of the trauma of recent days. I reiterate the utmost gravity with which the Government view the challenge Deputy Kenny has correctly raised. Recent events pose a challenge for our criminal system, our communities and society and it is a challenge the Government will take on, as the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform outlined here at length yesterday. It is important that where the democratic institutions of the State are challenged, those of us who are elected to represent our communities and defend our democracy and the constitutional principles which define a society should work together to that end. I appreciate the House is anxious to do that.</p>
          <p eId="para_5">We should come together with a firm determination to work to defeat the sinister elements Deputy Kenny mentioned who work to undermine what is decent and good in this country. We should not allow one or two cases to determine all that is happening. That would be the wrong impression for this House to give. It is important to emphasise that, day in and day out, the criminal justice system deals very successfully with a huge number of cases involving serious criminality, including loss of life and what would be regarded as organised crime. It would be wrong, because of difficulties in one or two cases, to assert that the entire system has collapsed.</p>
          <p eId="para_6">It is a challenge, however, and for almost two hours in the House yesterday, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and I outlined what we believe is the situation. The additional €2 million was to provide for extra overtime for the rest of this year. That is in addition to huge resources that have been put into parts of Dublin City, Cork City and particularly into Limerick over the course of this year to deal with particular organised gangs who believe they can take the law into their own hands. These people have no respect for their neighbours, communities, the law, gardaí or anybody else.</p>
          <p eId="para_7">There has been a high level conference of the Garda. They have already put in place their plans to deal with these issues. The Minister also outlined yesterday that he would undertake an examination of Canadian law whereby statements, which are subsequently disavowed, can be admitted in court as evidence where people have been intimidated or otherwise after making them. He also said there was a possibility of strengthening the law on failure to report serious felony and that failure to give an account of one's specific knowledge in such an event would also be taken into account.</p>
          <p eId="para_8">On behalf of the Government, I warmly welcome the initiative of the Oireachtas Committee  on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights to assist in the review of legislation. However, I accept this is a challenge and it will be taken on, as the Minister has stated clearly. The Garda Commissioner and his senior colleges have already had a high level conference. We will deal with this issue as quickly as we can.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_9">The response from the Taoiseach is completely inadequate. What he said presumes we are in a position to catch these criminals and that they are getting off with sentences which are too light.</p>
          <p eId="para_10">The late James Dillon used to speak about the badge of honour on the caps of gardaí. They are all citizens have to protect them and they must be given the resources necessary to do their job. Unfortunately, in the case of this Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it is as if he has woken up like Rip Van Winkle and missed the inter-generational change in the crime culture. He is a Minister who, unfortunately, has trampled on the pride and morale of the Garda on a number of occasions in the last 12 months. He rightly praised the gardaí who captured those who shot a publican in this city but he has done down the pride and morale of others.</p>
          <p eId="para_11">What will the Taoiseach do, as leader of the Government, with the Ministers for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Defence and Finance, to see that the Garda gets the resources and the authority it needs to deal with these criminal gangs now? We have been living in a fantasy world about which he has been well warned. A programme on national television has said there are 40 criminal gangs operating in this city and the price of a life, or the cost of a death, is €5,000.</p>

          <p eId="para_16">I have no great disagreement with Deputy Kenny on this issue. We will have 12,200 gardaí as soon as the present recruitment is completed. We have approximately €1 billion in resources and well over 1,000 extra prison places. We have good criminal legislation, although perhaps when challenged and something happens, we will have to look at it. It is a combination of tough law, good resources and well trained and well motivated gardaí. Anything the  Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has done is to help the reform and updating of the Garda and to give it more technology.</p>
          <p eId="para_17">Public opinion is also important. Too often people are soft on crime and when gardaí go out to tackle crime, people line up to say the gardaí over-reacted. We saw that a few years ago with demonstrations. People jump up and down and abuse—</p>

          <p eId="para_19">Yes, and he suffered for it. However, we must defend them. We cannot ask 12,200 gardaí to have the best handwriting skills in the world. That is not what gardaí are about, taking names and addresses. They have to be tough. If we are serious about it, we have to let them get on with the job. They have to be tough about the job. They cannot take on a crowd of gangsters and criminals with their peann luaidhe. That is not the game we are in.</p>

          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_32">I want to ask the Taoiseach about the report taken on 5 March of this year by the Minister for Transport from PricewaterhouseCoopers. The Minister commissioned the report on Aer Rianta. The purpose of the report was to compare running costs on the basis of the <i>status quo</i> with running costs on stand alone projections for the independent airports. Having read the report I appreciate that for reasons of  commercial sensitivity the Minister would not want to put it completely into the public domain, but I am amazed he has not brought its conclusions to the attention of SIPTU in its negotiations about the future of Aer Rianta because they are quite striking.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">The report concludes that Shannon Airport is not viable as a stand alone airport and that Cork Airport would be a serious loss maker. It concludes that there would be incremental additional costs imposed because of the imposition of stand alone status on the individual airports.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">There is the related issue of so much of the debt –€250 million – being denominated in bonds. The bond holders would be of the opinion as a result of this that they would be moving from a risk free environment to a riskier one, on the basis of which expert advice suggests to me that the cost of borrowing could rise by as much of 2%. Given that they were the conclusions of a report commissioned by the Minister to compare the <i>status quo,</i> as it is called in the report, with the new stand alone projections and since they are presumably the opposite of what he wanted, why is the Government still going ahead with its original plan?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_24">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_35">The Government made a policy decision after much discussion on the splitting of the three airports into independent entities. We believe that is in the best interest given our conclusions of the examinations and the reports undertaken by the Minister, some of which have been mentioned by Deputy Rabbitte. The Minister and the Government discussed this at length and it was our considered view that we should give the airports autonomy to allow them to grow, to deal with regional issues which arise and which are different in every area and that the airports would have a far healthier future.</p>
          <p eId="para_36">Cork Airport is a fine airport and is undergoing huge expansion and investment by the State. It is well capable of being able to stand alone and to make profits into the future. With all the difficulties in Shannon, the changes in the stopovers – those which have taken place and those which are still under deliberation in terms of European Union law – the industry in the region being unhappy with the flights and the autonomy to organise flights in and out of the airport, Shannon Airport also wants an opportunity to work on its own. Dublin Airport is doing extraordinarily well with Aer Rianta handling approximately 15 million passengers, which will rise to 20 million in this period. It should have the capacity to take on the debt and continue to work into the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_37">That has been the consideration of the Government. We believe in the three airports standing alone, driving forward on their own and that the combined effort of the three will be far bigger than their individual positions. The Minister has gone ahead with that policy decision which the Government made. One of the boards has been announced and the other two will be announced in the coming weeks. We have many difficulties  with which to deal in respect of Aer Rianta but that is the policy position.</p>

          <p eId="para_38">I know the Taoiseach has decided to go ahead but the question asked was the basis on which he decided to go ahead. The Minister decided to commission the report. Aer Rianta was sent scurrying to provide the figures. The consultants came back with conclusions which did not recommend themselves to the Minister, he ignored them and the Taoiseach proceeded. On what basis did the Taoiseach decide to proceed? The Minister felt he had to have consultants' advice, which he got, but which was not the advice he wanted. Why did the Taoiseach proceed?</p>
          <p eId="para_39">This is manifestly an ideological decision politically driven by the Minister. The loss making Cork Airport will end up in the ownership of the Taoiseach's friend, Mr. O'Leary. The bond holders who had the security of the total company, Aer Rianta, the Great Southern hotels, the international company – I am sorry for mentioning Michael O'Leary. The Taoiseach must not go off at a tangent and tell me he is no friend of his—</p>

          <p eId="para_50">It is the Government's considered opinion that local and regional autonomy should be encouraged and airports allowed to grow capacity and look at new markets. A decade ago no one thought Dublin Airport's capacity would grow beyond 6 or 7 million passengers. In the United Kingdom there are many airports which had been far smaller than Shannon or Cork and which have turned around and become successful operations. This is an opportunity for Shannon and Cork to grow. There is huge regional support for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_51">I understand staff concerns. The Minister is engaged in discussions and I have been engaged in discusions during the year. We will continue to deal with the matter. It is in the interest of regional autonomy to allow these airports to grow in the future.</p>

          <p eId="para_52">When the Dáil resumed in September the Government chose the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill as its flagship Bill in its list of proposed legislation. In February, on the Adjournment, I raised the disastrous cost of insurance cover and the damaging effect it is having on all aspects of business, social and economic life. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, responded on behalf of the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment and said the Tánaiste regarded insurance reform as her number one political priority.</p>
          <p eId="para_53">Since that time another Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, advised us that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board would have no effect on insurance costs. There are reports that the Departments of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and Finance are also opposed to the Bill.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">Given that the Bill is, allegedly, so dear to the Tánaiste, is it now a dead duck? While the Cabinet squabbles about this Bill, what action is being taken to address the exorbitant demands of the insurance companies and the effect they are having on the economy?</p>
          <p eId="para_56">Is the Taoiseach aware of the devastating effect of insurance costs on jobs and that jobs are being lost? Is he aware of the effect it is having on sporting, voluntary and community groups which are having to scrap their activities because insurance cover is beyond their reach? As a sporting person, the Taoiseach must be aware of the effect the cost of insurance cover is having. In my constituency a senior citizens' group in Cootehill in County Cavan is being forced to provide its  own insurance cover to access a day-care centre operated by the health board. Is that not also a scandal?</p>

          <p eId="para_60">It is a major issue. Everyone is well aware of the effects of high insurance on employment and on sporting and community groups. That is why the Tánaiste has made it her number one priority to deal with this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_61">There is no argument about the legislation. I stated yesterday in reply to a Fine Gael Deputy that the Personal Injuries Assessment Board Bill would be published in about a week. There is related legislation which the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform hopes to complete shortly after Christmas.</p>
          <p eId="para_62">The Central Statistics Office reported last week that insurance costs are coming down because of the related action. Of course the industry is putting forward its case for protection. The Government is going ahead with its proposals. We believe they are justified and right, are bringing down the cost of insurance and will bring them down further.</p>
          <p eId="para_63">There have been reports that resources are not available. Resources are available. Deputy Ó Caoláin will have the opportunity to speak on the legislation in the House very shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">When he responded to me last February the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, indicated that the Tánaiste was "willing to be benchmarked on this issue". Is it not the case that we have had zero productivity from the Tánaiste and the Government on this issue since then? Has it not been continually argued that price control in insurance cover is something with which the EU would interfere and that the Government has not taken on the real task of challenging the EU and seeking to effect change at that level in order that effective price control can be introduced, not only in this country but in any of the member states? Price control is what is needed to arrest the steady increase in premiums that people are having to accept.</p>
          <p eId="para_65">What does the Taoiseach say to young drivers, particularly in areas of the country where there is no public transport, who cannot afford their own cars to go to work, to small businesses, many of which have gone out of operation because of high insurance costs, or to sporting, community and voluntary groups which cannot carry out their full raft of activities because of public liability insurance and all that that entails?</p>

          <p eId="para_79">My Department has developed significant expertise and experience in all aspects of the public service modernisation programme through its lead role in the strategic management initiative since its inception. A key mechanism for monitoring the effectiveness of the implementation of the strategic management initiative in all Departments, including mine, and for verifying that targets are robust, is the performance verification group, which comprises management, trade union and independent members. Regarding the current performance verification process, each Department has developed an action plan which sets out performance indicators towards the achievement of the provisions in Sustaining Progress on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change.</p>
          <p eId="para_80">The approach taken by my Department in developing its action plan was based on the Sustaining Progress template, with the emphasis on how the human resources of the Department are managed and combined with investment in technology and organisational processes to improve performance in terms of both efficient and effective service delivery and strategy development. It is about making sure we have the skills, structures and systems to deliver improved services and strategies, while simultaneously reducing staff numbers in my Department by 4% by 2005. The high performance human resource practices outlined in the plan for my Department include both specific practices such as moving to 100% merit-based promotions and measures to secure greater engagement and commitment on the part of staff generally.</p>
          <p eId="para_81">The priority areas of modernisation where the Department intends to make progress are as follows: e-Cabinet; piloting a customer charter; applying a new management information framework; getting results with a new human resource management IT system; and implementation of an integrated human resource strategy and staff development plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_82">Targets in the plan have been reviewed by the performance verification group and a progress report on the actions taken since April this year has been submitted by my Department. The action plan and the performance indicators in relation to our modernisation priorities build on the progress already made by the Department, including initiatives to drive modernisation on a broad basis; measures to improve efficiency and minimise costs, through business process reviews; and measures to improve the effectiveness of our services through more efficient systems, such as the development of the social partners' extranet,  which allows for communications and sharing of information securely.</p>
          <p eId="para_83">Within my Department, the modernisation programme is subject to regular review. It is co-ordinated by a change management unit and monitored on a regular basis by the partnership committee and the management advisory committee, where it is a standing agenda item at all meetings. Progress in relation to modernisation is also outlined in my Department's annual progress report. To date, I am satisfied with my Department's contribution to achieving the Government's objectives through the implementation of its strategy, including the modernisation objectives.</p>

          <p eId="para_84">I think the grouping of Questions Nos. 1 to 6 is wrong. The strategic management initiative is different from the benchmarking proposals. Obviously, I cannot do anything about this grouping.</p>
          <p eId="para_85">Does the Taoiseach agree that the cost of benchmarking is equivalent to approximately €1,000 per household on an ongoing basis? Does he agree this is the equivalent of 3.5 points on the standard rate of income tax and that in order to pay for this, income tax will rise from 20% to 23%? Of course, the Government has not admitted this because of the implementation of stealth taxes.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">What are the new changes that have been introduced where consumers will see real change and real value for the money they will have to pay? What are the changes and better benefits and services the consumer, teacher, parent or nurse will see? It appears as if the verification process of change is quite threadbare and couched in wording that means nothing. If the Taoiseach or Minister for Defence, as citizens, were asked to pay €1,000 for something every year, they would be quite entitled to ask what increased benefits or changes they were going to get for it.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">Perhaps the Taoiseach will spell out some of the tangible changes that have been introduced since the commencement of this process, not ones that have been ongoing since the PCW. This is a process that will last for many years and people will have to pay not just once but every year. As taxpayers they are entitled to know what increased value for money they are to get in terms of better services.</p>

          <p eId="para_90">Regarding my Department, the priority areas for modernisation have been discussed in my reply. The Department intends to  make the e-Cabinet project, an entirely new project, central to this. It is a major technology project and would be a big undertaking for any business anywhere. It will see a move from a paper-based organisation and administration of Cabinet to electronic means. This is particularly relevant to my Department as a large part of its work relates to the presentation and preparation of what is dealt with and emerges from Cabinet. The move to electronic means is a major change. It would have been unheard of a decade ago in the Civil Service for an arrangement like that to be made by staff. It is of major significance to the entire system, not alone to my Department. This is a new project and people are engaging in it proactively.</p>
          <p eId="para_91">My Department is piloting a new customer charter, something I hope to see introduced in every Department. This charter entails my Department engaging with its customer base – whether that is other Departments, the public or agencies – and setting down standards and criteria to bring about efficiency in how it deals with work. While the Revenue Commissioners use this model, no Department has it and my Department is piloting it.</p>
          <p eId="para_92">We are applying a new management information framework. The benefit of this will provide us with much more extensive information about our cost base and centres. It will examine how money is spent and control costs. Hitherto there would have been broad figures but this will break those down into great detail. Cost centres must then apply and deal with efficiencies to remain under cost base. This is a major change. It is information that never would have been available in the system and units will have to live within their means under it.</p>
          <p eId="para_93">We are getting results from a new human resource IT system. This is helping the system in a great way. We are implementing a human resource strategy and staff development plan. It relates to training and modernisation so that staff can give their best and we can get the best from them. An independent performance verification group has reviewed targets in the plan. This has not been done by the Secretary General or any official in my Department; it is an independent group made up of employers and unions. A progress report on the actions taken since April of this year has been submitted by my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_94">I believe there is a huge amount of misinformation about benchmarking by some. I recently heard Deputy Richard Bruton saying something on the issue that was incorrect and I want to correct him. He just does not understand the system or seems to ignore what it means. The benchmarking process started in 1999. It was a genuine attempt by the public service unions to find an alternative to the relativities and analogue systems that we had for too long. Those were not based on merit, productivity or competition. It took a long time to move to that new system – I think the talks on trying to move from relativities to benchmarking have been going on since the  mid-1980s. When I was Minister for Finance I tried to make progress in this area but did not succeed in getting to a new system. This new system removes relativities and analogues.</p>
          <p eId="para_95">The discussion on this system started in 1999. It was 2000 before the details were considered and the discussions did not conclude until 4 December 2001. The last payment under this round is to be made in June 2005, with 25% paid this year back to 1 December 20001, 50% from 1 January of next year and 25% from 1 June 2005. The significance of the system, which is being lost in much of the media debate, is that it gives an objective judgment of salaries for the first time. It is not based simply on the relativities of what somebody else won by strike action, muscle or disruption. It is an objective analysis done in a scientific way, looking at comparison of what people do in the public service against the skills and responsibilities they would have outside, including a pledge to have no strike action or disruption. Moreover there is agreement to modernisation, to changes, to flexibility, productivity, technology – all the things that people in the private sector say they are great at, and well done to them, yet the public service is equally commendable in these areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_96">People are diligently putting in the effort to carry this through. They are also agreeing to a 4% reduction in staff. I do not see anyone in the private sector prepared to abnegate their rights in these areas without remuneration. What is being given in exchange is an enormous amount. At the same time as those reductions are made, services will be maintained or increased as we pass existing legislation. Furthermore we are changing to a system of open recruitment up to middle management AP/HEO levels in the public sector. This is a change from the traditional system of "next on the list" to merit-based promotion. New legislation covering Civil Service recruitment will come before this House in the new Billcovering all levels up to that of principal officer. The new regulations Act too, concerned with hiring and firing, will mean that the Civil Service will be dealt with not by Government but by its own peers and will also be covered by the Unfair Dismissals Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_97">These are major fundamental changes in return for pay increases. People who argue against this, people who just take the private sector angle and see nothing bad in anything the private sector does to its staff, or how it shafts people or ships them, people who take a simplistic view of the public service, are wrong. Most of them do not know what they are talking about because they never worked in the public service. They should look at this more closely.</p>

        <speech by="#EndaKenny" eId="spk_54">
          <from>Mr. Kenny</from>
          <p eId="para_98">The Taoiseach has given a long dissertation but did not refer to the overall cost of this agreement being equivalent to 3.5 points on the standard rate of income tax.</p>
          <p eId="para_99">I believe in a general sense that the benchmarking process could have done much for public  service effectiveness. As a Member of the House neither I nor anyone else has never been given the evidence the central commission looked at. It appears to have either been shredded or kept very secret. The only outside economist who served on that commission resigned because of that fact. The awards that have been decided, ranging from 3% upwards, will be the beginning of future pay claims when the next round takes place, in whatever form it does. Moreover, the deal done in respect of the craftworkers still keeps alive the relativities that the Taoiseach referred to as having vanished.</p>
          <p eId="para_100">Electronic payment in the Taoiseach's Department was to be implemented by November 2003. Is that happening, or is it is likely to happen on time? The e-Cabinet project the Taoiseach refers to was to be active by September of this year. What is the likely scale of its introduction? The Accenture consultants submitted a very comprehensive report to the Taoiseach's Department a number of months ago for the development of a national e-payment strategy which would save the Government up to €420 million assessed on an annual basis. Danny O'Hare, the chairman of the Information Society Commission, said this was a "win win" situation for the Government, but that what it required was real leadership. As the Taoiseach is in a broadminded frame this morning, does he think that since his Department is the flagship Department, he should drive this on in view of the assessed savings for the Government and for the country as a consequence?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_55">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_101">As I stated, the e-Cabinet initiative is well advanced. The hardware for the new system has been produced. A new server room has been fitted out. There have been substantial advances in the design and software. An enterprise agreement is in place to enable the software tools for e-Cabinet use to be applied to potentially all desktops in the Civil Service. There is liaison and consultation with key players and all Departments, and implementation is continuing through the business managers' forum and the technical managers' group. Testing of the software for the first phase of the system was to take place in September in advance of the pilot, subject to successful testing of phase one of the system. I understand that has happened and is ongoing. This will entail pilot Departments altering, processing and submitting a number of memoranda using the new system. It is hoped to introduce to introduce the new electronic system to the Cabinet table sometime this month, or before Christmas. Work has already begun on development of the next phase and will expand the functionality being provided in the first phase.</p>
          <p eId="para_102">Regarding e-procurement, the Department of Finance is actively pursuing implementation of a national e-procurement strategy. My Department will obviously have an input. The emphasis is on procuring management reform, supported by technology appropriate to the procurement-related spend profile of the Irish public sector.  The benefits of e-procurement in management reform are maximised through the involvement of nine Government Departments in procurement improvement projects to be undertaken over the next 12 months. The projects aim to reform the way in which procurement is managed at an organisational level. The result of these projects for the participating Departments and sectors will be seen in substantially increased capacity to achieve significant savings and benefits, as adverted to by Deputy Kenny in reference to Danny O'Hare's statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_103">The projects investigate and provide a practical way forward in several key areas. Organisation procurement strategy is based on a thorough understanding of the organisation spending profile, transaction patterns, key supply markets, organisation of the function within the focal entity, procurement operation and policy procedures, adoption of best practice tools and techniques, procurement-related systems including use and potential for e-procurement, and appropriate application of the knowledge and skills including addressing training and education needs. Though the policy unit of the Department of Finance is driving this, there has been enthusiastic involvement by all those involved in the national procurement policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_104">Deputy Kenny also asked about e-payments. The information society commission which is based in my Department produced a report, Delivering a World Class Payments Environment, in June of this year. The report estimates that a significant migration from paper based payment channels over three to five years would generate economy-wide benefits of somewhere between €230 million and €420 million per annum. It therefore points to a strong economic rationale for development of a cohesive national strategy to co-ordinate the development of modernised payments. The e-strategy group of Secretaries General has agreed to prioritise a response to the report and bring forward the proposals as soon as possible. I have no date for when that will happen but I understand it will be in the spring.</p>

          <p eId="para_105">If any of this is used on "Oireachtas Report" it will kill off the programme altogether. This is heavy going. Looking at the template for the Civil Service involvement in this, it is really impenetrable.</p>

          <p eId="para_109">The Taoiseach referred to the fact that there is now outside recruitment in the Civil Service up to middle management, arising from the benchmarking arrangement. Has any attempt been made to address the deficiency that is manifest in terms of our conceiving of designing and implementing major infrastructural projects? Last week's mid-term review highlighted deficiencies which arose from the time a project was conceived to the implementation stage with several changes being made, Ministers changing their minds, including add-ons and projects coming in late and seriously over budget.</p>
          <p eId="para_110">The argument could be advanced that part of the problem is that the generalist tradition in the Civil Service is not equipped to deal with this kind of project. This results in huge cost over-runs and a continuation of infrastructure logjams and so on. Are changes contemplated in that area?</p>
          <p eId="para_111">Why have the PPPs collapsed? We have not yet managed to design a formula that is workable in the PPP area following five years of supposed commitment to the idea. There is no workable model that is acceptable to the private sector or that could be supported by the public sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#Bertie" as="#Taoiseach" eId="spk_61">
          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_112">The Deputy's question is not totally related. I do not have briefing on the matter. I am chairman of the Cabinet infrastructural committee. While there is a substantial amount of expertise within the public service and in all Departments in terms of dealing with large contracts, there is not enough. That is the reason, more often than not, outside consultants are brought in to engage and involve themselves in larger projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_113">We have given huge resources to agencies dealing with these issues. As a result of increased resources the NRA, which had the expertise but not the people required, has been able to recruit project managers, many of whom come from South Africa where there is an over-supply of graduates in this area. We have managed to recruit many of the project management teams we required.</p>
          <p eId="para_114">The question of why these difficulties arise in the public sector as opposed to the private sector was asked. While I chair the Cabinet infrastructural committee and am aware of how things operate within the system, I am not involved in the details on such issues. Everything must be done by the book. Every change has to go through the system. If there is a substantial change it must go through EU regulations and the planning process. Nobody is prepared to take a chance. Archaeological digs can only be undertaken by way of legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_115">It is my personal view – if I can still have one – that following many years of inquiries and investigations public servants no longer take the chances they may have taken in the past. It is also my personal view that going forward they will do so far less. It is a pity that is so because such people have great ability which they should show.  I know it is not politically correct to say that but I believe it is a major part of the problem. Everybody will ensure the file is right and will follow proper procedure, undertaking the required archaeological digs – the fastest growing industry in this country. That does not help.</p>
          <p eId="para_116">I do not offer the foregoing as an excuse. One of the benefits of benchmarking is that the public service will now be in a position openly to recruit people, though not to the level I would like. That is a substantial move. Previously, if one wanted to recruit to a Civil Service Department one was required to take the next person on the Civil Service Commission list. A person might hate the word "agriculture" and might not know one end of a cow from the other but would nevertheless end up in the Department of Agriculture and Food. Now a Department will be able to recruit directly from the market. That will permit enormous change, a change which has forced public servants reluctantly to move on. I appreciate that and thank them for doing so. In time the change will be hugely beneficial. A Department will be able to recruit a person, perhaps not at the highest level, who has an interest in the job. The Department will then at least have the chance to build its expertise. While things may not change today or tomorrow this will allow for enormous change in ten years' time or less. Departments will be able to recruit people with good IT skills who in turn will deal with many of the issues which the Deputy rightly raised.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_117">I understand that the principles of equality, diversity, official languages equality and internal customer service are part of the strategic management initiative. Will the Taoiseach say how the official languages equality principle has affected recruitment policy in the public service, given that one would expect there to be a level of proficiency in any said section of a Department for dealing with matters in Irish and English? Perhaps the Taoiseach will explain recruitment policy in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Can the Taoiseach give us a timescale – the Minister of State referred to this earlier – on the availability of cre±che facilities, another issue covered by the strategic management initiative? What progress has been made on workshare or flexi-time arrangements? The SMI also deals with modernisation of the Civil Service and states that all Departments and offices should publish a charter of service standards and report on performance against these standards in their annual report. Have all Departments published a charter?</p>
          <p eId="para_119">Would the Taoiseach like to offer any particular changes he expects the Oireachtas to make so that the public service as a whole could have credibility in terms of benchmarking?</p>

          <from>The Taoiseach</from>
          <p eId="para_123">I do not have up-to-date information on worksharing or flexi-time arrangements. Departments have made many proactive moves in that regard. I will not try to guess the answers required by the Deputy. I will leave the matter to be dealt with by the Department of Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_124">Strategic management is about trying to provide better value to customers by providing a better service and a quicker turnaround by the Civil Service in dealing more efficiently with inquiries. Such work is best dealt with by civil servants. The SMI process is working well across Departments. The Revenue Commissioners and the Department of Social, Community and Family Affairs led the way in this regard but all other Departments are now involved. Public servants are, in my experience – and I have a good deal of experience in dealing with them on this issue as the SMI and modernisation units are located in my Department – driving this change and are making a sincere effort on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_125">On the question of modernisation and benchmarking, it is appropriate that this House contribute. I said yesterday that our efficiency should be monitored. First, we should try to explain what it is we do. We are not good at doing that. A good example is what happened last week in the discussions on whether this House would meet or not. A number of committees published excellent reports last week. Incidentally, the chairpersons of various committees pointed out to me that no journalist turned up at the launch of any of those reports. While some were ranting on about what we were not doing, others were issuing important reports yet they received no publication in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_126">That point must be made. However, there are things that we can do. This is a House of legislation, and we should be able to improve our mechanisms in dealing with that – I made that point yesterday. I am very glad to support the Government Whip on that issue. We must criticise where criticism is due. Our day has been pulled back more and more by the debates and other issues.</p>

It is very easy for me to get here in 15 or 20 minutes on most occasions. However, the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage  and Local Government, Deputy Pat The Cope Gallagher, after driving 100 miles from his door, is still in Donegal. One must be realistic and Members of the House comprise more than those who live in Dublin Central or Dublin North.</p>

          <p eId="para_161">Yes. As I said at the outset, with benchmarking we are endeavouring to achieve a big change on the previous system, and Deputy Ó Caoláin has mentioned some of the issues involved. It is important that productivity, modernisation, changes and flexibility are given in those negotiations. It is important, when we are paying a sizeable amount of taxpayers' money, that people can see they are meaningful. As I said, the negotiations and verification groups are not all cloaks and mirrors. I reiterate that substantial changes are being made to legislation governing the public service, which in many cases goes back 50 or 60 years.</p>
          <p eId="para_162">Not everyone is getting substantial payments. When there are 250,000 employees and they all get an increase that effectively runs from December 2001 to 2006, the cumulative figure looks very big. However, taken in its stages and scales, that is not the case for many people. It is forgotten that the row on which I had to hold back, particularly in the teachers' dispute, involved 30% just for one category. I am not saying that benchmarking, what is being given by public servants, is 100%, but it involves a sizeable change in their working patterns to improve the public service in a fair manner.</p>

I held the post of Minister for Labour for the longest period of any Minister since the foundation of the State, and then the Department was abolished. Those matters are dealt with differently nowadays in that negotiations come under my Department and other sections such as pay are within the Department of Finance. The Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment has the labour sections division. The SIPTU leaders and others have made the point that the old system was better. However, at that time people argued that having the central negotiating element in the Department of Finance or the Department of the Taoiseach would be a better way of doing things. I am not sure that if one changed it back, one would satisfy the case being made.</p>

          <p eId="para_209">The Taoiseach quite rightly pointed out to the House yesterday that a greater amount of time should be allocated to Members to deal with legislative matters. I accept this. As a general principle, I do not like to see a guillotine being imposed on any Bill. It is fair enough, however, if a Bill runs its course, if Deputies do not have sufficient interest or if the matter has been talked out. I do not object to the two proposals before the House.</p>

It was wrapped up very quickly, perhaps in record time. In that context, I wonder if the Government will stand by its proposal to limit the debate on Committee and Remaining Stages to 45 minutes. Will Report Stage be lengthened to compensate for the short Second Stage?</p>

          <p eId="para_216">There is legislation in this area – the 1990 Act is the relevant one. There is no proposed new legislation.</p>

There is no reason we should have to wait until 2004, the expected publication date of the Bill, as it is concerned merely with implementing our obligations under the comprehensive nuclear test ban treaty.

This provides that the provisions of the 2002 Act, in so far as they amend the Courts (Supplemental Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2000, shall be construed as one with those Acts and that the provisions of the 2002 Act and the 1961 to 2000 Acts and the Courts (No. 2) Act 1991 may be cited together as the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2002. Accordingly, the Act referred to by the Deputy is already covered by the collective citation since that date. Section 1(2) of the Bill merely includes the Bill, when enacted, within the collective citation. Hence the reference to the Courts (Supplementary Provisions) Acts 1961 to 2003. In the circumstances, the need for an amendment of the type suggested by the Deputy does not arise.</p>

        <speech by="#CiaranCuffeGP" eId="spk_236">
          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_315">I had hoped we would address, through this legislation, some concerns about the performance of the Judiciary, particularly with regard to training, the appointment of judges and disciplinary procedures. The issue of training for judges has arisen several times in recent years as a result of rather injudicious comments by judges on certain matters. In one instance, certain racist comments were made by judges which reflected badly on the Judiciary and the lack of training judges receive prior to their appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_316">When the remarks were made by Judge John Nealon and Judge Harvey Kenny, there was a certain amount of discussion in the House and a general commitment was given to provide some type of training in this area for judges. That training should be part of a process that should occur with the appointment of judges. They should receive some background training in dealing with equality issues, particularly racism which has become an important issue in Irish society today. Given that more than one judge has made comments in this regard that reflected badly on the Judiciary, there should be a module of training to deal with racism. I had hoped the Minister would use this legislation as an opportunity to provide for this.</p>
          <p eId="para_317">The second issue is that of disciplinary procedures. The only recourse the Oireachtas has if a problem arises with senior judges is impeachment. We need a method of expressing concern  about the behaviour of judges other than the media. Disciplinary procedures should be incorporated into the operations of the Judiciary and should allow for some type of penalty other than impeachment. There was a discussion about putting a complaints board in place to deal with the behaviour of judges but there has been no movement on this. The Green Party is seeking the provision of a formalised system of training for judges and the establishment of a complaints board.</p>
          <p eId="para_318">My final point refers to the appointment of judges. While this is the prerogative of the Government, perhaps we could look at another mechanism of appointment which does not politicise the process. The politicised appointment of judges may lead to certain views receiving more attention than others in the implementation of the law. That is not to cast aspersions on any judge but the method of their appointment is politicised. We should examine other methods of appointment as part of the process.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelMcDowellPD" eId="spk_237" as="#Minister_for_Justice,_Equality_and_Law_Reform">
          <from>Mr. McDowell</from>
          <p eId="para_319">There is a Judicial Studies Institute which deals with the issue of providing training, education and research for judges who are not simply left on their own. The institute has an annual budget of €350,000 which is spent on conferences, lectures, courses and the like which members of the Judiciary organise. It is not the case that people are simply appointed to the Bench, that that is the end of their intellectual development or that they are left to their own devices to read themselves further into their job. The institute is up and running and effective.</p>
          <p eId="para_320">The Deputy also raised the issue of the behaviour of judges, particularly behaviour that falls short of grounds for impeachment but nonetheless raises questions about the conduct of judges in the discharge of their functions and otherwise. As Attorney General, I served on a committee established in the aftermath of a case that was the subject of great public controversy, although I will not go into that now. A detailed report was submitted to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has been on my desk for some time. The problem is that to convert it into legislative form will require time but there are other legislative pressures on me from all quarters. Therefore, I have had to prioritise other matters in accordance with the wishes of the House. That is not to say the Deputy is wrong to remind me of the requirement for it. I believe a judicial council should be established by statute and I intend to do so. A judicial conduct committee should be part of that judicial council's structure while the Judicial Studies Institute should form another portion. It will be a parallel structure with the Courts Service. I hope the two bodies will be able to share the same secretarial and administrative functions as far as possible to minimise extra expenditure by the Exchequer.</p>
          <p eId="para_321">There is a need for a degree of lay representation in the judicial conduct committee. It is  important that where an instance of judicial behaviour is deemed worthy of investigation, the investigation should not be confined to members of the Judiciary. Persons from outside the judicial and legal world should be part of the procedure in order that the public will have maximum confidence in the outcome of such inquiries. It will not simply be a case of the judges investigating themselves.</p>
          <p eId="para_322">Some have argued that such a body is inconsistent with the independence of judges under the Constitution. I radically disagree with this opinion. Misbehaviour by a judge is not somehow authorised or encompassed by the notion of judicial independence. On the contrary, if there is behaviour by a judge which is worthy of censure, there should be a formal system for so doing without the nuclear option of tabling a motion for his or her removal from the Bench by a decision of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_323">It is not simply a question of judges making inappropriate remarks, although that has happened on occasion. The Deputy should acknowledge that the two members of the Judiciary to whom he referred acknowledged that they had made a mistake and apologised for it in public. God knows, if we were to be as censorious of ourselves for the mistakes made, we would spend a great deal of time apologising for the inappropriate or careless remarks everybody makes in the political process. It does occasionally happen that a well meaning remark carries an unintended implication. Those concerned suddenly realise afterwards that the remark came out wrong; they did not mean it to carry a xenophobic or racist implication.</p>
          <p eId="para_324">We expect the Judiciary to deal independently and vigorously with the matters that come before it. We expect its members to deal with them immediately, not to go off to their chambers to write out the judgments and stay absolutely silent in case they might make a mistake. They are bound to make mistakes from time to time and are bound to make remarks which, in the cold light of day, do not look good. Therefore, it is to the credit of both members of the Judiciary in question that, when they saw what they had said in cold print, they took the first opportunity to explain in public, from the bench, that they did not mean to insult or belittle any section of society.</p>
          <p eId="para_325">There are other forms of judicial misconduct, however, which also have to be borne in mind. One of them involves the potential situation that would arise if a judge were, for instance, to show favouritism to a particular lawyer or client, or to act in a manner which suggested prejudice of some kind. Alternatively, a judge may inexcusably delay judgment in a matter to the detriment of the judicial process and the litigants. I am not suggesting that is the case but one may well arrive at a situation where a judge might at some point, because of a problem with alcohol or a psychological problem, require some degree of counselling. It is important that members of the public  should have some means of making a complaint – a serious one, obviously, not just a trivial complaint – about a judge's behaviour so that a view might be formed as to whether remedial steps can be taken concerning that grievance.</p>
          <p eId="para_326">I do not believe that the Constitution impedes the creation of such a judicial council or the establishment of a body with lay participation, which would deal with those kind of matters. If a serious act of judicial misconduct were to be uncovered or established through such a process, the process itself could end up with a report being made to the Oireachtas with a view to considering an impeachment motion. Detailed work has gone into this matter and I hope to produce legislation during the first part of 2004 to advance the process of a judicial council and build on the work of the committee, on which I participated as Attorney General.</p>
          <p eId="para_327">Deputy Cuffe raised the method by which judges are appointed. Under the Constitution it is a matter for the President acting on the advice of the Government. That is a constitutional prerogative which cannot be trenched upon in a way which fundamentally changes it. The Deputy will be aware of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board. Its proceedings are confidential and it evaluates applicants for judicial office carefully and confidentially. The board provides the Government with a short-list of applicants. In furnishing it the board, in effect, certifies to the Government that those on the list are fit and proper persons whose appointment to the bench the board would recommend. That is as far as it goes, however, because under the Constitution the Government is not bound by the advice of the board. In any case, where the Government is not going to rely on such advice, it is bound to make that decision public by the simple method of not recording in <i>Iris Oifigiúil</i> the fact that the appointment was made on the advice of the board. It is impossible to pretend, in secret, that a particular nominee was, in fact, appointed by the board. That is the legal position.</p>
          <p eId="para_328">Deputy Cuffe went one step further by suggesting that other jurisdictions have different ways of appointing judges and that we should consider the issue more broadly. He hinted at the suggestion, although I know he does not mean to push it too far, that the present situation might in some sense be seen as politicising the Judiciary. That may be, but the alternative methods might be far more politicised, such as, to take one example, the American congressional system. Under that system, the world view and personal life, as well as the social, economic and political attitudes and records of candidates are scrutinised in public by people who are highly political in their approach to these matters. Would we end up with a more or less politicised Judiciary in those circumstances? One would have to ponder that question long and hard before being able to claim it as an improvement which we should adopt in our system. Would it be desirable that the merits or demerits of any particular appointment to the  bench should be examined and commented upon in public, before such an appointment was made, by a group of elected people who, with the best will in the world, frequently act in a political and partisan manner? They are elected on an ideological basis to represent one ideological world view, rather than another. The proponents of change in this area would have to establish that their new, alternative system was significantly better than the present system and was free of the pitfalls I have mentioned, before it could be adopted. I am not being unduly conservative about this but I do not think we should embrace change for the sake of it, unless we are clear that the consequences of that change would be those that were originally canvassed by its advocates.</p>
          <p eId="para_329">There is no point in seeking to depoliticise the Judiciary by having a Dáil debate on the merits and demerits of every applicant for the bench. The very fact that one has such a public examination must, considering the American experience, deter some people from allowing their names to go into the bear pit of public controversy and political discussion. There must be some people who would say, "It's not worth the candle. I'm not going to subject myself to being torn apart or being cross examined as to my views, or have my attitudes since I was a student scrutinised."  The investigation of members of the Judiciary in states which allow for that, have been so far reaching and personal that there is, both among solicitors and barristers, a substantial category of people who would never subject themselves to it. They would prefer not to sit on the bench rather than enter the public arena and be rejected after a hearing. Some people may ask what they have to hide. That is one view but there are cases where people simply regard their own privacy as important. In this context, I have never seen political partisanship being exercised on the part of the Judiciary.</p>
          <p eId="para_330">A number of remarks were made recently in the House about the bin dispute, but I thought it was probably wiser not to intervene to contradict them. They suggested that one class's interest, one political interest or one world view was being served by the Judiciary. We, as a Legislature, live under our Constitution in which we accord independence to the Judiciary and we expect it to be impartial. A concerted campaign has been waged on the airwaves, in the print media and in this House to insinuate that people have been jailed because of their political opinions or because they engaged in a protest. However, nothing could be further from the truth. The Judiciary has not punished anyone who was not brought before the court and asked the simple question of whether he or she would obey the law of the land, established by a democratic Legislature under the Constitution, or if he or she proposed to continue to breach that law. No one who answered that question by stating that they intended to obey the law of the land and undertook to do so has been punished in any way. No one has been punished by the Judiciary for engaging in lawful protest,  nor could they be because that would be an unconstitutional act by a judge and would be subject to immediate appeal if it were attempted.</p>
          <p eId="para_331">The suggestion made repeatedly in this House that people have been punished by a Judiciary which is biased in some institutional sense against them because they have engaged in peaceful protest is untrue, is a black lie and is a calumny on the Judiciary. That is not what anyone has been punished for. Whatever view one has about the bin protest and the tactics adopted and whether, like some Members of this House, one sympathises with the protest, it should not be stated that anyone has been jailed for engaging in a lawful peaceful protest. That is not and will not be the case. They would immediately be entitled to <i>habeas corpus </i>if that was the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_332">There has been a concerted campaign, which has been repeated day in and day out both in this House and in the media, to suggest the Judiciary is prejudiced and biased and is acting at the behest of Government against individuals, but nothing could be further from the truth. Just as this House passed a resolution requiring one of its former Members to comply with the law of the land in another respect and condemned his failure to do so, the same applies to someone who is found by an impartial tribunal, namely the courts, to be in breach of our criminal law in respect of the way in which he or she interferes with the provision of bin services.</p>
          <p eId="para_333">I take this opportunity to emphasise that although as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I have sat through debate after debate and Order of Business after Order of Business where that calumny has been constantly repeated, it is not true and it should not be repeated in this House. It is not true that anyone has been punished for lawful peaceful protest. It is only people who have been asked solemnly and in court to indicate whether they will abide by the law of the land and who have indicated a determination not to do so who have been subjected to the process of contempt of court. It is important to make that point.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCostelloLAB" eId="spk_238">
          <from>Mr. Costello</from>
          <p eId="para_334">The Minister's last point highlights the case made for a judicial council to ensure that there is some form of induction and training for judges. What has happened in the bin case is that there has been considerable disparity in the sentencing process. Two elected members, Councillor Clare Daly and Deputy Joe Higgins, got a month's sentence, but such a sentence was not given to anyone subsequent to that. Some cases were thrown out of court, some people were fined and others got less time in prison. Does that mean that an elected public representative, whom the Minister believes is serving the needs and wishes of the people, will be thrown in prison for a longer period than someone who has committed the same offence? Surely that is a clear example of the disparity in sentences given by different judges. I did not intend to discuss that point, but  the Minister said that what has been said about this case is a calumny and that there is an attempt to undermine and accuse judges of being unfair. However, there is evidence of a disparity in sentences in cases before the courts. We saw that yesterday and we will see it again in the future.</p>
          <p eId="para_335">This issue must be addressed. We have a situation where people are barristers or solicitors one day, but then they are chosen as District Court judges. There are also promotional prospects from the District Court to the Circuit Court and then to the High Court, with which we are dealing here, and the Supreme Court. People are expected to move from an adversarial system of arguing a case in court to sitting on the Bench to dispense justice like Solomon. People must adjust to that new situation – it will not happen overnight. People move from one type of career to another which can mean different expectations and judgments. There is no formal induction or educational process. It is taken that it will be all right on the day because the judges are separate from the Executive. We must consider this issue from the point of view of supervision and induction.</p>
          <p eId="para_336">Some examples were given of comments which were interpreted by some of the people affected as racist and xenophobic and for which the judges apologised. I refer the Minister to the case of Judge Conal Gibbons who put someone in jail for three months for making racist remarks. There is a difference in the manner in which judges mete out judgments in the courts. I expect them to know what they are talking about.</p>
          <p eId="para_337">As we have completed Committee Stage of this Bill, it is not possible to table an amendment to deal with the manner in which this legislation has been presented, although I would like to have done so. The Bill provides for a maximum of 28 judges. We are introducing amending legislation in the Dáil and Seanad to allow for the appointment of two extra judges. We can now raise the number of High Court judges from 26 to a maximum of 28. We may find in a few months' time that we need 29 or 30 judges, which means we would have to go back to the drawing board and to this House. Would it be possible for the Minister on Report Stage to introduce an amendment which would allow some degree of flexibility so that we do not have to waste the time of the Dáil and Seanad in debating this issue? We know there are problems, including the extra work being done by the tribunals and the extra demands due to family law, which result in a need for more judges. Rather than as few as two, the Bill should have contained scope for at least a maximum of five other judges so that the appointments can be made as they are required.</p>
          <p eId="para_338">Part of the reason we are discussing this Bill is the number of tribunals that require High Court judges as chairpersons. Perhaps the work could be done equally by a senior counsel, who could sit as the chair of a tribunal without the need to appoint an extra judge, or we might delegate to this and the other House some of the work the  tribunals are doing. This would be much more effective and economical because of the length of time for which the tribunals go on and the possibility that others will be set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_339">I mentioned yesterday the Barron report, the Nally report and the Cory report, all of which recommend the establishment of tribunals or inquiries. We have been waiting two or three months for the Minister's statement on the report of the Nally committee. The Minister might have privileged information, but the information abroad is that the Nally report recommends an inquiry. Also in the public arena is the information that the Barron report, which deals with the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, recommends an inquiry. If any of these inquiries are established we will immediately have exhausted our allowance of new High Court judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_340">We will have to consider carefully the recommendation of the Committee on Public Accounts that we establish a parliamentary investigator to do the work the Comptroller and Auditor General does for that committee. The Minister's proposals for setting up a commission of investigation, about which he spoke before the summer, should be considered and action taken quickly so that we can get a handle on the work of the tribunals. That would be useful to us in terms of the number of High Court judges we need to appoint.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cuffe</from>
          <p eId="para_341">I thank the Minister for his detailed and discursive reply to the points I raised. I look forward to finding out more about the work of the Judicial Studies Institute and its terms of reference and work programme. It certainly has a role to play in the issues I raised.</p>
          <p eId="para_342">I do not mean to criticise the body of work in which both Judge Neilan and Judge Kenny engage, but I was upset by the remarks that were made, as were many people. I accept that a spokesperson for the Courts Service made a conditional apology on behalf of Judge Neilan at the time, but it is still possible to infer that neither judge understood the gravity of people's concern. I have no doubt that an education process for the Judiciary could play an important role in addressing these issues. An induction procedure, as mentioned by Deputy Costello, might go a long way towards this. I look forward to any further developments in this area.</p>

        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_240">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_343">I welcome the provision for the appointment of two extra High Court judges. We must remember, however, that we are starting from a very low base in terms of the number of High Court judges <i>per capita.</i> We would need to appoint a further 25 judges to bring the number up to the European average. We are also behind on waiting times. However, it is a move in the right direction, although as Deputy Costello said, it should not be necessary to go through the legislative process every time we want to increase the number of judges.</p>
          <p eId="para_344">Judges are now being asked to adjudicate cases of dramatically increasing volume and com plexity. This has been happening for 12 to 15 years. In more recent years we have been setting up a tribunal almost every year, which eats into the time High Court judges have to apply to cases. They are being asked to adjudicate on complex issues such as benchmarking, cattle exports, payments to politicians and mobile phone licences. Mention was made of the need for extra expertise in these matters, which would be welcome. It must take a long time for a judge to come up to speed on an issue such as benchmarking so that he can give a rational judgment.</p>
          <p eId="para_345">The overall shortage of High Court judges is leading to the denial of justice. Some years ago people were forced to go to the courts to establish their entitlements to services in Monaghan general hospital. Despite this, the health board has nibbled away at our services over the years. To counteract this, we decided to go back to the High Court to establish yet again our rights to maternity services, accident and emergency services and so on. We started that process in May 2002, but we have been promised a hearing in late 2004. Justice is being denied to the people of Monaghan.</p>
          <p eId="para_346">One of the two extra High Court judges will be replacing Ms Justice Laffoy on the Laffoy commission, so all we have is a net increase of one judge. That is not acceptable. Any inquiry resulting from the Barron report will take up the time of another High Court judge. While we are moving in the right direction, the increase in the number of judges is totally inadequate. Does the Minister believe that the appointment of one judge will have any impact on the huge waiting lists for the High Court?</p>

        <speech by="#JohnDeasyFG" eId="spk_241">
          <from>Mr. Deasy</from>
          <p eId="para_347">Deputy Costello mentioned the Nally report. The Fine Gael leader mentioned this to the Taoiseach earlier who replied that the Minister was waiting for a legal opinion on what he could say about the report. For some time the Minister has avoided making a statement or answering questions from relatives of those who died in the Omagh bombing. However, a report by Tom Brady in last Friday's <i>Irish Independent</i> contained selective details, leaked by somebody in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, of what is contained in the report. The Minister has refused to answer questions or make a statement in the Dáil about this, but I can pick up the <i>Irish Independent</i> and read details leaked by his Department. It is a disgrace.</p>
          <p eId="para_348">It is about time the Minister faced up to disclosing what is in the report. The Government is trying to hide some very serious facts. After meeting the Northern Ireland police ombudsman, Ms Nuala O'Loan, last week, there was no doubt in our minds about how she felt about the report. She would not have got on a train to Dublin and personally hand-delivered her report to the Minister, Deputy Cowen, if she did not believe it was serious. It is a disgrace that I can pick up the <i>Irish Independent</i> and read about what is in the Nally  report when the Minister has refused to make a statement in the Dáil about this matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_352">On the points made by Deputy Costello, he said a judicial behaviour board would be necessary because of the disparity of sentencing in respect of contempt sentences imposed on various protesters. That is exactly the function that a judicial behaviour board would not be involved in. It is not there to act as some kind of appeal or corrective mechanism to ensure that one judge does what another judge does.</p>

I therefore refuse to accept the Deputy's implied criticism of the sentences.</p>

          <p eId="para_406">The advice on Committee Stage was that this amendment could not be accepted and that it went beyond the scope of the Bill. The Bill deals only with the transposition into Irish law of Ireland's obligation to the protocol to the nuclear safeguards agreement of 1973. We do not see any necessity for the amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_407">The Bill is specifically aimed at implementing Ireland's obligations under the additional protocol to the 1973 safeguards agreement. The additional protocol relates to specific activities, including dual purpose equipment and materials mentioned in the protocol, and is aimed at strengthening the effectiveness of the existing safeguards agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_408">The 1973 safeguards agreement involving the non-nuclear weapons states which are party to the non-proliferation treaty was made on foot of the treaty. Ireland is a party to both the agreement and the treaty and also participating in the implementation in Ireland of the safeguards agreement. The objective of both the additional protocol and the safeguards agreement is to prevent the diversion of nuclear energy from  peaceful uses to nuclear weapons and other explosive devices.</p>
          <p eId="para_409">Ireland, as an EU member state, is committed to working towards an EU common policy related to criminal sanctions for the illegal export or brokering of weapons of mass destruction and related material, including nuclear weapons. This process is taking place under the aegis of its action plan for the implementation of the basic principles for an EU strategy against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction. Furthermore, legislation is already in place in Ireland prohibiting the unlicensed export of dual use material, including nuclear related technology. The Government, therefore, does not see a need for this amendment which I have to oppose.</p>

          <p eId="para_428">These amendments address the need to establish credible deterrents and sanctions for the offences of unauthorised production, use, acquisition, transfer and processing of material that could be used in the making of nuclear weapons and thus contribute to the spread of weapons of mass destruction and of obstructing nuclear weapons inspections. They would ensure the introduction of proper State sanctions for domestic violations of the nuclear non-proliferation treaty. Amend ment No. 21 is related to amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</p>
          <p eId="para_429">There are two problems in the legislation. First, paragraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of section 3(2) propose that offences under this section should be treated either as indictible or summary offences. It is not clear what will govern whether an offence is an indictable or summary offence. Second, the penalties for these offences, six months imprisonment and a €3,000 fine for a summary offence and four years imprisonment or a €500,000 fine for an indictible offence, are minor. Section 14 outlines that all other offences under the legislation will be dealt with summarily and the consequence of conviction will also be minor. There will be a maximum of six months imprisonment and/or a fine not exceeding €3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_430">The Sinn Féin amendments recognise three classes of offence within the legislation and propose three classes of sanction. An offence under section 3, the violation of the non-proliferation treaty by contributing to the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, cannot be construed as anything but a grave offence. This is a crime against humanity which deserves the strongest possible deterrent and the harshest available sanction. A refusal to comply with inspections, the obstruction of inspectors or the deliberate deception offence under section 7(9) and section 9 are not minor offences, nor is the section 12 offence which involves a failure to provide information or keep documentation required by the national authority or the IAEA. Iraq stood accused of a similar offence. The penalty in that instance, which the Government seemed to back, was the invasion and levelling of the country, the violation of its sovereignty and loss of life.</p>
          <p eId="para_431">The least this domestic legislation can do is to provide a credible deterrent and sanction by threat of a substantial prison sentence and/or a fine. On the other hand, the section 10 offence of failure to notify and the section 11 offence of leaking or publishing so-called privileged information are minor. I question whether such information should be privileged as this will prevent transparency which is in the public interest. We, therefore, propose to retain the designation of these offences as summary and liable, on conviction, to six months imprisonment and/or a fine of €3,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_432">Section 11 relates to the offence of leaking or publishing so-called privileged information. I question that such information should be privileged as this will prevent transparency, which is in the public interest. I contend that both of these offences are minor.

A fine of €3,000 on summary conviction is minor when one is talking about such offences. I ask that further consideration be given to this. I do not believe amendment No. 13 would prevent a conviction being sought and gained – it would have the effect of ensuring the gravity of the offence was taken into account and the sentence corresponded with the offence. The fine mentioned is too low and should be substantially increased if this Bill is to have any deterrent effect.</p>

          <p eId="para_438">Based on legal advice, I am not prepared to accept the amendments. I do not think the Deputy or any Member would want to find that having accepted the amendment, it would not be possible to convict a person on a summary conviction. While it may be a matter for discussion later, I would point out that on conviction on indictment, it would be a matter of a fine not exceeding €500,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding four years. I feel this is sufficient and the punishment fits the crime.</p>

          <p eId="para_442">I raise this as a matter of ensuring constitutional rights are protected.

          <p eId="para_443">I can clarify the position. Section 7 (1)(<i>k</i>) of the Bill provides that an authorised officer, for the purpose of ensuring that the Act has been complied with, may require a person to give any information to the officer which the latter may reasonably require in the inspection or investigation. The amendment would mean such information would not be admissible in criminal proceedings against the person from whom the information was obtained or that person's employer.</p>
          <p eId="para_444">On the basis of legal advice received by my Department, we cannot accept this amendment. I understand from our legal advisers that the insertion of such a provision is not necessary as the matter is covered in common or case law. Such a provision has not been inserted in previous legislation. To do so in this Bill would have a knock-on effect for other legislation. It is obviously something that would require detailed consideration and such consideration is not possible given the time available for this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_445">My legal advice tells me that while a person would not, under existing law, be obliged to incriminate himself or herself, the person would be obliged to provide information reasonably required. In these circumstances, the general rules of common or case law would apply. Accepting this would go against the normal process of inspections or official visits to premises. The Bill is sufficient as this section stands. I hope the Deputy accepts the insertion of this would not help us in achieving our objectives.</p>

      <b>Mr. Timmins</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if, with respect to establishing entitlements under the mid term review agreement, farmers who leased their land during the entire reference period has entitlements; if not, the other similar groups which have no entitlements; the plans he has to address this; and if he will make a statement on the matter.

        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_300">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_457">Under the mid-term review of the Agenda 2000 agreement, the single decoupled payment is for farmers who actively farmed during the reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002. Entitlements will be established for them which they must activate by submitting a valid area aid/single payment application in 2005. The single payment will be based on the average number of animals, or the average number of hectares in the case of arable aid, on which payments were made under the livestock premia and arable aid schemes in respect of the three reference years 2000, 2001 and 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_458">The single payment is calculated by taking the three-yearly average number of animals or arable hectares which attracted payment and multiplying them by the payment rate for 2002 in respect of livestock, or by €383.04 per hectare in the case of arable aid. Accordingly, farmers who had let their entire land during the reference period cannot establish entitlements. However, if such farmers  can demonstrate to the satisfaction of my Department that they were obliged to lease their land because of reasons of <i>force majeure, </i>or exceptional circumstances, they may request that entitlements be established for them on the basis of the years 1997, 1998 and 1999. The main group of farmers who will not have entitlements established for them are those who were not actively farming and drawing down premia payments during the reference period.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_301">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_459">The Minister said that farmers who did not draw down premia payments during the reference period will not have entitlements established for them. In that context is he also referring to 1997, 1998 and 1999? Does the Minister agree that it would be undesirable if several groups emerged to argue against the Fischler proposals similar to the milk rights group, which was in operation for nearly 20 years and the concerns of which were only recently addressed? Would he agree that there is something inherently unfair about a system whereby someone who leased their land, be it without any unusual circumstances, had no indication that such leasing would lead to a negative economic impact for them down the road, and that something must be done to address the difficulty these people have? I know that many of the farming organisations have adopted an attitude of, "tough luck – you lost out", but if we are interested in fairness in our society we must address these difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">To what is the Minister referring when he points to <i>force majeure</i>? What of an individual who was sick for a long period, for example, someone not necessarily in the farm retirement scheme, who leased his or her land? What about the individual who never farmed for premia? I recently spoke to a vet who has about 400 clients, approximately ten of whom never claimed premia. Ten is not a huge number, but enough to have major implications for those involved. Can the Minister give any indication that those people will be facilitated in any manner?</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_461"><i>Force majeure,</i> or exceptional circumstances, could be any of the following: the death of a farmer during the relevant period; long-term professional incapacity, that is, sickness; a severe natural disaster gravely affecting the holdings of agricultural land; the accidental destruction of livestock on the holding if, for example, they fell victim to an electric storm; or epizootic diseases affecting part or all of the farmer's livestock, forcing a farmer to destock during the period as a result of one of those diseases. A farmer applying for <i>force majeure</i> will have to provide appropriate evidence and each case will be examined on its merits. The Department and I intend to make a decision next year to establish an appeals body for difficult and exceptional cases, which will be dealt with as equitably as possible. In the case of <i>force majeure, </i>the quotas given to people will be taken from our annual  entitlement of quota and there will, therefore, be a reduction in the overall national quota. If there is a very large number of <i>force majeure cases, </i>over the ceiling, that could mean a linear reduction in our national quota entitlement.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">Could the Minister confirm that entitlements will come from the national reserve and will he outline what he considers will be the reserve? I understand the figure is 3%. Will payments come from the national reserve or from the entitlements outside the reserve?</p>
          <p eId="para_463">I welcome the announcement by the Minister that he is going to establish an appeals body and I ask him to do so as soon as possible. I see no reason why it can not be set up straightaway in the new year so that the appeals can be dealt with as quickly as possible, allowing those who are adjudged to qualify to get their payments at the end of next year.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_464">The first category to be catered for is the <i>force majeure</i> category. Those payments will come from the top of our national ceiling when there is a deduction of up to 3% for the national reserve, and that will be made up from our gross entitlements to create this national reserve. Farmers may apply for an allocation of entitlements from the national reserve. They will, for example, include farmers who start this year, qualifying perhaps because of their age. Other likely categories are farmers who receive a holding or part of a holding by way of an inheritance; farmers who bought a holding or part of a holding in the reference period, or not later than 31 May 2003; farmers who entered into a multi-annual lease of a holding or part of a holding; and farmers who made investments or purchased land in the reference period, or not later than 31 May 2003. That type of farmer, younger farmers, particularly, with an appropriate green certificate or qualification, will have priority entitlements from the national reserve.</p>

          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_468">As the Deputy is aware the reported animal health and disease problems of the early to mid-1990s in the Askeaton area were the subject of a multiagency investigation under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in which my Department participated. The report of this most comprehensive investigation was published in August 2001 and details of the studies and laboratory tests of animals of all farms, except one farm that withdrew voluntarily in the early stages from the study, are presented in chapter 3 of the main report of the investigations of animal health problems in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_469">Briefly, these results are comprised of the periodic haematology and biochemistry analyses on blood samples collected from a selected group of monitor animals. Additional blood, milk and other samples were collected as required to investigate specific animal health or production issues. Post-mortem investigations and analyses are also undertaken on any animal carcases from these farms submitted to my Department's regional veterinary laboratory in Limerick. Milk samples were also analysed by culture or cell count methods as required by the ongoing investigators and no additional checks on milk or meat products, including feeding trials, were deemed necessary based on the findings of the animal health aspects of the investigation. All such products originating from these farms would have been subjected to the normal food hygiene controls at the processing intake points.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MaryUpton" eId="spk_308">
          <from>Dr. Upton</from>
          <p eId="para_470">I accept the report published was comprehensive but it contained a number of significant gaps. Will the Minister outline whether tests were carried out on meat and milk in terms of animal feeding trials? I base that question on the potential risk to human health. It is not good enough to say animals are monitored for hygiene when they reach the factory. That is true but this is not a fundamental question on hygiene regarding animal products. It is much more significant than that. Concerns have been expressed for many years about animal and human health and environmental factors. Many of them have not been discounted. If feeding trials were not carried out, why not? I would like an answer to that specific question.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" eId="spk_309">
          <from>Mr. Walsh</from>
          <p eId="para_471">The EPA carried out a comprehensive study in this area. All relevant tests were undertaken. Feed tests were deemed unnecessary based on the animal health aspects of the investigation which were, ante and post mortem tests at the various processing plants and they went much further than the hygiene aspects of the study. The overall conclusion of the study, as published in the final report, was that there was no evidence that animal health or production on any of the participating farms were subject to unusual adverse influences during the periods of observation. The incidence of diseases were generally within acceptable limits and no serious disease  outbreaks were encountered. These results, together with those of the other studies, that comprised the Askeaton investigations, provide no evidence to suggest that animal health problems in the Askeaton area were significantly different to those of other comparable farming areas in Ireland.</p>

          <p eId="para_472">I accept the findings of the EPA report in so far as they were substantial and were published. I put it to the Minister that the report contains major gaps. Those gaps raise questions of unfinished business from where, potentially, problems will arise. I would be most unhappy to learn that no tests were sought in terms of animal feeding trials to show whether there was a safety issue regarding human health arising from the consumption of products derived from animals in that area.</p>

          <p eId="para_473">The report contained no evidence that human health was in any way affected by products produced in the area. This was a most comprehensive and in-depth exercise, based on scientific evidence, in the course of which specialist expertise from various quarters was brought to bear on analyses of animal health, human health and environmental issues in the Askeaton area. In so far as the possible causes of animal health difficulties experienced in the Askeaton area in the past are concerned, I believe this report speaks for itself.</p>

      asked the

          <p eId="para_475">It was only in 2000 that the EU regulation on organic farming was extended to the livestock sector. This sector accounts for the bulk of organic production in Ireland. Work then began on the preparation of secondary legislation empowering my officials to enforce the regulation. Shortly afterwards, however, an application was made by an organic organisation to the High Court for a judicial review of the proposals for implementing the regulation. I was advised that it would not be appropriate to introduce secondary legislation until the court had given its judgment. The High Court gave judgment, in my Department's favour, earlier this year. My officials immediately began discussions with the three bodies representing Irish organic operators, with a view to reaching agreement on arrangements for the future regulation of the sector. I hope these discussions can be concluded shortly. At that stage I intend to introduce the necessary secondary legislation. It should of course be borne in mind that general legislation, not specifi cally related to the organic sector, already exists to protect the consumer against false labelling of goods and produce.</p>

          <p eId="para_476">The Minister mentioned 2000. I am not sure if we are speaking about the same directive. I am referring to directive EC/2092/91. I would like confirmation from the Minister that this is the correct directive which includes amendments defining organic farming and which requires national member states to put in place legislation by way of statutory instrument to deal with people wrongly labelling organic produce. We have had examples of many types of mislabelling from beef to poultry. We are now dealing, internationally, with GMOs. Even products such as queen's potatoes are being wrongly labelled and a cheaper and inferior product is being sold. The Minister should not waste time and should ensure the required statutory instrument is put in place. One of the groups, IOFGA, was approved in 1993. Why was the statutory instrument not put in place then? The Government was already required to do so. What advice does the Minister offer to growers who are subject to inspection, are required to keep records and to pay a licence fee, when they come up against another producer selling food as organic when it has not been certified as such? What advice does the Minister give to the grower who has gone to significant trouble and expense to ensure his or her produce is certified organic? When will the statutory instrument be introduced? It should not be tied into any court action. It is long overdue.</p>

          <p eId="para_477">The non-livestock sector came into effect in 1991-92 and it was only in 2000 that this was extended to the livestock sector. It was the livestock sector that was being complained about in the publication to which the Deputy referred. There are three different bodies involved. If there were unanimity or consensus across the three bodies, it would make life much easier for the Department because the statutory instrument is ready, but the three organic bodies are not. A High Court action was taken and the Attorney General's advice to my predecessors and me was that it would be inappropriate to introduce legislation while the action was under way.</p>

Germany had at one point, and perhaps still has, about eight. It does not seem to confuse the Germans, and I am not sure why it should confuse the Irish Government. It is a directive. Will the Minister speed up the implementation of the statutory instrument so that there is clear protection for organic producers against people who are effectively trying to profit by ignoring the rules? We have had many examples in this country of the rules being ignored, in BSE, foot and mouth disease, beef tribunal evidence and so on. Will  the Minister end the temptation for people to ignore the rules on organic certification and undermine the sector? I understand that he is distinguishing between livestock and non-livestock farming. However, the directive has been there since 1991 for non-livestock farming. Does the Minister not think it is high time that it was put into effect? If the statutory instrument is ready, when will that happen?</p>

        <speech by="#NoelTracey" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Treacy)</from>
          <p eId="para_485">Food labelling is a complicated and broadly based area to which we have devoted considerable attention. Our primary aim in doing so is to protect consumer interests and ensure that the consumer is properly informed. We were concerned in particular at the difficulty caused for consumers by the multiplicity of Departments and agencies involved in consumer information on labelling and especially in the enforcement of the regulations. As a result, and following a recommendation that we received from the consumer liaison panel, we set up the food labelling group in July 2002 to examine issues of concern to consumers on labelling.</p>
          <p eId="para_486">In December 2002, the labelling group presented its report to us. It contained 21 recommendations covering general labelling rules, policy and enforcement, consumer education and awareness, and origin. We accepted the recommendations of the group. As the recommendations covered issues within the responsibility of several Departments and agencies, we set up an interdepartmental and interagency group to make progress on implementation of the recommendations. I am pleased to say that considerable progress has been achieved in implementing the report, especially on the two main issues emanating from it, the centralisation of enforcement of food labelling regulations in the Food Safety  Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the definition of origin of meat.</p>
          <p eId="para_487">On the centralisation of enforcement, responsibility for general food labelling legislation was transferred from the Department of Enterprise Trade and Employment to the Department of Health and Children in June 2003, with the enforcement of those regulations coming within the remit of the FSAI. Responsibility for the enforcement of our Department's beef labelling regulations was transferred to the FSAI last January and responsibility for other labelling regulations will be formally transferred shortly. On the definition of origin of meat, there was full agreement in the food labelling group that consumers should have a right to information on the origin of the meat they cook in their homes or eat outside it. While the group could not agree on how origin should be defined, there was unanimous agreement that further research was necessary to establish consumers' wishes in the area. At our request, the consumer liaison panel drew up a strategy for that research, which it has commissioned. At this stage, the research is almost completed and we expect that the consumer panel will report to us on the results before the end of this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_488">I will briefly outline progress on other recommendations of the food labelling group. The food labelling group recognised the concerns of consumers that there needed to be clearer information on labels on allergens. An EU regulation on allergen labelling on food was adopted by the European Council and Parliament in September 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_489"><i>Additional Information.</i>Two proposals are being worked on at EU level relating to nutritional health and functional claims and nutritional labelling. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment has been asked to incorporate a module on food safety, labelling and consumer issues into the primary and secondary school curricula. The group's recommendation on informing the consumer of the price per weight unit was addressed in legislation brought in by the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, in March 2003.</p>
          <p eId="para_490">The labelling group emphasised the responsibility of the food sector to produce safe food and to provide on all food and drink labels information that is clear, accurate and easy to read. In July 2003, we launched an industry guide for clear labelling for food and drinks which was prepared by Food and Drink Industry Ireland. Significant progress has therefore been made and we intend to pursue the matter to ensure that deficiencies in food labelling are addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">On that report, which was published in December 2002, perhaps the Minister will tell me how many of the 21 recommendations have been implemented. He mentioned enforcement. Does the Food Safety Authority of Ireland  have to monitor and enforce labelling? Does it take a proactive stand? The fact that a few months ago one of the farm organisations carried out testing on beef and proved conclusively that the product being presented to the consumer was misrepresented left much to be desired. Nothing was, or can be, done about that. Has the Food Safety Authority of Ireland itself carried out any testing since then and, if so, do we have an indication of what the result might be? Does the Minister liaise with that group?</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_492">The Food Safety Authority of Ireland is very proactive. They are eminent and highly professional people, with excellent staff across the country. The first main recommendation of the report related to the fact that there was a great deal of confusion regarding the regulatory authorities and the implementation of the various measures that they were going to take. It recommended that the Food Safety Authority of Ireland should be the body on which we should place most of the responsibility for enforcement. Agreement was reached on that and, as I said, responsibility was transferred from my Department to the FSAI earlier this year. Various other agencies and Departments are in the process of transferring responsibility to it. Obviously, in the report itself, there was no full and clear recommendation on the definition of the origin of a product. According to the report, it was necessary that we carry out research on that. That research is proceeding apace. We hope to receive a report on it before the end of the year, and we will certainly act on it as soon as we do so.</p>

        <speech by="#BillyGodfreyTimminsFG" eId="spk_324">
          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_493">If the Minister does not have the figure to hand, I will be quite happy to accept it in writing. How many of the 21 recommendations have been implemented? The consumer liaison panel states that it is not sure what the consumer wants on the labelling of origin. Surely people are entitled to know where something came from? It is very simple, and I am not sure if one needs to carry out research on that aspect. We are all aware of the ongoing milk price war. Does the Minister have any concerns at the labelling of milk in supermarkets? Many people going into supermarkets are perhaps driven by price more than labelling, and that is undesirable. Does the Minister agree that if this price war continues, it may have a negative, knock-on impact for farmers and farm incomes in the dairy industry?</p>

          <p eId="para_494">Several of the recommendations contained in the report have been implemented. I cannot tell the Deputy the exact number off the top of my head, but I can certainly get the information to him. On milk and other food products, the research clearly shows that consumers want quality and safety in what they purchase. Price comes into the equation after that and origin is not a major criterion that consumers use to make a decision on what they purchase, though obviously a small number of consumers will take  that into account. In marketing, there are many people who believe that origin could distort the market from an Irish point of view as we export 90% of all the food products that we produce in this country. We have been very successful in international markets and we must take cognisance of the record, our success, and the capacity to expand the food industry on this island for the benefit of our people. Taking all that into account, we await the report, and we will act positively on it thereafter.</p>

      <b>Mr. Ferris</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if he will support an all-Ireland ban on the growth and importation of genetically modified crops.
      [25751/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_326">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_496">The production and use of GM crops and crop products in the European Union is governed by EU regulations which have been adopted by the European Parliament and Council. Under those regulations, all GM crops and crop products are subject to rigorous scientific testing before being approved for use in the European Union. Once approved, they must be labelled as containing GMOs and fully traceable through the supply chain. The regulations also address the issue of co-existence of GM crops with conventional and organic crops. It is not possible, therefore, to ban the importation and growing of such crops.</p>
          <p eId="para_497">The controls to be applied to the growing of GM crops will be drawn up and implemented at member state level under guidelines issued by the European Commission. This so-called subsidiarity approach will allow member states to put in place stringent controls to minimise cross-contamination between GM crops and conventional or organic crops. In this regard, the Department of Agriculture and Food has established an expert group involving the relevant Departments and State agencies to examine all aspects relating to the growing of GM crops. The Deputy should also be aware that responsibility for legislation relating to the assessment of the safety of GMOs and their approval for release into the environment rests with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MartinFerrisSF" eId="spk_327">
          <from>Mr. Ferris</from>
          <p eId="para_498">In reply to a question I asked him last month the Minister for Agriculture and Food stated each member state would have the right, under the subsidiarity principle, to introduce its own strategy. Does the Minister of State agree that this approach will be a nonsense if GM crops are allowed to be grown in one part of Ireland but not in another? Does he agree that the authorities on both sides of the Border need to adopt a common approach? Given the availability of evidence, does he agree that the correct approach is to ban GM crops in both jurisdictions?</p>
          <p eId="para_499">I would also like the Minister of State to comment on the fact that the Department's attitude to GM crops has been described as "positive but precautionary". Given that the weight of evidence proves that GM crops are not of economic benefit to farmers or consumers, on what is this positive assessment based? It is clear that such crops are not necessary to feed the hungry people of the world, as food is over-produced globally but does not reach those most in need. Does the Minister of State agree that the real motive behind genetic modification is to tighten the main agri-food corporations' control of the world food system? This is being done by patenting seeds and creating terminator seeds.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NoelTracey" eId="spk_328">
          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_500">I do not agree with the Deputy's suggestion that the principle of subsidiarity should be flouted by any member state. We have to take account of topography, climatic conditions and the differences between member states. Under the Treaty of Rome, the EU principle of subsidiarity has always given member states the right to implement the necessary guidelines and regulations at local level. Ireland adopts such a position on all issues of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">When the Deputy referred to a "positive but precautionary" attitude to GM crops, he was quoting from a report produced by the interdepartmental committee on biotechnology, which I established in October 2000 when I was Minister of State with responsibility for science and technology. The committee concluded that we should adopt a positive approach in the interests of science and mankind and with the aim of ensuring society could benefit from research and innovation, while being very precautionary as regards evolution and conclusions. That is the line we have taken at EU level as a result of the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_502">The Deputy can be certain that the Government and the Department are prepared at all times to consider innovative methods that make a huge contribution to illness, research and the treatment of different problems throughout the world. We cannot place a boundary on research, regardless of where we are. We have to consider it in a positive light, while managing and using it carefully. In this case we are guided by our experts who work on the various EU committees. We await their conclusions and the further directives that will be published in the Official Journal of the EU shortly. We will make the necessary decisions about statutory instruments or new legislation when conclusions have been arrived at.</p>

          <p eId="para_503">Will the Minister of State take on board the tremendous credibility of Irish agricultural produce on the world stage and the damage that will be done if GM produce is allowed to be grown in this jurisdiction? Will he take on board the fact that the motivation of those who control GM production relates primarily to the control of the world food chain?</p>

          <from>Mr. Treacy</from>
          <p eId="para_504">The motivation of those to whom  the Deputy refers is twofold. I am not sure that he is correct. Scientists do tremendous research based on their intellectual capacity and scientific qualifications. They are motivated by research, innovation and arriving at conclusions. The corporate world may have other priorities but I cannot judge what they are. I am sure that scientists are very committed to making progress and ensuring they serve and make their mark in the job they do. The Deputy can be absolutely certain that the Government is proud of the Irish food industry and is careful to protect it.</p>
          <p eId="para_505">The Deputy spoke originally about the circumstances on the island of Ireland. The Minister, Deputy Walsh, and his team have played a major and successful role on the North-South agriculture body. We regret very much that the Northern Ireland Assembly is not in place and we cannot continue that progress. We will ensure, as far as we can, that there is absolute consensus on making progress on this issue. We will take into account the progress and decisions being made in Europe, the opportunities, or otherwise, that genetic modification may present and its possible effects on the food industry on the island of Ireland.</p>

      <b>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      the position in relation to the elimination of bovine tuberculosis.
      [25541/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#LiamAylward" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_331">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture and Food (Mr. Aylward)</from>
          <p eId="para_507">The bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme which complies fully with the relevant EU legislation has reduced the level of tuberculosis from 17% of animals in 1955 to 0.3% today. The maintenance of this low incidence is essential if Ireland is to trade internationally with the highest international disease status. This is of immense benefit to the economy, given that 90% of bovines are exported in one form or another. Our controls have achieved a steady decline in the numbers of TB reactors since 1999. Some 44,900 reactors were identified in that year, compared with less than 29,000 in 2002. Similar numbers are likely to be identified this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_508">Further progress towards final eradication is constrained, however, by the presence of a wildlife reservoir of infection. In this regard, the Department of Agriculture and Food operates an active wildlife programme nationwide. The four area badger study has just been completed. The final report on the study is being prepared for publication. The Department also has in place an ongoing research programme and liaises with international bodies and organisations in relation to developments on TB eradication.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JimOKeeffe" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Mr. J. O'Keeffe</from>
          <p eId="para_509">The information provided by  the Minister of State is helpful. Perhaps I can tease out a couple of areas in respect of the bovine TB eradication programme. An Oireachtas committee said about 15 years ago that it should not be called an eradication programme but a programme of "containment". Essentially, we are talking about the elimination of the disease in internationally acceptable terms. Have we reached that stage after 50 years of the scheme? How near are we to it? I would also like to ask about the cost of the scheme. I have read that expenditure on the bovine eradication or elimination scheme, in present day money terms, has been about €2 billion to date. Does the Minister of State believe we have got good value for money in the context of the results produced?</p>
          <p eId="para_510">Have there been any new research developments? I read about a blood test that might produce a more accurate result. Has this fallen by the wayside? I know that tuberculin was improved at one stage. Have we reached the optimum level in respect of testing procedures? Have there been any new developments?</p>
          <p eId="para_511">The final point I would like to make relates to wildlife. Many have spoken about badgers and other wildlife during the years. It has been suggested to me that the increase in planting and the consequent increase in wildlife habitats has meant that the problem has worsened. A reference was once made to a wildlife vaccination programme but I am not sure if that was feasible or possible. Can the Minister of State touch on this aspect of the matter in his reply?</p>

          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_513">The fact that the present day figure is 0.3% means, in effect, that we have reached the highest international standards in our disease status. This is widely accepted to be true, not only of TB but also of brucellosis. Very effective work has been done to control BSE. I am satisfied that we have come a long way and the figures speak for themselves. In 1960 there were 140,000 reactors. This figure has dropped dramatically. One also has to accept that there are much larger herd numbers today. We have reached the highest international standard. These facts must be considered in the context of the fact that we export some €7 billion worth of food, which is a fairly minimal figure in the context of what we export overall. The cost of the eradication of TB and brucellosis amounts to €52 million this year, of which approximately €32 million is dedicated to TB eradication.</p>
          <p eId="para_514">Research on vaccination is ongoing. We liaise with the various international groups, particularly those in Northern Ireland, England and New Zealand, but a suitable vaccine has not been found to date. There is no doubt in anybody's mind that the badger seems to be the main cause of the spread of TB in Ireland. We have a series of programmes in place in this regard and the rel evant report will be published shortly. We have been very successful regarding certain pilot projects in different counties. The programmes operate under licence and strict controls, but we must maintain a balance. Our animal rights friends are concerned about the number of badgers that are being destroyed. We have to take all such considerations on board.</p>

This is causing extreme hardship for farmers and the costs they incur are catastrophic.

Has there been a discernible decline in the level of TB infection because of the new system of registration? On the basis of the statistics the Minister of State quoted earlier, it seems that the trend on the graph is going in the right direction. How much credit for the downward spiral on the graph can be attributed to the new system of registration on individual farms?</p>

          <p eId="para_531">There will possibly be a reduction in the number of animals and the  movement of animals. This will have positive effects on all the various diseases from which our animal herds suffer. It remains to be seen.</p>
          <p eId="para_532">Deputy Sargent asked about progress on vaccination. Our researchers in Abbotstown and elsewhere are working extremely hard to find a suitable vaccine but have not found one to date. I do not want to say I foresee the production of a vaccine at any stage because it has been awaited for many years without success. Furthermore, research has been carried out in many other countries and they have not found one either.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">I would not like to anticipate what might appear in the Estimates but we are confident that the Department of Agriculture and Food will receive a reasonable sum from the Department of Finance. I hope we will not have to increase the fees and, if we do not, we will all be happy.</p>
          <p eId="para_534">As regards independent valuers, the system has been well received. An appeals system is also in place and the hardship grants have been maintained. To respond to Deputy Crawford's question on whether the system has been changed, it has not been changed and I do not envisage change in the near future.</p>

      <b>Mr. O'Dowd</b>
      asked the 
      <b>Minister for Agriculture and Food</b>
      if he has implemented a code of practice for the special investigation unit of his Department; and if he will make a statement on the matter.
      [25461/03]
    </p>
        </question>
        <speech by="#LiamAylward" eId="spk_353">
          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_541">This question should be placed in its proper context. The Department has responsibility for a substantial sector of the economy and, correspondingly, for public health and animal welfare, and for ensuring that we meet international trading requirements. In discharging its responsibility, the Department operates a wide range of programmes involving the control and eradication of disease and the supervision of food and foodstuff production. Traceability is an essential element of these programmes. The Department officials primarily involved in administering these programmes are assisted in their work by officials from the Department's special investigation unit.</p>
          <p eId="para_542">The special investigation unit was originally established to deal with serious practices and problems relating to the use in animal production  of illegal substances such as hormones and angel dust. Its work in this area has resulted in the successful prosecution of more than 220 people since 1996 for offences under the animal remedies legislation, of whom 67 received custodial sentences. Fines of €870,000 were also imposed. The effectiveness of the actions taken is evidenced by the ongoing overall low levels of positive samples and the absence of residues of growth promoters in targeted testing in recent years under the national residue monitoring plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_543">The remit of the special investigation unit extends to assisting different areas of my Department in the operation of various schemes and regulations and, in particular, to investigate breaches of legislation governing animal disease control, animal medication, the production, processing, trading or otherwise handling of animals, carcases or meat intended for human consumption, or the manufacture or trading of feeding stuffs. Many of these investigations are conducted jointly with the Garda Síochána and the customs authorities. The special investigation unit assists with inquiries from other public agencies and, similarly, it co-operates with other national enforcement agencies under international mutual assistance arrangements.</p>
          <p eId="para_544">Officials in the special investigation unit are departmental officers who operate fully in accordance with national and European Union legislation. Their activities have formed the basis for almost all the successful court prosecutions in recent years which, in itself, is clear evidence of the legality of the actions taken. The investigative procedures comply fully with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of the person or persons being investigated. They follow a similar type of criminal investigation carried out by the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_545">On occasion, investigations by the unit involve the use of search warrants during which all the rules of evidence are complied with. Interviews are carried out under caution and statements are prepared for use in court by counsel on behalf of the Department. Existing special investigation unit guidelines and operational procedures under headings such as authorisation, legislation, communications, investigations, assistance to other public bodies and customer service are currently being codified.</p>
          <p eId="para_546">The reality is that the vast majority of farmers and others comply with the legislative requirements and, therefore, have no reason to be concerned with the activities of the special investigation unit, which fulfils a major role in sustaining and protecting the interests of farmers and the high reputation of the Irish food industry by eliminating the malpractice of the few who operate outside the law.</p>

          <from>Mr. Timmins</from>
          <p eId="para_547">I thank the Minister of State for his reply and acknowledge the importance of having a special investigation unit. Given the negative impact that interfering with food safety has  on the industry, anyone involved in such practices should be debarred from practising or should lose his or her herd number. Notwithstanding this, it is important that the special investigation unit operates under a code of practice. I am delighted, therefore, that its practices and guidelines will be codified. When will the code of practice be introduced?</p>

          <p eId="para_548">While I cannot give an exact date, it is being worked on in the Department and I expect that work to be completed in a number of months. Difficulties arise when one gives a date in this House and does not make the deadline. The intention of the Department is to have the matter addressed as quickly as possible.</p>

          <p eId="para_550">I noted from a recent breakdown by county of the special investigation unit's raids since January 2002 that some counties have a significantly higher number of raids than others. What is the reason for this? Are the counties in question less compliant or is the unit more active and enthusiastic in these areas?</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#LiamAylward" eId="spk_358">
          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_551">One must assume there is more activity in certain counties. The unit, which used to operate from Kildare Street, now operates from a centre in Maynooth and responds to circumstances as they arise. The proof of its success is its record in court cases, which speaks for itself. Convictions have been secured and substantial fines imposed, which proves that this relatively small, but nevertheless effective, unit has done an excellent job and successfully dealt with many difficulties, including the use of angel dust and hormones, the BSE problem and other diseases Deputies have mentioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_552">We anticipate that a significant Bill will come before the House next year to establish the unit on a permanent basis. Members will recall that earlier this year I extended by 12 months the relevant Act, which was emergency legislation introduced during the foot and mouth disease crisis. That legislation will be built into the new Bill on which Members will have an opportunity to have their say in the new year.</p>

          <p eId="para_554">The annual Estimates process, which involves discussion between each Department and the Department of Finance on allocations for 2004, has been taking place over the past few months. The process involves the examination of various options in the light of the expected Exchequer position and competing demands for limited funds. The first stage of the Estimates and budget process for 2004 will be completed shortly with the publication of the 2004 Abridged Estimates volume next week, on 13 November 2003.

          <p eId="para_555">As the Minister's reply does not give me much ammunition with which to find out what cuts are likely, I will highlight some of the cuts which took place last year. Teagasc, Bord Glais, Bord Bia, the REP scheme and other bodies were badly hit in last year's budget, with funding for Teagasc cut by 13%, and funding for Bord Glais, Bord Bia and the REP scheme cut by 32%, 13% and 19%, respectively. The amalgamation of Bord Bia and Bord Glais has also been recommended. What plans does the Minister have to ensure that these agencies do not suffer disproportionately again?</p>

          <p eId="para_559">All will be revealed on 13 November and subsequently in the budget in which some tidying up can be done. While funding for Teagasc was cut last year and the organisation underwent some streamlining, its services were not affected and it continued to do a tremendous job, especially in regard to the information meetings for the mid-term review. Bord Bia and Bord Glais also tightened up their operations.</p>
          <p eId="para_560">The REP scheme receives a substantial allocation each year. In the past two years, however, its allocation has not been used in full and had to be redistributed because an insufficient number of farmers applied to the scheme. We have tried to simplify REPS, introduced computerisation and in every way sought to encourage farmers into the scheme. Teagasc provides independent planners and farmers can get from €5,500 per annum up to over €12,000 per annum if they are involved in the organic REPS. To date, however, we have found it extremely difficult to get farm ers to apply to participate in this worthwhile scheme.</p>

According to a recent article in one of the newspapers, one of the Teagasc personnel said that farmers would have to become minders of bats. Will there be funding available to assist farmers in controlling bats, however that might be done?</p>

Furthermore, the objective is to ensure that farming is carried out with the highest consideration for the environment. I have published codes of good farming practice and encouraged farmers to participate in the rural environment protection scheme. It is a disappointment that more farmers are not involved. The number currently involved is approximately 35,000 and it is my ambition to double it.</p>
          <p eId="para_563">There is a substantial annual income available but we want a return for that in terms of better farming practices, better regard for the environment and the elimination of pollution. The wanton pollution of our rivers and streams is to be deplored. There are improvements but I want more. If substantial amounts of money are paid out each year, we want a return for it through better farming practice that is in harmony with a better environment.</p>

          <from>Mr. Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_565">A total of 157 cases of BSE have been confirmed to date in 2003, including one case from a depopulated herd. In addition, depopulation measures were applied in a further three cases where animals tested positive on the screening test but where it was not possible to confirm the result because of the condition of the sample. The number of confirmed cases this year represents a reduction of more than 45% on the corresponding period in 2002 when 284 cases, including two cases from depopulated herds, were confirmed.</p>
          <p eId="para_566">To date this year, all but two cases were in animals born prior to 1997 while nine of the total number of confirmed cases were in animals born after 1996. In both 2002 and 2003, some 2% of cases were identified in animals aged six years or  less at the time of diagnosis, compared with 16% and 40% in that category in 2001 and 2000, respectively. The overall trend, therefore, provides confidence in the effectiveness of the control measures. The increasing age profile of animals in which the disease is confirmed and the declining numbers of BSE cases are positive indications that the enhanced controls introduced in 1996 and 1997 are having the desired effect and that the incidence of BSE will continue to decline in 2004 and later years as older animals leave the system. The various control measures will continue to be rigorously enforced and will be the subject of continuous review in light of scientific developments.</p>

          <p eId="para_568">The important issue is that the numbers continue to reduce, as has happened each year and especially this year. This is most encouraging and we anticipate that this country could be BSE free in the not too distant future. Obviously there will always be incidents such as the incidence of the disease in an animal in Japan which was most unexpected. All sorts of things happen but we are confident in that regard. The other important issue is the age profile. The age profile has changed dramatically and this gives us serious confidence that the country will be BSE free.</p>

          <p eId="para_570">These matters are constantly under review in the Department. One must bear in mind the huge amount of agricultural produce that is exported by this country. It is in our interest that we maintain the highest standards and for that reason we have a policy of depopulation of herds where BSE occurs. I accept the point made by Deputy Brady. It is something we keep under continuous review. As scientific developments occur, these matters will be considered. As of now, however, the policy remains in place because of the importance of the export market for our agricultural produce.</p>

It does not make sense that a herd is depopulated when one animal with BSE is discovered but it is not when there is a serious problem with TB. In 1989, a law was passed in this House to impose a ban on the use of meat and bonemeal. It shows how  important it is to implement a law once it is passed. That law was not implemented until 1996.

That is the advice we have been given and it contradicts the point made by the Deputy. The controls have been in place since 1989 but on foot of the scientific advice we got in 1996, the additional controls were implemented. All Members will agree that everything we have done to control BSE over the last number of years has been proved correct. The figures speak for themselves and the product we sell abroad is positive proof of it. The markets, which have never been as good as they are now, are satisfied that the standards we operate in Ireland are the highest. That gives us an advantage over other countries that are operating the regime the Deputy mentioned. It is in the interests of our food industry and our exports to have that advantage.</p>

There are concerns, of course, which I will seek to allay as far as possible through the establishment of an appeals body and a reserve of up to 3% to deal with exceptionally difficult cases. In addition, we have some modulated funds – approximately €34 million per annum – which will have to be spent according to strict criteria established by the Commission. I hope that the concerns about the new Common Agricultural Policy can be allayed. What is being proposed is a far more rational method of dealing with our industry, through which farmers will receive a single farm payment before Christmas, applying to the current year. They will then farm in a sensible way, producing high-quality produce, adhering to food safety and environmental regulations, and getting a return from the market place.</p>

He could not share the information with regard to the Estimates but this is something within his control so he might tell us what gems we will see during the six-month EU Presidency.</p>

          <from>Aengus Ó Snodaigh</from>
          <p eId="para_597">The amendment seeks to set out in a positive way that the Minister shall do certain things. These would be the minimum requirements – things that would happen within a set timescale. It is a positive amendment, which seeks to substitute the word "shall" for the word "may". The spirit of the House is that we wish all these matters to come into effect as quickly as possible. In principle, and certainly on this issue, we need to stop the spread of nuclear weapons and the legislation must give a basic direction to the Minister so that the enactment of the laws are not held up at the whim of a Minister, which is what the word "may" could imply.</p>
          <p eId="para_598">It is a pity that my earlier amendment No. 4 was ruled out of order. If we had access to the committee Blacks I would have been able to  understand fully the reason it was ruled out of order. It was tied to this amendment in that it sought to insert timeframes in the legislation but was not accepted. While I must accept that decision, it is a pity that the Blacks were not a available so that I might have been better able to formulate the wording of this amendment.</p>
          <p eId="para_599">When the Bill was discussed on Second Stage in 2001, my party was denied the opportunity to speak to it. It is a pity we did not have a proper Second Stage debate when the new Dáil was elected. As well as asking the Minister of State to consider these positive elements, he should also consider introducing a package of Bills such as a military export control Bill and a nuclear free zone Bill. The people have expressed their opposition to the nuclear weapons industry. We all remember the demonstrations in the early 1970s at Carnsore Point. It is a pity the Minister of State has not done for Ireland what some local authorities have done, namely, to declare their areas nuclear free zones. We could have declared Ireland a nuclear free zone in the Bill without taking away from it.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">The other issue, to which the Minister of State alluded, is that there is already legislation in place for dual use goods. However, it is not good enough because dual use military goods are still leaving the country. Many are used in nuclear weapons programmes and the nuclear industry. We must introduce adequate legislation to prevent this. We must also ensure there is not a proliferation of weapons, not only from the point of view of organisations which are a threat to the world but also from the point of view of other countries such as France, the United States and Britain. We must not encourage the nuclear weapons industry by supplying it with parts. We should take a lead in that regard because this is a small country which will hold the EU Presidency next year.</p>

          <p eId="para_603">This is a black and white issue. The Bill states that "without prejudice to the generality of subsection (1), the regulations may (<i>a</i>) designate an authority to be the National Authority for the purposes of this Act in place of the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland”. We have made it known that the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland will be the authority. However, we do not want to put ourselves in a strait-jacket because it may be necessary to support the institute from time to time. If we accept the Deputy's amendment, we “shall” designate the authority as a replacement for the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland. We  must have flexibility and discretion to support the institute which will be the designated authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_604">I do not want to get drawn into a discussion on some of the other points made by the Deputy. He knows the procedure well. We do not have any control over Second Stage debates. Other new Deputies in the House could say the same. The ratification of this strengthened agreement is in line not only with Ireland's long-standing position on nuclear disarmament and non-proliferation but also with our position on nuclear safety. That is totally unambiguous. As regards the regulations, I guarantee that they will be given effect rapidly.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_32">Question again proposed: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."</summary>
        <speech by="#SeymourCrawford" eId="spk_397">
          <from>Mr. Crawford</from>
          <p eId="para_607">Two weeks' ago when I first discussed this Bill, I spoke about small companies and their anxiety about directors' reports. I understand the Bill proposes to include in a directors' report a statement of compliance with all relevant legislation. Some 400 offences were introduced under the Company Law Enforcement Act 2000. The auditor must refer to any breaches of law in his or her audit report. He or she must carry out a legal as well as a financial audit. This will mean further costs for small companies which must employ specialists to ensure the auditor agrees to sign the report.</p>
          <p eId="para_608">The Bill extends the reporting requirements to breaches of environmental and employment legislation, Road Traffic Acts, Central Bank Acts, health and safety legislation, food hygiene laws and any legislation considered relevant to the conduct of a company's affairs. This is an extremely serious aspect of the legislation, about which I am worried from the point of view of small companies. Such legislation applies in the United States only to companies listed on the Stock Exchange, the turnover of which exceeds $1.2 billion. This issue must be considered by the Minister before the Bill is enacted.</p>
          <p eId="para_609">The core principle of all regulations is that they should be proportionate to a clearly stated public interest. The Companies (Amendment) (No. 2) Act 1999 introduced a concept of audit exemp tion of which it allowed companies to avail if they satisfied a number of criteria. This removes the chore for many small companies to complete a statutory audit. The cost to a company with a turnover of €1 million of an audit is approximately €3,000. Such costs will undoubtedly increase if this Bill is enacted as initiated. If similar figures are applied to all small companies, the overall cost will be significant. As the owners and managers of small companies are often the same people, there is little need for an independent audit of their stewardship. Owners and managers can decide whether to have an audit based on their information needs, for example, if they require a bank loan.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Research into the exemption threshold in other European countries clearly highlights that the threshold in Ireland is considerably lower. The current threshold for turnover in Northern Ireland is £1 million sterling compared to a figure of €317,000 in the Republic. This means that a company trading in Newtownbutler or Lisnaskea in County Fermanagh with a turnover of £900,000 sterling is not required to have a statutory audit, unlike a company trading across the Border in Clones with the same level of turnover. It will mean additional costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_611">This hardly creates a climate conducive to greater cross-Border trade. It may be hard to understand the effects of this when one is living a long way from the Border, but there is no doubt that it has the potential to create problems. For example, it could affect a young person's decision whether to start up a company in counties Cavan, Monaghan, Leitrim, Sligo or Louth as against one of the Northern counties. Of course, there are better grants in some areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_612">The Bill puts into effect the recommendations of the review group on auditing, which was chaired by none other than Senator O'Toole. I congratulate him and the review group for the work they did. The group was established following the DIRT inquiry of the Public Accounts Committee and sat between February and July 2000. It was asked to address a number of issues to do with the regulation of accountancy. The group did its work in four months and produced a 300-page report containing 80 recommendations. Its output represented a broad consensus among the diverse bodies represented on it and provided an effective plan for moving forward. It should be remembered that the group met and did its work before the Enron and Worldcom collapses and the accountancy scandals in the United States. In that context, its work was far-seeing.</p>
          <p eId="para_613">The core of the review group's work on the accountancy profession was that we needed to move to a new model. The model in place was effectively based on complete self-regulation. This had developed over the years for two reasons: first, those in the profession wanted self-regulation; and, second, successive Governments were happy to leave this responsibility with them. The review group decided that this must change.  It arrived at the view that there was a need for more hands-on involvement. We need to move from a model of delegated self-regulation to one of supervised self-regulation. This would see the State playing a much more active role in supervising the way in which the accounting profession regulates itself and, if necessary, undertaking direct regulation.</p>
          <p eId="para_614">The involvement of accountants in a number of scandals through the 1990s, including that which resulted in the beef tribunal, and the inability of the professional bodies to demonstrate to the public that they could regulate their members in an open, effective way made some changes inevitable. Self-regulation does have some benefits: it can be done at no cost to the State and it involves professionals who understand the nature of the work and its technical side as well as the regulatory process. However, it also has many disadvantages. It creates a perception of chaps regulating chaps. This is the main anxiety of many people in this regard. It is easy for the public to believe that when a professional organisation is faced with a choice between its members' interests and those of the public, the members' interests will win. The Bill is welcome because it provides us with a structure for the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority, which will rigorously examine how the accountancy body carries out its self-regulation and ensure that the right procedures and processes are in place and that fair, independent decisions are made.</p>
          <p eId="para_615">Perhaps the Minister could clarify the number of members that will be from the auditing profession, which has become unclear in the course of the debates. A number of previous contributions have given the impression that the number of accountants to sit on the board has been increased from two, as specified in the Bill as originally published, to five. I do not believe this is the case. The current legislative proposals guarantee only a maximum of three accountants out of a board membership of 15. An additional two accountants may sit on the board only if the chief executive happens to be an accountant and the other monitoring bodies happen to nominate an accountant between them. This is an important issue, but it can be discussed further on Committee Stage. Will the Minister guarantee that five seats on the board will be filled by accountants, given the highly specialised and technical nature of the board's remit? International best practice suggests that 40% of the board should consist of experts from the profession. We should not depend on a political appointee from any side of the House to decide whether a decision was independent, judicious or prudent.</p>
          <p eId="para_616">This is a detailed and complex Bill but it is disappointing that it has taken so long to reach the floor of the House. The review group on auditing reported in July 2000. Since then the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment has issued many press releases about the action she is taking on the regulation of the accounting profession. She even took the unusual step of  publishing draft heads of a Bill about 18 months ago, just before the general election, to show what she was doing. However, that does not hide the fact that it has taken three years for this Bill to reach us. It is an indication that the Minister is perhaps more interested in public relations than in the delivery of public services.</p>
          <p eId="para_617">I was interested to hear the issue of insurance being mentioned once again, along with the fact that the Minister had been working on it for a year and a half. Some people in this House would have us believe that this Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government has only been there since the last election, but the Minister has been in charge of these matters for the last six and a half years. It is important to remember this.</p>
          <p eId="para_618">The Bill also contains a number of measures to strengthen the regulation and independence of auditors. These will have to be teased out in detail on Committee Stage. There does not seem to be a clear indication of who is and is not an auditor. A person can set up an auditing business without being attached to one of the auditing organisations. I ask the Minister to take into account the need for people to be certain that the person they are dealing with is legally covered.</p>

          <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_621">I welcome the opportunity of contributing to the debate on this Bill. As mentioned by previous speakers, this Bill has been promised for a long time – it has taken more than three years to come before the Houses. When the Minister introduced the Bill in the Seanad there was genuine widespread concern among certain sectors of the accountancy profession about the implications of certain aspects. I compliment the Minister and Department officials on the consultation process which has taken place with various interested bodies since then. Its complexity and fine details are part of the reason it has taken so long to come before us. However, when the legislation is passed – I understand the Minister may make some changes on Committee Stage – it will strengthen the role and the independence of auditors. It will also help to engender confidence in the business sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_622">The company law review group recently issued a report on recommendations for private companies, some of which are radical and would have far-reaching effects. A number of them, such as replacing the articles of association with a simple constitution, would be welcome. Allowing private companies to function with just one director is an innovative idea brought forward by the Company Law Review Group. It suggested also that companies should, by legislation, have to dispense with the holding of an annual general meeting and has asked for the abolition of the draconian <i>ultra vires</i> clause.</p>
          <p eId="para_623">Many of these recommendations are sensible and the central theme of the group's report is the refocusing of the Companies Acts to allow private companies, which are limited by shares, to become a new mother company. It is time we examined the ten current items of legislation dealing with companies. To progress this, a re-examination of all the current Companies Acts will have to take place and perhaps now is the time to expedite that process. For far too many small companies, the legislation covering their setting up and operation has become excessively bureaucratic and for many small and medium size enterprises, the time involved in complying with existing legislation has become very onerous.</p>
          <p eId="para_624">There is much confusion for business people who are not familiar with company law with the legislation which governs private companies on the one hand and public liability companies on the other. I understand much progress has been made between the review group and the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment in trying to progress improvements and rewrite some of the ten existing Companies Acts. I encourage the Minister to ensure that the new Bill is published some time in 2004 and that priority is given to its passage through the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p>
          <p eId="para_625">It is important that we acknowledge the role and work being carried out by the Company Law Review Group, which was established on a statutory basis by the Company Law Enforcement Act of 2001 and which reported to the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment in February of last year. The wide range of representations on this review group ensures that every sector of commerce in Ireland is represented and is an indication of the strength of that group.</p>
          <p eId="para_626">There is a lot of responsibility on new start-up companies in complying with the existing legislation. It is important that we acknowledge and commend the role being carried out by various county enterprise boards which give valuable advice to individuals, particularly young people starting out in the commercial sector. They have been positive and proactive in helping these individuals, some of whom would be unfamiliar with VAT, PAYE, PRSI and how and when they should make returns. It is important that we acknowledge the contribution county enterprise boards make. There are many statutory obligations which they would be unaware of at the time of setting up, and we should encourage entrepreneurs of all ages to make their contribution to this country.</p>
          <p eId="para_627">The Bill places a major onus and responsibility on auditors and accountants, although the Minister has gone some way towards alleviating their fears in that regard. This legislation will strengthen Irish commercial life. I hope the Bill will not take too long to pass through this House and that it is enacted before the end of the year because when this legislation has been dealt with by the Oireachtas, the Minister should focus on  amending the other items of legislation and publish a Bill in 2004 to accommodate the up-to-date needs of business in every sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_628">I welcome the Bill and join other Members in wishing it a safe passage through the House. I assure Deputy Crawford that the insurance issue is being aggressively tackled by the Government. The Tánaiste in particular is leading the charge in bringing down the cost of premiums, with the Minister of State, Deputy Michael Ahern, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, who can all take credit. The members of the Joint Committee on Enterprise and Small Business, of which I am Chairman – Deputies McHugh and Nolan are in the Chamber also – have their sleeves rolled up to ensure that this problem is tackled because what is happening currently in the insurance industry is unsustainable. Small family businesses are being put out of operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_629">I assure the House that we will be back with part 2 of the insurance inquiry after the interim report, which was favourably received by the media and the public in general, starting next Wednesday morning. I assure the House also that I will be briefing and updating it on our progress over the coming weeks. I assure the public in particular that we regard this issue as the biggest challenge to employment, particularly small family businesses and factories in rural Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#DonnieCassidyFF" eId="spk_403">
          <from>Mr. Cassidy</from>
          <p eId="para_631">That includes County Mayo as well. I know Deputy Ring's heart is in the same place as those of all of us who come from rural Ireland who want to get a better deal for our people.</p>
          <p eId="para_632">It is probably fair to say that recent years have brought unprecedented change for the accounting and auditing profession, and that is likely to continue into the foreseeable future. The report of the review group on auditing, which arose from the Committee of Public Accounts inquiry into DIRT, heralded significant developments in this area. I want to mention all those who served on that committee who gave great account of their stewardship, particularly the late former Deputy Jim Mitchell, who chaired it. Their contribution should be acknowledged here today because they took the position of the committees of this House to a new level. I congratulate everyone who was involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">One of the key features of the Bill is the proposed establishment of the Irish auditing and accountancy supervisory authority. This authority will be independent of the profession while having at its disposal all the necessary expertise required for effective regulation to ensure that the auditing and accounting profession operates to the highest standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_634">The authority will have a wide range of oversight functions in respect of accountancy bodies as well as the power to intervene in the disciplinary process of accountancy bodies where it deems it necessary; carry out the independent investigations of possible breaches of standards of prescribed accountancy bodies by their numbers; require accountancy bodies to amend their rules and their disciplinary and investigation procedures, which is important; review the accounts of certain categories of companies and apply to the courts to compel directors of these companies to amend accounts not in compliance with the Companies Acts – all Members of the House will wholeheartedly welcome that proposal; and grant recognition to bodies of accountants under the Companies Acts, which is also necessary and very important.</p>
          <p eId="para_635">The authority will be funded jointly by the State and the accountancy profession respectively on a 40%-60% basis as recommended by the review group on auditing. In the case of prescribed accountancy representative bodies, I welcome the fact that disciplinary procedures operated by them in respect of their members are to be given statutory underpinning. Existing controls on auditors are being enhanced and they will be subject to new audited related requirements.</p>
          <p eId="para_636">Other procedures are being put in place which are designed to ensure that auditors are genuinely independent of the companies whose accounts they audit. We all welcome that provision. There will be a greater imposition on companies with respect to the preparation of accounts. Moreover, directors of companies are being required to confirm their company's compliance with its statutory obligations as regards company and tax law and other legal obligations which may materially affect its financial statement. The company auditors will vet these statements.</p>
          <p eId="para_637">The central objective of the legislation is to ensure the regulatory structures governing auditors and accountants in Ireland meet best international practice. Given what we have seen in other jurisdictions and in one of the biggest markets in the world, if not the biggest, we cannot be too careful in respect of accounting practices and procedures. What makes business happen and what gives the entrepreneur a just reward for his or her endeavours, is the credibility built up by people who make things happen. One's credibility is one's high standing with financial institutions and the people with whom one is doing business. If anything is unethical and interferes with confidence, it shatters the trust between the person doing business with the financial institution, employees and customers. This Bill puts safeguards in place to ensure that in the future, people can do business comfortably and maintain confidence with creditors and a financial standing with financial institutions and their customer base.</p>
          <p eId="para_638">I congratulate the Minister of State, who has considerable experience in this area and who comes from an accountancy background. He has  come to this House with a reputation of high standing. The House and the Government are benefiting from the considerable experience of the Minister of State in respect of a Bill of this nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_639">The central objective of the legislation is to ensure the regulatory structures governing auditors and accountants meet best practice. Enhancement of corporate compliance is also of the utmost importance. The Bill will also apportion new responsibilities between the various parties involved in corporate governance. I understand submissions have been received from interested parties. The debates in the Seanad and the Dáil have focused on three aspects of this Bill. I refer to the section dealing with the appointment of the directors of the supervisory authority by the Minister. When the Bill was published, there were different schools of thought on the appropriate level of representation by accountants on the board of the supervisory authority. Some considered that the original appointments were right, while others disagreed. The Minister of State did a good job and took another look at the problem before altering the permissible level of representation by accountants in a Seanad Committee Stage amendment. This was done by increasing the number of nominees from the accountancy bodies from two to three and by providing that one of the nominees of the designated bodies may also be an accountant. There is no restriction preventing the chief executive officer from being an accountant. The formula designed to achieve what the Minister wanted is a fair and realistic one and it strikes an equitable balance in terms of overall representation on the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_640">I welcome the thrust of the Bill, particularly section 43 which introduces an obligation on the directors of a company to prepare a compliance statement concerning the company's policies in respect of compliance with its obligations under company and tax law and any other statutory law which would have a material impact on the company's financial statement. The Minister of State has reflected on the points made. I know we can trust him because he is probably one of the experts in the House on this legislation. We cannot have too much legislation in place which makes it easier for people to conduct business. The order of the day is openness and transparency. All of us who come to the House on behalf of our constituents come with our integrity and dignity and with the best will in the world to do our utmost on behalf of our people. We work so hard for 50 of the 52 weeks of the year despite what we hear elsewhere. This legislation, which gives credibility to what is taking place in the business world, must be commended. I wish the Bill a safe passage through the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaddyMcHughIND" eId="spk_404">
          <from>Mr. McHugh</from>
          <p eId="para_641">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important legislation, the Companies (Auditing and Accounting) Bill 2003. I have concerns about some aspects of the Bill. In an era  in which we have experienced bad and dubious practices internationally and nationally with the accountancy profession, it is timely we discuss the issue and develop controls and safeguards for the accountancy profession.</p>
          <p eId="para_642">It is welcome that this Bill will establish an independent supervisory authority to oversee the regulation of the accountancy profession. That supervisory authority will ensure a greater degree of protection for the public in its dealings with auditors and accountants. There is a deficiency in the Bill in that it does not cover all practitioners who describe themselves as accountants. A person who is appropriately qualified might decide not to become a member of a professional body covered by the legislation so that he or she can operate outside the terms of the Bill. Such a situation, should it arise, would make a mockery of this legislation and render it useless. There is danger for the consumer who engages the services of a practitioner in the accountancy profession. Consumers are entitled to know that the person they engage is subject to the rigours of the supervisory authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_643">To address this failing in the Bill, it is necessary to define persons entitled to engage in the profession of accountancy and to make them subject to the supervisory authority, rather than apply the terms and controls imposed by the supervisory authority to professional bodies only. If this new authority is to gain the confidence of the public, it must be amended to include all persons entitled to engage in the profession of accountancy.</p>
          <p eId="para_644">The other issue of concern is that of corporate governance. There is a view that corporate governance should not be the subject of primary legislation – I am sure the Minister of State has received much correspondence on that – but that it should be covered by a code. This code could be developed by the supervisory authority in conjunction with the Minister and the professional bodies. The benefit of going down the code route is that it would be possible to regulate appropriately and at the same time adapt or respond to new and changing situations immediately, if that is required, without having to wait for the necessary legislation to be enacted. The code route would provide for an appropriate response within an appropriate and satisfactory timeframe to new, ever present and ever changing challenges.</p>
          <p eId="para_645">I am alarmed at the rigorous requirements of the directors' compliance statement. To have any semblance of respectability such a compliance statement would have to be based on a degree of knowledge which it cannot be assumed that all company directors would have. This is not a reflection on them. They simply cannot be experts in all areas of their businesses. That is the reason companies engage professionals to attend to various aspects of their operations. If there is a need to employ a professional, it must follow that the company directors do not have the competence to deal with the matter. How, therefore,  can the same company directors confidently sign a directors' compliance certificate?</p>
          <p eId="para_646">This compliance certificate requirement also has implications for charitable companies and creates burdens that cannot be discharged by those providing their services free of charge on a voluntary basis. If this issue is not addressed, it will have serious consequences for charitable companies and organisations. I understand the Minister is reflecting on this issue and look forward to enlightened amendments in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_647">The Bill is welcome and long overdue. The scandals that have occurred have highlighted the need for such measures to restore confidence in the profession. The measures need to be given effect as a matter of urgency.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelRing" eId="spk_405">
          <from>Mr. Ring</from>
          <p eId="para_648">I wish Deputy Cassidy and his committee well in their work on the issue of insurance, the most important issue affecting jobs, industry and rural communities. I hope the committee will be successful in its efforts to deal with the crisis in the insurance industry. I wish the committee, the Minister and the Government well in their work. In the past year many jobs have been lost because the demands of insurance companies have put many companies out of business. Much that could have been done in the past was not done.</p>
          <p eId="para_649">I am not in favour of over-regulation in any industry. I am a director of many companies. Before people get excited at this revelation, I add that they are all voluntary companies. Those of us involved in such companies get no payment for our work. I agree with Deputy McHugh that some exemption must be granted to directors, like myself, who are not being paid. We do not wish to be liable under company law if things go wrong. I hope the Minister will respond to this issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_650">I welcome professional regulation. All professions should be regulated and no profession should be regulated by itself. That is the reason I welcome this Bill. Accountants should not be in the majority on the board which regulates their profession. We have seen professions regulate themselves and know it does not work. It does not lead to independence when a profession regulates itself.</p>
          <p eId="para_651">Accountants, like members of other professions, have done good work during the years. There are good and bad accountants. Where stands an accountant who does not wish to be governed by this legislation? I would not like to see regulation putting people out of business. People should be protected by this regulation rather than put out of business. It would be unfair of us to pass legislation that would affect anyone's livelihood. I hope the Minister will clarify this question.</p>
          <p eId="para_652">I do not pretend to be an expert in company law. We have often seen companies collapse and their owners walk away from their debts because they had limited liability. Their customers and suppliers were put out of business but there was  no law to deal with the owners of the limited company. They were protected by their accountants under the law. They put small business people out of business but continued to drive their Mercedes cars, live in big houses and wine and dine in restaurants. Although they were not obliged to pay their customers or suppliers, many of them set up other companies within a short time and began trading once again. This must stop. The legislation should protect small business people from such activity.</p>
          <p eId="para_653">Recently in the United States a man with a computer came close to bringing down Allfirst Bank. We must examine how such power can be given to one person. We remember the Dáil being recalled to deal with similar crises in the PMPA and the AIB. The taxpayer had to save these companies. No company should be allowed to overexpose itself to such an extent. Safeguards must be put in place. Accountants must be allowed to report the activities of such companies to an appropriate agency.</p>
          <p eId="para_654">Thinking of the crisis in Allfirst Bank reminds me of the new regulations regarding electronic voting. I can foresee the day when a whizz kid will gain access to a computer and be able to decide who will sit in this House. This will happen if we have electronic voting. In Leinster House we cannot deal on a daily basis with the viruses in our computers. We are warned every day about computer viruses. I compliment the ICT section which does an excellent job. In my constituency office in County Mayo I can access all of the information available to me in Leinster House.</p>
          <p eId="para_655">It will cost €1.5 million per year to run the board. The Government is putting in €600,000 this year while the rest of it will be funded by the profession. We know who will pay ultimately – the customers. I would welcome the regulation of any profession. No profession is above the law and there is no profession that should not be regulated. To be fair to this profession, it has done a fairly good job over the years and there have been few scandals relating to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_656">The smaller accountancy firms that operate in rural Ireland feel they do a fairly good job. We do not want to make accountants become policemen or policewomen. That is neither their job nor their role. Their job is to give the best information and advice to their clients and outline the law as it stands. If clients are breaking the law accountants must advise them of that, in writing if possible. It is not the job of accountants to write to the Revenue if their clients do not comply with the law. I would not like to see Ireland becoming a police state. One thinks of the smoking regulations. Whether one wants them is not the issue. The biggest problem with it is how it is to be policed – pub staff are expected to police it and this seems to be the biggest dispute. As regards this Bill, while accountants must be regulated, it is not their function to fulfil the role of informer. Their function is to give the best possible advice. If they break the law, this board will deal with them.</p>
          <p eId="para_657">While I welcome the Bill in principle, I know  there are many concerns about it. The Fine Gael spokesman in this area, Deputy Hogan, has many concerns and these will be discussed on Committee Stage. I welcome the fact that accountants will not be allowed to police themselves. No profession – neither the Garda nor anybody else – should be allowed to police itself. There should be an independent board with representatives of the profession, and that is what will happen here. However, they should not have a majority of members.</p>
          <p eId="para_658">I raise the issue of the forthcoming Estimates, of both the Government and the local authorities. Why can these not be simplified? Why can it not be explained simply to people rather than putting it in coded language? A Bill came through this House last year and worked well. There are now explanatory notes with all Bills.</p>
          <p eId="para_659">I brought the county council book of estimates to an accountant last year and asked him to go through it. He told me that one would want to be Houdini to go through it. It was so coded and well done that it beat even this professional accountant. The material that is given to Members is not acceptable. As well as regulating professional groups like accountants, the State should regulate its own agencies. The State accountants that work for councils should also be regulated and made live within the law. What happens in this country is a bit like what happens with nursing homes – the private sector will be regulated but the public sector will be left alone. I hope county councils, health boards and all State agencies will come under the aegis of this Bill. I hope that if one makes a complaint against the accountants of Mayo, Galway or Cork county councils, they can be brought before this board. Let us regulate everybody and not just the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_660">I hope whatever problems arise with this Bill can be ironed out on Committee Stage. I note that the Minister declared his interest in that he is a member of this profession. The board must be independent and seen to be so. The profession should have its representatives on the board, but not a majority. A representation of four or five on a 15 strong board would be fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_661">While there is nothing wrong with regulations, we should not go overboard. That is what happens all too often in this country. The response of this House to everything is to go three steps too far. We should start softly, see how it works and move on from there. We should not over-regulate in such a way that it will not work and that hurts innocent people. There are fully qualified accountants and a couple of other categories of accountant. The Minister of State must ensure that this Bill does not put the other category of accountants out of business. That would not be right and it is not what we are here to legislate for. I hope they can be protected in this Bill.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JohnMcGuinness" eId="spk_406">
          <from>Mr. McGuinness</from>
          <p eId="para_662">I welcome the Bill and the debate it has created around the issue of small business. I wish the Minister of State well in steer ing the Bill through the House. Given his record and long service in the House, I know that he will take on board the sincere views that are being aired on Second Stage on both the Bill and the broader issues affecting small businesses in the country. Because of the challenges the sector faces, there is a need for focus on the small business sector. As a Government, we should ensure that we do not add to those challenges by the legislation we enact. We must be conscious of this as we progress this Bill and others that are in the pipeline. Given the Minister of State's qualifications in this area, he does not need me to preach to him.</p>
          <p eId="para_663">I come to this from a different perspective. I should declare my interest and say that I come from the small business sector. I learned my trade in various small businesses and I am still attached to a number of such businesses. I fully understand the implications of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_664">Before I come to the Bill, I do not want to miss a comment on IT made by Deputy Ring, whose contributions I always enjoy. I have greater faith in that system than he does. We should embrace technology developments, an example of which are the initiatives undertaken by the Ceann Comhairle on presentations to this House and private meetings etc. We should move these forward, be confident and bring the confidence of the people with us as we make decisions. We should do this in our work, in small enterprises and indeed in the elections to this House or local government.</p>
          <p eId="para_665">I am concerned about another issue that I heard raised here. While it is outside the scope of the Bill, it deals with one of the challenges facing business, namely, insurance. While I will not go into detail about it, I support what was said. I was a member of the enterprise and small business committee during the last Administration. It did an incredible amount of work on building the foundations that now underpin the work being undertaken by the current committee under Deputy Cassidy. We met a stonewalling process that will have to be overcome to help small businesses throughout Ireland. The cost of insurance to small business is simply prohibitive. A number of businesses in my constituency are not insured as the proprietors or directors could not meet the premiums when they came up for renewal. If we are to protect jobs in small businesses, we will have to take whatever initiatives are necessary to bring about a change in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_666">As regards the Bill, I clearly understand the differences between the small business sector and the bigger companies that operate here. I understand the differences between those companies with huge turnovers – while we need not name them here, we know who they are – that are creating jobs and taking risks in business. There is a distinct difference between that group of companies and the smaller family-run businesses or those run by families who are the directors and proprietors – the ones carrying out the business. We need to acknowledge that in the context of  this Bill. We need to protect those small businesses because they are involved in what I believe is the backbone of the economy. That element, the SME sector, is quietly working away and doing its business.</p>
          <p eId="para_667">I was a member of the Kilkenny County Enterprise Board until recently. One can see how small communities are enhanced by the presence of perhaps a family or a couple of entrepreneurs who get together, build up a small business, create employment for perhaps one to ten people, and move ahead. I have seen them struggle, as I did in business, with a massive amount of red tape and bureaucracy visited upon them by various Acts passed in this House. We have to understand that it is almost impossible for small businesses to carry that burden of administration, factor it into their costs and stay competitive.</p>
          <p eId="para_668">My background is in transport, and there is a great deal of legislation in that area, from company law and health and safety directives to compliance with road regulations and so on. It is not that one should not be compliant, but we have to measure that compliance against the size of the company. If we did that we would create structured Bills as they pass through this House, acknowledging the challenges of companies of that size and at the same time acknowledging their desire to ensure compliance.</p>
          <p eId="para_669">One of the things helping to give rise to this legislation and others is that something happens in the corporate world involving some large enterprise. Time and again we have heard Enron and WorldCom mentioned. That same stick that is applied to them is then used to beat down small businesses in the general business sector in Ireland, when we should instead be measuring the stick of Government, recognising what is going on in the sector and then tailoring the legislation to suit what is happening in the marketplace. It is not easy to survive there and it is not getting easier. Legislation can often be a serious obstacle to competition as those small businesses move along.</p>
          <p eId="para_670">I will touch on the area of social enterprise within small businesses. This is the area of communities coming together and creating around themselves an enterprise, driven mainly perhaps by some other scheme of Government within that community, enabling it to stand on its feet, with the community almost replacing a co-op, or alongside the model of a co-op, moving along and delivering a certain amount of employment and esteem to that area, but in its infancy. It must be recognised that that is beginning to happen. We need to nurture and protect it, and give it every assistance in moving it along.</p>
          <p eId="para_671">In terms of the Bill itself, I am all for accountability, transparency, the acknowledgement by directors of that responsibility, and proper corporate governance modelled on best practise in the EU and beyond. Looking to the rest of the EU, there is less regulation of small businesses than in Ireland. The rules are not as stringent. Nevertheless I welcome the fact that the IAASA  is being established to monitor the auditing and accounting profession. There is room for a certain amount of regulation which acknowledges the profession or group that it is regulating and for which it is tailored. It is not meant to impose a "one size fits all" regime. One size certainly does not fit all in this small country.</p>
          <p eId="para_672">IBEC and other organisations have expressed their concerns about the Bill. While I do not sing directly from their hymn sheet, or the one created by them for us, I have views similar to the message they are promoting. My views are centred around the fact that within a big company one has a sharing of responsibility among directors, with some signing off on health and safety, company law, commercial law requirements and so on. Such companies have the ability, funds and the various departments to do so. They are making that kind of money. That is the world they live in, and there should be proper corporate governance for them. I acknowledge that, as I do the improvements required within those big companies. However, in regard to foreign investment in Ireland, we had better be careful that in the case of directors signing off on everything, as they are required to do, we acknowledge that some of those directors may not even be in Ireland. They will raise questions regarding the fact that they are not in Ireland but are part of the companies existing in Ireland. That needs to be explored and I hope it is done on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_673">The real fear I have involves small businesses in the sector in this country. If we require them to deal with the issues of health and safety, commercial law and all the other regulations, and ask them to sign off and take the responsibility, then we are asking them to take on a further cost of employing another professional to ensure that everything on which they are being asked to sign off is up to scratch, working, beyond reproach, open and transparent. That sounds fine until one goes to pay the professional fees in these cases. One then finds that there is a huge cost involved in ensuring that the documents to which one puts one's name stand up to scrutiny, and that in turn one's company stands up to the same scrutiny by an auditor.</p>
          <p eId="para_674">I have been told, and I have checked it locally rather than with any representative body, that fees for auditing small businesses range around €3,000 or €4,000 annually. That is the general range. It is possible to create an argument that the implications of this Bill for small, home-grown family companies will raise that cost up to as much as €12,000, if all is factored in. We must be very careful that does not happen. The auditors will ensure compliance. Either the company or the auditors will ensure that the accounts stand up to professional scrutiny. Someone pays the bill. Small businesses in this country end up paying the bill for everything. I agree that directors should have responsibilities in all of this and ensure that the professionals sign off on the various requirements of this legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_675">That brings me to the turnover exemption fig ure. This is currently given as €317,000, so that companies with turnover under that figure are exempt in terms of the Bill's demands. The public should know that the companies are not entirely exempt. Companies have to submit accounts. They must have them signed by their accountant or auditor. There is transparency in all of this, so it is not as if people are ducking and dodging. I have no difficulty with strengthening the rules in this area, making things more transparent so that people can look in and see what is going on, and ensuring there is no ducking and dodging, but all that must be done without damaging the company.</p>
          <p eId="para_676">We have to be careful about these limits. The ISME submission asks for the €317,000 threshold to be increased and gives the general EU comparative figure as being around €7 million. That figure is extreme, but the figure of €317,000 is much too low in this day and age. I encourage the Minister, in the course of his consideration of the issue, which has drawn comment from all small business representative groups and others, to examine it in more detail and ensure that in making companies more compliant and accountable he does not damage the work they are doing in terms of job creation and that he does not add to their costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_677">Deputy Ring made an interesting point which arises every week at the Committee of Public Accounts, of which Deputy Connaughton is a member. We are speaking here of private companies. Non-commercial semi-State agencies often handle far greater amounts of money than private companies. The accounts they compile to cover their activities are incredibly scrappy. What is good for the goose is good for the gander. In this instance, as in many others when making legislation in this House, we should extend this legislation to the public sector, which should be just as accountable as anybody else. We should ensure that if we allocate money, €80,000 or €100,000 a year – in some instances it can be millions of euro – to vocational education committees etc. they are forced to have a proper accounts system open to scrutiny by the Committee of Public Accounts or some other body. Those accounts should be laid before the appropriate committee in this House for scrutiny. That ensures not only good corporate governance but public confidence in the building and public sectors because they must meet the same standards. At this point, those standards are not being met. We are witnessing, on a weekly basis, enormous overruns and huge increases in the costs of delivery of projects, and there is no end to the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_678">While we look back on accounts in a historical fashion, there should be room within the system to examine such accounts after the first quarter so we can take the necessary corrective action. One of the first actions required is to ensure those in the public sector meet the same standards as those in the private sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_679">Other issues raised by various groups in regard to this legislation are well documented. I know they have been submitted to the Minister for consideration and he too, in his profession, has a number of issues relating to this debate. He has an open mind and understands business quite well, and I urge him to examine and reflect on what is being said by Opposition and Government speakers between now and Committee Stage. I ask that he allay the fears that exist. Legislation is dumping red tape and bureaucracy on small farmers and small business. If we were to scrutinise much of this legislation we might discover how it hurts the development of small businesses that are trying to keep their heads above water. I hope we will receive sufficient time to debate and iron out these difficulties on Committee Stage. We must strive to have legislation which is overseen by the authority but, more importantly, that can be worked by those in the field creating the jobs and doing the business. I come from that sector and respect those who are turning the buck and making the profit, even though it is not easy. They are keeping the wheels of small business moving against the odds.</p>

          <p eId="para_682">The Minister of State will have to suffer on a little longer. I welcome the general thrust of the Bill for the reasons outlined by the Minister of State in his speech. Most of the issues I wished to raise have already been raised here and in the Seanad. The Minister of State, in his opening remarks, said that while a number of worthwhile suggestions had been made in the Seanad – I have not read the report of that debate – he regretted he was unable to include them in the Bill. I find that difficult to understand. What did the Minister of State mean by that?</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_686">It would be remarkable if the Minister of State agreed with an amendment but was unable to accept it. We all know from where this evolved. The public will always refer to tribunals such as the Goodman tribunal, which is embedded in their minds. They believe that if everybody had done his or her job in a professional manner we would not now be in this mess.</p>
          <p eId="para_687">As Deputy McGuinness said, I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and have been for the past 12 months. It is the first time in  my long service in this House that I have been a member of that committee, and it is a real eye opener. I assume the new authority, given its over-arching control of auditorship and so on, will operate in the same manner as the Comptroller and Auditor General in dealing with public accounts on the State side. Several Deputies have called for the State sector to be included in the remit of this Bill, but I do not know if that is good or bad.</p>
          <p eId="para_688">I have learned through the Comptroller and Auditor General and his officials of some remarkable things done in State-run organisations. There has not been a Thursday in the past 12 months when I have not learned of €1 million or €5 million being wrongly spent in areas that had nothing to do with contracts or the objective of the exercise involved. In most cases it related to overruns on projects.</p>
          <p eId="para_689">I do not know whether State companies should face the rigors of this new authority. We would be in a worse position but for the benefit of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Committee of Public Accounts. Despite what we say about something never happening again, somehow or other it always does.</p>
          <p eId="para_690">The question of how we handle smaller enterprises was articulated by everybody who spoke today and on the last occasion we discussed this matter. I have some association with small businesses. I have not been involved in them but, like most of my colleagues on all sides of the House, the only time we get an opportunity to see the workings of small businesses is when they are in trouble. One then sees the raw edges of what has gone wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_691">Those who set up small firms are initially full of enthusiasm. They set up business at great personal expense to their families. They do things that most others would not do in a lifetime out of missionary zeal to get the project off the ground, usually at extremely small profit margins. I have no doubt that I know from where the Minister is coming and that his heart is what we are talking about. Whatever he does, we must naturally have transparency which we now have for the accounts of small companies. I will come back to the question of how transparent that is. In my political life I have always noticed that the further up the professional ladder one goes, the costlier the signature is when one signs off on anything, whether it is a consultant in a hospital or an auditor at a certain level. It is always very expensive at the top.</p>
          <p eId="para_692">I certainly call for the exemption limit to be raised far above the figure of €317,000 which is nothing. If one did not have that level of turnover in a company, one would have it in a group water scheme. There is an obvious need for a huge increase. While I cannot second-guess what is in the Minister's head, I imagine that the Government would wish seriously to consider jacking it up by a great deal. I have no idea of what the level should be since I lack the expertise but it should certainly move up into the €3 million or €4 million bracket. As Deputy McGuinness said, we would not want the image to be spread that we are calling for an exemption for small businesses from having proper accounts and paying their way through their due tax contributions. That is not what I am about. The Minister will understand what I am getting at.</p>
          <p eId="para_693">Let us consider how daft laws can be. As the Minister is aware, every business is supposed to send off its annual returns to the Companies Registration Office. That is perfectly in order and should be done. Failure to do so incurs a penalty of, I believe, €1,200. I know of a community employment scheme with 17 workers. Unfortunately for it, two supervisors died in very sad circumstances over the past two years. That meant that the administration of the scheme went astray. The workers were building walls in the parish, which are there for everyone to see. However, because they did not send in their returns by the due date, they have received a bill for €3,600. I have made representations based on the greatest possible hardship. Only the other day I received a note back to say that, within the remit of the Companies Acts, the authorities could not do anything about it. I hope the Minister might be able to do something about it. I will send him the information. He talks about legislation and its implementation which has gone a little daft in this case which involves a non-profit-making organisation. It is out of this world that such a thing should happen. On reading this legislation, many will be afraid that the same will happen to them if they are pulled into its remit. I do not know whether that will happen but it should never be allowed. The Minister should inject some sense into it. Provided there is transparency and a good reason, there will always be exceptions to a rule.</p>
          <p eId="para_694">I have very little expertise in the following area. As far as auditors are concerned, I assume that the overall authority does not intend to use them as whistle-blowers, or will they have to be whistle-blowers? It concerns what my colleagues were talking about which I would like to be discussed in more depth on Committee Stage. Perhaps the Minister will mention something in his summing up. Obviously, as has been said, the law has set down that all auditors may do is explain to their clients that they must stay within the law. If they are outside it, is it the intention of the legislation that there should be an onus on the auditor to get onto the Revenue Commissioners and say his or her client is now non-compliant? Is that the core of this legislation?</p>

          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_700">At least we have explored it. It has been pointed out that there are directors of both very big and very small companies. I have never been a director of any company as such and have very limited knowledge of their responsibilities. However, I know that many non-executive directors are not in command of a whole pile of their firm's executive functions. In other words, they would not know many of the company's trade secrets or future strategy. With the CE scheme that I mentioned, the rules were taken to an illogical conclusion.</p>
          <p eId="para_701">It might happen that it becomes extraordinarily difficult to get people to act as directors. The whole concept of company formation and the administration of the commercial life of the country is essentially built around companies and their directors. It is the engine room. Where exactly the shoe pinches as far as this impinges on the directors of small companies – or large ones – who do not have access to the information that this legislation will require them to have may need to be clarified during Committee Stage. This might mean that there will have to be a huge change in the culture of a company whereby all of its directors will have to have the same information as the company accountant. However, I do not think that is practical or possible, and genuinely believe such things do not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_702">I would be very grateful to the Minister if, either in his summing up or on Committee Stage, he could delve into this huge area. I am sure there are literally thousands of people around the country, the smallest companies being firms with one, two or three directors, who might glean from this legislation that, if the slightest thing goes wrong with the company, they too will be pulled into the centre of activity. That would not be good for the commercial life of the country. I sincerely hope that is not intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_703">Another important matter is the question of the authority itself. I will not enter into its make-up and have seen what is proposed in the Bill. The Government's decision not to opt for State supervision is a step in the right direction. It is right that an element of controlled self-regulation has been included. What sort of connection will the new authority have with the firms on the ground? Will all the various reports and the audited documents be sent to the authority or will a random sample be taken? Am I right to assume that all the commercial life of the country will have to flow through this authority?</p>

          <p eId="para_709">The costs will eventually be passed down to the individual companies. They will carry the can. Deputy McGuinness mentioned that the accountancy fee for small firms is €4,000, or €5,000 at present, but these figures may increase to €10,000, €12,000 or more. I imagine that the figure could be much more than that as a direct result of this legislation. I have not heard the Minister of State or one of his Government colleagues discuss the fact that costs will increase as a result of the legislation, but I have heard representatives of companies talking about the fact that they will face huge indirect costs as a consequence. The accountancy industry has been besmirched and blemished to a great degree in recent times, in the same way as the profession in which Members of this House are involved has been criticised.</p>

          <p eId="para_711">The Minister of State is in the eye of two storms. Many accountants and auditors do an excellent job, just as many politicians do an excellent job. Many people do not believe this to be the case, however. I hope the Minister of State can clean up the image of the accountancy profession and eliminate those murky elements of the world of big business that work to the detriment of many of those known as "the small people". I refer to those who work hard every day of their lives for a small enough return, only to see many fat cats acting in an illegal manner. I hope the Bill can cure the problems without hurting those who demonstrate the culture of enterprise that no nation can do without. The Minister of State should ensure the survival of the culture of enterprise, in the interests of the countless thousands of young people in universities and schools. Such a culture should exist and should be fostered to ensure that people can see that taking risks is worthwhile. This should be done within reason, as one always needs counter-balances. The entire system works on the basis that those who take risks can employ a few others.</p>
          <p eId="para_712">I sincerely hope that this legislation is interpreted as the House intends. The Minister of State may think that he is bringing certain measures through the Dáil. When a person is given planning permission from a local authority, it is often the case that real problems emerge afterwards, when the conditions are interpreted. I wish the Bill well and I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_428">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_713">I welcome this Bill, which will implement the recommendations of the review group on auditing, which emanated from the DIRT inquiry conducted by the Committee of Public Accounts. The Bill's provisions will be most effective in helping to curb corporate fraud and in staving off major accounting scandals, such as those at the Allfirst, Enron, WorldCom, Tyco, Xerox and Adelphia corporations in the United States. There have been scandals nearer home too. The Anglo-Dutch publishing giant, Reed Elsevier, was alleged to have inflated its 2001 results. It was alleged that the company exaggerated its profits that year by changing the way it wrote off the price it paid for acquisitions over and above their asset value. This is known as "goodwill amortisation".</p>
          <p eId="para_714">The Bill aims to reform the oversight and conduct of auditing and accounting law. It will prevent many of the possible abuses that were evident in the recent wave of corporate accounting scandals. The State will have a much more hands-on involvement in supervising the way the accounting profession regulates itself. The new structure – the Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority – will perform this function and will adjudicate on procedures and processes to ensure that fair decisions are made. The new body will be something of a hands-on monitor, as it will examine every aspect of the auditing and accounting function in order to ensure absolute transparency and, in this instance, accountability.</p>
          <p eId="para_715">I welcome the fact that the regulation and independence of auditors will be strengthened by the Bill, as it will help to ensure best practice. There was a rather grey area in the realm of accounting and company accounts before now. People could describe themselves as accountants and thereby perform accounting procedures for individuals and companies. There should be a means of dealing with such people, who cause many problems for companies. This Bill is an ideal opportunity to set this matter right.</p>
          <p eId="para_716">Many of the aforementioned scandals demonstrate that there can be a far too cosy relationship between chief executives and their auditors. Executive directors should not have the power to appoint company auditors. Stock options, which, in effect, enable a company to take staff costs off balance sheets, have long been used to inflate earnings, as well as to provide so-called incentives to staff. The habitual pension holiday was another ruse which allowed companies to flatter profits. The relationship between the company and the auditor was blurred, to put it mildly. I recommend the rotation of auditing firms, rather than allowing an auditing company to serve a company for a long time. Human nature can ensure that cosy private relationships develop and, in such circumstances, best accounting practice does not always survive. Large auditing firms should be barred from providing other lucrative services to companies they are auditing, as it is possible that  golden circles, or mutual back-slapping societies, can develop.</p>
          <p eId="para_717">I emphasise that a minority of companies inflated their earnings by fraudulent accounting. I do not suggest that the Bill will end all bad practice, but it will create more difficulties for those who want to get involved in such practice. I hope the Bill will lead to a little more transparency. People will seek a way around the law in circumstances such as this. We need to keep our eye on the ball, if necessary by reviewing legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_718">I welcome the Bill, which I predict will have a major and salutary effect on every business in the land. I understand that the then Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, the late Jim Mitchell, commenting on the report of the review group, said it was more like a pussycat than a tiger. I hope that things will change.</p>
          <p eId="para_719">I feel sure significant amendments can be made to the Bill on Committee Stage which will have the effect of strengthening it and helping it to elevate and protect the reputation of the vast majority of auditors and accountants.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelAhern" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Enterprise,_Trade_and_Employment" eId="spk_429">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment (Mr. M. Ahern)</from>
          <p eId="para_720">I thank all the Deputies who participated in the debate on this Bill. Many interesting points emerged from the discussion and I welcome the opportunity to reflect further on some of them. I am prepared to consider them in the context of the finalisation of the Committee Stage amendments.</p>
          <p eId="para_721">As I said in my opening remarks, the purpose of the legislation is to promote and encourage the culture of corporate compliance. There is no question of seeking to impose rules, regulations and conditions whose purpose serves simply to penalise commercial enterprises. Neither is it my intention, or the purpose of the legislation, to impose unduly onerous requirements on our auditing and accounting practitioners. Most of all, the legislation is striving to achieve a balance between the extremes of a climate of minimal standards of commercial compliance at one end of the spectrum and, at the opposite end, wholesale regulation of all conceivable aspects of this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_722">I am also extremely conscious of the role it is proper that company law should play <i>vis-à-vis </i>commercial enterprise, namely, to provide a framework within which companies are required to operate and in which they know they have to operate, thus providing stability and order for companies themselves and for all those with whom they interact in the course of their business. It should not be a barrier to entrepreneurship or a disincentive to inward investment. There is also a need, in appropriate circumstances, to distinguish between categories and scales of companies. I am satisfied the Bill has passed the litmus test regarding these considerations.</p>
          <p eId="para_723">I am particularly of the view that the kinds of amendments I have in mind for Committee Stage  will serve to assuage the concerns that were articulated today and on 16 October. I look forward to the prospect of having a more detailed debate on the Bill's provisions on Committee Stage, during which Deputies will have an opportunity to bring their forensic skills to bear on the measure, subsection by subsection. In that way, points to which I may, inadvertently, not have responded or which I may not have covered sufficiently in my response can be taken up.</p>
          <p eId="para_724">On some of the general points that were made, the implementation of many of the requirements that will flow from the legislation are, quite simply, matters of good practice. In many instances, they are a restatement or refinement of obligations that already exist. I am satisfied that an impartial, sober and measured assessment of the new legislation should not be such as to inspire anxiety among those whose practices it will affect, whether they are commercial enterprises or practitioners. Most of all, it will introduce a climate of certainty in the commercial sphere and serve to enhance corporate compliance. It is eminently arguable that companies considering investing in Ireland would prefer to be dealing in a proper corporate environment rather than in a corporate jungle. I am not sure we would wish to entertain those who would prefer the latter environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_725">Some words of clarification and elaboration are appropriate in respect of some of the specific observations made by Deputies in the course of the debate. Deputies Crawford, Nolan and McHugh raised the issue of the length of time the legislation has been in gestation. The Bill is very detailed and complex, as Deputy Nolan acknowledged, and we need to get it right. It is better not to legislate in haste so one will not repent at leisure. The Irish Auditing and Accounting Supervisory Authority has been established since April 2001. In addition to the useful work it has done since its inception, it will abridge the time required to have the statutory authority fully functional.</p>
          <p eId="para_726">Deputy Nolan asked about a review of existing Companies Acts. This work is ongoing on the part of the Company Law Review Group and we expect to obtain its proposals early in 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_727">Deputy Ring raised the issue of directors who walk away and leave debts, thus leaving creditors in the lurch. This has been addressed by the disqualification and restriction provision in Part 4 of the Companies Act 1990, as strengthened by the Company Law Enforcement Act 2001, and particularly the impact of the Director of Corporate Enforcement.</p>
          <p eId="para_728">A question was raised by Deputies Connaughton and McGuinness about whether the Bill should be applied to State bodies. The primary purpose of the Bill is to supervise the recognised bodies, especially in the auditing of registered companies. The Comptroller and Auditor General fulfils this function for State bodies under the Comptroller and Auditor General legislation  and/or as provided for in the legislation establishing the State body.</p>
          <p eId="para_729">The first of the general issues raised concerns whether another body is needed to do the work being assigned to the IAASA in the Bill or whether some rationalisation of existing bodies might not be a better alternative. The cost implications were also raised. In particular, Deputy Hogan, whose comments were framed in the context of auditors <i>vis-à-vis</i> the public good, questioned the need for the establishment of the supervisory authority. He wondered if other entities could not carry out its functions. He instanced in particular the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and later referred to the scope for the establishment of an overarching body consisting of the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement, the Competition Authority and the IAASA. Deputies Howlin and Eamon Ryan made broadly similar points.</p>
          <p eId="para_730">The establishment of the supervisory authority was a key recommendation of the review group on auditing. In formulating the recommendation, consideration was given to a number of possible alternatives, but ultimately the group's decision was unequivocal. It deemed the establishment of the supervisory authority to be the best option. I am not aware of any developments since its decision that necessitate a major reconsideration of this option. The activities the authority is to carry out are, by and large, of a bespoke nature and would certainly not, in their totality, lend themselves to either of the two bodies proposed. Neither am I persuaded that there is a major advantage to be gained from the fusion of the three bodies, as has been suggested. Additional resources are necessary in any case to take on this new workload and will have to be provided. A dedicated body is required to discharge the remit provided for in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_731">The second key general point made referred to protection for the term "accountant". This was referred to by Deputies Hogan, Howlin, Finian McGrath, Eamon Ryan, English, McHugh, Ring and Connolly. I made a point of making specific mention of the question of legal protection for the term "accountant" in my opening speech when I stated this was something that would benefit from further consideration and research. I then undertook to request the supervisory authority, when statutorily established, to examine the issue in detail and report back to me when it has completed its deliberations. I hope this will lead to a satisfactory resolution for all concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_732">I exhort members of recognised bodies to trumpet, on all appropriate occasions, their membership of these bodies and the advantages of the greater protection it affords to clients. Recognised bodies could usefully promote themselves in similar ways.</p>
          <p eId="para_733">Deputies Hogan, Howlin, Finian McGrath, Murphy, Fleming, Boyle, Eamon Ryan, Crawford and Cassidy raised matters concerning the constitution of the board of directors of the IAASA. There was some confusion among Deputies about  the numbers and allocation of places on the board, which is probably accounted for by the fact that some were working from the text of the Bill as published rather than as amended by the Seanad. It is intended that the board of directors of the supervisory authority will consist of a maximum of 14 directors in addition to the chief executive officer, who will be an <i>ex officio</i> director. The 14 nominated directors will include three persons nominated by agreement among the prescribed accountancy bodies, two nominated by the Minister and one nominee of each of the designated bodies set out in section 6(2), a maximum of one of which may be a member of an accountancy body.</p>
          <p eId="para_734">The provisions of section 11 restrict the number of the 14 directors appointed by the Minister who can be prescribed accountancy bodies to four. Due to the fact that there is no restriction as to the profession of the chief executive, members of accountancy bodies could constitute a total of five directors of the supervisory authority. As I stated, there were differing schools of thought as to the appropriate level of representation by accountants on the board of the supervisory authority when the Bill was published. Some considered that the original apportionment was about right, while others disagreed. Having considered the differing viewpoints at some length and with considerable care, I introduced amendments, which were agreed in the Seanad, increasing the permissible level of representation by accountants. The formula I devised in so doing, which I have described, was designed to achieve a fair, realistic and equitable balance in terms of overall representation on the board and I am disinclined to interfere with it.</p>
          <p eId="para_735">As to the argument raised by Deputies Hogan, Eamon Ryan and Murphy that it is necessary to have greater levels of accounting expertise available at board level, it must be borne in mind that the substance of the work of the authority will be carried out by the executive of the body, rather than the board. Furthermore, some of the work will be done by sub-committees of the board which could, if necessary, include members of the prescribed accountancy bodies or experts who are not members of the board. This is expressly provided for in section 27 by way of Seanad amendments. Provision is also made for the delegation of the supervisory authority's functions as regards the review of company accounts to a committee comprised exclusively of professional and other advisers. This mechanism could facilitate the suggestion by Deputy Eamon Ryan regarding the availability to the authority of persons with knowledge and experience which can be placed at its disposal.</p>
          <p eId="para_736">As I have explained, I am reluctant to tamper with the current balance of representation on the board. Furthermore, the significant increase in representation for the accountancy profession is as much as could reasonably have been expected. That said, I point to the scope to increase the numbers which comprise the board of the super visory authority, including those who are members of the accountancy bodies, by regulation under section 46.</p>
          <p eId="para_737">As regards the concerns expressed by Deputy Fleming, I have already reviewed the nominating bodies and I am satisfied with the current composition. The supervisory authority, as it is currently proposed to constitute it, has the optimal balance of participation and expertise to enable it to carry out the various functions assigned to it in the Bill. I have already referred to the scope to make a ministerial regulation under section 46 of the Bill regarding the composition of the board. This can be invoked, in particular, if in light of the operation of the authority on a statutory footing, a need is demonstrated to have additional expertise available to it at board level. Deputy Hogan welcomed this flexibility and I invite Deputy Howlin, who expressed reservations about this provision, to view it in this light. The independence of the authority is an overriding consideration. It is essential for us, as legislators, to ensure the authority is constituted in a manner which obviates any possible claim of bias against it.</p>
          <p eId="para_738">On section 22, Deputy Boyle raised a question regarding the possible lack of accountability of the supervisory authority. The basis for the status, structure and funding of the supervisory authority lies in the recommendation of the review group on auditing, which considered that it should be separate from the State. However, the authority is accountable to the Minister and the House and I refer the Deputy to accountability mechanisms provided for under section 22.</p>
          <p eId="para_739">The issue of the need to avoid double jeopardy for members of the recognised accountancy bodies arising from the application of the supervisory authority of certain of its powers under sections 23 and 24 was raised by Deputies Howlin and Ardagh. Care was taken in the drafting of the Bill to avoid such a risk arising for an individual practitioner. I am satisfied that the powers being conferred on the supervisory authority under sections 23 and 24 are necessary for the discharge by it of its duties and responsibilities in an efficient and effective manner. Section 35, which provides for a statutory backing for disciplinary procedures of the accountancy bodies, was raised by Deputies Hogan, Howlin and Eamon Ryan, who questioned the need for application to the High Court to uphold disciplinary sanctions of accountancy bodies. I confirm that I propose to table amendments to section 35 which should address their concerns.</p>
          <p eId="para_740">A number of speakers referred to the provisions on audit committees in section 40. Deputies Hogan, Howlin, Ardagh and Murphy made a number of points relating to the requirement under section 40 for all public limited companies, other than investment companies and other firms over a certain size, to establish an audit committee. The establishment of audit committees is in line with the recommendations of the review group on auditing which are explicit and wide ranging in scope. Following reflection on the  comments and submissions I have received, I will table amendments to this section on Committee Stage to counterbalance the extensive nature of the recommendation of the review group in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_741">The thrust of certain Deputies' comments was that the need to have audit committees is unsubstantiated for private companies and may transpire to be an undue burden on those entities. The thresholds set out in section 40 are such that only sizeable companies are comprehended by this requirement. Deputies should also note the provisions of section 43 which provides that the board of directors of private companies which exceed the stipulated thresholds have the possibility of stating in their report, under section 158 of the principal Act, that they had decided not to establish an audit committee and setting out the reasons they have so decided. The Act does not demand that audit committees be established in all cases involving private companies where it is relevant to do so. It allows latitude in a case where a company decides that it is either not in a position or not prepared to establish such a committee by providing that the company instead explains its decision in this regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_742">Deputies Howlin, McGrath and Murphy further suggested that it may have been preferable to have provided for codes to be developed on the responsibilities and activities prescribed for audit committees on the grounds of flexibility alone. From soundings I have received, my first reaction is that the list set out in section 40 strikes the right balance. Furthermore, the provisions in subsections 2<i>(n)</i> and 7<i>(b) </i>of section 40 allow for flexibility by enabling the Minister, by regulation under section 46, to prescribe additional functions and conditions for audit committees. It is necessary to create clear blue water between auditors and their client companies and the establishment of an audit committee charged with the duties set out in the Bill and with the flexibility for adjustment described is an effective way of doing so.</p>
          <p eId="para_743">Section 43, which addresses directors' compliance statements, was widely discussed. Deputies Hogan, Howlin, Ryan, Ardagh, Murphy, Morgan, English, Fleming, Perry, Crawford, McHugh, McGuinness and Connaughton referred to the requirement in the Bill for companies to prepare a compliance statement and for auditors to sign off on the validity of such a statement. The thrust of some of the interventions has been that this requirement is unduly harsh and punitive, especially with regard to smaller companies. I expect companies to be in a position of compliance with all the various requirements imposed on them under all applicable legislation. The process of verification by auditors of such compliance does not appear to be an inordinate burden. To argue against such a requirement is to suggest that it is acceptable for companies not to be compliant with their various legislative obligations. It is not unfair to ask companies to comply with their legal obligations and to state that  they are in compliance and their auditor has certified that such is the case.</p>

          <from>Mr. M. Ahern</from>
          <p eId="para_745">I mentioned earlier that it is not the purpose of the legislation to impose undue burdens on companies or professions acting in the commercial sphere. Some of the concerns which found expression in the media regarding the contents of this section are misplaced and exaggerated. It is neither the intention nor the effect of the thrust of these requirements to impose an inordinate cost or other burden on companies. Notwithstanding this, I have thoroughly reviewed all aspects of this section and, as I signalled earlier, I will propose amendments on Committee Stage arising from this review.</p>
          <p eId="para_746">Deputies Howlin and Murphy expressed concern that the provisions of the Bill could discourage businesspersons from involving themselves in and providing their expertise to companies in the voluntary sector. I reassure the Deputies on this point by confirming that I will put down an amendment on Committee Stage to address the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_747">The thresholds for audit exemption were raised by Deputies Hogan, Ardagh, Murphy, English, Perry, McGuinness and Connaughton. They proposed that the thresholds be increased significantly. Deputy Fleming advocated a more moderate increase. I am mindful of the need to establish realistic thresholds for exemption from audit. The Department monitors these thresholds on an ongoing basis and I have asked relevant officials, in the context of this legislation, to advise on the current threshold. I am considering what the appropriate level might be and I expect to move an amendment on this on Committee Stage. In deciding on the figure I must factor in prudential considerations and the need to avoid undue impositions on small companies. It is interesting that the English, Scottish and Welsh accountancy representative bodies are opposed to the UK Government's proposals to increase significantly the levels for exemption.</p>
          <p eId="para_748">I again thank the Deputies for their contributions to this debate. They were well informed and constructive and I hope that the Committee Stage amendments, which I am in the process of finalising, address the substance of the most significant concerns they articulated. I hope I have clarified the issues and questions the Deputies raised and I look forward to returning to these matters on Committee Stage.</p>

          <from>Mr. Kelleher</from>
          <p eId="para_752">It is some time since I moved the adjournment of this debate so I might repeat some of what I said on the last occasion. This is a most important Bill and I welcome the opportunity to speak on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_753">I compliment everybody involved in the initial debate and discussions which resulted in the introduction of this legislation. There was wide consultation and the Bill contains solid proposals to ensure that the rights of both the tenant and landlord are adequately addressed. As a result of the pressures in the housing market and the cost of housing, more people are entering the rental sector. That is something we must accept. This legislation acknowledges that and seeks to provide a legislative framework that accommodates the rights of both those who provide the rented accommodation and those who rent it.</p>
          <p eId="para_754">In the 1970s and 1980s the standard of private rented accommodation was poor. It has improved in recent years not only because of modern building standards but also because people will not accept the poor standards. The policies that have been pursued in recent years to ensure an adequate supply of housing are also having an effect and there is top quality private rented accommodation available. However, the cost of private rented accommodation is exorbitant in some places and particularly in the centre of cities where there is huge demand from people with large disposable incomes who wish to live near their workplaces. The increase in the cost of rented accommodation, as well as the demand for housing and the pressures in the housing market caused by the population increase that resulted from immigration and the economic boom, have created much difficulty. However, ten years ago only 22,000 housing units were being built each year in this country whereas we are now at the record level of 57,000 completions and it is projected that we will reach 60,000 completions next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_755">Supply is the key issue and we must ensure that any blockages in the system that hinder the supply of accommodation in the private rented or private ownership sectors are removed. It must be acknowledged that some developers in larger urban areas have been hoarding land. That must be addressed and the Government and all poli ticians are conscious of that. It is time to take action to force the people who are hoarding land to release it so we can increase the supply of housing. In some areas up to €50,000 per unit is incurred in costs on development land and that is being passed on directly to the mortgage holder or the person in the private rented sector. We must address the issue of land supply.</p>
          <p eId="para_756">The issue of planning is not dealt with in the Bill but it is within the remit of the Department. Local authorities must accept responsibility for the lack of planning in the past. There was a major upsurge in economic activity and in the population. The demographic bulge demanded the provision of accommodation but the local authorities were slow if not inactive in addressing it. It was sometimes necessary to wait for up to seven years for some county development plans to come on stream until it was made mandatory to make such plans every five years. A system must be put in place whereby local authorities can become more proactive. They must have the means to address the trends that are developing in their cities and other areas and to ensure that there is an adequate supply of land.</p>
          <p eId="para_757">Let us be under no illusions. The difficulty is that while county and city development plans contain areas that are zoned for residential development, it does not mean that the lands are available to the market. The person who owns the land might not be willing to sell it at a certain price or to sell it at that time. It is not fair or practical for planners or county and city managers to say that a number of hectares of land are zoned for housing to cope with projected housing demand when many of those landbanks might not be available for development. It could be due to developers hoarding the land and inflating the market or simply that people do not wish to sell a parcel of land for whatever reason. We have to address this issue in the short-term. Otherwise this difficulty will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_758">It is projected that we will need more than 60,000 housing units per year for the next ten years to address demographic trends, immigration and the changes in the population. These statistics are probably conservative given that the EU is expanding and there is a possibility of more people immigrating to this country because of the strong economic growth that still prevails as a result of the Government's policies. The economy is expected to pick up and to continue to grow.</p>
          <p eId="para_759">The thrust of the Bill is to ensure security for tenants and to provide for a mechanism to deal with tenants who are not appreciative of the property they rent. There is an onus on tenants to look after the property in a proper manner. The most important aspect of the Bill is that it provides for a dispute resolution mechanism to address the grievances of tenants or landlords. In my experience, many tenants are vulnerable and find it difficult to make ends meet. It is traumatic for them to live without security of tenure. If they have a dispute with a landlord, the only way it can be addressed is by going to court and in many  cases these people would not have the means to pursue their rights and entitlements as tenants in the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_760">This Bill gives me an opportunity to speak on a number of issues that must be addressed. One is the practice of stage payments. This will have to be seriously examined. The Irish Homebuilders Association, in conjunction with the Department, will have to bring forward guidelines or a voluntary code for the construction industry to ensure that stage payments are no longer an accepted practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_761">It is unfair that people are funding the cost of the development of their homes, while waiting to take possession of them and at the same time having to rent private accommodation. I have major concerns about this practice, which happens in some parts of the country. First of all one has to pay a booking deposit, followed by further payments on signing the contract and when the ground works are completed. A further payment is due for the joist level, followed by a final payment on completion when the mortgage is drawn down. It is inherently unfair on young people who are trying to get on the property ladder and purchase a home. Another obstacle is being placed in their way because they must draw down a partial amount of the mortgage prior to taking possession of the house. They are funding the development instead of the builder or developer funding it themselves and then selling the house on completion. This practice, which is taking place in some areas but not in others, must be examined. The Irish Homebuilders Association has a voluntary code but we must examine this practice and perhaps legislate to address the difficult problems young people have in acquiring property.</p>
          <p eId="para_762">Local authorities themselves have neglected the rights of tenants. Council estates can easily be identified by the dilapidated state of their grounds, including a lack of trees and poor grass cutting, as well as poor amenities. We will have to address this matter because a local authority tenant is entitled to the same treatment as anyone else. Even if they have to make a small contribution to this end, grounds, parkland, lights and footpaths should be maintained to an acceptable standard. Such standards are currently required from developers building estates through the bonding system.</p>
          <p eId="para_763">Many local authority estates were built back in the 1960s and 1970s and may not have featured today's quality of building materials but there is no excuse for local authorities not to address the aesthetics of such housing. It is like the broken window syndrome: if these issues are not addressed it further exacerbates the problem and people begin to lose interest in the community association and in maintaining their housing estate, with repercussions of which we are all too well aware.</p>
          <p eId="para_764">I am not sure how we can address the land banks issue but perhaps the expertise within the Department could come up with some imaginative solutions. Huge profits have been made in recent times due to the increased demand for housing. However, some mechanism is required to deal with the situation, perhaps through changes in the constitutional provisions on property ownership and through changes in the taxation code whereby people could be encouraged to release land immediately to increase the supply available for development. In the budget some years ago, changes were made to capital gains tax, which was used as a carrot and stick approach to encourage people to sell land in order to increase the supply. There was such a continual increase in the price of development land, however, that landowners who hoarded land were able to sit it out knowing full well that after a number of years the capital increases would far outweigh the problems associated with an increase in capital gains tax. We will have to re-examine those matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_765">Changes to the law on property ownership would require a constitutional referendum and while property owners would be concerned about that, we must be concerned with the greater public good. A compromise will have to be reached just as this Bill reached a compromise between tenants and landlords. The Irish Property Owners Association has stated it would prefer if this Bill was not, as it considers it to be, biased towards tenants. However, tenants who are renting property are most entitled to security of tenure. Very often they are on the threshold, trying to get on the property ladder, and, as such, they are vulnerable. In that respect, I welcome the provisions of the legislation.</p>
          <p eId="para_766">The best way we can address the cost of rental accommodation for ordinary people is to create a real supply of top quality accommodation. That would address the rental difficulties that are being experienced. Rents have decreased in some areas because of the increase in supply following the policies being pursued by the Government.</p>
          <p eId="para_767">I welcome the Bill and congratulate everybody who was involved in the initial stages of its drafting, as well as those who have taken part in the debate. I commend it to the House and wish it a speedy passage through the Oireachtas.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_435">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_768">Tá áthas orm deis a fháil labhairt ar an mBille um Thionóntachtaí Cónaithe 2003. The Residential Tenancies Bill 2003 provides us with an opportunity to examine a sector that is held in low esteem, even by landlords themselves, according to surveys. An attempt to focus on this issue is long overdue and, even if the legislation is imperfect, it will, I hope, be improved on Committee and Report Stages.</p>
          <p eId="para_769">The history of the rented sector in Ireland evokes the worst memories of exploitation, including evictions. Most people who are not involved in the sector probably think of such exploitation in a 19th century context. However, those who are dependent upon rented accommodation all too often arrive at clinics – I am sure  the Minister of State is aware of this, as much as any other Member of the House – with stories of absentee landlords and their agents that are not too far removed from the kind of tales one would associate with the 19th century. This is the case when notice to vacate a premises is served giving little time to find alternative accommodation or when rent is increased way above the rate of inflation. In those circumstances, people have little option but to take to the streets or pay up. That situation must be tackled and it would be remiss of any Government to allow it to continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_770">The evidence in this regard is not just anecdotal. There is enough hard evidence to prove that many landlords renting accommodation are unwilling to house anyone in receipt of a social welfare cheque. That raises the issue of registration upon which the Bill focuses attention but whether it will be sufficient remains to be seen. At our clinics we hear much about rented accommodation that is in an awful condition, including dampness, rats and cramped conditions. Any day of the week at a constituency clinic, one will hear these conditions being described vividly. The health problems associated with such living conditions in the rented sector can often be a source of considerable distress.</p>
          <p eId="para_771">The registration system for rented accommodation has involved enormous hypocrisy within the political system. It is obvious from surveys by Threshold and other voluntary organisations that there has been a flagrant disregard for the law when it comes to landlords registering. However, landlords are not sent to prison or severely reprimanded for not registering. It seems that the local authorities either do not have the resources or are not willing to use them accordingly.</p>
          <p eId="para_772">Unfortunately, there is a parallel between that and what the State did in the 1930s, 1940s and 1950s, which we have heard about in recent years following many cases of child abuse in institutions. The State was in the position that if it took strong action, the institutions would not be available and it would then have a problem in terms of what to do with the young children. The same is the case in the rented sector. If the State takes action against landlords for poor conditions, exploitation and lack of registration, they will invest their money in something else and the State will have to provide accommodation for people. It is time we faced up to the lack of willingness to tackle the issue head on because of the threat that the rented sector will not be available and that those with money to spare will invest it in an offshore account or somewhere else. I hope this Bill will deal with that anomaly and that the same type of regulations will be introduced here as there are in other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_773">This Bill also refers to anti-social behaviour. Similar legislation was introduced in the past for houses which were used for drug dealing or other types of criminal activity. The definition in this legislation is still unclear. The Government must give some thought to the definition of anti-social  behaviour and the limitations. It is a serious matter to be accused of anti-social behaviour and it is even more serious if a person is a victim of anti-social behaviour. The Government must consider the exact definition, which I am sure we will discuss on Committee Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_774">As regards the lack of sufficient penalties for non-registration of properties by landlords, the penalty of €140 does not indicate that we are serious about dealing with that issue as landlords are unlikely to quake in their boots. It is a fairly small amount of money considering the level of rent for most properties. That issue must be considered if we want to provide a serious deterrent from non-registration.</p>
          <p eId="para_775">There are many others issues with which I could deal, but I wish to share my time with Deputy Ó Caoláin.</p>

        <speech by="#TrevorSargent" eId="spk_437">
          <from>Mr. Sargent</from>
          <p eId="para_777">I understand that approximately 50,000 households currently depend on the rented sector. That is a sizeable portion of the population. One third of those households are in receipt of social welfare allowances. The thought that landlords could refuse to accept people in receipt of social welfare is extremely distressing for those who are already at a disadvantage. If the lack of penalties means that such behaviour is acceptable, it must be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_778">The Bill's proposed six-month probationary period, which allows a landlord to give 28 days' notice within that period, has been criticised by groups, such as Threshold. The temptation for a landlord who does not want to get into a long-term arrangement is to terminate the notice before six months, while giving 28 days' notice. We support shortening that probationary period to ensure that landlords face up to their responsibilities to provide long-term accommodation. Three months was recommended by Threshold, which seems reasonable. It is not clear if the legislation includes every form of rented accommodation. I assume it does, but I would like that clarified because many agencies want to know if bedsits are included.</p>
          <p eId="para_779">I have some experience of dealing with people who were unfortunate not to receive a service of notice. That often happens in a property in which a number of people are living because the letter is thrown in the door, but it does not reach the person to whom it is directed. There is a need to register such post and to clearly communicate a service of notice.</p>
          <p eId="para_780">It is also important to take into account the fact that this country has an appalling record in terms of providing student accommodation. We have the lowest levels in Europe, according to the Union of Students in Ireland. We depend on the private sector for rented accommodation at the beginning of the academic year which ends in May or June. It is a disruptive system because it uses up private rented accommodation of which  long-term households could avail. Other countries rely more on campus accommodation. We must face up to that responsibility rather than relying on private rented accommodation.</p>
          <p eId="para_781">I referred earlier to the standard of accommodation. There is a need to improve the level of insulation not only in rented accommodation, but in all houses. Although it does not necessarily have anything to do with Government policy, there is no doubt that energy costs will increase in the future. If we are serious about helping people, particularly those who are disadvantaged and on low incomes, we must improve the levels of insulation in rented accommodation. I cite the example of Berlin where the tenant is looked after. A portion of the rent which a tenant pays in Berlin can be withheld if repairs are not done or substandard accommodation is provided. That would be a revolutionary step in this country, given our history.</p>
          <p eId="para_782">The constitutional committee has mentioned changing the Constitution. However, the experts I heard at the committee when I was a member said they did not feel the need to change it. There must be political will to address the exploitative element in the rented sector where the price is too high for rented or private accommodation. Local authorities must be given the power to purchase agricultural land and they should be required to have it before it is rezoned and to have a certificate of valuation. We do not want the profiteering by developers to continue without a reasonable level of valuation.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_438">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_783">The record of the Fianna Fáil-Progressive Democrats Government on housing over the past six and a half years has been nothing short of appalling. It has mirrored the rest of its policies. Everything is left to the market, while social provision is ill-planned and underresourced. This long awaited Bill is yet another example. Tenants in the private rented sector will only have marginally more protection as a result of this Bill. The establishment of the tenancies board is welcome, but it is also long overdue. I acknowledge there are other positive elements, but so much depends on enforcement and enforceability that even those elements remain in question until we see what happens in practice. Everything has been done to protect the interests of landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_784">By contrast, tenants are expected to be content with the bare minimum. It is widely known that existing protections and regulations for tenants are not being enforced. The local authorities do not have the resources to enforce them. Under this Government the trend has been for local authorities to retreat from the area of housing. This is a sad reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_785">In recent weeks we have seen amazing revelations from the Revenue Commissioners about the extent of tax evasion in this State. We are also seeing exposed once more the practice of some of the wealthiest people sending their money  abroad to avoid taxation. Many of these people claim to be living outside Ireland for tax purposes while it is well known they are living here. The Government mentality which indulges and protects these people at every turn is evident in the Bill, where it provides that the landlords register will not be made available to the Revenue Commissioners. This is a disgraceful provision which speaks volumes about the real intent of the Government. Could the Minister explain this decision? Why should this register not be made available to the Revenue Commissioners? Why should this sector not be fully but fairly assessed and held to account as it should be?</p>
          <p eId="para_786">The fundamental weakness of the Bill is the Government's dogged refusal to address the issue of affordable rents. By refusing to regulate rents it has taken the side of landlords against tenants. This goes to the root of the Government's approach to housing – to serve the interests of the property owner. The landlord is seen as a player in the market and the tenant is a source of rent. If market forces cause rents to rise, all the better. This stance will ensure increased contributions to Fianna Fáil from their landlord and property developer friends. Meanwhile, tenants will continue to be fleeced.</p>
          <p eId="para_787">As a member of a local authority for the past 19 years, I have considerable experience at the coalface of dealing with people's needs in the context of the landlord-tenant relationship. There are many bona fide applicants for local authority housing who, as tenants, are denied their entitlement to rent subsidy under the terms of the supplementary welfare allowance scheme because their landlords refuse to provide evidence of rental payment. This scheme is operated by the network of community welfare officers, who are employees of the health boards. This abuse is not dealt with in the Bill, nor is there any promise to address the double-edged abuse perpetrated by landlords who refuse to acknowledge their incomes while simultaneously denying the less well-off their entitlements to assistance. I have no doubt the Minister is aware of this practice. Many single parent tenants, already living in fear because of the denial of fixity of tenure, are suffering serious financial hardship. This is not a great start for the young children of these families. From their earliest breaths they are victims of unscrupulous and greedy landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_788">In order to qualify for rent supplement, one must be paying less than €107 per week in rent. This has also caused great hardship as it is virtually impossible to find accommodation which costs less than this. It is pushing landlord and tenant agreements underground – people are clearly falsifying documentation in order to give the impression they are paying less than €107 per week.</p>

          <p eId="para_792">This ceiling must either be raised or scrapped entirely. Rents of more than €107 per week are not found only in city areas – they are the reality in most locations. In my own home town one would do very well to find accommodation for less than this. The cap on rent is cutting out access to rental subsidy for deserving people. This is something the Minister of State should deal with.</p>
          <p eId="para_793">The Minister of State wants to change the definition of homelessness. Many other speakers have mentioned this also. I was deeply disappointed with his position towards and his approach to the excellent work of a very credible organisation, Focus Ireland. Although I did not hear his commentary in the Chamber, I heard it subsequently on radio and television programmes. The idea behind redefining homelessness is to hide the reality of the level of need. This will win the Minister no friends among people who are dependent on B&amp;Bs, homeless hostels or women's refuges. This is not the note on which I wanted to finish, but the Minister of State is in denial. Perhaps there is a more suitable portfolio for him than that of responsibility for housing because he does not show the sentiment or the sympathy that is necessary to address this tragic day-to-day reality for countless families throughout the country. Housing is a right that should be enshrined in the Constitution.</p>

          <p eId="para_796">Rather than referring to housing in general, as previous speakers have done, I will consider some aspects of the Bill. This legislation will help alleviate many of the fears and concerns of some of those I meet on a regular basis. It was mentioned by another Deputy that 150,000 houses or more are now rented. That still leaves us some way behind many European countries, although one suspects that as things change in the coming years that number will increase, for a whole variety of reasons – different lifestyles, different family sizes, increasing mobility and so on.</p>
          <p eId="para_797">The Minister of State should be congratulated for bringing this legislation before us. I would like to have seen it a long time ago and I am glad it has eventually arrived here. It provides a legal framework for the relationship between landlord and tenant which did not exist before now. Various rental agreements were simply not worth the paper they were written on. There were no rules or regulations, and that did not favour either party. As many landlords have approached me about troublesome tenants with whom they did not know how to deal as have tenants whose  landlords did not, from their point of view, give them adequate notice. I welcome this Bill because it clearly sets out a whole range of obligations for both parties.</p>
          <p eId="para_798">I am sure the Irish Property Owners Association, a lobby group with a vested interest, has contacted most Deputies. I disagree with one or two of its points. It complains about the provision of a right to four years' automatic tenancy following a six-month tenancy period. I welcome this provision. As more people rent private accommodation, security of tenure becomes more important. It is important that they have security of tenure, that they can plan their lives and be guaranteed that their children will be in the same school for a number of consecutive years.</p>
          <p eId="para_799">The specific complaint made by the Irish Property Owners Association is that the proposal for an automatic four year right to occupy following an initial six months tenancy period is contrary to the tenant demand for flexible leasing arrangements. It also believes that the blanket imposition of these rights would be a godsend for troublesome tenants. I refute that claim. For the first time, the Bill gives a mechanism to deal with the whole area of anti-social behaviour and in the constituency I represent, which has a number of rented properties, that is an issue that must be addressed. There are tenants in private properties who cause problems for the landlords but, more frequently, the complaints come from the neighbours. This Bill addresses that problem specifically, and it does not just refer to anti-social behaviour in a general way. It goes further and identifies what it regards to be anti-social behaviour, not just on the part of the people living there but others who may visit and so on. That is a major issue and I am glad to see it addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_800">Another issue which was mentioned earlier is the area of registration. There is supposed to be a registration office in local authorities but most people realise it is hit and miss. I welcome the fact that a new registration system will be put in place. I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts and one of the issues that frequently arises is the whole area of computerisation and IT and the fact that computers are not linked up to each other and people do their own thing without communicating with each other. In that regard, I welcome one aspect of the Bill, which is the use of the tenant's personal public service number for registration purposes.</p>
          <p eId="para_801">While it is not specifically mentioned in the Bill, although it is an aspect I urge the Minister to examine, the logical follow on from this is the use of the details on the landlord's side. I cannot understand why there is not an automatic link from this registration to the Revenue Commissioners. Apparently it has not been ruled out fully, but as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, we examine from time to time the breakdown in communications in this area and I would welcome automatic exchange of information among all relevant Departments. That has been done to some extent on the tenant side with  the use of their numbers, but I would also like to see it as an automatic follow through on the landlord side.</p>
          <p eId="para_802">On the area of dispute resolution, currently there is no system in place. It is a case of the strongest wins, and that could be the tenant or landlord. That invariably leads to frustration and from that point of view, I am delighted the Bill provides for a system to address disputes. It is interesting to note, as a public representative, that there are a number of misunderstandings between landlord and tenant, many of which arise for minor reasons. In many ways the legislation will help prevent some of those disputes because the obligations of both parties are laid out. While the Bill is cumbersome, comprising many pages, I hope it will eventually be summarised and some of the key elements made available so that tenants would be fully aware of their rights.</p>
          <p eId="para_803">It is of equal importance, however, that the landlords know some of their basic rights because the disputes that arise originate from minor incidents. Both parties dig their heels in until eventually, in most cases, the tenant moves on. The fact that we are looking for longer four year tenancy periods to give stability must be tempered by the fact that we have a system here to address those type of disputes.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatCarey" eId="spk_446">
          <from>Mr. Carey</from>
          <p eId="para_804">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this important legislation. In welcoming the Bill, I compliment my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Noel Ahern, for bringing it forward. There is probably no one else in this House who has such an intimate knowledge of the housing sector as the Minister of State, and I reject the criticism of speakers like Deputy Ó Caoláin in regard to his handling of his portfolio.</p>
          <p eId="para_805">The Bill is the culmination of a process that started with the establishment of the Commission on the Private Rented Residential Sector. The commission, an independent group comprising a range of key players in the sector and interested bodies, examined the rented sector in detail and proposed a number of recommendations designed to improve the situation of tenants while maintaining a balance between the rights and obligation of both landlords and tenants.</p>
          <p eId="para_806">The commission's recommendations were designed to facilitate the rented sector of the housing market develop to its maximum potential and become an alternative choice for people seeking accommodation. There are, perhaps, 150,000 rented residential units in Ireland ranging from the penthouses in Ballsbridge to bed-sits with a toilet in the hall in Dublin 1, Dublin 3 or Dublin 11. The majority of tenants, because they are reasonably well off, can and do vote with their feet if their landlord is difficult, making for a fairly balanced tenant-landlord relationship.</p>
          <p eId="para_807">It is the tenants at the low end of the rental market for whom the Bill should have the greatest impact. That includes the 54,000 recipients of  SWA rent supplement. They typically have the periodic tenancy even though, very often, they may have started with a fixed term lease. This means that the landlord can evict them at will on 28 days' notice and raise the rent as much and as often as he or she likes. We know from contact with our constituents that this often arises.</p>
          <p eId="para_808">The insecurity of tenure in turn undermines the basic rights any tenant ought to be able to expect. If a tenant wants to assert his or her rights because they are being evicted illegally, the existing dispute resolution system conspires against them. There is no mediation available for handling deposit refund claims, except to a limited degree in the small claims court process. Tenants wishing to protest about their landlords' behaviour have to hire legal representation and go to court. This is a slow, expensive and therefore impractical process in most cases. The Government accepted the commission's recommendations and has included them in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_809">This has been a particularly good way of creating and introducing legislation. To a large extent it has been already agreed before its introduction and despite some comments about tweaking it, the vast majority of speakers I have heard are supportive of the thrust of it. While I have no doubt that as the debate proceeds to Committee Stage various suggestions and amendments will be proposed, it is fair to say that most Deputies and the public are supportive of the comprehensive and well balanced objectives of the Bill. If all legislation were approached in this way, our job would be considerably easier. I have had the opportunity of reading comments from many of the stakeholders from the organisations representing tenants to policy makers to organisations like the Irish Property Owners Association and I must say that, by and large, they are in agreement that this is the way we ought to proceed.</p>
          <p eId="para_810">One of the key provisions of the Bill is the establishment of a statutory private residential tenancies board. This is an extremely important feature of the legislation. For too long the residential sector has been viewed as secondary to home ownership. As a result, it became a slightly forgotten sector. It is appropriate and timely that we should now turn our attention to the rental sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_811">For more and more people, the option of renting is an option of choice. Society has clearly changed over the past decade. Flexible working arrangements are becoming a reality for more and more of the workforce. This often requires a level of housing mobility that renting can best provide. Over the past years there has been a massive increase in net immigration, not only of foreign nationals coming here to work but of Irish men and women returning to work. Short to medium term accommodation is usually what these people seek. Therefore, it is important that we not only address the current problems and imbalances in the rented sector, but that we create and maintain a focus on the means, oper ation and development of the sector. The establishment of the tenancies board will create and maintain this focus.</p>
          <p eId="para_812">One of the key roles given to the board will be the collection of data on, and the monitoring of, the sector and the undertaking of research into it. I agree with some previous speakers who expressed concern about the lack of data and hard information on this sector up to now. The board will be empowered to advise the Minister on activities and trends within the sector, thereby facilitating informed policy making for its future development.</p>
          <p eId="para_813">Dispute resolution will probably be the most important function to be carried out by the board. I particularly welcome this. At present the only legal method of resolving disputes between landlords and tenants, if they cannot resolve them themselves, is to go to court. However, for many people the courts are not a realistic option for a variety of reasons, most of which, as we all know, are largely concerned with the high cost of legal fees. People may not be able to afford to pay the costs associated with legal action or they may require speedier resolution than is perhaps usually available in the courts. I do not make this point as a criticism of the courts but merely to point out the reality of the judicial process. The result is that many of the disputes between landlords and tenants are not satisfactorily resolved.</p>
          <p eId="para_814">I doubt if there are many in the House who have not come across problems arising in the private rented sector, whether at local advice centres or in correspondence with our constituents. Problems arising for tenants include illegal evictions, too short notice to quit, massive rent increases, poor standards of accommodation, deposits being unreasonably withheld, or failure on the part of landlords to repair or replace broken fittings and appliances. Equally, landlords complain of tenants not paying rent, anti-social behaviour, causing a nuisance to other tenants or neighbours and damaging property.</p>
          <p eId="para_815">With the advent of the tenancies board, landlords and tenants will have recourse to an efficient and cost-effective dispute resolution procedure. Over a period of time, as the board deals with disputes as they arise, both landlords and tenants will become familiar with what is expected of them. I hope this will reduce the number of disputes arising in the sector and that landlords and tenants will become more professional in their dealings with each other.</p>
          <p eId="para_816">Another key aspect of the board's dispute resolution procedure is the fact that in all instances, the system is designed to help the parties resolve disputes themselves rather than have solutions imposed on them. This is an appropriate way to deal with disputes. The board's ethos appears to be to call on the parties to mediate, not litigate. Perhaps other areas of activity could learn from its approach.</p>
          <p eId="para_817">An aspect of the Bill which has perhaps not received the same amount of exposure as issues such as rent or security of tenure is the provision  which sets down in law obligations on landlords and tenants. I am especially impressed by the fact that it deals with the issue of anti-social behaviour. I wish we could come up with other words for anti-social behaviour because nowadays anybody who looks crooked at anybody else is accused of engaging in it. This provision has the major benefit of giving third parties a means to have problems with such behaviour addressed, including the right to make complaints to the tenancies board, if necessary. Unfortunately, incidents of anti-social behaviour are probably more prevalent now than in the past.</p>
          <p eId="para_818">Overall, the legislation will be good for the private rented sector and neither landlords nor tenants should have anything to fear from it. It will help to stabilise and professionalise the private rented sector and lay a suitable foundation for its development and much needed expansion. The Bill should make landlord-tenant relationships more balanced, even for those whose incomes and options are restricted. It is important that landlords are deterred from penalising a tenant, whether over the six month probation period or if he or she complains to the local authority that the standard of the dwelling is below the legal minimum. A provision should be included in the Bill to cover this.</p>
          <p eId="para_819">I would like to see a shorter probationary period of three months rather than the six months mentioned in the Bill. That amount of time should be sufficient for landlords to vet tenants. Landlords should be able to evict tenants who do not comply with their obligations quickly but they would see little to gain by cutting short tenancies to avoid Part 4 of the Bill. The penalty provision in section 14 is a critical safeguard against reprisals by unco-operative landlords. Section 14 should make explicit that retaliatory notice to quit is covered.</p>
          <p eId="para_820">I read the comments by the Irish Property Owners Association. While I recognise its concerns, they are not well-founded. The success or otherwise of the new statutory framework will turn on the efficiency with which the board fulfils its functions and, in particular, on the effectiveness of the dispute resolution service. Clearly, the board must be provided with adequate staff and other resources to carry out its functions. It is critical that the board establish itself as a force to be reckoned with at an early stage. Systems must be put in place to ensure that any determination made following the referral of a complaint to the board will be effectively enforced. It is also essential that clear user-friendly information on the impact of the forthcoming regime on existing rights and obligations is made available to tenants and landlords from the outset. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeHiggins" eId="spk_447">
          <from>Mr. J. Higgins</from>
          <p eId="para_821">Since I came into this House six and a half years ago, I questioned the Taoiseach on a number of occasions on the situation of tenants depending on private landlords for accommodation. I have brought to his attention on  many occasions the grievous exploitation of tenants in this State. Indeed, having been a tenant for approximately 20 years, I am familiar with the situation that obtains for those in our society who are dependent on private landlords for a roof over their heads. The purpose of the legislation is to ostensibly assist what is one of the most exploited sections of the population – those who are dependent on private landlords. They total probably a half a million people in this State of nearly four million.</p>
          <p eId="para_822">Historically, landlordism has been the scourge of the Irish people. I refer to the landed variety who were, historically, rapacious, ruthless thieves and people who caused enormous suffering to the majority of those who lived on the land. It took the great Michael Davitt and the Land League, a huge movement of people power – among the great demonstrations of people power in the history of the country – to rectify to some extent the balance between the tenant farmers, the small farmers, the rural community and the rapacious landlords.</p>
          <p eId="para_823">I am interested in hearing the Fianna Fáil speakers refer to the need for a balance between rights and responsibilities and to the relationship between landlord and tenant. There is no such thing. The relationship is hugely imbalanced in favour of the landlord and to the disadvantage of the tenant. In the capitalist society which obtains in this State, successive Governments have granted virtually all the rights to the propertied class. When the propertied class has the political system and the major political parties in its pocket, pays into their coffers and corrupts members of the main parties, as we have seen again and again, that propertied class can run riot to the detriment of the rights of ordinary people.</p>
          <p eId="para_824">The modern counterparts of the landed aristocracy of old are the owners of apartments, bedsitters and houses which are rented throughout the country. The greed of a significant section of the modern landlord class is not a shade paler than that of their landed counterparts in Irish history. The housing crisis over which the Government has presided for six and a half years has given a unique opportunity to the landlord class to rackrent with impunity and to charge the most outrageous rents for properties, ranging from small bedsitters and one-bedroom flats to modest three-bedroom semi-detached homes in modest suburbs. The Government has a disastrous record as far as the housing needs of our people are concerned. It has sat on its hands during that time and allowed the speculators and greedy land developers to run riot and to double, treble and, in Dublin, quadruple the price of a modest home. It has not raised a finger in any significant way to change the grotesque profiteering and exploitation, especially of young people who have to put a roof over their heads. In the same way as we had failure with regard to the price of homes, we have had absolute failure with regard to any measure of protection for the hundreds of thou sands of our people who are dependent on private landlords. The Government has left those people exposed to rackrenting landlords who charge exorbitant rents which are totally out of sync with reasonable standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_825">When modest homes in working class suburbs are being rented for as much as €1,500 per month and one-bedroom flats in modest areas of Dublin are being rented for between €700 and €900 per month, it is clear that there is an exploitative situation. A rent of €1,500 per month in west Dublin represents an annual income of €18,000, a far greater figure than many workers on the lower end of the income spectrum earn in an entire year. That is what the Government has allowed to happen. The landlord class has profited massively from the housing crisis in our society. The Government has sat back and allowed the land speculators to determine that a basic human right would not be afforded to many of our people, causing endless suffering, overcrowding and great family tensions in many parts of this city and in other cities and towns throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_826">The dishonourable record of certain Fianna Fáil members and councillors in succumbing to corruption by those who sought to corrupt the planning process has been responsible, in part, for the present crisis. It is ordinary people who suffer from the crimes of politicians who have been in the pockets of developers. Of course, much of this has been legal. Those landowners have subscribed to the Fianna Fáil Party and have, therefore, been able to dictate party policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_827">There is a double standard in our society. Six decent, honourable taxpayers from south Dublin are in prison tonight because they have taken a peaceful and honourable stand against double taxation and the taxation plans of the Government. Their crime was to carry out a peaceful and brief protest against double taxation. Within days they were landed in the High Court and then in the pits of Mountjoy and Wheatfield prisons, but not a single one of those creatures who subverted the housing rights of our people through the corruption of the Fianna Fáil Party has been in front of a court, let alone seen the back of the high walls of Mountjoy Prison.</p>
          <p eId="para_828">The Bill addresses the key issue of security of tenure to some degree. The other critical issue is that of the cost of rents and the affordability of private rented accommodation. This is the one issue on which the Bill refuses to legislate. The single most difficult issue tenants face, their grotesque exploitation by landlords, is not addressed in the Bill. That is incredible. The provision that rents shall not be greater than the market rent prevailing would be a sick joke if it were not so serious for so many tenants. What is the market rent? It is whatever the landlord, in a landlords' market, decides to set. What is the purpose of giving the collection and provision of information relating to the private rented sector, including information concerning prevailing rent levels, as one of the responsibilities of the Residential Tenancies Board? The Minister knows well that land lords can charge anything they want and can judge the cost of a property in Mulhuddart by the standard of a rent in Foxrock. This is a joke. The Minister of State had better get back to basics regarding the issue of affordability and exploitation.</p>

          <p eId="para_830">Let us get on to supply. The Minister of State referred to increased investment through the promotion of public private partnerships in order to resolve the housing crisis. He should get real. We have much experience of providing good quality public housing. That is what we should get back to rather than depending on the equivalents of National Toll Roads and the rest of them. They will hold us to ransom if the principles enunciated by the Minister of State are put into practice.</p>
          <p eId="para_831">The key to resolving the grotesque exploitation of tenants is the provision of large numbers of affordable, good quality, properly planned homes in order to take the ground from under the landlord class, but the Government is not addressing that issue. Another key issue which could resolve the situation is the provision of good quality on-campus student accommodation.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. Callely)</from>
          <p eId="para_832">In opening the debate this evening, I would like to comment on some of the issues raised in last night's debate. Deputy Olivia Mitchell raised the issue of the future of private health insurance in this country. Currently, 49% of the population has private health insurance cover. Private health insurance is a long-established feature of our health care system and the health strategy affirmed that it would continue to play a vital part in the overall resourcing of health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_833">The policy of my Department in relation to services for older people is to maintain them in dignity and independence by providing the necessary supports and to provide a high quality of hospital and residential care for older people when they can no longer be maintained at home. The home help service plays a role in the implementation of my Department's policy. Since 2000, the total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas has been 113%.</p>
          <p eId="para_834">I am also pleased to advise that a number of health boards are developing personal care packages that are more focused on individual care needs involving the public health nurse service, attendance at day care, day hospital, rehabilitation, respite care and home help and care assistance. I am actively encouraging all health boards to explore the benefits of such care packages. It is important to acknowledge that many positive things are happening in our services for older people. Of course, I also appreciate that there are gaps in service provision in the regions that we must address and I will be working with all the relevant authorities to further improve services.</p>
          <p eId="para_835">Listening to the Labour Party contributions last night, they seemed to be hedging their bets, speaking out of both sides of their mouths, but clearly refusing to make any real decisions. If the Labour Party is serious about health reform, it is time to drop the cherry-picking approach. Indeed, one would think they would be present in the House for this debate.</p>
          <p eId="para_836">I take serious issue with their motion that claims no health reform has taken place. This suggestion is as dishonest as it is unworthy. Unlike the Labour Party, the Government parties will not cherry-pick expert reports. We will not engage in each way bets and we will, at all times, do what is in the best interest of patients. This will involve some difficult choices along the way but our approach, from which the Labour Party could learn much, is founded on two key concerns – first to invest in services and second to bring about significant reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_837">In terms of investment, we have made considerable progress since the days the Labour  Party was last in government. This year the Government will invest almost €9.2 billion in health and that compares to a paltry £2.5 billion donated by the rainbow Administration when it was last in office six years ago. Put simply, it is the parties on this side of the House that have increased the health spend by 162%.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_839">While it might pain the Deputies opposite to admit it, the facts show that Fianna Fáil and our partners, the Progressive Democrats, have shown the political will to reverse the historical under-investment in our health services. We are proud of this record and can stand over the level of investment we have allocated to health. The Labour Party must ask itself if it is proud of what took place on its watch.</p>
          <p eId="para_840">Regarding the Labour Party's criticism of our reform record, we are now set forth on implementing the most comprehensive reform programme in the recent history of Irish health care. As Deputy McManus is well aware, earlier this year the Government announced decisions regarding a new health service executive, which will include a national hospital office, a primary and continuing care directorate and a shared services centre. Taken together, these structural reforms represent the biggest single national reorganisation of the health system since 1970. Work is well under way to make these changes a reality. The Labour Party motion talks about a belief that "equality of access to the highest quality possible of medical care should be a central feature of our hospital service". I suggest to Deputy McManus that if she were really sincere about this sentiment, she and her colleagues would row in behind the Government in support of the reforms we have set in train.</p>
          <p eId="para_841">While this might be too much to hope for, it is surely not too much to ask Deputy McManus to stop engaging in scaremongering on such a sensitive issue. I was disappointed to hear the unworthy suggestion that it is the Government's intention to downgrade local hospitals around the country. She knows, as Members of this House know, that nothing could be further from the truth.</p>

          <from>Mr. Callely</from>
          <p eId="para_843">The Hanly report is about providing a higher quality of care in local hospitals – it is not about downgrading or closing them down. The reality is that it is Labour policies, not Government policies, that would close local hospitals. Current Labour Party policy entails a diversion of urgently needed funding away from the patient and into bureaucracy; the effect of this on local hospitals would be detrimental. The universal health insurance system the Labour Party advocates entails doubling the spending on  administration costs and this is borne out by international studies.</p>
          <p eId="para_844">Labour has previously told us that it is committed to fully funding the health strategy. Last night members of the party came into this House and demanded immediate financial commitment in regard to the Hanly report. If Labour is still committed to funding the universal health insurance system it must add that expenditure too to its published spending plans. I look forward to seeing how Deputy McManus will make these figures stand up.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Connor</from>
          <p eId="para_850">I am not going to compete with the Minister of State who made Deputies on the Opposition benches smile so heartily. I compliment Deputy McManus on tabling this motion. It is important that these issues are raised and I always take the opportunity to outline the opinions of my constituents.</p>
          <p eId="para_851">I support the Minister for Health and Children and his Ministers of State in their determined efforts to give this country a health service that should be customer focused. I think all Members should support the Minister in his endeavours. By all means, we should examine and highlight the areas of concern. Offering the alternatives for discussion in the Chamber is something we should do.</p>
          <p eId="para_852">Members will know that I represent Tallaght. It is not unusual for me to mention Tallaght in a debate like this as there is a major general hospital in the area. Not only have I been on its board since 1987, I have had the pleasure of being a patient there and experienced at first hand the good work that is done there. I often visit neighbours and friends in the hospital and see the great work that is done. Of course, this work is not only done in Tallaght, it is also done in other general hospitals around the city, county and country and it is important that we support this work in every way. While I accept that a little bit of politics will  always go on, we should understand that great work is carried out in our general hospitals.</p>
          <p eId="para_853">I accept that at a time when the Exchequer is spending so much money on our health services – I understand it is €10 billion this year – somebody will have to find a solution to the problem where people are seeking beds and assistance in our hospitals. Just to be fair, I checked with Tallaght hospital this evening and I understand 27 patients are waiting for beds in the accident and emergency unit and there were 18 majors and 15 minors waiting to be seen.</p>

I am positive about Tallaght hospital, I am positive about the work of the Department of Health and Children and I am certainly positive about the commitment of the Minister. I believe the health service is in very good hands and the Minister is doing a good job. We should let him continue with this good work and should support him in any way.</p>
          <p eId="para_856">We in Tallaght are pleased that the National Children's Hospital is expanding its services. I understand that a new paediatric post has been approved, as has a further academic paediatric post. The hospital has also told me that all the relevant participating bodies are evaluating proposals for further posts. I am positive about the health service. We must keep the pressure on the Department and as a Government backbencher I am prepared to do this. I am proud of what is happening in Tallaght and I am happy to support the Government, as I always do.</p>

          <from>Ms O'Malley</from>
          <p eId="para_857">While it is always a challenging time to be in charge of the health portfolio, the current Minister has had the benefit of presiding over a time when record amounts of money have been made available. He also has the benefit of recognising and knowing that finance is no longer the problem, that it is management and structures which need reorganising. With the three reports now completed, together with the health strategy, we finally have a strategic plan with which we can improve health care.</p>
          <p eId="para_858">Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children had the benefit of meeting Mr. David Hanly last week. As he pointed out, we have no alternative but to implement the report which has a lot to do with the working time directive. The motion before us is a little ill-considered because these reforms must take place. Everyone now recognises that we are tired of receiving reports that sit on shelves. This time it will be different, perhaps because we have requirements under the European working time directive which has become the catalyst. For whatever reason, it is going to work while the requirements will be managed.</p>
          <p eId="para_859">The Government alone cannot deliver a better health care service to patients. All of us, including health workers, politicians and the Department of Health and Children, recognise that patients are at the centre, the beginning and end of the health care reforms. We must look to the consultants and the work they will do in delivering what is set out in the report. The Government and politicians cannot do it alone. We need the co-operation of the consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_860">Those of us who are members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children hear consultants time after time looking for more money because there are not enough of them employed. The reports shows where we need to go. I call on the consultants to recognise their responsibilities to their patients, and urge that we all adopt a "can do" and deal making attitude in order that we will deliver better health care to patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_861">The other notion being spread is that local hospitals will diminish in responsibility and activity. We need to nail this lie. It was nailed by Mr. David Hanly and others who appeared before the joint committee last week.</p>

          <p eId="para_863">Rather than queue and move forward and back, there will be a lot more important activity in hospitals. Health care will become more focused and strategic. Particularly in more peripheral areas, we all know that it is the level of care one gets in the first hour after a trauma that is important. That is the reason the report recognises the importance of the ambulance service, and the improvements needed to it. The Government has resolved to have the report, which I commend, delivered. Budgets are mounting. It is now time that those of us concerned with patient health care, particularly those working in the service, recognise the changes that must be adopted in delivering better health care to patients.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MJNolan" eId="spk_466">
          <from>Mr. Nolan</from>
          <p eId="para_864">I welcome the opportunity to support the Minister in the matter of the recently published Hanly report. The main task of the report was the implementation of the working time directive which requires that non-consultant hospital doctors reduce their hours of work to 48 by 2009. The task force took account of two previous reports, the forum report which had recommended a consultant-provided service and the report on non-consultant hospital doctor working hours. A consultant-provided service replacing the consultant-led system is certainly the way forward. The present system is largely consultant-led where consultants lead and advise teams of junior doctors rather than taking a continuing and direct role in the provision of care in all cases. It means that patients have limited access to senior clinical decision makers, namely, consultants, relying instead to a significant degree on doctors in train ing. It is vital that they are seen by a doctor who has the skills, training and experience to diagnose, treat and plan the management of patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_865">In the context of the Hanly report, I made a case in my constituency that in the South-Eastern Health Board we had a regional hospital which is misplaced on the edge of the constituency. Some of my colleagues in the Labour Party were critical of my statement at the time but it is not conflict with anything contained in the report. The South-Eastern Health Board, or any health board, can decide to change the location of a regional hospital. Waterford Regional Hospital is misplaced as a regional centre. Kilkenny would be a far more suitable location. The report does not deal with the specific location of regional or general hospitals. I, therefore, call on the South-Eastern Health Board to review the decisions of the early 1970s when Waterford was designated as the location of the regional centre.</p>
          <p eId="para_866">In order to create a consultant-provided service that allows for reduced working hours for junior hospital doctors, we need to reorganise acute hospital services. Patients achieve a better outcome when treated in units dealing with sufficient numbers of cases, with specialist staff and diagnostic facilities. Hospitals with low volumes of patients cannot sustain large numbers of consultants who become deskilled if they do not treat sufficient numbers of patients. This means, in turn, that they cannot guarantee high quality care or adequately train junior hospital doctors.</p>
          <p eId="para_867">Local hospitals will provide minor injury and illness units. It is important to emphasise that some 60% of those who attend hospital emergency departments require non-urgent care. Typically, about one third of patients require urgent or semi-urgent care while only 5% to 10% have major trauma which needs to be attended to in accident and emergency units. The minor injury units in local hospitals will, therefore, be able to cater for a very high proportion of cases presented to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_868">I support the Hanly report. Perhaps there are aspects of it which need to be streamlined but, in general, it is a good report which will go a long way towards alleviating some of the current difficulties in the medical care system.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_869">When I was first elected, the Minister for Health and Children at the time was Deputy Rory O'Hanlon, now the Ceann Comhairle. He was put under a lot of pressure and the scene has not changed much for those fortunate or unfortunate enough to occupy the position of Minister for Health and Children. We have to acknowledge that despite the huge investment made in the health service, all is not well and change is badly required. In fairness to the Minister, he has shown a willingness to make the necessary changes and it is important that we support and help him in that task.</p>
          <p eId="para_870">When change is proposed, we can be certain of one thing, that there will always be resistance. It is vital that workers, in particular, and the public  are fully informed of what changes and reforms will take place. Unless we get the full support of those employed in the health service, the necessary reforms will not be possible. Last night I listened to a number of Labour Party speakers and it is difficult to understand their approach. It appears that they are keen to have some elements of the Hanly report implemented but are not so sure about other aspects.</p>

          <from>Mr. S. Power</from>
          <p eId="para_872">The report forms part of the Government's health strategy. It comes as one unit; it is not possible to adopt an <i>à  la carte </i>approach. We cannot pretend that we are in a position to provide multidisclipinary specialist teams within immediate reach of all households. Tough decisions will have to be taken but we cannot and should not try to fool the public. If we explain clearly the reasons behind the reforms, the public will understand and accept them. We have a population of four million; we are not living in Tír na nÓg.</p>
          <p eId="para_873">Hospitals with small numbers of patients cannot sustain big numbers of consultants. We will see a new role for local hospitals. It is important to emphasise to local communities that no hospitals will close as a result of implementing these reforms. We cannot allow a negative attitude to prevail. We have seen major changes taking place and major benefits in the health service. We have made great strides, despite the difficulties we are encountering.</p>
          <p eId="para_874">In the area of children's cancers we have treatment available that is as good if not better than what is available anywhere else in the world, and recovery rates are very high. In Naas Hospital in my area there was talk of closure for many years, yet in recent years we have seen huge investment taking place in the provision of new facilities. While there are teething problems, we are making real progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_875">I would like to refer to Peamount Hospital in the context of the five year strategy. That hospital specialises in the treatment of chest illnesses. It is now to be replaced by a rehabilitation unit. I ask the Minister of State to examine how this decision was reached. It is peculiar that a hospital specialising in a particular area is to be replaced. I ask the Minister to reconsider that decision and get directly involved with the staff in that regard.</p>

          <from>Dr. Devins</from>
          <p eId="para_876">I am delighted to have an opportunity to speak on this Private Members' Bill proposed by the Labour Party. This Government is delivering on its promise to provide an acute hospital service that meets the public need. Unlike the Opposition, who feel everything can be done in a flash, the public know real change and real improvements take time. The current Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, recognises this and has carried out widespread consultation with all the stakeholders in  medicine and health to ensure the best health care service is created. It has taken time.</p>
          <p eId="para_877">With the publication of the Brennan, Prospectus and Hanly reports during the past few months, the way is now clear to implement the changes required in our hospital service. I said before – I feel strongly about this so I will repeat it – that the most important person in medicine is the patient. Implementation of the Hanly report will ensure every citizen has access to the highest level of care appropriate to their illness. A patient with a minor illness or injury should attend his or her family doctor to have it treated. If such person suffers or sustains a more serious illness or injury he or she can attend the local hospital to receive treatment. However, a person unfortunate enough to sustain a major injury or illness would expect to be treated in a hospital equipped to deal with such an occurrence.</p>
          <p eId="para_878">If a person suffers a heart attack the best treatment involves him or her having a cardiograph and immediate fibril-electric treatment and he or she should be transferred to a modern coronary care unit with appropriate back-up such as invasive cardiology, radiological and laboratory facilities. This must be available to all citizens equally and not only to those in Dublin and Cork as is currently the position. Implementation of the Hanly report will ensure equality of access.</p>
          <p eId="para_879">It is worth remembering two further points. Only the first part of the Hanly report dealing with the mid-western and south eastern areas in terms of health care is currently available. Mr. Hanly recently told the health committee that the remainder of the report covering the rest of the country will be available in approximately nine months' time. When questioned, Mr. Hanly acknowledged that the concept of further developing certain general hospitals which would be suitable for areas of the country which for geographical reasons are too far removed from major cities of tertiary care can be worked on.</p>

          <p eId="para_889">I wish to share time with Deputies Cowley, McGrath, Connolly, Gormley and Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin.</p>
          <p eId="para_890">The failure of this Government to deliver a proper health service is a shame and a disgrace. What it has squandered in terms of health is nothing short of a crime. Where are the shorter waiting lists for acute treatment? They are not in County Clare – of that much I am sure.</p>
          <p eId="para_891">A distraught constituent rang me on Friday. He had to accompany his wife by ambulance from a village six miles outside Ennis to the regional hospital in Limerick, a 32 mile journey which took nearly two hours because of traffic gridlock. Having spent some time in casualty he waited half an hour for a porter who never arrived, resulting in his having to bring his wife to the ward. That is not acceptable.</p>
          <p eId="para_892">What will happen in County Clare when the Hanly report is fully implemented? Will patients in Clare have to go to Limerick for treatment? Will we have to ask people not to get sick during rush hour? Ennis General Hospital serves a population of 103,000 within Clare county and a fast increasing urban population in Ennis town. It provides acute services to patients within the Clare catchment area. It provides in-patient and out-patient services and a busy accident and emergency unit. Not only does the casualty department serve the population of Clare, it serves the transitory holiday population and the north-south route from Galway to Limerick.</p>
          <p eId="para_893">The Hanly report sets out to rob us of our accident and emergency service. It is proposed that the acute psychiatric service be moved to Limerick. That is ridiculous. We cannot be subjected to such measures in any shape or form given the size of the Clare catchment area as already outlined. Some €15 million is to be spent upgrading Ennis General Hospital. Can we be sure of that when in a recent interview on Clare FM the Minister of State said he was not aware of it? That does not instil confidence in the electorate of Clare.</p>
          <p eId="para_894">It is great to hear Fianna Fáil Deputies say the experts know what they are talking about. Do they live in Loop Head or any other remote part of Clare? The people of Clare are to hold a mass rally on 15 November to voice their concerns and disgust in this regard. They will let this Government know we will not be robbed of the right to a decent and full health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_895">It is time this Government put some weight  behind its empty promises and provided beds, consultants and the modernisation of the Irish health service.</p>

          <from>Dr. Cowley</from>
          <p eId="para_902">I am glad to have an opportunity to speak on this motion. I know we will have more time to discuss the Hanly report next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_903">It is difficult to believe what the Minister says when we witness what is happening in our hospitals. Last night, there were 11 people on trolleys in the accident and emergency unit at Mayo General Hospital. Most of them were elderly. There is a shortage of paediatric beds at Mayo General Hospital. This is not an isolated incident. People are being left on trolleys every night and that is wrong. The problem is not a lack of planning. It is welcome that we now have a plan and are to receive a consultant provided service but at what cost?</p>
          <p eId="para_904">We should be helping local hospitals rather than taking from them. The problem has not been the lack of a Hanly report but the lack of resources. We have had loads of reports. We had the health strategy. The problem with them all has been a lack of finance, and the problem with our health service has been a lack of money. Some has been put in, and I agree that it happened, but it was only right that money should be put in. Only now has it reached a level comparable with that of other countries in a similar position to us. The bottom line is that money has been put into the national treatment purchase fund, about which the Minister spoke last night. Would it not have been much better if that money had been put into developing local services? What we intend is to take from them.</p>
          <p eId="para_905">I also question those who wrote the Hanly report. I would never say that they had spent time in my constituency, for example, or dealing with the people with whom I deal. The Minister spoke last night about all the wonderful people who  were removed from the waiting lists. The Minister may not have seen <i>The Irish Times</i> today, but it reported that there had been a 200% increase in waiting lists. Where does that get us in Mayo? There has been a gross underspend on regional development, which I call unbalanced. The bottom line is that we are not at the races. I will conclude now, but I will welcome the opportunity to speak on the Hanly report in much more detail.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#FinianMcGrath" eId="spk_487">
          <from>Mr. F. McGrath</from>
          <p eId="para_906">I am grateful for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on the health service. I was elected on a strong health mandate, and I intend to live up to those principles in this debate. All citizens, in every part of this country, must have access within a reasonable time to world-class accident and emergency services. I give my support and commitment to radical reform in the health service. However, reform must go hand in hand with investment. If we do not face up to that reality, we are turning our backs on our citizens. I welcome the sections in the Hanly report that call for the provision and funding of 3,000 additional beds, a doubling of hospital consultant numbers to 3,600, and the upgrading and retraining of emergency medical technicians. Those are all positive recommendations, but I have major concerns about the Government's commitment. As I have said many times before, reforms must go together with funding and investment in the health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_907">We must also face up to the current crisis in accident and emergency services. The Government has failed to deliver an acute hospital service that meets the public need. We can have all the reports and recommendations we like, but having patients on trolleys in Beaumont Hospital is simply not good enough. It might be trendy and fashionable to hammer the decent taxpayers of this country while ignoring the broken lifts at Temple Street Hospital or the 25 people on trolleys at Beaumont Hospital. When will the Minister wake up to that fact and deal with the real issues confronting our people? The health service is seriously sick, and I ask him when he will make it better.</p>
          <p eId="para_908">While I support the motion, in the interests of all our citizens and taxpayers it is only fair to point out that successive Governments have failed to provide the necessary infrastructure to deal with health and social service waiting lists. The motion is about the health service. Above all, it sends out a caring and compassionate message to a society that is already riddled with greed. I urge all Deputies to support it.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaudgeConnolly" eId="spk_488">
          <from>Mr. Connolly</from>
          <p eId="para_909">Last night the Minister for Health and Children asked this side of the House whether it was supporting or rejecting the Hanly report. I do not believe he got an answer, but I am rejecting it. I strongly suggest that the Minister contact his own members on the North-Eastern Health Board, whose welcome consisted of binning the report. They did not accept it in the  north-east, and I am surprised that the Minister had to wait here to find out the response. Any report that has as its terms of reference setting aside cost implications and accepting the fact that one will have industrial relations implications, is not for the real world. It will be consigned to the shelf. It will be put up beside the Fitzgerald report and the 150 others. A few more spaces are left, and that is where the report is going.</p>
          <p eId="para_910">They are all effectively proposing the same thing – 14 regional centres of excellence. Governments have been trying that for 30 years, and it simply will not happen. At the launch in Government Buildings, both the Minister for Health and Children and Mr. Hanly himself denied three times that what was in the report amounted to downgrading. If one speaks to the ordinary man or woman on the street, he or she will tell one that removing an accident and emergency department or maternity unit from a general hospital amounts to its downgrading. It does not matter an iota how one window-dresses that.</p>
          <p eId="para_911">I know that the Minister tried to balance matters by stating that he would give them a dermatologist, rheumatologist or geriatrician as a kind of <i>quid pro quo</i> for the loss of accident and emergency services and maternity units. It does not work that way. Those services are needed regardless of the Hanly report. We are far behind the European average in such specialties. We should not have to wait for Hanly to say that the Government will take away accident and emergency services, but that communities will get something else in its place.</p>
          <p eId="para_912">In an emergency, people want access to a hospital. They want to see a doctor and ensure that the person they have with them will be stabilised. Someone could be suffering a severe haemorrhage, or there might be a mother whose child is suffering an asthmatic attack. Someone could be suffering a heart attack. That person probably arrives in a car, and every minute in it is probably an eternity. The person wants service straight away. If a woman is in labour, she does not want to be told to wait while someone checks the protocols to see how he can save himself or herself and send the person on ahead. If the birth happens when the woman is outside the hospital, the hospital saves, since it need not make an insurance claim. Such things are morally wrong, and we should never refuse to cater for an emergency. People see it as a basic and vital service.</p>
          <p eId="para_913">We spoke about the golden hour. The treatment that a patient receives in the initial hour following an accident or injury can provide a much better outcome, depending on how early it occurs. I know that my time is running short. There is an expectation in all those reports that GPs in their co-operatives will provide a service. In the North-Eastern Health Board area, for example, in Our Lady's General Hospital in Navan, doctors have stated that, if they are asked to take on the role of accident and emergency doctors, they will move from the site. They are not trained for that role but to provide a GP ser vice. We will be taking every form of emergency, including people with broken fingers or who need four or five stitches, to a regional centre of excellence and treating them there. Where else will they be catered for if not there? The other hospitals are closed. Accident and emergency departments are closed at weekends. Football injuries and minor accidents will all have to go there, for GPs will not treat them. We need people to be stabilised in general hospitals. I see that my time is up. I got good value for money.</p>

          <from>Mr. Gormley</from>
          <p eId="para_915">I welcome the opportunity to speak on this important issue and fully support the motion put forward by the Labour Party. The Government has failed spectacularly to deliver equality of access to our health service. The two-tier health system is now fully embedded and will continue because of the Government's failure to invest the fruits of the boom wisely in the health system and fully recognise the importance of preventive care. We have seen the publication of report after report. They are not, and sometimes cannot be, implemented. On the Hanly report, it is not at all clear whether the Minister for Finance is prepared to countenance further spending to ensure its implementation. Given that he has done so much to ensure a two-tier society, we should not be surprised if he is happy to continue with our two-tier health system. In the Hanly report, that two-tier system is taken to a new level. It is no longer a question of how much money one has but of where one lives. If one lives in Dublin or a major city, it seems one will not have to travel that far to receive good care. If one is unlucky enough to live in a rural area such as near Ennis, which has been mentioned, one will not have a proper accident and emergency unit in one's area. Mr. Hanly and the Minister have been at pains to stress that this does not represent a downgrading, but that is not how it seems to people who live in the areas to which I have referred. My Green Party colleagues in County Clare, particularly Mr. Brian Meaney, do not see it that way. I compliment Mr. Meaney on the amount of work he has done to try to retain services in Ennis.</p>
          <p eId="para_916">The Hanly report proposes that more consultants be put in place, something that is badly needed. I would welcome such a move. I want to see results and I want to know where the money will come from. Mr. Hanly told the health committee that the figures add up and that the plan will not involve huge extra expenditure. I am not so sure, however, as we are talking about an extremely powerful group. As I said at the committee meeting, if I were the Minister I would rather take on the local opposition groups than the consultants.</p>
          <p eId="para_917">I do not doubt that the Minister will respond  to this debate by saying that health spending has increased dramatically under Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats, which is true. We have not made up for years of under-investment and cutbacks, however. The Minister admitted on "The Late Late Show" that he favours tax increases to fund a better health service. The Deloitte &amp; Touche value for money audit of the health system states, "If a superior system is demanded by the public (and there is much evidence to believe this to be the case), then, as taxpayers, the financial implications of addressing the current health service deficits need to be accepted."  I agree with that statement.</p>
          <p eId="para_918">While this country's health spending has reached the EU average, we are still bottom of the EU league in many areas such as rheumatology and neurology. The average life expectancy in the State is falling behind the EU average. According to the figures for 2001, we had three acute hospitals for every 1,000 people, compared to an EU average of 4.81. There is no doubt that while we have reached the EU spending average, our services are far behind those elsewhere in the Union and we continue to mis-spend.</p>
          <p eId="para_919">This morning's Supreme Court judgment is a reminder of how we get things wrong. As a result of the judgment, home births will be a privilege of the well-off. The trend of centralising maternity care services in high-technology units is being continued. There were 108 maternity units in this country in 1973, but there are only 22 now. The medical manpower forum has recommended that a further 12 maternity units be closed. We have to ask if this is cost efficient. Almost 40% of Irish babies are born in three major maternity hospitals in Dublin. We know that the larger the institution, the more costly it is to service.</p>
          <p eId="para_920">Many sets of figures demonstrate that the highly interventionist approach that marks out the Irish maternity care service is extremely costly. I will back up that statement by citing some figures that show that certain services are particularly costly to maintain. It has been estimated that a caesarean section costs over three times more than an ordinary delivery. Dutch health care insurance data on the cost of births show that the caesarean rate of 10% in Amsterdam in 1997 accounted for 44% of the total cost of maternity care in the city that year.</p>
          <p eId="para_921">If the Green Party ever has the opportunity to serve in Government, it will amend the Health Act 1970 to ensure that all women have access to proper maternity care services, regardless of how much money they have. If they wish to have a home birth, they should be allowed to have a home birth.</p>

        <speech by="#CaoimhglinOCaolain" eId="spk_491">
          <from>Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin</from>
          <p eId="para_922">I wish to record my support for the Labour Party's motion. We do not need repeated public surveys to tell us that the biggest political issue of concern is the state of the health services. We know from our personal and family experience, our work as elected rep resentatives and our membership of local communities that the greatest cause of public disillusionment with the political system is its failure to correct the problems in the health system. Although this is a failure of successive Governments, no previous Government had the resources available to this Government to deliver increased funding and fundamental reform. The Government has failed miserably in its six years in office.</p>
          <p eId="para_923">If there is one factor that the Government can examine to explain its massive unpopularity in successive opinion polls, it is its broken promises in respect of health. Fianna Fáil's pre-election promises to abolish hospital waiting lists within two years and to extend the medical card to 200,000 more people have become bywords for broken political promises. People know the difference between Government rhetoric and the reality.</p>
          <p eId="para_924">I will be obliged later this month to step down as a member of the North-Eastern Health Board. My time as a member of the health board has been dominated by the fight to save Monaghan General Hospital, as well as Dundalk General Hospital in County Louth, from being downgraded and eventually closed. The axing of the maternity unit in Monaghan, combined with the attendant gynaecological and paediatric services, has hit women and children in County Monaghan hard. The closure of accident and emergency units is equally devastating.</p>
          <p eId="para_925">When Mr. David Hanly addressed the Joint Committee on Health and Children last week, he justified the planned closure of such units in local hospitals by saying that between 60% and 70% of those attending them require non-urgent care. That means, however, that between 30% and 40% of people presenting at accident and emergency wards require urgent care.</p>
          <p eId="para_926">These changes are being proposed in the absence of the promised massive upgrade in primary care, which is still inadequate and under-resourced. I have said repeatedly that Monaghan will be used as a blueprint or a template for the diminution of services across the State. As I listened to the presentation at the launch of the Hanly report, I saw that blueprint unfolding. The fight to save Monaghan General Hospital and other hospitals is repeatedly portrayed as "parish pump" local politics. We have been patronised by those who wilfully ignore the needs and wishes of local communities. The centralisation agenda has been pursued by Ministers, bureaucrats from the Department of Health and Children and representatives of the professional bodies. This agenda is driven by various interests and not by the interests of real people – those who use the health service. I refer in particular to those who depend on our public health service.</p>
          <p eId="para_927">Many services in local hospitals will be removed if this aspect of the Hanly report is implemented. The Minister's claim that there will be no downgrading will not wash with concerned citizens and health care providers at many of  these locations. The commitment not to close hospitals is a well-worn response from the Minister, Deputy Martin. It has been repeated many times in the case of Monaghan, while services diminish. The people of County Monaghan are very familiar with the language used by the Minister and his colleagues.</p>
          <p eId="para_928">I welcome the planned reduction in the working hours of junior hospital doctors, in line with EU directives. While the Government is indicating that more consultants will be employed, there will not be a substantial increase in the aggregate number of consultants and junior hospital doctors in the next ten years. There is a total of 5,800 such workers at present, a figure that will have increased to 5,900 by 2013. This is hardly a dramatic increase.</p>
          <p eId="para_929">The national health strategy, which was published in 2001, promised to renegotiate the consultants' contracts. The preliminary negotiations have not yet been concluded, over two years later, however. The Minister is promising a renegotiation on the back of the Hanly report. It seems that everything had to wait for the report. Consultants should be working exclusively in the public health system and should be paid by the State. The Brennan report recommended that all new consultant posts should be in the public system. The fact that the Hanly report does not address this issue directly is a major deficiency. The Brennan recommendation is essential if we are to end the two-tier system of apartheid in the health sector. The Government does not want to end that system. While the Minister is talking about further centralisation and centres of excellence – local hospitals will suffer as a result – he should note that we have a centre of excellence currently under threat at Peamount, which is noted for specialising in TB and its expertise of service. Will he intervene to ensure that the experience and expertise built up at Peamount in respect of TB be retained, resourced and not scattered to the winds at different sites around the city and beyond?</p>

          <from>Ms Burton</from>
          <p eId="para_932">I will make my points in the context of yesterday's Exchequer returns, which call for an explanation from the Minister. There has been a 12% fall in the capital spend compared to that of last year. There has been an under-spend of over €700 million in respect of current spending, which contradicts the forecast the Minister for Finance made on budget day last year.</p>
          <p eId="para_933">Has the Minister made a sufficient case to the Minister for Finance, in the context of yesterday's Exchequer figures, regarding the various areas of the health services that are under-funded and in which there are severe and acute staffing shortages? In many areas, people have been accepting  the argument that economic circumstances are not as good as they once were. However, the Exchequer returns show this is not the case.</p>
          <p eId="para_934">Certain facilities have not been opened or established for want of small amounts of capital. Yesterday's Exchequer figures belie the fact that this should have been so. Similarly, the Minster, were he to make the political argument, could no doubt argue with the Minister for Finance that relatively small staff deficiencies could be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_935">My second point, which has not been sufficiently debated by the Dáil, is that, despite the evident cutback in both capital and current spending, the Minister for Finance chose in last year's budget to forge ahead in one particular area. In spite of his statement in the budget on the cutting back of tax breaks, new tax breaks were introduced at the very last minute for the construction of private hospitals. Therefore, tax based spending for the private sector in the health service has been initiated in spite of the failure to open public facilities, such as the new facility at Blanchardstown, and the failure to employ the staff the health service needs.</p>
          <p eId="para_936">The Minister for Health and Children needs to tell us what the tax breaks for private hospitals have added to the health service this year and whether they benefited private patients primarily or some public patients, perhaps through the treatment purchase fund. As recently as last Sunday, the front page of one Sunday paper referred to a €17 million scheme, in terms of tax costs, which is to get the go-ahead under the schemes announced in last year's budget. If the Minister has any notion of a health service for all people, he should realise that the creation of very lucrative tax breaks for the private sector while starving the public sector is absolutely wrong and unjustifiable.</p>

          <p eId="para_937">I do not know if the Minister ever saw the Fitzgerald report. It was introduced in 1968 and was the first document I received as a public representative. It recommended certain cutbacks pertaining to hospitals, including Mallow General Hospital, but they were not followed through because we fought them. The previous leader of the Deputy's party shelved that report, as another Deputy stated earlier. I hope the current proposals will be shelved and the sooner the Minister does so the better.</p>

          <from>Mr. Sherlock</from>
          <p eId="para_939">Absolutely. In light of the non-consultant hospital doctors issue, the Minister is introducing the report by Hanly and, I might as well say, Dr. Cillian Twomey from Cork. Mallow hospital, which was to be downgraded in 1968, is a general double consultant hospital and a valued facility in the local community and its catchment area. A total of 90% of patients requiring hospitalisation can be treated in the general hospital  system. The remaining 10% are referred for specialist treatment. The north Cork area is taking in many people from the west Limerick area.</p>

          <p eId="para_941">In Mallow, the figure pertaining to bed days in 2002 was 12,007 in the medical category and 10,761 in the surgical category, amounting to 22,768. A total of 2,284 patients falling under the medical category were treated, and 1,194 falling under the surgical category were treated, amounting to 4,278 in total. The average length of stay was 5.26 days in the medical category and 5.40 in the surgical category. The average is approximately 5.3 days, which represents an excellent service in a general hospital. The accident and emergency unit in Mallow general hospital provided for 10,705 patients, with returns of 1,704, amounting to 12,409 in total. This demonstrates the service provided by Mallow General Hospital. If the recommendation in the Hanly report to reduce this hospital to a local hospital is to carried out, like other hospitals in the same category it will become a half-way house for half-cured patients. This is exactly what the Minister is proposing to do. He should not do so because it would be wrong.</p>
          <p eId="para_942">Cork University Hospital benefited from a grant of €254 million under the national development plan but we did not get such a grant in Mallow. Week after week and year after year, we are fighting and striving to obtain additional funding.</p>
          <p eId="para_943">The Labour Party motion calls for a commitment to the provision and funding of 3,000 additional hospital beds, the doubling of hospital consultants to 3,600 and for all citizens to be able to gain access, within a reasonable time, to world-class accident and emergency facilities in their own areas.</p>
          <p eId="para_944">The Minister has made no reference to the two private hospitals in Cork. He is dealing with the hospitals under the Health Act and I know he will require a change of legislation if he wants to implement the recommendations in the Hanly report. I presume he will state this in his response.</p>
          <p eId="para_945">There is a better relationship between medical staff and patients in general hospitals compared to that in others. From a sociological point of view, the general hospital system is better in terms of facilitating visits to patients from relatives and friends. We are demanding and defending this system and the people will support us. Small is beautiful, unlike the major centres.</p>

          <from>Mr. O'Shea</from>
          <p eId="para_946">Tá áthas orm labhairt ar rún Pháirtí an Lucht Oibre. The Labour Party motion states Dáil Éireann believes that equality and ease of access to the highest possible quality of medical care should be a central feature of our hospital service. That is not the case when one considers the recent decision of the Minister and the Government to endorse the recommend ations of the report on the development of radiation oncology services.</p>
          <p eId="para_947">Yesterday, the Minister replied to a number of parliamentary questions I had tabled on cancer services. Eminent people in the cancer treatment area have stated it is not necessary to locate a second supra-regional centre for cancer care in Dublin, as one centre would cater for the needs of the city. My proposal to locate radiotherapy services in centres in Waterford, Limerick and the north-west, rather than establishing another supra-regional centre in Dublin, originated among eminent people in the field. It is all very well to speak of a model which will deliver the best possible outcomes but people are stuck in pain in traffic as they make long journeys to Dublin from other areas to receive palliative care or treatment to facilitate recovery. It is neither right nor acceptable in a civilised society that people should be exposed to pain and suffering at a time when they need the greatest possible degree of care, attention and support. The Minister must reconsider this issue and seriously examine the proposal to provide the required centres in Waterford, Limerick and the mid-west, rather than locate a second supra-regional centre in Dublin.</p>
          <p eId="para_948">It has been brought to my notice that we face a problem in the area of primary care. It is becoming increasingly difficult to attract doctors to work full-time in general practice. Regardless of the kind of hospital system one has, the first point of referral for most people is the general practitioner. I have been informed that a real crisis in general practice will occur in the next five to ten years. Regardless of how the hospital plan materialises, if it soon transpires that the referral system, the basis of the health system, is not delivering adequate provision, we will have a major problem. This matter needs to be addressed urgently.</p>
          <p eId="para_949">The Hanly report states there is scope for assistant grades. I have been tabling parliamentary questions concerning the speech and language therapy assistant grade for a long time. As the Minister is aware, we have a major problem in terms of the number of speech and language therapists. If an assistant grade was introduced, new recruits could be trained relatively quickly as compared to speech and language therapists. They could work under the supervision of a senior speech and language therapist, thus allowing those children and others such as post-stroke patients, who have had a poor service or no service for a considerable period, to obtain a service. While I welcome the fact that additional speech and language therapists will be trained, the dividend, even in terms of the first tranche of qualified therapists, will be in four years' time. The Minister has failed to deliver in terms of the assistant grade.</p>
          <p eId="para_950">Much of the Hanly report is pie in the sky, for which I do not criticise Mr. David Hanly. When he told us how he arrived at his conclusions, he stated, for instance, that he ignored IR problems.  The Minister has had no success in terms of the development of assistant grades and I find it difficult to believe this position will change in the future. There is considerable scope to transfer some lower grade functions from nurses to nursing assistants. While it goes without saying that the nurse will always be at the bedside, upgrading the profession will be an important component in delivering the kind of health service we all want to see.</p>

          <from>Mr. Wall</from>
          <p eId="para_951">In a letter to the Minister, dated 14 November 2001, the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, stated he wished to make clear that initiatives contained in the health strategy involving expenditure implications for 2002 were included without his approval and carried no commitment on his part to the allocation of any particular sums to the Department of Health and Children in the budget. Unfortunately, this statement still haunts the people of County Kildare. Three Deputies from the county, who have made numerous representations to the Minister for Health and Children with regard to making Naas General Hospital 100% efficient, are present for this debate. Each time we ask the Minister a question we receive a similar reply, namely, that our question has been sent to the chief executive of the Eastern Regional Health Authority for comment. He then sends it to the chief executive of the South-Western Area Health Board, Mr. Pat Donnelly, who unfortunately must send me an identical reply every time in which he states that the South-Western Area Health Board is not in a position to provide funding to bring Naas General Hospital up to 100% efficiency and that representations to the ERHA are ongoing. I am sure the same position obtains for Deputy Stagg and the other four Deputies from County Kildare.</p>
          <p eId="para_952">Unfortunately, despite millions of euro in Exchequer funding being spent on Naas General Hospital, its capacity has not been increased to the 100% required in a county with a growing population. The latest census will reflect the increasing number of people in the county and the other part of the region, west Wicklow. Time and again, the Department of Health and Children escapes under a cloud by referring questions to the ERHA. The Minister has been unsuccessful in his efforts to seek funding from the Minister for Finance.</p>
          <p eId="para_953">Having listened to David Hanly's assessment of his report, it appears Naas General Hospital will not become what we had anticipated, namely, an efficient accident and emergency department for the people of County Kildare and west Wicklow. Mr. Hanly stated that the South-Western Area Health Board had not yet been assessed but that any future evaluation would reflect his assessment of the Eastern Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board. If we take as an example Ennis General Hospital, where a major initiative in the accident and emergency department on behalf of the people of County Clare will  be abandoned, we can assume that the cost to the Exchequer of a major initiative on behalf of the people of County Kildare will be foregone.</p>
          <p eId="para_954">In my area, the assessment and respite unit of St. Vincent's Hospital in Athy has been closed. This was a major initiative by the South-Western Area Health Board which benefited families whose loved ones receive 24 hour care. It is a major loss to south Kildare, north Kildare and west Wicklow.</p>
          <p eId="para_955">The Minister has tabled an amendment to the motion. The sufferers are the 24 hour carers who have lost this facility. We were unsuccessful in obtaining a guarantee from the South-Western Area Health Board that the facility would be restored. Where will assessment and respite take place for patients in Naas General Hospital or any of the Dublin hospitals that cater for Kildare patients? There does not seem to be a policy to provide it.</p>
          <p eId="para_956">Having listened to Deputy Twomey, I wonder where the Hanly report will go. I was a shop steward for 22 years and I have many grey hairs to show for it. I can assure the Minister that he will have as many, if not more, before that report is implemented.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children (Mr. T. O'Malley)</from>
          <p eId="para_959">I welcome the opportunity to respond to a number of points made about the Hanly report. I will deal with them in turn.</p>
          <p eId="para_960">The suggestion was made last night that under the Hanly proposals there would be no full-scale accident and emergency services available between St. Vincent's Hospital in Dublin and Waterford Regional Hospital in Ardkeen. It is important to emphasise that the task force on medical staffing did not make proposals beyond the East Coast Area Health Board and the Mid-Western Health Board. It reached no conclusions about, for example, the role of Wexford General Hospital or Waterford Regional Hospital. The group chaired by David Hanly that will look at the organisation of acute hospital services for the rest of the country will take account of demographic and geographic factors when making recommendations about the role of individual hospitals and on the availability of accident and emergency services throughout the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_961">A question was raised about the studies cited in the Hanly report which conclude that better clinical outcomes are achieved in units with high volumes of activity and appropriate specialist staff. The claim has been made that these refer only to the over 65 age group. This is not correct. The Nuffield Institute study, for example, specifically covers the full age range. While the body of  the report points to three studies, the extensive bibliography in the report lists a large number of other such studies. They all reach the same basic conclusion about better outcomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_962">Some Deputies raised questions about whether it is feasible to double the existing number of consultant posts. This is not just possible but necessary. First, the Hanly report proposes that this should be done over a period of ten years. Second, there is no doubt that there are many specialist registrars already in the system, and others who will become specialist registrars over the next few years, who will be ready and eager to be appointed to consultant posts. There are also many consultants abroad who qualified in Ireland and who are extremely anxious to return. I have met them, as have many other Members of the House. That is mentioned in the Hanly report.</p>
          <p eId="para_963">When the Tierney report on medical staffing was published in 1993, there was the same scepticism and cynicism about our ability to recruit the extra consultants. The Tierney report recommended in 1993 that we should have 1,500 consultants by 2003. In fact, we had 1,731 consultants by 1 January this year—</p>

          <p eId="para_980">I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this motion. As the Labour Party's spokesperson on older people's issues, I wish to refer to the inadequacy of the services for older people.</p>
          <p eId="para_981">Older people have been severely affected by the cutbacks in the health services. Services have reached crisis point in many health boards. Older people made severe sacrifices over the years and in difficult times to care for their children and to provide them with the education which in many ways has been responsible for the Celtic tiger and made this country one of the richest in the world. What have they received in return? They are lying on trolleys, for up to 30 hours in some cases, in accident and emergency units awaiting access to a hospital ward. This is unacceptable when an increasing number of beds are left unoccupied or inappropriately occupied in the same hospitals. Similarly, they might have to wait for more than three years to secure a bed in a long-term nursing home while, at the same time, beds for the elderly remain unoccupied. This is a scandal.</p>
          <p eId="para_982">The key community care services for older people and their carers are home help services, respite and day care centres, meals and transport services and paramedical services such as occupational therapy, physiotherapy, chiropody and speech therapy. Home and community care must be a cornerstone in the care of older people and it has been denied to them by the Government. I read the Hanly report in detail and there is little or no reference in it to the community care area. It is reported that home help services have been reduced in some areas by up to 50%. Hundreds of people have been denied a minimal amount of care due to cutbacks.</p>
          <p eId="para_983">I can give an example of the numerous representations I have received on this issue. The person concerned wrote to me about her Aunt Kathleen, who is almost 88 years of age. The aunt  received a letter a week ago informing her that her home help hours have been reduced from eight to four hours per week. The woman has had several strokes but has managed to live independently and happily in her home since she was discharged from St. Mary's in the Phoenix Park with the promise of the support of all services. Like thousands of other elderly people, she has been dealt a huge blow by this decision. She has a wheelchair and a zimmer frame but must be assisted. She found her home help invaluable but the hours have been reduced dramatically. The Government is standing over this.</p>
          <p eId="para_984">It is a scandal that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who has responsibility for the elderly, should state to the media that the service providers on the ground are happy with their allocations. Older people are entitled to a little honesty from the Minister of State who is supposed to look after them but the health services provided by the Government are an utter disgrace. This is about making hard choices and putting the needs of ordinary people, including the elderly, above the Minister's friends. Some €5 billion or €6 billion has been spent on those who are well off, yet those most in need of care are being deprived of it. That is a scandal and nothing that I can see in the Hanly report will help. The situation will not improve until the Government is thrown out.</p>

          <from>Mr. Penrose</from>
          <p eId="para_986">For some time we have had a lot of spin, froth and fudge concerning the Hanly report. It is high time that not just this report but also the matters at issue were discussed at length in this House. I welcome some aspects of the report which deal in detail with the required EU reduction in working hours for junior hospital doctors but this should have happened many years ago. However, junior hospital doctors had to wait until the Government was dragged kicking and screaming into the 21st century. It has delayed action until virtually the last minute – just a few months before the EU working time directive is enforced – to provide young doctors with civilised working hours.</p>
          <p eId="para_987">I also welcome the decision to move to a consultant-provided health service. The Hanly report quantifies the implications of the decision to provide 1,870 new consultant posts throughout the health service, which will represent a considerable improvement on the current position. In our two-tier health service most public patients rarely get to see a consultant, while private patients can have access to one whenever they want by paying the appropriate fee. With a large number of new consultants in the health service, the prospects for public patients getting access would be enhanced but I take the number of additional consultants, as projected by the report, with a grain of salt.</p>
          <p eId="para_988">There is more than a touch of cloud cuckoo land about the Hanly report. The terms of reference of the study team required that they assess the financial implications of their recommend ations. The financial projections they make with reference to the 1,870 consultants exclude substantial cost elements. One does not have to be an accountant to conclude that the financial projections are not for real, although that will not trouble the Minister for Finance who will almost certainly dismiss them as meaningless and irrelevant. His mandarins, likewise, will cast a beady eye on them. The Minister for Health and Children knows the cut of the Minister for Finance's cloth.</p>
          <p eId="para_989">I welcome some aspects of the Hanly report into which much work has been put but, from my perspective in representing the people of County Westmeath, it has some fatal flaws. I am concerned about two vital aspects. The Hanly team claims to have consulted far and wide at both national and local level about the matters dealt with in the report. However, when one looks at the detail, where the devil tends to reside, one finds that it did not consult public representatives, nor their constituents. Neither did it consult those who will be most affected by any decisions taken arising from the report. This is notwithstanding the Government's aspiration to develop "a health system that listens to you and ensures that your views are taken into account", according to page 8 of the Minister's health strategy report.</p>
          <p eId="para_990">The Hanly team consulted the medical establishment and is proposing a health service that listens to hospital consultants and sets up a hospital structure that accords with their views. It is adopting the "doctor knows best" principle, rather than listening to ordinary people and taking their views into account. This strategy fundamentally underpins the report. The Hanly team claims that it confined its consultation to medical professionals and health board staff – I agree that staff at all levels should be consulted – in order that it would not be tainted by political involvement. It is high time, however, that the report was subjected to the closest political scrutiny in order that people in County Westmeath and other constituencies, the recipients of health services, will have a voice in deciding how they should be developed.</p>
          <p eId="para_991">My second concern about the Hanly report relates to its commitment to the principle that bigger hospitals are better. The report's authors have dressed this up by talking about the concept of a few centres of excellence where most treatment options and specialists will be concentrated. Hospitals outside these centres, however, will provide some elective procedures, principally on a day care basis. The medical establishment has for years been pushing the line that bigger hospitals achieve better outcomes for patients and this nonsense is becoming increasingly the accepted wisdom. I seriously question this on the Hanly report's own terms.</p>
          <p eId="para_992">Perhaps I am old fashioned but I like to have some evidence to justify my proposed actions. The Hanly report invokes three publications to  justify its proposition that bigger hospitals in key treatment centres of excellence are virtually the only way forward but the its authors cannot have read the publications in question. At least two could more plausibly be cited in justification of the contrary argument, that is, the development of medium-sized hospitals with 200 to 300 beds, regionally dispersed, to meet the requirements of our future health service. I have a clear interest in this matter and will lay my cards face up on the table. If the Minister or the health boards want to truncate the services currently available to people in County Westmeath – I am referring to the hospitals in Mullingar and Athlone – they should have a better justification than what the Hanly report has come up with for so doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_993">Let us equip what we already have. It is a scandal that we have been waiting seven years for an extension to Mullingar Hospital, while the site has been lying idle. The disgraceful long-fingering of phase 2B of Longford-Westmeath General Hospital is a matter the Committee of Public Accounts should be called upon to examine. The message to the Minister is loud and clear: he should finish the work at Longford-Westmeath General Hospital for the 110,000 residents of the area. The hospital extension should be staffed, equipped and opened quickly to ensure the people of counties Longford and Westmeath get what they deserve.</p>

          <p eId="para_995">I thank every Deputy who participated in the debate. Naturally, the Hanly report has figured large and it contains much that is good. Let us remember, however, that they are only words on pages. The question is, what does the Government intend to do about it? Does it intend to apply the report's cost-cutting elements, while holding back on the positive agenda? It is not an issue of the Labour Party cherrypicking. What is of concern to the public is whether the Government will cherrypick by leaving aside aspects of the report that will cost money. Its track record on other reports is abysmal.</p>
          <p eId="para_996">I ask Members to consider the following:</p>
          <p eId="para_997">I think the Minister for Health and Children should reconsider his position. Maybe it is time for him to move over and let somebody else take over who can do the job.</p>
          <p eId="para_998">They are not my words but of the eminent cardiac surgeon, Mr. Maurice Neligan. Yesterday's performance by the Minister only confirms that view. I do not know if it is true but I have heard that when he was at school, the Minister was known as "Ducky Martin". If that is the case, he has certainly lived up to his nickname.</p>

          <from>Ms McManus</from>
          <p eId="para_1003">From where is the funding coming? How much money will the Minister put in to implement the report? How many consultants will be in place by August 2004? Will the Minister guarantee that we will not end up with no accident and emergency department in the eastern regional area between St. Vincent's Hospital and Waterford? These are plain questions that elicited no answers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1004">Senator O'Meara has visited Nenagh Hospital, one of the hospitals under threat of being downgraded. Yesterday morning the hospital found itself inundated with admissions. As a result, both the female and male medical wards were full to overflowing. There were patients in beds on both corridors. The Senator saw one man getting oxygen in a bed in a corridor. Not all of the patients were elderly but they were all in need of acute care. Officially, there are 86 acute beds in the hospital but up to 100 patients are being treated there almost all of the time. If, as recommended, these beds are closed and the accident and emergency department is closed, all such patients will have to travel to Limerick Regional Hospital. How will that hospital cope because it is already overstretched? There is no commitment in real terms to ensure bed capacity, consultants and training will be in place in order that the benefits of the the report can be realised for patients.</p>
          <p eId="para_1005">Our motion asks the Government to ensure the  changes are funded and that provision is made for them but it is refusing to support it. We ask for a principled commitment that, regardless of where one lives, one can access world class accident and emergency services within a reasonable distance. The Government has again refused to support this principle. Instead, it has presented its own anodyne amendment which amounts to a warning. It is asking us to welcome the Hanly report but is that all it has to say? What about saying it will implement or pay for the report? It did not say anything like that; it only welcomed it. The reason that is happening is that it is divided. The Minister evades the hard questions while the Minister for Finance says nothing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1006">I challenge the Taoiseach to start telling us about the future of the health service. It is a remarkable achievement to have spent so much money for so little return. Every time there is a debate on health the Minister comes in and trumpets the amount of money he has spent. He should hang his head in shame. While he has spent the money, he has not got the return. There has been a 2% reduction in hospital waiting lists. Thousands are waiting in pain for treatment which they know those with private health insurance can access as soon as they require it. However, a public patient must wait months or even years for the treatment needed. Until the Government faces this harsh reality and starts to make decisions focused on the experience of patients and what is happening in our hospitals and the health service instead of abstract notions which only relate to an ideal world where there are no industrial relations or funding issues, we will not get the Government response which patients deserve and to which they are entitled.</p>

        <heading>Adjournment Debate. - Coastal Erosion.</heading>
        <speech by="#DavidStanton" eId="spk_531">
          <from>Mr. Stanton</from>
          <p eId="para_1013">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment, on which I have raised it previously. I have also raised it nine or ten times by way of parliamentary questions. I welcome the Minister of State.</p>
          <p eId="para_1014">Four major reports have been carried out on coastal erosion in east Cork, most recently in 2001. A report carried out in 2000 cost more than €26,000. All of the reports indicate the need for urgent action as the problem in east Cork is very serious. In 1999 I was told it would cost about £5 million to resolve the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1015">Youghal is a tourist town with a fantastic beach which I encourage the Minister to walk if he is ever in the area. It is a great amenity, not only for local people but the whole country. At the beginning of the last century groynes were placed at right angles to the beach to prevent coastal erosion. They have been eroded to the point where they are more or less gone – in fact, they are a danger because all that is left is spikes sticking out of the sand. It is important that they are replaced because the beach is disappearing; it is being eroded into the harbour.</p>
          <p eId="para_1016">Ballyvergan bog, close by, is an important wildlife sanctuary which is also under threat, as is an amount of farmland in the low-lying area around  Gortroe and Ballymacoda. I have visited some of these areas and seen at first hand the devastation caused by the sea within a very short time. This week a young lad who was visiting Leinster House told me that his father's farm was being eroded and in danger of being submerged under sea water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1017">A lot of land is at risk in east Cork. It is surprising that no compensation or grants scheme is available to assist landowners in protecting their land against coastal erosion. This is something the Minister should consider. It seems unfair to put landowners in that position.</p>
          <p eId="para_1018">Cork County Council has made this matter a priority and I ask the Minister to investigate it again. The reports are in his Department. In the light of the upcoming Estimates and the budget, will he see what he can do to make resources available to address this urgent problem? Like our colleagues in the west, it will be too late when the sea encroaches. In Gortroe, a farmer spent a considerable amount, running to tens of thousands of euro, to rescue his land from the sea when the sea breached the coastal defences. The problem is that serious.</p>
          <p eId="para_1019">At this stage State intervention is needed. If the State does not intervene and follow on the work the Victorians carried out, which has now been destroyed by time and the elements, I fear a good deal of land in east Cork will be lost. Roads will be submerged and people isolated on islands. Now is the time to act. I look forward to the Minister's response and ask him to personally consider this matter as soon as he can because I do not raise it lightly. I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1020">Minister of State at the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs (Mr. N. Ahern): I would like to respond to the matter raised by the Deputy on behalf of the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern.</p>
          <p eId="para_1021">Coastal erosion is a natural process at locations around the coastline. Of the 5,800 kilometres of coastline in the Republic, some 3,000 are comprised of what might be called "soft coastline" consisting of sandy beaches, sand dunes and clay cliffs. Erosion rates around the coast range from zero at many stable locations to a maximum of approximately one to two metres per annum in some areas, particularly on the east coast. In general, erosion of a coastline takes place gradually but in some cases an individual storm or a cliff collapse can lead to sudden and often spectacular changes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1022">The types of land and property under threat from coastal erosion are as diverse as the locations in which the problem is occurring. Areas under threat include private land, land of marginal agricultural value, public infrastructure, areas of geological importance and natural heritage areas. The rate of  coastal erosion can also be affected by economic and amenity activities and usages in the coastal zone. For example, pressure on beaches and dune systems through large numbers of visitors can accelerate the process of erosion.</p>
          <p eId="para_1023">Primary responsibility for coastal protection rests with the property owner, be it a private individual or local authority. Last year the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources wrote to all coastal local authorities requesting proposals for consideration in the 2003-06 period. Cork County Council responded by submitting 23 proposals for consideration. Youghal Town Council also submitted a proposal for a coastal protection scheme. The county council did not submit any proposals in respect of Gortroe or Ballymacoda.</p>
          <p eId="para_1024">This year €1.072 million of Exchequer funding was provided for coastal local authorities for coastal protection works. Local authorities must provide 25% of the total cost of the works. Coastal protection works are, by their nature, costly undertakings. Accordingly, the selection of projects must be based on a clear cost benefit justification. The priority is to safeguard human life and protect public property, including roads and other public infrastructures and amenities. I note the Deputy's comment that a road might be at risk. The Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has no funding available for the protection of privately owned property. The proposals received from local authorities are carefully examined by officials of the Department in accordance with priority criteria, namely, to protect public safety, public property or any form of infrastructure; to protect areas of socio-economic, tourism or recreational importance – I note the Deputy's offer to walk the beach, although I do not know whether it falls under this category; to support the economic development or increase the economic potential of coastal regions, which probably covers a multitude; to provide essential protection for areas or features of environmental or heritage significance; and avert the need for costly remedial works at a later stage, provided it is not "soft" farmland.</p>
          <p eId="para_1025">The proposal from Youghal Town Council is for a significant multi-annual project, estimated to cost between €5 million and €6 million. Phase 1 of the project involves strengthening the existing sea wall and the construction of a 250 metre long groyne. Phase 2 involves the construction of three further 250 metre long groynes in a staged fashion. Phase 3 involves the consideration of the use of beach nourishment at a later stage when the effects of the groynes become apparent. In 2001 the town council received funding support from the Department towards the preparation of tender and planning documents for the project. I am not in a position to comment on the position at Gortroe or Ballymacoda as the Department  has not received any proposals from Cork County Council in respect of these locations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1026">As previously stated, the Exchequer provision this year is just over €1.072 million and it was not possible to allocate funding in respect of the Youghal proposal. However, €120,000 was provided for Cork County Council to facilitate the provision of beach groynes at Warren Strand, Rosscarberry. The question of providing Exchequer funding towards coastal protection works in County Cork in the following years will depend upon Exchequer funding. While I note the Deputy's comments and will pass them on to the Minister, perhaps he could do something at local level to get the county council to push the case for the two other areas mentioned.</p>

        <heading>Traffic Management.</heading>
        <speech by="#PatRabbitte" eId="spk_532">
          <from>Mr. Rabbitte</from>
          <p eId="para_1027">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for enabling me to raise the issue of the traffic nightmare at the busiest interchange in Ireland at the Red Cow roundabout. If the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, was present – I had hoped he would, with no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher – he would understand the provision of a bridge over the Naas Road from Monastery Road to the new Luas park and ride facility at the Red Cow roundabout was part of the solution to the bigger traffic crisis at the roundabout which requires proper grade separation.</p>
          <p eId="para_1028">It is all the more puzzling that the Minister effectively announced the cancellation of the bridge during the summer period. Even more puzzling was his announcement that Luas at that point was "a mess" and had to be put on stilts. I believe he has since been persuaded of his error and hope he now accepts that the problem at the Red Cow roundabout is a traffic, not a Luas one, and that when it is operational, it is likely to aggravate the congestion but to what extent, nobody knows for certain. The point is that no further aggravation for long suffering motorists is tolerable, given the disruption they have endured for years, only to have those in authority recognise now, at the 11th hour, that building works must start all over again to tackle the deficiencies at this interchange which have been evident for years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1029">I want to use my time constructively to persuade the Minister that a further major contract at the Red Cow roundabout is unthinkable without the over-bridge from Monastery Road first being in place. I further argue that this over-bridge is an integral part of the wider Luas project and in planning terms should be seen in that context. According to my advice, it could be functional in nine months. I repeat that it is unthinkable that Luas should commence operations if, in order to access the train, drivers will be forced  around the roundabout to get to the park and ride facility and somehow expected to cross three lanes of traffic to egress from the facility to Clondalkin at the end of their day's work.</p>
          <p eId="para_1030">I do not wish to labour the point about the mistakes made at what is the busiest interchange in Ireland. However, traffic-train interaction is unworkable without remedial action because motorists will be unable to live with the worsening situation. I ask the Minister to authorise construction of the bridge and require tenders – assuming it has to go to tender – without further delay and indicate a ballpark cost. I raise this point because expert advice assures me that estimates given to the Minister which caused him to cancel the project last summer were entirely and grossly inflated. I would like to engage the Minister at another time on the wider Red Cow roundabout-M50 crisis but tonight I want to stress that without an over-bridge to take the huge and rising traffic volumes from Clondalkin the busiest interchange in Ireland will become unmanageable when Luas is commissioned.</p>
          <p eId="para_1031">The Minister is exceptionally busy on the public relations front today and every day but is finding it exceptionally difficult to implement sensible decisions. The crisis of traffic volumes combined with defective planning and design on the M50 seems too big for him. This is one small decision – I am advised the cost would be somewhere between €10 million and €13 million – which, if implemented, would help to tackle the crisis. Without it, the system will grind to a halt. The Minister must not compound the errors of his predecessors. There is no avoiding the making of major decisions on the defective interchanges on the M50, the worst being at the Red Cow roundabout after which the issue of the M50 will need to be revisited.</p>
          <p eId="para_1032">Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (Mr. Gallagher): I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Transport and the Minister of State, both of whom have another appointment. No disrespect is intended to Deputy Rabbitte, in particular, and the House that neither of them is present.</p>
          <p eId="para_1033">The planning, design and implementation of individual national roads projects is a matter for the National Roads Authority in co-operation with the relevant local authority. I understand from the National Roads Authority that, with the assistance of its consultants, it is developing proposals to achieve major improvements in the key traffic movements on the M50, including at the N7 Red Cow interchange. The key concern is to ensure the problems at the Red Cow roundabout are resolved to the satisfaction of road users and Luas customers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1034">I understand it is envisaged that these proposals will cater for free flow traffic movements,  including south bound traffic on the M50 wishing to travel towards Naas, and will seek to significantly reduce conflicting traffic movements which are a major constraint at the Red Cow interchange. I also understand the NRA and the Railway Procurement Agency are examining how best to cater for traffic entering and exiting from the Luas park and ride facility close to the Red Cow roundabout. This may involve the provision of a grade separated junction arrangement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1035">The very significant Exchequer allocation to the Department for 2003 in respect of the development of transport infrastructure and services clearly demonstrates the Government's strong ongoing commitment to the upgrading of our transport system and infrastructure generally. Good progress has been made in the implementation of the national roads upgrade programme provided for in the national development plan. Over the period 2000-03 Exchequer investment will total approximately €3.8 billion. A total of 37 projects totalling 269 kilometres, including 76 kilometres of motorway and 50 kilometres of dual carriageway standard, will be completed by next year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1036">I have taken on board the points made by the Deputy about the serious traffic problem being encountered. He can rest assured that I will relate them directly to the Minister at the first opportunity.</p>

        <speech by="#JoeCallananFF" eId="spk_533">
          <from>Mr. Callanan</from>
          <p eId="para_1037">The people of Derrybrien in south Galway are worried due to the environmental disaster that has taken place as a result of the recent landslide. Roads are blocked, the local river is polluted with all fish life extinguished, while lands are destroyed. Lough Cutra is also affected. This evening water supplies for the town of Gort have turned brown and Galway County Council is monitoring the quality of drinking water.</p>
          <p eId="para_1038">Although it has not yet been proved, local people indicate that quarrying and boring at Hibernian wind farm during the construction of bases for 75 turbines may have caused the wet bog to run off the mountain causing the landslide. There are questions to be answered. Why did An Bord Pleanála grant planning permission for the project which had been turned down by Galway County Council? Were sufficient structural surveys undertaken on the mountain? Did the company have planning permission for the quarry? It is time Hibernian wind farm acted responsibly and got its consultants, ESB International, to work with Galway County Council to ensure the landslide is halted as there is evidence that much more material will run and cause untold damage to the people of Derrybrien. In the interests of the wind farm industry, Hibernian wind farm  should decide to cease work completely on the mountain for good.</p>
          <p eId="para_1039">I call on the Government to make emergency funds available to Galway County Council which is doing a great job under its director of services, Mr. Eugene Cummins, to make the area safe. The project has gone terribly wrong and the people of Derrybrien must be protected. No further turbines should be constructed. The community is worried and needs our help. It does not deserve this.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulConnaughton" eId="spk_534">
          <from>Mr. Connaughton</from>
          <p eId="para_1040">I thank the Ceann Comhairle for giving me the opportunity to raise this matter with my colleagues. With no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Gallagher, I had expected to see a senior Minister present, as had the people of Derrybrien, although the man sitting before us may be better than many of those who are not here.</p>
          <p eId="para_1041">I took away an image from a packed public meeting in Derrybrien, County Galway, last Monday night of a small community under siege which did not know to whom it should turn or on whom it should depend. Make no mistake about it, the landslide was dangerous and frightening and put the community in a quandary in terms of how it should move forward. It also has ramifications for future wind energy policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1042">There was a great deal of anger and recrimination at the meeting which was well structured and excellently run. All stakeholders attended and put their side of the story as best they could but the people of Derrybrien want answers to many questions. They do not want a return to work by Hibernian wind farm until there is an independent assessment of the reasons the landslide happened but, more importantly, they want somebody to quantify the possibility of whether landslides will happen in the future. The community is certain that interference by the company at the top of the mountain when laying the foundations contributed to the landslide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1043">The company has important questions to answer. Did it breach planning regulations by building bigger windmills than those for which it had received planning permission? Did the planning permission cover quarrying for stone which necessitated blasting? What assessment was carried out on the blanket bog before work started – as one man put it so well last Monday night – to put 71 huge windmills in a mushy, wet and boggy place? What will happen to water quality in Lough Cutra which is already showing signs of pollution? What will be the long-term problems in supplying Gort town with a new water scheme from the lough? Who will pay for the clean up? Will farmers whose lands have been ruined receive adequate compensation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1044">The long-term future of the site is clearly centre stage. Can an independent body with access to all records and the best possible data, using the  best possible professional advice available, make the type of assessment required which will quantify the possibility of whether landslides will happen in the future? Great work is being done by Galway County Council. The traps the company is putting in place seem to have a certain use but I remain unconvinced that if another large landslide begins to meander down the side of the slope, given its contents, any trap will be able to hold it. Until that time comes I ask Hibernian Wind Power not to work on the hill until everyone is reassured that no landslide will occur.</p>

          <p eId="para_1046">The landslides, or peat slides, have caused devastation to the Derrybrien area and great anxiety to the people living there. I visited the area of the landslides on the first weekend they occurred. On that occasion the slides, while disturbing and alarming, were nothing compared with what occurred subsequently. It is regrettable that more preventive measures were not taken in the initial period after the first slide when the situation was relatively stable. The fact that this lapse occurred is an indictment of everybody involved. Complacency set in and there was, perhaps, even an attempt by some to play down the significance of the slide. If proper action had been taken at the time, the subsequent slides would not have occurred or, at least, the resultant damage of the subsequent slides would have been greatly minimised.</p>
          <p eId="para_1047">There is a message for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and he cannot wash his hands of the matter. There are lessons to be learned which can be applied to any area of the country. I am extremely disappointed with the responses I have received from the Minister. His response has been that he will "remain in touch". Remaining in touch is not a good enough approach when there are numerous issues and unanswered questions arising from this disaster.</p>
          <p eId="para_1048">There are planning issues. What level of consulation did An Bord Pleanála give to the wind farm application? Were proper studies done and proper reports sought? Why, for instance, did the concern that led to the refusal of the gas terminal building in County Mayo not give rise to a concern here? The reason for refusal in County Mayo was that An Bord Pleanála was not satisfied that the peat could be stockpiled safely. Why the apparent discrepency in standards? The Minister needs to supply the answers because An Bord Pleanála will not.</p>
          <p eId="para_1049">The whole area of compliance with planning regulations and the issue of the possibility of unauthorised development taking place need to be examined. Has the Minister asked Galway  County Council to examine the issue? If not, will he do so?</p>
          <p eId="para_1050">An issue arises in relation to work practices on the site. Has the Health and Safety Authority carried out a thorough investigation of work practices engaged in by the wind farm company? I understand officials of the authority were on the site but what was the outcome of its investigations? What was the extent of the investigations? I know this does not come under the remit of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government but I ask him to engage with his colleagues to establish the level of scrutiny engaged in by the authority.</p>
          <p eId="para_1051">There is an issue in relation to the continuation or intensification of works on the site. Is it safe to continue the works or would a continuation lead to further destabilisation of the peat and further devastation?</p>
          <p eId="para_1052">There is an issue in relation to liability for the current situation. Questions are being asked. I know it is too early to arrive at a definitive answer but when that time arrives, will the Minister give an undertaking that the Government will ensure that, from whatever source it comes, adequate compensation will be paid to rectify the damage to property, roads, bridges and water courses? Will adequate compensation be paid to restock the river to replace the dead fish? Will resources be made available to rectify the damage caused to Lough Cutra, the water supply for Gort and surrounding areas? I urge the Minister to take a personal interest in this matter. If further movement occurs and the drinking water supply for the town of Gort becomes polluted, all hell will break loose.</p>
          <p eId="para_1053">The efforts of Galway County Council in relation to this problem have been heroic but its resources are limited and it needs help. All efforts need to be co-ordinated. This should be done by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PatTheCope" eId="spk_536">
          <from>Mr. Gallagher</from>
          <p eId="para_1054">I thank Deputies Callanan, Connaughton and McHugh for raising this important issue and express the sympathy of the Government to everyone affected by the recent landlslides in County Galway. This has been a traumatic time for everyone involved.</p>
          <p eId="para_1055">I will outline to the House the position on the landslides as has been communicated to my Department from Galway County Council. A landslide occurred in the townland of Derrybrien north, County Galway, in the Slieve Aughty Mountains at a location approximately 17 km east of the town of Gort. The slippage commenced on the afternoon of Thursday, 16 October on a site being developed as a wind farm by Hibernian Wind Power, a subsidiary of ESB International. Galway County Council was notified of the slippage by an engineer from ESB International. The Minister, Deputy Cullen and I were both notified  of the situation by our colleague, Deputy Treacy, who together with my party colleague, Deputy Callanan, has been in constant touch with my Department regarding this serious issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1056">Galway County Council's senior executive engineer for the area went to the site that evening and arranged to have the local road, 8211, closed to the public. Council staff also erected a barrier to halt the progress of the slide and took some measures to filter silt from the waters coming from the slippage material. The situation was constantly monitored by the county council and on Saturday, 18 October an examination from the air and ground was carried out by senior engineering personnel from the county council. An environmental monitoring regime with respect to waters downstream of the landslip has been in place since 18 October.</p>
          <p eId="para_1057">Following an initial preliminary assessment of the area by geotechnical experts from NUI Galway, the county council appointed BMA GeoServices, a firm of experienced consultants with geotechnical expertise, to carry out a comprehensive investigation of the landslip events, the draining of the wind farm site and its effects on slope stability and the effect of rainfall stability. The firm commenced work on the site on 25 October and provided its preliminary report for the county council on 3 November.</p>
          <p eId="para_1058">The county council also met ESB International and Hibernian Wind Power on 28 October. The company representatives undertook to carry out all remediation works and accept responsibility for them. They accepted and undertook to co-operate with the county council's regulatory and monitoring role. They informed the county council of a proposed action plan, the outlines of which include: a geotechnical survey of the complete site; establishment of monitoring points measuring the thickness of peat; re-establishing all pre-existing drainage paths; proposals for remediation works which, in the first instance, addressed the existing landslides; cessation of all construction works on the wind farm – these will not resume until the stability of the area can be assured while the Health and Safety Authority has been informed of the situation; and the developers to carry out a review of their construction methodology and complete it before any further works might take place in connection with the development of the wind farm. An official of my Department also met ESB International and Hibernian Wind Power on 31 October, at their request, to receive a briefing from the companies on the situation and the steps they were taking to control the landslide.</p>
          <p eId="para_1059">The landslide now extends for a distance of approximately 3.2 km, having crossed the local road, 8211, and passed under a bridge known as Flaggy Bridge, on the Regional road, R353, from Gort to Portumna. No inhabited dwellings have been affected by the landslide but one unoccu pied house is surrounded by peat and an outhouse associated with that dwelling, has been demolished. Some damage has been caused to parapet walls at Flaggy Bridge, on the R353.</p>
          <p eId="para_1060">Galway County Council continues to monitor and respond to the landslide in co-operation with all local interests. The slide has been halted and it is hoped to reopen the R353 which has been closed since 30 October. Measures such as the creation of silt ponds are being taken to minimise potential pollution to Lough Cutra.</p>
          <p eId="para_1061">As indicated to the House in replies to Questions Nos. 673, 674 and 711 yesterday, my Department will maintain liaison with and support, as appropriate, the efforts of Galway County Council in dealing with the causes and effects of the landslide at Derrybrien. My Department will also remain in touch with Galway County Council in regard to any necessary works to reinstate public roads or bridges in the area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1062">Regarding the effect on public water supplies, I understand that the extraction point for the Gort water supply scheme is located more than 6 km downstream on Lough Cutra on the Ceannahowna River. The supply from the river is supplemented by boreholes located in the town itself, which are unaffected by recent events. Galway County Council is reasonably confident that because of the distance involved and the fact that the river goes underground for some time after leaving Lough Cutra, the Gort water supply should not be adversely affected. In the event that water quality in the river is affected, the council has contingency plans which would involve cutting off the river intake, maximising supply from the boreholes – which provide about 30% of the town's current needs – and tankering in water to deal with any shortages. The council will also consider tankering water to households closer to the scene of the landslide if the need arises. The council is monitoring the position on the ground and is ready to put the water supply contingency plans into operation immediately, should it become necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_1063">In addition to public water supply sampling, regular monitoring samples have been taken by the council along the stretch of the affected waterway and further downstream as appropriate. The Shannon Regional Fisheries Board has also undertaken a wide sampling programme and taken preventative action where possible. It will conduct a full assessment of the river in order to ascertain the full scale of the fish kills. The river habitat is expected to take some time to recover. However, a habitat rehabilitation programme can be put together locally and ESB International has indicated it will assist with the resources required for this, as well as any expansion of the water monitoring programme, required by Galway County Council.</p>
          <p eId="para_1064">The council reports that no homes have as yet been affected by the landslide. However, it has  contingency plans in place should things change and my Department would refund to the council 90% of the costs of alternative accommodation in such circumstances.</p>
          <p eId="para_1065">I am satisfied that the efforts of the council and all relevant State agencies, as well as the action plan of ESB-Hibernian Wind Power, should provide strong reassurance to the local community that its immediate concerns are being addressed  to the greatest possible extent. The outcome of investigations and reviews will inform the rehabilitation of the environment in the area and its future protection. Of course we will keep the House informed in this regard. I pay tribute to Galway County Council for the trojan work it is doing.</p>
          <p eId="para_1066">The Dáil adjourned at 9.25 p.m. until 10.30 a.m. on Thursday, 6 November 2003.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1073">The reported animal disease problems in the Askeaton area were the subject of a comprehensive multi-agency, multi-million euro investigation under the auspices of the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, that was conducted over a number of years.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_72">The report of this investigation which was published in August 2001 concluded,inter alia, that environmental pollution, toxic substances in the diet, soil composition anomalies and herbage composition anomalies are unlikely causes of animal health problems on the main farms investigated; the reason for the animal health problems on these farms could not be specifically identified both because of the retrospective nature of the investigations and the limited involvement of specialist veterinary pathology services during the period the problems were at their worst i.e. from 1988 to 1993. However, many of the problems reported were of a type commonly seen on farms  elsewhere and there is evidence from the available historical information of the involvement of on-farm infectious, nutritional and management factors; while there was undoubtedly an unusually high incidence of animal disease on a small number of farms in the Askeaton area in addition to the main farms, neither the number of farms involved nor their geographical spread suggests this provides evidence of a phenomenon affecting the wider Askeaton area as a whole; and, given the animal health study findings, there is little cause for concern that the problems in the Askeaton area posed a threat to human health.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_73">In the view of the Department there is no evidence to suggest there has been a deterioration in the general animal health situation in the area since the investigation concluded. On that basis I do not believe that there are currently grounds which would justify embarking on any further animal health investigation in the area or the further commitment of significant human and financial resources which this would imply. Where individual problems occur, as they do on farms throughout the country, the veterinary laboratory service of my Department is available to support local veterinary practitioners and their clients and this will remain the case. With regard to Askeaton, the regional veterinary office provides services free of charge where the PVP deems tests to be necessary.</summary>

        </question>
        <speech by="#JoeWalsh" as="#Minister_for_Agriculture_and_Food" eId="spk_539">
          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1075">I am aware that a number of sheep flocks in Ireland have been infected with caseous lymphadenitis or CLA. CLA is a bacterial disease of sheep and goats that can cause economic losses in the form of poor weight gain, lower wool yield, reproductive inefficiency, devaluation of hides and condemnation of carcasses at slaughter. It is not possible to be definitive about the origin of the disease in Ireland, although a number of cases in recent years can be linked to imports of breeding stock. It is equally difficult to be certain about the number of cases because there is no readily available test which would facilitate screening for the disease. However, there are grounds for believing that there is substantial under reporting of the disease and the available evidence suggests that the disease is common in many flocks.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_74">In Ireland this disease is categorised as a class A disease under the Diseases of Animals Act 1966 and it is compulsorily notifiable. Until recently affected flocks were restricted, with sales for slaughter permitted, but sales for breeding and fattening prohibited. However, the disease is not categorised as a class A disease under current  OIE rules and is not regarded as being of human health concern.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_75">Against this background I recently announced that in future, flocks in which CLA has been confirmed would not be restricted other than in exceptional cases where this was considered necessary. However, the disease will retain its class A status in Ireland, and will remain compulsorily notifiable. This will facilitate an ongoing evaluation of case numbers and allow my Department to take action in exceptional cases where this is considered necessary.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_76">In addition, in July of this year, my Department issued an advice note to every flock owner in the country to assist them in identifying the clinical signs of the disease, in understanding how it is spread, in protecting their flocks, in reducing the risk of the disease spreading and in dealing with suspect cases. In this context the primary responsibility for tackling this disease, and the most effective means of doing so, rests with the sheep sector itself. I urge farming bodies, breed societies and flock owners themselves encouraging greater effort in this area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_77">With regard to the question of compensation, my Department does not have a compensation scheme for affected flock owners. However, in the past, and in the context of a regime which prohibited the sale of breeding stock from affected flocks, my Department from time to time madeex gratia payments in respect of the depopulation of sheep to pedigree flock owners whose primary business was effectively prevented by such a restriction.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_78">The question of providing such compensation future cases does not arise. However, my Department is considering the question of makingex gratia payments to a small number of farmers whose flocks were restricted under the previous regime. I expect this matter will be finalised and offers made to these farmers in the near future.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_79">With regard to the role of women in agriculture, I established an advisory committee, which reported in September 2000. The advisory committee's report contained 36 recommendations in total, covering a broad range of policy and operational areas, relating to 19 Departments  and agencies. These areas were statistical evaluation of women farmers; employment and training; information technology; social inclusion; representation; and personal finance-legal issues. While recognising the contribution of women to Irish agriculture, it is clear from an analysis of the recommendations that the report's central concerns related to issues affecting women in rural communities generally.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_80">The establishment of a national rural development forum, which meets in open session twice a year, provides a forum for continued attention to many of the issues raised in the advisory committee's report. It should also be noted that, subsequent to the publication of the report, the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was established. In addition, elements of the report were incorporated into the National Plan for Women, published in 2002 by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Action was taken, in as far as practicable, on the recommendations in the advisory committee's report and my Department is currently preparing a report on progress across all the recommendations.</summary>

My Department has expressed its general reservations on these aspects in the discussions.

          <p eId="para_1084">I propose to take Questions Nos. 124 and 140 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1085">It is my policy and that of the Government to ensure Irish livestock or beef exporters have unrestricted access to world markets. An agreement signed with Libya in June 2000 provided that Ireland would be officially listed as a source country for all Libyan tenders for the supply of live cattle. Since then, however, the Libyan Foreign Minister indicated that it had not been possible to import live cattle because of what he called logistical problems and that Libya would buy beef directly. Libya subsequently issued tenders for the supply of beef and Ireland was included in the list of countries invited to tender. I understand a number of Irish companies submitted bids at that time. Efforts at diplomatic and technical level are continuing to ensure that the agreement signed with Libya is fully implemented in so far as it relates to cattle exports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1086">With regard to live cattle exports to Egypt the position is that proposals for a trial shipment of live cattle were submitted to the Egyptian authorities in 1997 but these proposals were not implemented. The lack of a market for live cattle exports to Egypt had been, however, more than offset by the volume of trade in beef exports to that country in the period up to 2001. The Egyptian market was re-opened to imports of Irish beef in late 2001 following an intensive political, technical and diplomatic campaign. Resumption of trade in commercial volumes had been hampered by conditions imposed by the Egyptian authorities on the type of cuts eligible for that market. Agreement was reached with the Egyptian authorities last September on the removal of these conditions and on new certification arrangements which now open the way for a resumption in trade. There is evidence of strong demand for Irish beef in the Egyptian market and with the recently negotiated 30% increase in EU export subsidies, it is open to Irish exporters to avail of the outlet and regain a position in this important market.</p>

          <p eId="para_1088">It is a matter for the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, in conjunction with local authorities and health boards, to address alleged breaches in the retail and catering sectors and I understand the FSAI is following up the matters raised. I have been concerned for some time about the issue of food labelling and, for this reason, I established a widely representative group to examine the matter, which reported to me on 10 December 2002. On the basis of the recommendations of the food labelling group I took a number of actions which included arranging for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the FSAI; pursuing with the EU Commission the question of extending the beef labelling regulations to the catering sector; and asking the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research to identify consumer requirements on the origin of meat, including beef. While beef imports constitute a small fraction of our overall production and exports, it is absolutely essential that EU labelling requirements are applied to all beef sold on the domestic market, irrespective of origin.</p>

          <p eId="para_1090">The consumer liaison panel was established in January 2002 to strengthen communication between consumers and our Department. Meeting the requirements of the consumer is vital to the future of a progressive multi-functional agri-food industry, encompassing not alone the basic function of food production but also food safety, food quality, environmental and animal welfare issues. The panel is representative of general consumers. During 2002 the panel discussed a number of issues ranging from food safety, to country of origin labelling and food prices. The key issue identified by the panel was food labelling and it recommended that we examine this issue.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_82">As a result of this recommendation and the concerns that we already had on this issue, we set up the food labelling group in July 2002 to examine the issues of concern to consumers in regard to labelling. As part of the exercise, submissions were invited from any interested parties. A large number of submissions was received and examined by the group from a wide spectrum of individuals and organisations. In December last, the labelling group presented its report to us. It contained 21 recommendations covering general  labelling rules; policy and enforcement; consumer education and awareness and origin.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_83">We accepted the recommendations of the group. As the recommendations covered issues within the responsibility of a number of Departments and Government agencies, we set up an interdepartmental agency group to progress implementation of the recommendations. This group includes representatives from our Department, the Departments of Health and Children, Enterprise, Trade and Employment and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, together with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland and the Food Safety Promotion Board.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_84">I am pleased that considerable progress has been achieved in implementing the report. In particular, the centralisation of enforcement of food labelling regulations in the Food Safety Authority will be completed shortly. Good progress has also been achieved on other issues such as allergen and nutritional labelling, industry responsibility for clear labelling, food labelling in school curricula and substantive transformation.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_85">One main issue, the food labelling group recommendation on the origin of meat, has occupied a lot of the time of the consumer liaison panel this year. The group recommended that consumer research should be carried out to establish how origin of meat should be defined and also the effectiveness of the beef labelling regulations. At our request, the consumer liaison panel drew up a strategy for this research and has commissioned same. At this stage, the research is almost completed and I expect the consumer  panel will report on the results before the end of this year.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1092">The number of cases of Johne's disease reported to my Department has increased significantly in recent years. In the 50 year period up to 1982, a total of 92 animals were diagnosed with the disease whereas in 2002 alone 100 animals in 34 herds were diagnosed as having Johne's disease. My Department is currently finalising a review of both policy and practice in relation to Johne's disease with a view to establishing a new approach to the disease. Details requested in respect of the locations in which compensation has been paid in the past two years are included in the tabular statement which I propose to circulate in the Official Report. In 2002, the largest compensatory payment made was for €422,000 in respect of the depopulation of a single herd in County Cork comprising of 202 animals. The lowest amount of compensation paid was €127.54 for an animal, also in a herd in County Cork. In 2003, to date, the largest compensatory amount paid was €21,398.03 in respect of nine animals in a herd in County Louth. The lowest amount of compensation paid was €37.56 for an animal in a herd in County Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_1208">Under the mid-term reform agreement, a dairy premium will be introduced from 2004. It was originally envisaged that the premium would remain coupled to the milk quota on an individual holding until the year 2007, after which it would be decoupled. In the course of discussions in the Council it became clear that the possibility existed to decouple from an earlier date. Following detailed consideration of the impact of the decoupling of the dairy premium and having taken account of the views of representatives of dairy producers, I decided to decouple the dairy premium from 2005, the earliest possible date. This action will provide dairy farmers with the necessary certainty that they require to allow them to take informed decisions on their future in the industry. Decisions on the sale and acquisition of milk quota and land and the associated investment decision can be taken in a more certain environment. In addition, the decoupling of the premium at the earliest possible date should provide for a more gradual restructuring of the industry at producer level.</p>

        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_88">Given that the current remit of my Department as licensing authority is confined to veterinary vaccines, with the Irish Medicines Board having licensing responsibility for other veterinary medi cines, this reply relates only to vaccines. I have on a number of occasions in the past outlined to this House the situation in relation to veterinary vaccines. My Department has also met with the various stakeholders to explain its approach in this area.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_89">The licensing regime that had been in place until recently for veterinary vaccines in Ireland and which was based on the Therapeutic Substances Act 1932, was significantly out of date in terms of EU legal requirements and particularly in regard to the level of expert scientific evaluation applied to individual products. As well as other deficiencies, the regime did not provide for mandatory routes of supply which has been an EU requirement for many years. Accordingly, it was necessary to commence a thorough review on an individual basis of all veterinary vaccines currently on the Irish market. My Department, as provided for in the legislation, reached agreement with the Irish Medicines Board so that the board would carry out the detailed technical examination of application dossiers submitted by sponsoring companies. On the basis of this examination, IMB recommends to my Department, as the licensing authority on the grant or otherwise of a license and the conditions, including route of supply, to attach to such licence.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_90">Since 1 October 2003, of four vaccines licensed by my Department, one was assigned to the "Prescription Only", POM, route, while, of the remainder, two were assigned to the "Licensed Merchant", LM, route and one to the "Prescription Only Exempt", POME, route. In overall terms, of the 98 vaccines reviewed to date, 66 have been designated POME, 29 POM and three LM.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_91">As regards concerns which have been expressed about additional costs arising for farmers, the principal dynamic driving the actions by Department in this area has and will continue to be the need to protect public health and animal health and welfare. While my Department does not have a policy of excluding any of the commercial outlets provided for in the legislation, it has a responsibility under the legislation to apply to individual products the degree of control, in terms of route of supply, consistent with the risks it judges to be associated with each. However, I am conscious of cost considerations, particularly at this time, and that my Department will keep this matter under review to ensure a workable regime consistent with the overall objective of protecting public and animal health and welfare. My Department is reviewing its remit as licensing authority for veterinary vaccines.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1214">The settlement in question principally concerns actions taken by my Department against the AIBP group in respect of irregularities in the operation of the beef intervention system during the early 1990s. The irregularities included the non-declaration of intervention beef deboning yield and substitution of beef during canning operations. There were six actions taken in all, three by my Department and three by the AIBP group, who were seeking the release of a number of payments which my Department had withheld, pending resolution of the main actions, as well as the return of a special export refund licence for their Rathkeale plant.</p>
          <p eId="para_1215">All six cases have been settled and payment has been made by AIBP in the sum of €3.81 million, which is largely in respect of the undeclared yield and canning cases. The sum received allows my Department to make full recovery to the EU of the irregularity amounts reported. Following receipt of the settlement sum from AIBP, the payments which my Department had withheld were released. These two payments totalled €0.94 million. The agreement was approved by the Government on the basis of the legal advice given by counsel and the Attorney General and brought to an end seven years of litigation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1217">The FAPRI-Ireland report on the effects of full decoupling predicts that, after an initial drop in cattle prices in 2005 due to increased slaughtering, the trend will be reversed from 2007 onwards and an overall price increase of 10% is predicted for cattle prices in Ireland by 2012. Similarly, Irish sheep prices are predicted to increase by 13% by 2012. The report indicates that there may be marginal increases in pigmeat prices due to the cross price effect of higher beef and sheepmeat prices.</p>

          <p eId="para_1219">The mushroom industry is an important industry nationally. In 1997 total mushroom output was an estimated 56,000 tonnes produced by 576 growers. Last year an estimated 69,000 tonnes was produced by 365 growers. Rationalisation and restructuring is taking place among growers, producer organisation, composters and marketing companies. While some growers have left the industry, mushroom output has been maintained by growers who expanded. The sector is facing strong competition on the British market at the present time but I do not believe that mislabelling is a significant factor in the current marketing climate. This year mandatory indication of origin has been introduced in the UK and I understand that the authorities there are actively enforcing it.</p>
          <p eId="para_1220">There are serious issues facing the mushroom industry. In this regard, I have recently announced the setting up of a mushroom task force. It will consist of private and State interests involved in the mushroom supply chain and its brief is to devise a timebound action plan to address the issues now facing the industry with a view to securing the future viability of the sector. I look forward to receiving this action plan in the new year.</p>

Issues in the economy such as inflation, productivity and international comparisons are being monitored and analysed at all times and have impacts for all sectors of the economy, not just agriculture. With regard to agriculture, which is highly export dependent, I am particularly conscious of Ireland's competitive position given the reports on competitiveness, which my Department sponsored, from researchers such as Professor Gerry Boyle of Maynooth college and Professor Alan Matthews of Trinity College. I am particularly anxious that competitiveness within the sector should be kept under review. It is in regard to such concerns that I have decided to revisit the report of the agri-food 2010 committee in light of recent developments in the CAP and WTO.

          <p eId="para_1231">During the period 1 January to 31 August 2003, it is estimated that 90,123 tonnes of meat and bone meal, MBM, were produced in Ireland. This represents an average weekly production of 2,575 tonnes. A quantity of approximately 210,000 tonnes of MBM is in storage in Ireland. Of this, 172,000 tonnes is under the responsibility of my Department and is stored in 34 locations throughout the country. The remainder, which is owned by rendering companies, is also held in approved stores.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_92">My Department has launched an EU-wide tender competition with a view to placing contracts  for the disposal of the 172,000 tonnes of MBM. The closing date for the tender is 28 November. It is not possible at this time to prejudge what the cost of disposal of this tonnage will be. However, my Department is making every effort to ensure that the disposal operation will be conducted safely and efficiently and that value for money is delivered for the Exchequer. I have established an interdepartmental agency committee to examine options for the future disposal of MBM and its report will soon be put before the Government. Ongoing disposal of commercial MBM, including SRM, is undertaken by renderers on prevailing market conditions.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1233">EU beef labelling regulations were introduced in 2000 and are applicable to operators involved in the production and marketing of beef. These regulations do not extend to the catering industry. With regard to lamb and sheepmeat products, the general food labelling regulations apply. I have, however, been concerned about two issues in particular regarding the labelling of food. One of these relates to the question of enforcement of existing provisions and I have arranged for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland. A second issue is the scope of the existing EU beef labelling regulations and in this regard, I have raised with the EU Commission the question of extending these regulations to the catering sector. Consumer requirements are a key element in assessing the need to change or broaden existing labelling rules with regard to meat, and I have asked the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research in this area. I expect to have the findings of this research shortly.</p>

          <p eId="para_1235">The major changes resulting from the mid-term review will apply from 2005 onwards. This will involve significant changes in my Department's current operations and structures. Six major schemes, currently operated by my Department, that is, special beef premium, slaughter premium, suckler cow premium, ewe  premium, extensification and arable aid schemes will be replaced. New processes will be in place to process the new single payment. In addition, compulsory cross-compliance measures for food safety, environmental standards, animal health and welfare etc. will be required.</p>
          <p eId="para_1236">Particular flexibility and commitment will be required from my staff from now to mid-2005 as during this period the current schemes must be operated as normal while the same staff will be involved in the advance preparations for the new procedures. The decision to proceed with full decoupling was made recently. In addition the detailed implementation rules and regulations have yet to be drafted by the European Commission. It is, therefore, too early to assess the final impact of the changes on the operations of my Department. However, it is clear the decision will lead to the reallocation of work and staff and will involve the redeployment of officers in my Department.</p>

          <p eId="para_1245">I fully recognise the potential of farmers' markets for small food producers and rural communities in general. Bord Bia, under the aegis of our Department, has statutory responsibility for the marketing and promotion of Irish food. The board has identified the importance of routes to market for small food producers. It recently launched Pioneering Routes to Market, a web-based guide to serve as a one-stop-shop for local producers interested in setting up a farmers' market. Such local markets give producers an opportunity to sell directly to local consumers and to test-market varieties of product. Bord Bia's guide identifies the benefits of farmers' markets to producers, consumers and local economies, lists the location of markets and trading days, offers clear advice on what makes for a successful market and outlines the benefits and expansion opportunities in farmers' markets. Farmers' markets continue to grow in popularity and now operate under various arrangements in 22 locations throughout the country. Located in old market halls, hotels and racecourses, they offer a range of experiences for local people and visitors. I welcome this variety and the potential that they offer to a number of producers, taking account of the decoupling of premia payments from production in 2005.</p>

These included increasing the income unit ceiling for eligibility under the schemes to 450, as well as increasing the investment ceiling to €75,000 for farm waste works and to €50,000 for dairy hygiene works. In addition, a standardised rate of aid of 40% is to be introduced for most investments.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_94">I have made it clear at all times that EU approval is required before we can implement  these changes and that they were linked to the overall mid-term evaluation of the schemes. The formal approach to the EU must come from the regional assemblies, following consideration and approval by the monitoring committees. The committees met at the end of October and endorsed the changes and the assemblies have written formally to the Commission seeking approval. In the meantime, work is under way within my Department on drafting the revised scheme documents and necessary application forms in anticipation of early EU approval. Finally, it was agreed in Sustaining Progress that the standard costs which are used to calculate grant aid, should be revised. This matter falls completely within national competence and I have already implemented a number of significant increases, following a detailed assessment of the position.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_95">The Sustaining Progress agreement also included a commitment in respect of REPS to seek approval in negotiation with the EU Commission and based on analysis of the underlying data, for payment rates of €200 for the first 20 hectares, €175 for the next 20 hectares and €70 for the next 15 hectares. In October 2002 I launched a consultative process on REPS which gave all stakeholder groups a chance to contribute to the formulation of an amended scheme. All aspects of the scheme, including the scheme measures, payment rates, controls and sanctions were reviewed. My officials are finalising proposals for an amended scheme with an implementation date of 1 January 2004. They will meet farming representatives later this week, after which the proposals will be submitted to the European Commission for approval.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1256">In conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry, I initiated a strategic review of the dairy processing sector during 2002. Prospectus and Promar International undertook this major consultancy study and their report identified weaknesses in the industry including a lack of appropriate scale for today's conditions and an over dependence on commodity products and intervention. The report recommended greater expenditure in research and development to allow the development of a greater range of consumer-value added products and its key message is that the success and long time survival of the industry is critically dependant on its ability to transform itself and deliver on the key strategies set out.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_96">A fundamental part of the next stage of development for the Irish dairy sector is the need to increase expenditure on research and develop ment. A key element in becoming more market-led in our approach is to ensure we concentrate sufficiently on researching and developing the products which not only consumers want and are prepared to pay for today, but those which they will want into the future. There is evidence that the Irish dairy industry invests less in research and development than its international competitors and this is something which needs to be addressed.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_97">Since the publication of the Prospectus report, I have had a series of meetings with representatives of most of the main processing undertakings. In September, I convened a dairy forum at which all of the main organisations, representing both producers and processors were present. The purpose of that forum was to afford an opportunity to all sections of the industry to give their views regarding the present state of the sector, the changes necessary for the future and how these changes might be achieved. Enterprise Ireland also participated and outlined the main areas where State grant assistance would be available to the industry. Involvement in research and new product development was the principal area which would benefit.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_98">Overall, the need for greater investment in research and development and the need for continued diversification of its product range has been clearly identified as an objective for the entire food industry, including the dairy industry. The prepared consumer foods sector is the fastest growing sector of Irish industry and recently Enterprise Ireland, in co-operation with my Department, launched the Prepared Consumer Food Strategy 2003-2006. The commitment of the Government to assisting such developments in the dairy industry is clear from the offers of assistance from Enterprise Ireland and from the development and funding of world-class research facilities at Moorepark. The contribution by my Department to the funding of the food research programme is also of particular use to the dairy industry. Ultimately, decisions as regards investment in these areas are for the industry itself, however, and in practice for the boards and the management of the individual companies involved.</summary>

However, the EU Council of Ministers agreed the terms of the Luxembourg Agreement from 26 June 2003, which provided the legal basis for member states to adopt various options to decouple direct payments. Following an extensive public consultative process I recently announced my intention to fully decouple all direct payments from production with effect from 1 January 2005. The implication of that decision is that individual farmers with an established entitlement will in future receive premiums in the form of a single direct payment rather than the existing coupled payment. As a result there is no provision that would allow the second age premium to be paid in 2005 to those farmers with male animals born in the aforementioned period.</p>

A general scheme to effect this was approved by Government in July last and drafting of the legislation is under way. A mechanism has since been put in place for formal co-operation between Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. In drafting this general scheme, our Department consulted with the stakeholders including organisations and institutions representative of the horticulture sector who were asked to submit their views for inclusion in the legislation. The replies received would suggest that the main areas of concern are representation on the board, a dedicated subsidiary board for horticulture and assurances that the current functions of Bord Glas, as these relate to horticultural production, including fruit and vegetables and the  amenity sector, will not be overlooked in the new body.</p>

          <p eId="para_1265">The installation aid scheme involves a two stage application process; initial applications for entry into the scheme, IAS 1, must be submitted within six months of the date of set up in farming. The applicant then has a further 24 months to complete the educational and other requirements under the scheme. An application for payment, IAS 2, together with all the required supporting documentation must be forwarded to my Department before the end of this period. My Department has 1,279 IAS 1 forms on hand, of which 375 have been progressed to IAS 2 stage by the applicant. This stage, which is completely controlled by the applicant, normally takes about eight months. Once the IAS 2 has been received, it usually takes about eight weeks to carry out a full examination, which may require a site visit. Once the application has been approved, my Department then issues payment within six weeks.</p>

In addition, a number of postcards were received from an organised source. Fur farming is a legitimate farming activity in this country. Under the Musk Rats Act 1933 (Application to Mink) Order 1965, the keeping of mink is prohibited except under licence from our Department. Licences are issued under this legislation only if the applicant, following an inspection carried out by officials from our Department, is found to be compliant with a number of key conditions.</p>
          <p eId="para_1317">Licensed fur farms are also inspected by our Department to assess compliance with the Council of Europe recommendations concerning fur animals and Council Directive 98/58/EC concerning the protection of animals kept for farming purposes. These inspections have found that the licensed fur farms have been operating in compliance with current legislation. Inspections have also found that the slaughter methods employed by the licensed fur farms are permitted under the Sixth Schedule to the European Communities (Protection of Animals at Time of Slaughter) Regulations 1995. We have no plans to ban fur farming in Ireland. Our Department will continue to keep in close contact with the fur industry and to monitor the operation of the licensed fur farms.</p>

          <p eId="para_1319">The Department's purpose in funding the eventing and exhibition centre in Punchestown was to have available a state-of-the-art facility for the holding of all forms of agricultural shows and displays. It was intended that the facility should be able to attract significant agricultural events such as those connected with the sport horse eventing competitions as well as cattle breeding shows and other special events. It was felt that the World Equestrian Games which come around every four years, the European Eventing Championships which take place every three years and international congresses could be attracted to Ireland at reasonable intervals if the facilities were available at a venue accessible to Dublin where air and sea travel could be convenient and where car and truck parking and animal movement would not present a problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1320">The centre at Punchestown is operational. I am pleased that the European Eventing Championships and the Open European Endurance Championships took place at Punchestown in September. These are major events in the world of equestrian sports, as together they comprise the largest international equestrian event in Europe this year and comprise the biggest sport horse event ever held in Ireland. The events attracted large numbers of oversees visitors and received wide international press and television coverage. Attracting events such as these to Ireland were among the main factors in deciding that the centre should be funded.</p>
          <p eId="para_1321">The Comptroller and Auditor General in his report expresses concerns about certain aspects of the project. These are being examined. Before it was agreed to provide funding, the project was examined in the Department and I am satisfied that it will be a great asset to the industry over time.</p>

          <p eId="para_1323">The overall objective of the Enterprise Ireland Prepared Consumer Foods Strategy 2003-2006, which was launched on 9 October last, is to assist the sector to continue its dynamic sales growth. The prepared consumer foods sector has performed exceptionally well in the past ten years, with sales and exports almost trebling over the period. Sales in 2002 reached €2.6 billion, of  which half were exports. The sector contributes significantly to the economy at national and regional levels, employing 15,000 people directly and supporting more than 32,000 people, when the indirect jobs, which it helps to sustain are factored in, and is forecast to continue to be the main area of growth in the food industry over the next decade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1324">The strategy sets out a vision for a strong performing sector, with continued emphasis on increasing export growth in Britain while, at the same time, providing support towards developing sales in continental Europe. The emergence of a number of high performance food start-up companies is a key element of the plan. The key targets for the period to 2006 are to increase total sales in the sector by 30% to €3.42 billion, representing annual compound growth of 6.8%; increase exports in the sector by 38% to €1.83 billion, representing annual compound growth of 8.5%; and increase job numbers in the sector to 16,600 people, an overall increase of 9%.</p>
          <p eId="para_1325">The strategy outlines the key features driving rapid and radical change in the food industry. The main feature is a continuing market-led move away from basic products towards prepared food products, driven by changing consumer buying behaviour, the changing marketplace and technology advances. The challenges facing prepared consumer food companies, including problems of scale, the need for innovation and new product development, and the need to invest in communication technologies are then addressed and finally the initiatives to be taken by the State agencies, in partnership with the sector, are comprehensively set out. While the targets set for the sector are ambitious and the operating environment is more competitive than ever, we are confident that by 2006 the prepared consumer foods sector will have developed to be stronger, more dynamic and capable of achieving the objectives of the strategy.</p>

          <p eId="para_1327">The EU regime for arable crops covers the area payments for this sector. Under this regime, Ireland has a base area of 345,500 hectares, of which 200 hectares applies to maize. In accordance with EU legislation, where claims for arable aid exceed the national base area, payments must be reduced in accordance with the extent of the overshoot. Maize silage producers were protected from penalties over the years by virtue of the fact that an overshoot of that base area could be offset by any undershoot of the base area for other crops. However, provisional figures for 2003 show that both the arable base area – all other cereals crops including set aside – and the maize base area of 200 hectares appear to have been breached this year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1328">In that situation, in accordance with EU legislation, the aid payable to maize growers must be reduced in proportion to the overshoot. The provisional figure for the maize overshoot is approximately 11,300 hectares. As the base area is only 200 hectares, a 100% reduction would be applied. There is no provision for a derogation from this rule in EU legislation and, accordingly, it is not open to member states to seek such a derogation.</p>

          <p eId="para_1330">The current low level of land sales and its high cost for many farmers means that land leasing is the main option available for most farmers wishing to improve the scale and efficiencies of their enterprises. Currently, almost one fifth of agricultural land is leased mainly on a conacre or short-term basis. There is a number of incentives in place to encourage land mobility and long-term leasing. For instance, participants in the early retirement scheme who do not wish to permanently transfer their land by deed of transfer have the option of availing of long-term leases. The taxation system allows for a rental income tax exemption for farmers over 55 years who lease their land on a long-term basis to an unconnected person.</p>

At current rates, the disease levies will bring in some €20 million in 2003. In the context of the agreement with the farming organisations, it was agreed that reviews of expenditure will be carried out during 2003 with a view to identifying savings while protecting consumer health, animal health and animal welfare and complying with statutory requirements. A meeting with the farming organisations to consider these issues is due to be held later this week.</p>

An international panel of EU approved experts will conduct the trials, and once deemed successful, some or all of the machines will be approved for use in Ireland. It will then be a matter for the industry to make the necessary arrangements for the acquisition of the machines. The Department is putting arrangements in place to allow for the withdrawal of its classification officers from 1 January 2004 after which its role will be confined in this area to supervision of the grading process. This is in line with the systems operated in 13 other EU member states.</p>

          <p eId="para_1342">On 19 October 2003, I announced my decision that all direct payments in the arable crops, cattle and sheep sectors would be decoupled from 1 January 2005. On 29 September 2003, I announced my decision that decoupled direct payments in the dairy sector, for which there were no partial decoupling options, would also take place from 2005.</p>
          <p eId="para_1343">My decision regarding the arable crops, cattle and sheep sectors was taken after having given careful consideration to the submissions received under the public consultation process, which included the farming organisations and other social partners, that I initiated last July. I had also carefully studied the outcome of the independent research which I had commissioned from FAPRI Ireland. I also took into account the overwhelming weight of opinion in favour of full decoupling among individual farmers whom I had met and who had attended the information seminars held by my Department throughout the country in the preceding weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1344">I believe that decoupling is in the best interests of Irish agriculture and the development of a sustainable, market orientated agri-food sector. Decoupling will allow farmers to concentrate on enterprises that return the best margins from production rather than on optimising their income from premia. Quality should also improve through better market orientation. There should also be environmental benefits through the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions. The analysis undertaken by FAPRI Ireland showed that the full decoupling option should lead to the greatest improvement in aggregate farm incomes.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_101">The decision to opt for full decoupling was announced well ahead of the effective date of 1 January 2005 to enable farmers and the markets to adjust and to plan ahead with confidence. The establishment of single payment entitlements for  each individual farmer will be a major undertaking for my Department. I am anxious that the transition should be as smooth as possible and in that context a steering group has been established in my Department to oversee the overall implementation of decoupling. While precise estimates cannot be made at this time, decoupling should not result in an increase in net costs to the Exchequer.</summary>

The survey disclosed a number of interesting results, including the finding that 62% of the respondents said they were in favour of full decoupling, the most significant element in the reform, with only 13% against. I was particularly pleased to note that 81% of the respondents said they were either "optimistic" or "very optimistic" about the future of Irish farming. I should also add that during the information meetings on the mid-term review conducted by my Department a strong mood in favour of full decoupling was evident.</p>

          <p eId="para_1349">I, along with my Northern Ireland  counterpart, commissioned a comprehensive study of the all-island pig industry. The study was conducted by Prospectus consultants in conjunction with Enterprise Ireland and the Northern Ireland Enterprise Board and the report was produced in 2001. The key recommendations of the report highlight the need for rationalisation of the pig processing sector, improved supply chain management and the need to develop more consumer convenient pigmeat products. While these findings are largely a matter for the industry itself, my Department has been progressing these recommendations with the main players in the pig industry and this process will continue.</p>
          <p eId="para_1350">The health status of the pig herd is also a matter of major importance. My Department is engaged with the pig industry in the ongoing monitoring and control of a wide range of diseases such as Aujeszky's disease, salmonella, PRRS, which, as well as improving the health status of the national herd, is necessary to maximise the acceptability of Irish pigmeat in export destinations. Pig processing plants also operate under the supervision of the Department's veterinary service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1351">With regard to market access, it is my policy and that of the Government to ensure that Irish producers have access to markets worldwide. Irish pigmeat processors are currently trading pigmeat in significant markets such as Japan and the United States. My Department will continue to work with Bord Bia, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the industry to identify and develop other potential markets. Discussions have been held with representatives of the pig industry on the introduction of a scheme to assist this industry to comply with EU welfare requirements. A decision on the introduction of such a scheme will be taken, <i>inter alia,</i> in light of the 2004 Estimates provision for my Department. The Teagasc programme of activities includes research in the area of pig nutrition, health and welfare. The main objectives of the advisory function in regard to the pig sector are better profitability and competitiveness based on improved growth rates and this is delivered to producers through farm visits, conferences, newsletters, etc.</p>

          <p eId="para_1353">The farm improvement programme which provided grant aid to approved apple growers to plant trees is no longer in operation. EU policy in more recent years has sought to address a mismatch between supply and demand and to improve Community production of apples and other fruits. In pursuit of this policy a premium was granted at EU level for the grubbing up of apple trees, excluding cider trees, on con dition that applicants undertook to refrain from replanting any trees for a period of at least 15 years. A number of Irish growers availed of this measure while it applied. In applying grant schemes at domestic level it became necessary therefore to ensure that schemes for the grant aid of horticulture during the last decade were compatible with broader EU considerations. I understand that the French scheme was designed to cut overall production capacity.</p>
          <p eId="para_1354">The domestic apple producing sector, however, continues to be supported. A producer organisation consisting mainly of apple growers has been in receipt of substantial EU funding on an ongoing basis in support of its operational programme and intervention activities. In this connection there is potential for funding apple trees as part of the operational programme of a recognised producer organisation. In addition, under round 1, 2001-02 of the NDP scheme of investment aid for the development of the commercial horticulture sector, five apple producers were approved for investment worth €205,000 in equipment. Under round two this year, investments of €73,000 in four apple projects have been approved.</p>

          <p eId="para_1373">The milk quota restructuring schemes have been the primary means of transferring milk quotas over recent years. They have proved a very useful mechanism for getting milk quota into the hands of active, committed producers at a reasonable cost. However, I am currently considering how the present mechanism can be improved in light of the emerging needs of the sector. I am aware that representative organisations in the sector are also considering this matter and I will consult them in the period ahead in order to share ideas on initiatives that might help to improve the availability of quota for active, committed producers.</p>
          <p eId="para_1374">I recently announced the decoupling of the dairy premium in 2005 – the earliest date possible under the Luxembourg Agreement – and I am confident that this will significantly improve the prospects of an orderly restructuring of the milk production at farm level. I took this decision with due regard to the views of representatives of the sector who had expressed fears that deferring the decoupling date until 2007 would hinder progress towards a more efficient farm level production structure. The decision to decouple from 2005 will help to accelerate the freeing up of quota and increase the quantities available for re-allocation.</p>

Compliance with the statutory management requirements are being phased in with effect from 1 January 2005 and with certain statutory management requirements in the areas of environment, public and animal health identification and registration of animals applicable from that date. Further statutory management requirements in the areas of public, animal and plant health are applicable from 1 January 2006 and statutory management requirements in the areas of animal welfare are applicable from 1 January 2007.

          <p eId="para_1386">I propose to take Questions Nos. 181 and 183 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1387">I assume the Deputy's questions relate to studies carried out on the effectiveness of the community employment, CE, programme as an active labour market intervention. In this regard a review of the programme was carried out in 1998 by Deloitte &amp; Touche. The Deloitte &amp; Touche report indicated that the scheme had a positive impact on the subsequent employment rates of participants <i>vis-à-vis</i> unemployed persons in general. However, the consultants recommended a reduction in the size of the programme from the existing level at that time of 40,000 down to a level in the region of 28,000.</p>
          <p eId="para_1388">The ESRI report, Investing in People, published in November 2000, concluded that while CE was of some benefit to women there were no positive employment effects shown for male participants. This report recommended a reduction in the level of CE and expansion in the provision of effective training programmes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1389">The more recent report by Indecon Economic Development Consultants commissioned by my Department on behalf of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, supports the recent reductions in the level of CE places and indicates that based on the evidence available, which includes international research on direct employment schemes, CE and similar programmes are not as effective as other measures in enhancing employability.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_105">The CE programme is currently under review. An overall appraisal of active labour market programmes is being carried out under the aegis of the Standing Committee on the Labour Market, which is chaired by my Department. In addition, a cross-departmental senior officials group has been asked to consider options for the future of CE, taking account of the link with the provision of community services. FÁS is also currently completing an internal review of CE and the job initiative programme, JI, which is well advanced  and should be finalised shortly. A decision on the future funding and structure of CE and JI will be taken in the context of the Estimates provision for 2004, having regard to the outcome of the current review process, which is now nearing completion.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1392">The administrative costs of each of the task forces, together with the implementation costs of the recommendations, have generally been met from within the overall Estimates allocations of the Department and-or its agencies, and from other bodies involved, for example, local authorities and private sector funding. In the circumstances, my Department does not attempt to calculate total costs of task forces. No cost benefit analysis has therefore be carried out on any of the task forces.</p>

          <p eId="para_1443">My Department monitors the draw down of public funds for each agency on an ongoing basis, and has strict financial procedures in place to ensure that such funds are properly drawn down.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_109">Actual expenditure by the agencies is subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and observations on the efficiency and effectiveness of their spending is open to commentary by  the Comptroller and Auditor General. The chief executive officer of each body becomes responsible for the funds upon their receipt by the agency. At that time, the chief executive officer becomes the accounting officer for those funds, and is answerable to the Oireachtas for such expenditure, through the Committee of Public Accounts. Furthermore, some of the agencies are subject to further audits by other bodies at national and EU level in respect of EU funding.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_110">With regard to most of the agencies under the aegis of my Department, I have appointed senior officials of the Department, usually at assistant secretary level, to sit on the board of the agencies, which gives me additional succour as to the agencies' activities. In 2001, the Department of Finance introduced a new code of conduct for the governance of State boards to increase the transparency and accountability of publicly funded bodies. Included in this code is a requirement for the board to appoint an internal audit committee. The chairman of the board is required to report on compliance with the code of conduct when submitting the agency's annual report to me.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_111">In recent years, in addition to the strict financial procedures referred to above, my Department has conducted expenditure reviews in a number of key spending areas. This also allows me to satisfy myself that spending programmes show real efficiencies, and are effective and represent value for money. Recent reviews include a review of Forfás and several major reviews of FÁS training programmes, for example, apprenticeships and traineeships, community employment, etc. As part of the Expenditure Review Initiative, reviews of IDA Ireland property portfolio and of the Enterprise Ireland overseas office network are currently being undertaken within my Department, and a review of science and technology spending and of supports for the long-term unemployed are planned. In addition, other agency programmes are reviewed on an ongoing basis outside of this central initiative by my Department in collaboration with the agencies.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_112">My Department also has a number of agency liaison sections, which,inter alia, monitor the day-to-day activities of the agencies, and are in a position to informally determine the efficiency of the agencies' activities.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_113">Performance indicators for a management information framework are currently being developed within my Department. The availability of this information will enable managers to measure efficiencies within their own areas. The Department is also currently assessing the most effective methodologies by which the agencies may be brought within the scope of my Department's MIF.</summary>

          <from>Minister for Defence (Mr. M. Smith)</from>
          <p eId="para_1452">I propose to take Questions Nos. 191 to 194, inclusive, together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1453">The Government is committed to a policy of equal opportunity within the Defence Forces. The Defence Forces commitment to this policy is outlined in their Annual Report for 2002. Defence Forces recruitment and career policies embrace the concepts of equality and diversity. Careers in the Defence Forces are open to both male and female applicants on an equal basis. These principles are formally enunciated in the Dignity Charter for the Defence Forces which was adopted in line with the recommendations of the Government task force on workplace bullying. The statement of the Chief of Staff in July 2001 was also a clear statement of Defence Forces policy on this issue. The concepts of the dignity charter and the charter itself are being mainstreamed into all levels of induction and career course training within the Defence Forces and continue to be incorporated in Defence Forces policy documents and initiatives such as the integrated personnel management plan.</p>
          <p eId="para_1454">In 2001 following newspaper coverage of an academic thesis by a then serving officer in the Defence Forces on the subject of harassment of females in the Defence Forces, the Chief of Staff established a special military steering group to examine these issues. Dr. Eileen Doyle, who chaired the Government's task force on the prevention of workplace bullying, was asked by me to join the group as an expert civilian chairperson. She was joined by two other civilian experts and by senior military personnel. Dr. Doyle's group was asked to: determine the nature and extent of sexual harassment, harassment and bullying in the Defence Forces; review existing policies and procedures on interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces specifically in regard to harassment, bullying, discrimination or sexual harassment; and make recommendations on strategies and programmes relating to awareness and education in this whole area.</p>
          <p eId="para_1455">Dr. Eileen Doyle and the external advisory committee group presented their completed report, Challenge of the Workplace, to me in March 2002. I accepted the report and recommendations in full.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_114">Action to implement the recommendations of the report has been a priority since that time. The follow-up action has been driven by an independent monitoring group, chaired by Dr. Doyle.  This group meets regularly to oversee the implementation of the report's recommendations. In particular, the group is continuing to oversee the review of structures, policies, complaints procedures, selection procedures for career events such as selection for promotion, overseas service and career courses and education and training to ensure awareness and recognition of the problem.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_115">This group has overseen the following important developments in this issue: the establishment of an equality steering group; the launch of an independent confidential helpline and counselling service for members of the Permanent Defence Force; the launch of a revised administrative instruction and an accompanying booklet on interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces, which have been issued to every member of the Defence Forces; sourcing of training on a pilot basis for commanders and senior NCOs focusing on the area of prevention and resolution of interpersonal conflict, which the monitoring group identified as important to organisational development and change; the appointment of an independent body to design, administer and analyse an exit interview questionnaire for personnel leaving the Defence Forces; identification and training of personnel with appropriate skills to act as contact persons to assist in allowing personnel to deal with bullying issues by an informal approach, where appropriate; and the use of focus groups to identify appropriate ways of enriching training at all levels.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_116">The equality steering group has been engaged in an equality audit of various Defence Forces regulations and instructions. It has been examining a range of matters including the legislation, regulations and administrative instructions, practices and procedures under which the Defence Forces operate. This examination is taking account of the current legislative requirements, best practice in employment in Ireland, the particular requirements of the military environment and the Challenge of the Workplace report. The equality steering group will ensure that progress is made both on legislative requirements and best working practice.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_117">The independent confidential helpline and counselling service provides a 24 hour 365 days a year freephone careline to all serving members of the Defence Forces. A counsellor is available to answer the careline at all times. The service is fully confidential and is intended to complement existing personnel support services.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_118">The exit interview questionnaire process is now in train and will be conducted in respect of personnel who have left the Defence Forces since October 2003. Total confidentiality is assured for any individual member of the Defence Forces who participates in the work of the project. A comprehensive report will be presented to the monitoring group. It is envisaged that other such questionnaires and/or interviews will be conducted for new entrants and personnel in mid-career at a future date.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_119">On 9 April 2003 I launched the revised  Defence Forces administrative instruction entitled Interpersonal Relationships in the Defence Forces. This policy document was originally developed and implemented by the Defence Forces in 1996, prior to the enactment of the Employment Equality Act 1998. The 1996 policy was based on developments in this field in other armed forces. The revised administrative instruction sets out policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces including negative workplace behaviours such as bullying, harassment, discrimination and sexual harassment.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_120">This new administrative instruction reflects best practice and contemporary workplace legislation. A guidance booklet and easy reference card were also launched for distribution to each member of the Defence Forces. The aim of this new instruction is to set down policy and procedures regarding interpersonal relationships in the Defence Forces in order to deter unacceptable behaviour and promote a service environment based on mutual respect and professionalism. The instruction also provides detailed procedures for an individual who may wish to make a complaint of unacceptable behaviour. It explains how the individual can use either an informal or formal approach. It explains the methods by which a formal complaint can be dealt with using either the legal-disciplinary process – the existing military legal system – or the administrative action process – for less serious complaints.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_121">However, no document will of itself promote trust in the organisation and the need for "a parallel structure" remains.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_122">The monitoring group agreed on the importance of training for those who will implement the revised procedures, and for those within the military representative associations who have a crucial role in representation of their members. The success of the new administrative instruction, as a formal structure for dealing with complaints, will depend on the people who interpret and implement it. Training in human resource management is crucial. The military authorities have engaged an associate of IBEC to provide initial training on a pilot basis for commanders and senior NCOs. The focus of the training is on the prevention and resolution of interpersonal conflict which the monitoring group had previously identified as important in organisational change and development. The monitoring group will review this pilot work.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_123">The monitoring group has agreed that the informal approach to dealing with bullying issues should include "contact persons" with appropriate support skills. The selection and training of such personnel is now under way.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_124">The most significant development is the genuine and growing collaboration between the military authorities, the two representative associations and the Department of Defence in implementing the recommendations.</summary>

However, the Defence Forces have a derogation from the terms of the Employment Equality Act 1998 in respect of the criteria of physical ability and age. Therefore, the current age, medical and physical requirements for entry into the Defence Forces reflect the fact that only able bodied and fit recruits can satisfy the difficult and strenuous physical demands of the training and operational environment of the Defence Forces. Because of this, an unqualified statement such as that suggested by the Deputy would not be strictly accurate.</p>

          <p eId="para_1459">On 30 September 2003, I stated that discussions were continuing within established arrangements with the permanent Defence Forces representative associations, PDFORRA and RACO, on how the recommendations of the Benchmarking Body can be implemented in the Defence Forces in the context of the Sustaining Progress agreement. The position currently is that, last month, RACO balloted its members and a majority voted in favour of acceptance of the terms of the agreement. For serving personnel, payment of 25% of the benchmarking awards granted to basic pay and backdated to 1 December 2001, was made with their October salary. 25% of the awards granted to allowances and backdated to 1 December 2001 will be made with their November salary. Pensioners will receive their arrears of pension with their December 2003 pension payment. As regards PDFORRA, the position is that it plans to ballot its members shortly with a result due later this month. If a majority of members vote in favour then the arrears will be paid to serving personnel and pensioners as soon as is practicable thereafter.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_125">Payment of the final two phases of the benchmarking increases and the general round increases is dependent, in the case of each sector, organisation and grade, on verification of satisfactory achievement of the provisions set out in the Sustaining Progress agreement on co-operation with flexibility and ongoing change; satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation and the maintenance of stable industrial relations and absence of industrial action in respect of any matters covered by this agreement.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1467">Following the Agenda 2000 mid-term review agreement, I have decided that all direct payments will be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. With effect from 2005, the decoupled payment, to be known as the single payment scheme, will be based on the average amount paid to the farmer under the various premia schemes for the years 2000-02 inclusive. The average amount is determined by taking the three-yearly average number of animals or arable hectares which attracted payment, multiplying by the premium rate for 2002, the highest rate under Agenda 2000, and dividing by the average number of hectares over the three year period.</p>
          <p eId="para_1468">The result is that a certain number of payment entitlements are established. The total number of entitlements will be equal to the average number of hectares in the reference period, while the value of each entitlement will be the figure obtained by dividing the average amount determined for the reference period by the average number of hectares. Farmers for whom entitlements have been established must activate those entitlements in 2005 by continuing to farm and submitting an area aid declaration in that year.</p>

          <p eId="para_1471">Discussions are taking place between my officials and the European Commission on the detailed rules for implementing the mid-term review agreement, including the decoupling of payments from production. While it may be some time yet before the position is clear, my officials have already raised and will continue to raise a number of issues relating to farmers who have retired under the early retirement schemes and the implications for them of the decoupling and single payment proposals.</p>
          <p eId="para_1472">By definition, retired farmers cannot activate entitlements earned during the reference period and the Commission's position is that entitlements should not be linked to land but should go to farmers who were active during that period. However they have also indicated that they favour arrangements under which family members who were not farming during the reference period, but subsequently take over a holding, will have access to the national reserve. My officials will continue working to secure as favourable an outcome as possible, having regard to the legitimate aspirations of all stakeholders.</p>

This is apart from the advisory, training, research and development services provided by Teagasc.

Over 90% of these payments are issued within one week of the commencement date for payment laid down in EU regulations.

          <p eId="para_1506">In the context of the Sustaining Progress negotiations, a number of proposals for significant changes to the farm waste management scheme were agreed. These included increasing the income unit ceiling for eligibility under the scheme to 450, as well as increasing the investment ceiling to €75,000. In addition, a standardised rate of aid of 40% will be introduced for most investments. These proposals mean that significant grant aid will now be available to the vast majority of Irish farmers who need to carry out anti-pollution works. These changes require EU approval before they can be implemented and the regional assemblies have written to the Commission seeking this. In the meantime, I have already made a number of significant increases to the standard costs. They are used to calculate grant aid under the FWM scheme. This ensures that the grant aid approved accurately reflects the cost farmers must bear in carrying out antipollution works.</p>

At present some 38,000 farmers are participating in this measure. I will shortly make proposals to the European Commission for changes to the REP scheme.

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1512">The current bovine tuberculosis eradication scheme complies with the relevant EU legislation. It has been successful in reducing the level of tuberculosis from 17% of animals in 1955 to 0.3% of animals today. The maintenance of this low level of disease makes it possible for Ireland to trade internationally. Since 90% of bovines are exported it is of immense benefit to the Irish economy.</p>
          <p eId="para_1513">There has been a steady decline in the numbers of TB reactors since 1999 when 44,900 reactors were identified compared with less than 29,000 in 2002. Similar numbers of reactors are likely to be identified this year. Further progress towards final eradication is constrained by the presence of a wildlife reservoir of infection. In this regard my Department operates an active wildlife programme nationwide and the four area badger study has just been completed. The final report on the result of the study is being prepared for publication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1514">My Department has also in place an ongoing research programme. It liaises with international bodies and organisations on developments in TB eradication.</p>
          <p eId="para_1515">In 1986 Ireland was declared to be officially brucellosis free. Significant progress was made in the initial stages of the brucellosis eradication programme but the disease was not fully eradicated. From the mid 1990s onwards the situation deteriorated. During 1997 and subsequent years a series of measures were introduced to address the problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_1516">The full impact of the measures is being kept under review but significant progress has been made since 1998. During 2002 1,679 reactor animals were identified compared with 3,142 in 2001, 3,729 in 2000, 4,545 in 1999 and 6,417 in 1998. The 2002 figure represents a 74 % decrease on the 1998 figure. The number of newly restricted herds has fallen from 1,081 in 1998 to 430 in 2002, a 60 % decrease. The improvement in this situation has continued in 2003. If current control measures are maintained the improvement shown in recent years will continue.</p>

          <p eId="para_1518">Importation of MBM or such products for any purpose to do with the farm animal and human food chain is prohibited. Under Community rules the importation of such products which have already been incorporated within pet foods and are destined for meat eating animals is  provided for subject to certain conditions. While the main source of imports of pet foods is from other member states, it is also imported under licence from Hungary, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, the Czech Republic, Poland and the USA. Data supplied by the Central Statistics Office indicate that the total quantity of pet food imported here during 2002 was 48,513 tonnes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1519">Importers of pet foods are required to register with my Department and give at least 24 hours notice of intention to import. Pet food originating from an EU source must come from an approved establishment. It must also be accompanied to its destination by a commercial document or a health certificate signed by an official veterinarian on the competent authority of the member state of origin. In the case of importation from third countries it can only be imported under licence. In such cases it must originate in a country approved by the EU for trade in such products, have been produced in an approved establishment and be accompanied by a health certificate in accordance with the provisions of Community legislation.</p>

          <from>Minister for Agriculture and Food (Mr. Walsh)</from>
          <p eId="para_1522">I propose to take Questions Nos. 214 and 225 together.</p>
          <p eId="para_1523">Last July I initiated a public consultative process. I gave careful consideration to the 200 submissions received prior to my announcement that all direct payments for cattle, sheep and arable crops would be fully decoupled from production as and from 1 January 2005. I also studied the outcome of the independent research I commissioned by FAPRI Ireland. I was mindful of the overwhelming weight of opinion in favour of full decoupling among farmers I had met or who had attended my Department's information seminars. I based my decision on what I saw as being in the best interests of Irish agriculture and the development of a sustainable, market orientated agri-food sector.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_131">Full decoupling represents a fundamental change in the nature of support for Irish farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy. It provides a better basis for a competitive agriculture and food industry than a system that required farmers to take farming decisions based on eligibility for premium. Farmers are now free to focus more sharply on the market and the demands of  the final consumer. On occasion farmers kept loss-making livestock as well as additional burdens associated with compliance with a myriad of schemes involving various application dates and retention periods. Under the new regime the better market orientation of primary production should assist food processors in developing and supplying quality markets.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_132">While some reduction in production can be expected under full decoupling, I am satisfied that the resulting increase in prices and reduced input costs will lead to an aggregate increase in farm incomes as is evidenced by FAPRI Ireland's research.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_133">In future farmers will have the cushion of single farm payments, decoupled from production, providing greater freedom of choice and the scope to enhance incomes by more market orientated production.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_134">There is strong determination within the beef sector to meet the challenges under the new regime. My Department will work with the food industry and Bord Bia to ensure that there is a strong beef industry for the benefit of producers, processors and consumers.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_135">A major study of the dairy processing sector was published in March. It was jointly funded by my Department, Enterprise Ireland and the dairy industry. Prospectus and Promar International prepared the report. It identified a number of weaknesses associated with the dairy industry. It also suggested key strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term success of the industry in an increasingly competitive trading environment. Issues such as scale, cost efficiency, greater investment in research and development and new product development are central to the consultants' recommendations.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_136">Less dependence on commodity type products and intervention and a move to more value added products is a fundamental requirement for the sector's development. Our international competitors invest more in new product development and it will have critical importance in the future. Ireland's dairy output must be dictated by the needs of the marketplace. I have no doubt that product innovation will be a critical element of dairy processors future business plans.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_137">The prepared consumer foods sector is the fastest growing sector of Irish industry. My Department has been actively involved in the Prepared Consumer Food Strategy 2003-2006. It addresses the continuing market-led move away from basic food products, towards prepared food products. This shifting trend has been prevalent in the dairy sector for a number of years. Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc actively assist organisations to exploit the opportunities that exist. Their continued work in this area, combined with my Department's contribution to the funding of the food research programme, will provide valuable support to the industry in the years ahead.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_138">To assist the discussion on the future development of the sector and to address the strategies required to bring about the changes necessary, I  have over the past few months had a series of meetings with representatives of most of the main processing undertakings. I also convened a dairy forum and all of the main producers and processor organisations were present. The forum afforded an opportunity to all sections of the industry to give their views in relation to the present state of the sector, the changes necessary for the future and how these changes might be achieved. Of course the final decisions relating to investment in change rests with the management and boards of the processing undertakings themselves. These are commercial decisions which must be taken within the constraints inherent in every organisation. I will continue to encourage and support the industry to take the steps necessary to ensure a viable and successful future for the sector in an increasingly competitive environment.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1525">BSE related restrictions have never been imposed on Ireland by the European Commission or by a member state. The UK market, in particular as a destination for Irish beef, has seen a huge growth during the past two years and has remained strong this year. Last year exports to the UK amounted to 250,000 tonnes. Markets for Irish beef in France, the Netherlands, Italy, Germany and Sweden also remain strong. In the course of the past year Switzerland, the Czech Republic, Poland and Hungary have lifted their restrictions on Irish beef imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1526">We are keen to have existing restrictions in non-EU markets removed at the earliest possible date. Last year Russia lifted its remaining BSE related restrictions on Irish beef imports.</p>
          <p eId="para_1527">The Egyptian authorities lifted their restriction on Irish beef in October 2001 but for technical-commercial reasons trade did not resume. Following ongoing contacts with the Egyptian authorities, they lifted restrictions on certain cuts of beef last September. This easing of the restriction on cuts clears the way for a resumption in trade.</p>
          <p eId="para_1528">Bahrain lifted its restrictions on Irish beef imports in July. My Department works closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Bord Bia. It is also in contact with the Saudi authorities and other Gulf state authorities and we are making progress.</p>
          <p eId="para_1529">The EU is a deficit area and a net importer of lamb. Therefore, export to non-EU countries does not arise. The bulk of our lamb export trade is with France which takes some 80% of the total.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_139">It is my policy, and that of the Government,  that Irish beef and sheepmeat should be free to enter any market where exporters consider there are commercial possibilities. Every effort has and will continue to be made at political, diplomatic and technical level to have all potential markets open to Irish exporters. There has always been strong competition on international beef markets. However, I am confident that Irish beef will continue to perform well provided we produce a high quality product that offers the maximum food safety guarantees to consumers.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1567">FAPRI Ireland has produced a detailed study of the effects of the Luxembourg agreement on relevant commodities, including sheepmeat. The study shows that supplies will increase and prices decrease in 2005 as a result of decoupling but as supplies become scarcer prices will recover in 2006 and continue to improve up to 2012, the period of the agreement.</p>
          <p eId="para_1568">As regards trade, the FAPRI analysis forecasts that there will be marginal changes in the level of imports and exports over the period. The result, therefore, is unlikely to alter the current position where France remains the principal outlet for Irish sheepmeat exports, accounting for some 80% and where better quality product will continue to be targeted. Bord Bia will continue to focus its efforts on consolidating and growing the opportunities for further market penetration in France and in other EU countries.</p>

          <p eId="para_1571">Arising from the Luxembourg Agreement, I recently decided that all direct payment for cattle would be decoupled from production. Full decoupling represents a fundamental change in the nature of support for Irish farmers under the Common Agricultural Policy. Farmers will now be free to focus more sharply on the market and the demands of the final consumer. While some reduction in production can be expected under full decoupling the resulting increase in cattle prices and reduced input costs will lead to an aggregate increase in farm incomes.</p>
          <p eId="para_1572">The beef market in the EU at present is broadly in balance. Consumption is of the order of 7.3 million tonnes with production at 7.2 million tonnes. Intervention stores have almost emptied with 250,000 tonnes sold in the last 18 months. The UK and other EU markets are performing well and exports to Russia continue to be strong. I am aware of the importance of third country markets for our Irish beef exports and the recent lifting of restrictions on product specification for Egypt and the agreement by the EU Commission to my request for an export refund increase of 30% will enable trade in commercial volumes to resume shortly. I continue to make every effort at political, diplomatic and technical level to re-open other third country markets that have been restricted due to BSE.</p>
          <p eId="para_1573">However commercial considerations also arise in respect of all markets and Irish beef faces stiff competition from South America in particular, to retain and expand market opportunities. In this regard the industry needs to intensify its focus on both quality and price in order to improve its international competitiveness and sharpen its appeal to consumers.</p>

          <p eId="para_1575">A major study of the Irish dairy processing sector, jointly funded by the Department of Agriculture and Food, Enterprise Ireland and the Irish dairy industry itself, was published in March of this year. The report, prepared by Prospectus and Promar International, identified a number of weaknesses associated with the Irish dairy industry and suggested key strategies aimed at ensuring the long-term success of the industry in an increasingly competitive trading environment. Issues such as scale, cost efficiency, greater investment in research and development  and new product development are central to the consultant's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_1576">It is clear that less dependence on commodity type products and intervention, and a move to more value added products is a fundamental requirement for the development of the sector. It has been shown that our international competitors invest more in new product development and this is an area which will have critical importance going forward. Ireland's dairy output must be dictated by the needs of the marketplace and I have no doubt that product innovation will be a critical element of dairy processors' future business plans. The prepared consumer foods sector is the fastest growing sector of Irish industry. My Department has been actively involved in the prepared consumer food strategy 2003-06 which addresses the continuing market-led move away from basic food products, towards prepared food products. This shifting trend has been prevalent in the dairy sector for a number of years, with Enterprise Ireland and Teagasc actively assisting organisations to exploit the opportunities that exist. Their continued work in this area combined with my Department's contribution to the funding of the food research programme will provide valuable support to the industry in the years ahead.</p>
          <p eId="para_1577">To assist the discussion on the future development of the sector, and to address the strategies required to bring about the changes necessary, I have, over the past few months, had a series of meetings with representatives of most of the main processing undertakings. I also convened a dairy forum at which all of the main producers and processor organisations were present. This forum afforded an opportunity to all sections of the industry to give their views in relation to the present state of the sector, the changes necessary for the future and how these changes might be achieved. Of course, the final decisions relating to investment in change rests with the management and boards of the processing undertakings themselves. These are commercial decisions which must be taken within the constraints inherent in every organisation. I will, however, continue to encourage and support the industry to take the steps necessary to ensure a viable and successful future for the sector in an increasingly competitive environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_1580">I have been concerned for some time about the whole issue of food labelling and for  this reason I established a widely representative group to examine the matter which reported to me on 10 December 2002. On the basis of the recommendations of the food labelling group I took a number of actions which included: arranging for the centralisation of control of food labelling in the Food Safety Authority of Ireland; pursuing with the EU Commission the question of extending the beef labelling regulations to the catering sector; and asking the consumer liaison panel to carry out market research to identify consumer requirements on the origin of meat.</p>
          <p eId="para_1581">Where there is evidence that these requirements are not adhered to, then the agency responsible for controlling the particular sector and for implementing the legislation should take the appropriate action. In relation to the beef slaughtering and cutting plants under the control of my Department, I have asked the Department's veterinary inspectorate to examine the procedures in place to ensure full compliance. It is a matter for the FSAI, in conjunction with the local authorities and health boards, to address any alleged breaches in the retail and catering sectors and I understand the FSAI is following up the matters raised.</p>

This programme is in response to growing consumer concerns on the quality and origin of food offered when eating out.</p>
          <p eId="para_1584">EU beef labelling regulations were introduced in 2000 and are applicable to operators involved in the production and marketing of beef. As they stand at present, these regulations do not extend to the catering industry. With regard to lamb and other meat products the general food labelling regulations apply. I have raised with the EU Commission the question of extending these regulations to the catering sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_1592">Tax relief for the film industry was first introduced in 1984 under the business expansion scheme and has continued in various forms for the past 19 years. This makes it one of the longest running sector specific tax reliefs in the economy and has seen an Exchequer contribution in terms of tax foregone in the order of €265 million in the past ten years alone. It should be noted that this relief has continued over time against a backdrop of the widening of the tax base and the reduction of rates generally. In budget 2003, I referred to the generally accepted principle that such reliefs narrow the tax base and that a widened tax base is the price that must be paid to retain the current low tax rates. Consequently, all tax reliefs must be subject to ongoing review. In that context I announced in the budget that a number of these reliefs across a range of sectors including film relief would not be extended beyond 31 December 2004.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_142">I am aware of the views of many in the film sector that have been expressed either directly to me by way of representations or indirectly through the media, with regard to the economic and social impacts of the termination of this relief in December 2004. The Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism has forwarded to me a copy of a study reviewing the relief that was commissioned jointly by his Department and the Irish Film  Board. I have asked officials from my Department to examine this study. However, as things stand, the position with regard to the 31 December 2004 termination date for this relief remains unchanged.</summary>

In percentage terms, Ireland was the seventh largest donor internationally in 2002 – just behind Belgium at 0.42% – and our performance is well above the EU average.

          <p eId="para_1624">Responsibility for arranging insurance cover on school property and against public liability is a matter for the managerial authorities of voluntary secondary schools, which are privately owned. <i>Per capita</i> grants towards the operating costs of voluntary secondary schools may be used for this purpose. <i>Per capita</i> grants have been increased significantly in recent years.</p>
          <p eId="para_1625">In the case of voluntary secondary schools, the standard <i>per capita</i> grant now amounts to €266.49 as against the rate of €224.74 that applied in 1997. For disadvantaged schools the increase has brought the <i>per capita</i> grant to over €300. In addition, secondary schools have benefited under the school services support initiative. The initial grant of €25 per pupil that was introduced for schools in September 2000 was increased to €63 per pupil in November 2001. It was further increased to €116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and was further increased by €10 per pupil from January last, bringing the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €127 per pupil.</p>
          <p eId="para_1626">This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, €44.44 per pupil, per annum that has been approved for voluntary secondary schools. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. This is, in my view, in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives. For example, in a school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €100,000 per annum and annual grants of €236,761, €255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services, including insurance costs.</p>
          <p eId="para_1627">Tackling the difficulties that are being caused by high insurance premiums is a clear priority for the Government and for my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment. A key concern to which the Tánaiste is giving priority is the cost and availability of liability insurance. In this context, the Tánaiste has announced a comprehensive programme for the fundamental reform of the Irish insurance market. The Government considers that this programme is capable of delivering very real reform and that reductions in insurance costs will translate into significant reductions in premiums.</p>

          <p eId="para_1634">There are currently 13 classes in national schools and three pre-school classes for children with autistic spectrum disorders, ASD, on the northside of Dublin. The details are set out in the table which I propose to circulate in the Official Report.</p>
          <p eId="para_1635">The particular facility referred to by the Deputy is not recognised as a national school by my Department. It was set up as a pilot project in November 2001 to cater for 12 children with ASD. It now caters for 24 children. The facility has a staff of one director, one supervisor, 25 tutors and one secretary. My Department provides funding for the facility, which amounted to €887,300 for the 2002-03 year.</p>
          <p eId="para_1636">A decision on the future of this facility will be made in light of an evaluation of provision for children with ASD currently being carried out by my Department's inspectorate. The evaluation will also include educational services for children with ASD being provided in other settings such as special schools, special classes and mainstream schools. It is envisaged that the outcome of the evaluation will be determined before the end of school year 2003-04.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_151">The outcome of the plenary meeting can be summarised as productive. First, agreement was secured on peer review and monitoring though on a voluntary basis with the objective that as many participants as possible should receive a "review visit" within three years. Review visits form only one part of the "peer review". The meeting also agreed that each participant would exchange a detailed annual report on its implementation, which would be analysed by the working group  on monitoring. The results will be used to encourage further volunteers for visits but might also identify indications of serious non-compliance for which the document already provides for more intensive monitoring. The first annual report is due on 31 March 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_152">Substantial progress was achieved in other areas. The two Congos thrashed out a bilateral deal designed to end suspected wholesale smuggling of a significant percentage of Kimberley's diamonds across the water into Brazzaville. Further progress was reported on statistical returns in that by the end of the meeting, only five sets of data were outstanding in relation to the member participants. Finally, Canada takes over the chairmanship in 2004 with Russia as vice-chair. In future its appointed vice-chair would succeed as chair and therefore Russia becomes chairman in 2005. I am satisfied that the plenary meeting has achieved substantial progress in progressing its objectives of the Kimberley process.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1723">The following genetically modified foods are authorised for sale on the Irish market: vegetable oil from oil seed rape; vegetable oil from cotton seed; maize products; and soya products.</p>
          <p eId="para_1724">Several EU regulations, including 258/97, 1139/98, 49/2000, 50/2000, govern the labelling of food products containing genetically modified organisms, GMOs. These have been updated by two new regulations, 1829/2003 and 1830/2003, which amend the current rules on the labelling of foods produced from GMOs to require labelling irrespective of whether DNA or protein of GM origin is present in the final product. Consequently, highly refined or processed food such as starch, sugar and oil products which may not have any residual DNA or protein will, nonetheless, require labelling if derived from GMOs. A traceability system will also be put in place to verify the origin of the food. Labels will have to indicate either "This product contains genetically modified organisms" or ". . .  produced from genetically modified (name of organism)". Operators will have to comply with these new provisions on labelling from April 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1725">Trace levels of GMOs in conventional food and feed can and do arise during cultivation, harvest, transport and processing. This is not particular to GMOs but it can occur in the production of food, feed and seed with the result that it is very difficult to achieve products that are 100% pure. Against this background, the EU's objective is to ensure legal certainty and establish certain thresholds above which conventional food and feed have to be labelled as consisting of, or containing, or being produced from a GMO.</p>
        </speech>
        <summary eId="sum_156">Under current legislation the presence of genetically modified material in conventional food does not have to be labelled if it is below 1% and if it can be shown to be adventitious and technically unavoidable. The EU has now revised this  to a threshold of no higher than 0.9% that will apply from April 2004.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_157">Ireland applies EU legislation on genetically modified, GM, foods and has no additional national legislation. Under EU rules, only authorised genetically modified foods, or foods containing ingredients thereof, can be imported and placed on the market.</summary>

        <summary eId="sum_160">The total increase in expenditure on the home help service across all health board areas since 2000 is 113.59%. The overall economic position in 2003, which has implications for all aspects of public investment, is reflected in the Estimates and budget adopted by the Government for 2003. Within this overall framework, however, some two thirds of the additional funding available for non-capital investment in services has been allocated to the health services. This funding is being applied largely to maintain existing levels of service across all service programmes, including the home help service.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_161">There are a number of reasons there is an increased demand on the home help service, including the demographic fact that about 6,000 people are coming into the over-65 bracket every year. There is, proportionately, a bigger percentage increase in the more dependant over-80 category. These factors may necessitate some minor adjustments in the provision of the home help service. This means that although a small percentage of clients may have had their hours reduced in 2003, this has been counter-balanced by others receiving the service for the first time.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_162">The only health board or authority where 2003 expenditure on the home help service is down on the 2002 figure to a significant degree is the North-Eastern Health Board. This is because the board overspent its home help budget in 2002 to the sum of €800,000 and, in accordance with accountability procedures, that amount had to be drawn down against the 2003 allocation. I have been assured by all health boards that the provision of the home help service is organised on the basis that the more vulnerable clients are given priority. I am also pleased to advise that a number of health boards are developing personal care packages that are more focused on individual care needs, such as public health nurse service, attendance at day care, day hospital and rehabilitation and the provision of respite care, home help and care assistance. I am actively encouraging health boards to introduce such care packages. It will be some weeks yet before the 2004 financial allocations to health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority are known.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1847">Under the provisions of the Children Act 2001, which is now in the course of phased implementation by the relevant Departments, as Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform I will be obliged to provide separate, dedicated secure detention centres for the accommodation of 16 and 17 year old offenders. These secure detention centres, called children detention centres, will operate under their own unique regime which will cater specifically for the needs of juvenile offenders. The provision of these facilities has been identified as a priority by the Irish Prison Service.</p>
          <p eId="para_1848">Pursuant to a Government decision of April 2002, it was the intention of the service to provide 20 spaces at St. Patrick's Institution for the custody and education of 14 and 15 year old boys. In pursuance of this Government decision, the Prison Service had proceeded with the adaptation of one residential wing of St. Patrick's Institution as well as the construction alongside that wing of a dedicated education unit, a recreation-sports hall, counselling rooms, as well as other ancillary services, thereby creating a self-contained facility which could operate independently from the existing institution.</p>
          <p eId="para_1849">Since then, the accommodation difficulties in the special schools system which gave rise to the April 2002 Government decision have eased and the Department of Education and Science has indicated that it now has sufficient spaces in its special schools for 14 to 15 year olds. The Government, therefore, decided that the Irish Prison Service should move directly to the use of the new facility at St. Patrick's Institution for the benefit of 16 and 17 year old boys in custody, as part of the preparation for the implementation of the relevant provisions of Children Act 2001. The director general of the prison service expects that the transfer to the new facility of up to 44 male offenders aged 16 and 17 years should commence in the coming weeks.</p>

Efforts are continuing to reach agreement between the Irish Prison Service and the Prison Officers Association following the recent rejection by the association of proposals put to a ballot of the membership. In this regard, I have already indicated publicly that I am allowing a ten day period with effect from 30 October 2003 to allow prison management and the Prison Officers Association to see whether they can close the gap between them.  I hope that these latest efforts will prove successful.</p>

          <p eId="para_1872">Under section 34 of the Wildlife Act 1976, my Department is responsible for the issue of an annual licence to the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, and its affiliated clubs to capture live hares. Only clubs which are named by the ICC in its licence application request are permitted lawfully to catch hares. No clubs in Northern Ireland are included in the current licence. Any person catching hares other than in accordance with a licence is open to prosecution under section 23 of the Act. I can confirm that such prosecutions are currently taking place but it would not be appropriate for me to comment further while the cases are before the courts.</p>
          <p eId="para_1873">The regulation of live hare coursing, including conditions governing the use of hares for that activity, is carried out under the Greyhound Industry Acts, which are the responsibility of the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism. The controls exercised by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government under the Wildlife Acts 1976 and 2000 relate more generally to the protection and conservation of wildlife species, including hares, and licences embody conditions designed to support these objectives. A steering group comprising members of staff from my Department and from the Environment and Heritage Service of the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland has been set up to draft an all Ireland species action plan for the Irish hare. Work on drafting the species action plan commenced in June 2003. The plan is expected to be finalised by March 2004.</p>
          <p eId="para_1874">A survey to estimate hare numbers in Ireland is expected to be one of the strategies proposed in the action plan. Once the action plan has been finalised implementation of identified strategies will commence.</p>

          <p eId="para_1877">The national water pricing policy framework requires local authorities to recover the cost of providing water services from the users of these services, with the exception of households using the services for domestic purposes. In this regard the policy framework provides for the metering of all non- domestic users by 2006. While flat-rate charging is acceptable in the interim, the move to universal metering of non-domestic users, including schools, will permit the application of a volumetric charge which can reflect periods when service is not being availed off. This is in accordance with an appropriate application of the polluter pays principle and the requirements of Article 9 of the EU Water Framework Directive. It builds on the already widespread practice of charging for water services. The framework does not provide for the exemption of non-domestic users, including those engaged in the provision of educational services, from the charging policy.</p>

We are continuing to use every diplomatic and legal route available to us to work towards the removal of this threat.</p>

        <summary eId="sum_168">The Government has taken a demonstrable initiative in pursuit of this policy objective through its separate legal actions in relation to the Sellafield MOX plant under the OSPAR Convention and also the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, UNCLOS. These actions challenged operations at the Sellafield MOX plant on economic, legal, environmental  and safety grounds. The OSPAR tribunal issued its award on 3 July 2003. Although the award did not grant Ireland a right to gain access to the confidential information withheld from the UK public consultation papers because the tribunal deemed that the information sought was not environmental information, the tribunal established an important international legal precedent, namely, that Ireland has a right under the OSPAR Convention to access to information on the marine environment, that the UK has an obligation to make such information available and that Ireland has a right of redress under the convention to vindicate its rights to such information.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_169">The provisional measures award and order of the UNCLOS tribunal of 24 June 2003 recommended that Ireland and the United Kingdom enter into dialogue to improve co-operation and consultation between the two Governments and to report to the tribunal on the matter on specified dates. In compliance with the tribunal's order, Ireland and the United Kingdom submitted separate reports to the tribunal on 12 September 2003, setting out the progress to date on discussions towards progressing the tribunal's recommendation. Exchanges between the two Governments at official level on this matter are continuing.</summary>
        <summary eId="sum_170">In addition to the legal actions, Ireland has also responded critically to various UK public consultation processes concerning the regulation of the UK nuclear industry covering such matters as the management of radioactive waste in the UK, a review of UK energy policy and the UK strategy for discharges from nuclear installations. Ireland has also been involved in stakeholder talks with regard to the development of the new Nuclear Decommissioning Authority that is being set up in the UK and will continue to use its influence in whatever way possible to ensure the highest safety and environmental standards are adhered to, while continuing to campaign at every level for the ultimate safe closure of the Sellafield plant.</summary>

          <p eId="para_1896">CLÁR funds the cost of the customer contribution to the ESB for conversion from single phase to three phase electricity supply for small businesses. In order to qualify for assistance under the scheme, a business must be located in a CLÁR area and employ not more than ten people. The applicant's business must also have received assistance since 1 January 1997 from the county enterprise board, the local Leader group or from Údarás na Gaeltachta. Assistance may be in the form of grant aid, training, mentoring or advice.</p>
          <p eId="para_1897">On the basis of the information provided, the person referred to by the Deputy does not appear to be eligible for assistance under this scheme. However, I refer the Deputy to the farm electrification grant scheme, FEGS, which is operated by the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. FEGS subsidises the basic installation or conversion of electricity supply in farmhouses and farms engaged in traditional farming located in disadvantaged areas. "Disadvantaged areas" in this case means the areas designated by the Department of Agriculture and Food as having a specific handicap and where conditions are particularly severe for farming. Further information may be obtained from the electricity division, Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.</p>

      asked the

      if her attention has been drawn to the difficulties created for officers of the Defence Forces who served during the period of the Emergency between 1939 and 1946, who are now denied the reduced pension payable to other ranks, apparently as a result of an anomaly in the Widows and Orphans Act 1938, which regards only other ranks as insured persons; if, in view of the small number of such surviving officers and the hardship caused, she will consider dealing with the problem; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1901">I understand from additional material supplied by the Deputy that the case to which he refers concerns a former Army officer who has applied for a living alone allowance from my Department on the grounds that his spouse is in a nursing home and he is living alone. His application was refused on the grounds that he is not in receipt of a pension from my Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_1902">The living alone allowance, which amounts to €7.70 per week, is payable to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare-type payments and who reside alone. It is not a payment in its own right but an allowance which can only be paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment such as old age contributory pension. It cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of the UK or other countries.</p>
          <p eId="para_1903">Commissioned Army officers recruited prior to 6 April 1995 are insurable under contribution class C. Contributions made under this class can contribute toward an entitlement to widow's or widower's contributory pension, orphan's contributory allowance, bereavement grant and carer's benefit. NCOs and enlisted personnel of the Defence Forces are insurable at class H, which includes entitlement to an old age contributory pension. The Army officers concerned are not entitled to the old age contributory pension on the basis of their class C contributions and cannot therefore qualify for a living alone allowance.</p>

      asked the

      the average number of PRSI contributions which must be paid to be eligible for maternity benefit; the plans she has to review this or introduce a pro rata payment; and if she will make a statement on the matter.

          <p eId="para_1905">The standard contribution conditions for qualification for maternity benefit require that a woman must have paid at least 39 PRSI contributions since first starting work and must also have at least 39 paid or credited contributions in the relevant tax year, currently the 2001 income tax year, or in a subsequent complete tax year. A woman may also qualify for maternity benefit if she has paid a total of 39 PRSI contributions in the year immediately before she commences her maternity leave.</p>
          <p eId="para_1906">In order to overcome particular difficulties that can occur in the case of women who are working a split week, an alternative qualifying condition was introduced. This enables qualification for benefit where the woman has at least 26 PRSI contributions paid in the relevant income tax year and at least 26 PRSI contributions paid in the tax year immediately prior to the relevant income tax year. In addition to covering employees, the maternity benefit scheme applies to women who are in self-employment. Given the different nature of self-employment and the different arrangements for the payment of tax and PRSI contributions, different qualifying conditions apply. A self-employed woman must have paid at least 52 PRSI contributions in the relevant tax year. Alternatively, a self-employed woman can qualify if she has paid 52 PRSI contributions in the tax year immediately prior to or subsequent to the relevant tax year. The weekly rate of maternity benefit is related to the woman's earnings, subject to a minimum weekly payment of €141.60 and a maximum payment of €232.40. The benefit normally lasts for 18 weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_1907">The current contribution conditions require that a woman must have a minimum period of attachment to the workforce – at least nine months – in order to establish entitlement to maternity benefit. In the circumstances, the current contribution requirements are reasonable, given the level and duration of benefit provided. A working group representing the various pillars of social partnership has been established under Sustaining Progress to examine proposals for the development of a fully inclusive social model which would facilitate combining work and family responsibilities. This group is, <i>inter alia</i>, examining the method of calculating the weekly rate of maternity benefit. The outcome of the deliberations of this group will inform future policy developments in this area.</p>
