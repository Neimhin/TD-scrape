I offer my condolences to the family of the young Irish soldier who lost his life in Lebanon. Our thoughts and those of the Government are with his family and with the other brave soldiers injured in this attack, their families and their colleagues in Óglaigh na hÉireann. Our Defence Forces' tradition of peacekeeping with the UN is a proud one and these brave soldiers served in that tradition. In serving the noble cause of seeking to build and maintain peace, they put themselves in danger. We should never forget that. This morning is a tragic reminder of those dangers. One of our soldiers has paid the ultimate price in the service of his country and of peace. His family and friends, his injured colleagues and the Defence Forces will have the full support of the Government and the State at this difficult time. I thank Deputy Kerrane for raising this question. Our Rural Future is the most ambitious and transformational policy for rural development in Ireland for decades. The policy commits to developing an effective rural-proofing model to ensure that all Departments fully consider the effects of significant new proposals on rural communities and better target the particular challenges and opportunities facing them. Building on a report on rural-proofing my Department commissioned, I also recently hosted the 13th OECD Rural Development Conference, which provided further valuable insight into how the common challenge of proofing is being addressed in other countries. Our objective is very clear. We want to develop a proofing model that is practical and effective and which encourages meaningful consideration of rural impacts at the early stages of policy development. The approach must be efficient and implementable without being administratively burdensome. It has to add value, making new policies and programmes more effective in rural areas. As part of a phased approach, my officials have been actively engaging with all Departments in recent weeks with regard to rural-proofing and they have identified several areas in which to work collaboratively in 2023, such as on the development of the sustainable tourism policy, the review of the national planning framework and the development of the cross-departmental national hubs strategy. Under this pilot approach, Departments will consider the likely impact of their policies on rural areas at an early stage in their development and, where necessary, adjust the policy to ensure that the rural perspective is incorporated. This policy approach will underpin a broader approach of policy-making through a rural lens to support rural development and to ensure we maximise the opportunities for rural areas to the greatest extent possible.

It is of course important that we get this model right. The work that has been done to date is welcome. Looking at the international perspective allows us to take the best bits, to look at the challenges faced where rural-proofing models are in place and to make sure that we develop the best model possible to ensure that our rural communities are not adversely impacted by policies brought forward by the Government and by State bodies, which I hope will also be included.This is a proposal that has now been in place for some time. Can the Minister give us further detail regarding the work being done and how many models are on the table? Can she tell us anything about these aspects? On timeframes, when does the Minister hope to see this in place? I would welcome any information the Minister may have in this regard.

In conjunction with other Departments, we have identified the areas we wish to focus on as part of a pilot project. This includes sustainable tourism, which is an aspect that has a major impact on rural economies. We have, of course, launched the national outdoor recreation strategy. This will have great economic benefits. We just have to look at the Limerick greenway or the mountain bike trail in Kinnitty, and this is just to name a few examples. The national planning framework is another important area that has a major impact on balanced regional development, rural housing etc. Turning to remote working hubs, I launched 300 hubs nationwide as part of the connected hubs network. We are doing a lot of work with the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Enterprise Ireland and the IDA to promote these hubs to companies as a landing space for multinationals. Cavan has a good example. There is a remote working hub there and PublicRelay, which is a multinational company, came to Ireland, rented a space there and it is employing 25 staff. This is the type of development that is important for rural Ireland.

I appreciate that much work has been done and that it is important to get this right. It is welcome that the Minister is ensuring that this is being brought forward, because it is extremely important. We have seen the consequences of the failure to not look through this rural lens in respect of the north and north west, which is now a region that is no longer developed in the eyes of the EU. If rural-proofing had been in place, then perhaps we might have had a more balanced approach instead of these low investment figures for the north and north west. When the Minister talks about balanced regional development, we clearly do not have it. Alarm bells should be going off concerning the north and north west particularly. I appreciate that funding is now arriving and that work is under way. This is all welcome, but it shows the consequences of not having something like this in place. It is, therefore, so important that this model is put in place as quickly as possible. I hope we will see this happening next year.

This region in transition designation was decided in 2018 based on GDP per capita in the region over the previous three years and has been used to calculate European funding allocations for the region from 2021 to 2027. Separately, then, the European Parliament's Committee on Regional Development, REGI, independently categorised the north-west region as a lagging region. It is using a range of other data, such as productivity and education and skills. What we are talking about here, therefore, are two parallel classifications. Both highlight what we already know, which is that the north and west region warrants targeted support to reach its full potential. I looked at the figures from my Department, and since 2020, it alone has provided funding to this region of €349,749,000. The Deputies and I live in the region and we know how important it is to continue this momentum. It is good that €217 million will be available for investment in the region as well under the European Regional Development Fund, ERDF, 2021-2027.

The huge interest in this fund shows how important community centres are for communities throughout Ireland. Under the 2022 fund, applications were invited under three categories, with funding of up to €300,000 available. On 12 October, I announced over €12.5 million in funding for 580 successful category 1 applicants. On 8 December, I was delighted to announce a further €33 million in funding for 278 successful categories 2 and 3 applicants. Details of the successful applicants are available on my Department's website, www.gov.ie/drcd. It is clear that this is a much-needed and appreciated fund for communities nationwide. I was determined to make the process of applying for this funding as straightforward as possible so as not to burden groups run on a voluntary basis. As a result, detailed information is not available for each of the specific headings referenced by the Deputy. Following on from the huge interest in the 2022 fund, I was delighted to secure €20 million in budget 2023 to run the community centre investment fund again in 2023. It is intended that the 2023 fund will be targeted towards new-build community centres, as well as upgrades and improvements to existing centres. I expect to be in a position to launch the 2023 fund in quarter 1 of 2023. The Deputy will appreciate that many of these applications came from community centres and communities and volunteers on the ground. These were assessed by Pobal. It was not information that we looked for, but we had to ensure applicant groups were constituted properly etc. There was a need to be speedy to get this out to the groups as fast as possible.

It was something I called for while I was a member of Fingal County Council, as well as something I called for in this House. I hope the Minister enjoyed her trip to Hartstown community centre. I again commend the centre management. The Minister saw the passion and joy on the faces there when this substantial amount of funding was awarded. It will secure Hartstown community centre for the future. I also welcome that Fingal County Council is going to take this centre on board and take ownership of it, while the management of and planning regarding this centre remains in the community. My point is that most local authorities have a substantial fund for their own community centres and have used these funds for many years. This has been done through their own capital funding. A specific group of the centres, though, those not owned by local authorities, do not have access to this type of funding. In future, then, as we move on, can we get a bit more targeting concerning these centres?

There was a good turnout on the day. It was a lovely event. I thank all the local volunteers and the committee in Hartstown for the work they put into the application. This was the centre about which concerns were expressed some years ago regarding whether it would survive. I saw the "Save Hartstown" signs in place myself last week, so we are delighted that we have been able to support it. It would be a desperate blow for that community if the centre was not maintained.

The centre in Hartstown was in the ownership of the diocese, but it is now being taken over by Fingal County Council. This is a good thing. The support of the local authority will be of great help in future. We are happy to work together. I come from a rural area, and the community centres there are nearly all run by volunteers. Few centres are owned by local authorities. I am happy, though, to work together because it is the communities we want to focus on.

It is a good fund and a substantial amount of money.What I noticed when I was going through all of the allocations - I will refer to Dublin West and Fingal because I know them better - is that there were a number of Fingal County Council owned, run and managed community centres that also got phase 1 and phase 2. None of them got phase 3, but certainly phase 1 and phase 2. They have substantial capital funding. Not all local authorities have that. Obviously, the Minister wanted to get the first tranche of money out there to people. Is there a way that we can sit down, have a look at this and provide it in a more targeted way so that, for those local authorities that have substantial capital funding, there is consideration if there is money left over that it could go to them, but primarily to those that are non-local authority owned or even local authorities that do not have substantial funding? Some local authorities struggle with funding. Perhaps it could be a bit more targeted and they could then get an even more substantial amount of money.

In fairness, the majority of the applications that came in were from community owned ones. There are some local authority owned ones. However, I take the Deputy's point that if there is an obligation on the local authorities to support those centres, they should be honouring that obligation. At the same time, we want to make sure that we have good facilities. Of course, this was supposed to be originally a €15 million fund but in the end, we announced over €45 million in grants. As I stated in Hartstown, we are all on the same hymn sheet when it comes to supporting our community centres. As with any scheme we have, we will certainly look at it to see can we make it better. Generally, the feedback has been really good on this scheme. We will engage with everybody over the course of the coming months in terms of paying out the money and if we see issues that need to be addressed, we are happy to do that. Indeed, I am happy to hear any suggestions from here as well. As I have stated previously, I listen.

It is popular. There is considerable demand for the scheme. I acknowledge the fact that the Department has over the years since it was reintroduced funded this scheme as best it could. There is considerable demand for it. In Galway alone, we have probably 150 applications in a waiting list and we have stopped taking applications. I wonder how can we increase funding for the scheme.
#HeatherHumphreys	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-party	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-dob	unknown-#HeatherHumphreys-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	15	I thank Deputy Canney for raising this. The local improvement scheme, LIS, supports the improvement of rural roads and laneways that are not normally maintained by local authorities. As part of Our Rural Future, the Government is committed to ensuring that the LIS is funded into the future. The scheme makes an important contribution to connectivity in rural Ireland. I am also committed to improving connectivity for rural residents, whether it be access to homes, farms or outdoor amenities. The local improvement scheme was reintroduced by my Department in 2017 following a number of years with no dedicated funding. From 2017 to 2022, my Department has allocated over €100 million towards improvement works on over 3,600 non-public roads and lanes benefiting over 16,000 landowners and residents in these rural areas. I launched the 2022 scheme with an initial budget of €11 million. Over the course of the year additional funding was sourced from savings within my Department and I allocated a further €11 million, effectively doubling investment in LIS to bring the total investment this year to €22 million. I was pleased, as part of budget 2023, to announce an increase in the base funding for LIS to €12 million. I will continue to monitor expenditure patterns closely next year in my Department and should savings emerge, I will certainly give consideration again to allocating additional funding to the scheme. Finally, I am continuing to engage with my colleague, the Minister for Transport, regarding his Department contributing to a jointly-funded LIS scheme so that we can further address the high demand under the scheme. This is a scheme that Deputy Canney was supportive of when he was a Minister of State in the Department as well. It is an important scheme. Any time that there have been savings in other areas it has gone straight into the LIS scheme. Over the past number of years, we have invested €100 million in it and we have managed to get some of these lists down.

The Minister hit on the point I wanted to raise. We have active travel. Many of these schemes are used for active travel. They are used for cycling. At the back of my own house, there is a 2 km road which serves bogs and connects two roads and it is used for walking and cycling. In Sylane, we have access to Clas an Aifrinn. It was done over ten years ago under an LIS scheme. It is not only for farmers to get into land. It is creating connectivity. It is creating active travel. I believe that if the Minister for Transport could see his way to funding on a par with what the Department of Rural and Community Affairs is doing, we would see the list being lifted. It is important that we get co-operation from the Department of Transport on this important scheme.

The Deputy is correct that it is active travel. Where I was reared, it was a lane a mile long. It was very active when one was late for the bus, I can tell the Deputy. The Deputy is correct because many people use those ways. They are safe places to walk in rural Ireland because it is not safe to walk on the main road. There are laneways, for example, around lakes or whatever, that people could use. That is a good point the Deputy makes. The Department of Transport has a large capital budget, far in excess of what my Department has. I have raised the matter with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on a number of occasions. I have not had much success yet but I am a firm believer in the saying that if at first you do not succeed, try and try again. I will continue to keep after the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan, on this because that Department should be providing matched funding for this. I will raise the good point the Deputy has made with me.

I will lend my support to the Minister's campaign with the Minister, Deputy Eamon Ryan. I believe that in rural Ireland - earlier the Minister mentioned a region that is lagging in all of this type of thing - a scheme such as this is popular. There is demand for it. It is efficient. The local authorities are doing a great job in getting the works done. In the Department, it was always the case that if there was money lying around, it was not left lying around; it was put into the LIS scheme. Coming from zero in 2017, I acknowledge the €22 million that was put into the scheme last year. It is important that we continue that momentum but at Cabinet level there is a need to make sure that there is an emphasis on continuing something that is good, that is working and that is giving benefit to rural Ireland. If the funding was to be doubled, we would get rid of this backlog in a short time. The active travel fund is there sufficiently to allow a small percentage to go to the LIS scheme.

It has secured combined funding of over €3.26 billion over the past two years. Forty-nine roads were upgraded in 2021 and a further 50 this year. Of course, resources are finite but I am tackling the situation. I doubled the LIS roads allocation originally envisaged in last year's budget and this year alone, I invested €22 million in the scheme. We are making progress in some counties. I was talking to those in Leitrim County Council the other day and it has cleared its backlog, which is good. Some other counties have got it well down. Like Deputy Canney, there are a lot of lanes in my county of Monaghan, and in Cavan. Those local authorities still have a considerably long list. We are working with the local authorities to get a little more detail around the lists because, as the Deputy will be aware, even at local authority level, even in the municipal areas, there are different lists and different lengths of lists.

I know this is something she is very committed to. As the Deputy is aware, the Government is committed to publishing a ten-year policy on island development with associated three-year action plans. The programme for Government includes a commitment in this regard. As Minister with responsibility for the islands I am determined to ensure the policy is delivered. The Deputy is aware that an extensive consultation process has been completed by the Department including meetings with island communities and relevant Departments and agencies. The feedback from this consultation process provided a valuable insight into the key priorities, challenges and opportunities for our island communities. The Government's ambition for a national policy and action plan for the islands was set out in chapter 10 of Our Rural Future, the action plan for rural development published in 2021. The most recent meeting of the interdepartmental committee for the islands, which is chaired by my Department, was held on 10 October 2022. The initial draft document was shared with committee members for their feedback and observations, both in terms of their Department's draft input and the overall document. Officials from my Department have had further engagement with individual Departments and agencies over the past few weeks, including meetings with the relevant local authorities, in order to finalise the actions for inclusion in the plan. This process has now been completed and the draft updated accordingly. I expect a copy of the draft document to submitted to me before the end of the year, with a view to its publication in 2023. Deputy Connolly asks me a lot about the islands policy. There has been extensive consultation on it. We are nearly there. As I have said, the officials have been engaging with their counterparts on the draft document in recent weeks. It is important that we get buy-in from other Departments. When I get the commitments I can hold their toes to the fire to make sure they deliver. We are nearly there. It is a very important document that has been awaited a long time.

I do not doubt that she is working very hard to see a policy produced but we have heard this for a very long time. In 2019 I tabled a motion in the Dáil. By comparison, in Scotland we see the population of the islands rising. We see a policy underpinned by legislation and proper resourcing. Here we have promises. I know the Minister has inherited this but we have promises. In the meantime, 70% of the population of the Gaeltacht islands is made up of Irish speakers. There has been a serious reduction in population over the time that various Governments have ignored them. Over and over, the island communities have told us they do not want charity. They have shown us how to have a resilient life. What they want is a co-ordinated plan with proper resources. I understand Deputy Kerrane has tabled a question on the LEADER programme. This directly affects the policy on the islands.

The final draft will be submitted to me by the end of the year. We are very close to the end of the year and I want that draft. With regard to the next steps after that, I hope, if I am still here, to take the draft to a Cabinet committee early in the new year and then to the Government. What is most important is that we have a strong policy at the end of the process. It will be the first island policy in 26 years. It is important that we get it right. I have shown my commitment to the islands. I was the first Minister for Social Protection for many years to increase the island allowance. That was in my first budget in the Department. In Donegal there is a long-running issue with regard to the roads on the islands. I worked with the island community and Donegal County Council. We have the investment there. The roads have been transformed. I was on Arranmore during the summer at the annual AGM of Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann. There is positivity among the island community. I want to work with it. I appreciate the urgency of getting the policy sorted and up and running.

What I hear is the Minister telling me she will have the draft plan. The draft plan was there in October. It remains a draft almost three months later. I presume the Minister has not seen it yet and it has not landed on her desk. She is giving a commitment that it will be published. I would like this clarified. When will the action plan be published? There has never been a policy for the islands. There have been interdepartmental committees and any amount of reports. When I tabled the motion in the Dáil I had them all before me on the day. I emphasise that I do not doubt the commitment of the Minister but we need action. We need a policy. In the meantime decisions are being made on LEADER funding about which the island representatives are most unhappy. They were certainly not positive in the audiovisual Room when they made a presentation there six weeks ago.

I will address the issue on LEADER in response to a later question. No islander is putting us under pressure to get this done. What they are putting us under pressure for is a policy document with actions that will deliver and make a difference to their lives. This is what they tell us. I will get the draft submitted to me by the end of the year. The next step will be that I go through it because I have to make sure that I am happy with it. Much work has gone into it. What is most important is that there are policies and actions to underpin how the policies will be delivered. Every Department must buy-in and commit. It is across Government and we have put a large amount of work into working with officials from other Departments. When they say they will do something in various areas, whether housing, which I know is a big issue on the islands, education or health services, I want them to be very clear on what they have to do so we can hold them to account and make sure they deliver.

I welcome the decision of the Minister working with the county council. The former Bank of Ireland branch will be occupied by a new and, I hope, expanded library for the community. It is badly needed. I ask the Minister to expand on this.

The Department is responsible for policy on public libraries. The provision of library services, including the provision of library buildings, is primarily a matter for local authorities in their capacity as library authorities under the Local Government Act 2001. Accordingly, the development of a new public library in Dunleer is, first and foremost, a matter for Louth County Council. I understand that Louth County Council has been exploring options for the improvement of library services in Dunleer as a result of increased usage and membership. However, no specific proposals in this regard have been received by the Department from the council. All buildings used for the provision of public library services are required to comply with the requirements of the Department's public library standards and benchmarks, including the requirement that the minimum size for a new branch serving a population of 3,000 within the catchment area should be at least 500 sq. m, and that new public library branches should be centrally and prominently located and offer a multifunctional meeting, event and study space. All proposals for new public libraries are also required to be progressed through the Department's four-stage capital management process.My Department is working with the Local Government Management Agency's library and development unit to finalise a new strategy for the development of our public libraries. It is also planned to launch a new libraries capital plan next year. In that context, my Department looks forward to engaging with Louth County Council on this. The Deputy will, of course, be delighted because this is a matter he has raised with me on several occasions. One of the buildings announced yesterday was an old bank building in Dunleer, which my Department provided funding for the local authority to purchase. I do not see any reason why that would not be a perfect building in due course. It may require extra work and probably needs to be made bigger but I am sure the Deputy will be talking to Louth County Council about that.

The Department's policy of using vacant buildings in small rural towns, such as Dunleer, a growing rural town, will make a significant difference and show increasing confidence in the community. They already have a library service in what was the old railway station. Hopefully, when they move out of there and into the new library, which I appreciate will take some time, we will have a new railway station in Dunleer, a town that is rapidly expanding. There was further news there in relation to land owned by the local authority that may be used for additional housing. Dunleer is a vibrant community and its sustainable energy community would be directly opposite in the new market house. Eugene Conlan is an active community leader there. The whole community is very happy with this proposal. By working with people like Martin Naughton, who is a great supporter of community development in County Louth and Dunleer in particular, we could have a fantastic library in Dunleer and a new railway station. I know the latter is not the Minister's responsibility but I will be pushing for that later.

Funding under the measure is for the purchase of derelict and vacant buildings. That money is only for the purchase of buildings, but if Louth County Council decides to develop the building into a library - the Deputy knows better than I do as he has raised this with me on several occasions - the council will need to make it a bit bigger. The door will be open in my Department in terms of supporting the council through the libraries fund, which amounts to approximately €29 million and supports 17 projects, the My Open Library initiative and a smaller-scale capital works programme.

It is through local authorities and Departments working together and bringing on board the community that they will restore vibrancy and dynamism to villages and towns that had lost it in the past. The Minister's Department has been particularly active in looking after smaller towns with a population under 10,000. This is a good start to a new Dunleer. The need for the new railway station, which may be under the remit of a different Department, is absolutely essential. The fact that the library will be leaving its current building will, therefore, provide a vacant space for more modern commuter use into the future.

To my knowledge, there was only one extension to the original CLÁR programme, which occurred in 2006 and was based on the 2002 census. The Minister will be aware from my correspondence with the Department and parliamentary questions I have tabled that I have been calling for an extension to the programme. At what stage is the consultation process at in relation to a possible extension to this very important programme, particularly for small rural communities?

The CLÁR programme provides funding for small-scale projects in designated rural areas that have experienced significant levels of depopulation over a defined period. Since the programme was relaunched in 2016, it has supported a wide range of measures. The CLÁR 2022 programme was launched in February this year and I am delighted to say that the overall amount awarded under all measures of the 2022 programme was a record €12.2 million with 292 projects being supported. A review of CLÁR areas nationally was undertaken in 2021 using the 2016 census of population data. The review examined the most recent changes in population patterns throughout the country on the basis of the 2016 data. It also examined the approach to developing the existing CLÁR designations, which is based on 2002 data, and considered how changes in population since then impacted on designations. It is clear from the review that many areas have seen population growth in the relevant period rather than decline and, indeed, the most recent census data published by the Central Statistics Office point to population growth across all counties since 2016. The details of the review are being considered by my Department before any decisions are made on areas that are designated as eligible for CLÁR.

I know from speaking to my colleague, Deputy Ó Cuív, the architect of the original CLÁR programme, that population decline was the main measurement in identifying areas at that time. It was always his opinion, and that of others involved in drafting the programme, that as the programme developed and brought investment to areas, other criteria should also be factored into the assessment of areas under consideration for inclusion. The Minister will be aware that, thankfully, there has been population growth in our constituency, particularly in County Cavan, continuously since the early 1990s, and in Monaghan. There has also been great growth in employment as well as population. We suffered a decline in our population for far too many decades and, thankfully, we now have the reverse. Along with population growth, there are also additional pressures on local amenities and social infrastructure. Both the Minister and I have received representation from different communities and are aware that where a school, such as a small rural primary school, has developed and the population has grown, there in an increase in demand for services. Such schools cannot avail of assistance towards the development of a playground etc. In areas where there has been a welcome growth in population, there should still be other criteria attached to the assessment of areas under consideration for inclusion in CLÁR.

The Deputy has been on to me about different projects. Kilnaleck recently received €50,000 for the upgrade of the playground and St. Anne's National School's parents' association got €45,000 to build a multi-use games area, MUGA. Lavey Community Group got €50,000 to provide wheelchair access. The Brackley Lake Geopark Amenity Area, with which the Deputy will be extremely familiar, received €50,000, and Ballymachugh GAA and Sheelin Park, another community the Deputy will know, got €23,000 for an astro turf carpark.The grants are small, as the Deputy and I are aware, but they are very important to these communities. The grants are simple enough to get in that one applies to the local authority which assesses the application and sends it on to my Department for us to work on it. Cavan town, Clonervy, Moynehall and Ballyhaise are the only areas not included in CLÁR-----

We know when groups get public funding, it enables them to raise funding through their own fundraising initiatives. As well as being an important financial contribution, it is a great encouragement to groups. The Minister mentioned Clonervy which is the Castletara-Ballyhaise area. That is one area with a small enough population. It could not avail of assistance towards the development of a school playground. Thus, it is one of the areas I wish to see different criteria being brought in with regard to assessment of areas that may be included in the CLÁR programme in the future.

We did a review and we found the population had actually increased, which is good to see, but it is also important to say there are other funding streams from my Department. The Deputy will be very familiar with the community centres investment fund and the good support communities are getting from it because only last week we made the announcement. Some €33 million has been invested in the upgrade and development of 270 community centres nationwide. I know the Deputy was very anxious a number of those community centres be supported. I was glad we were in a position to support a number of the centres the Deputy had mentioned. We continue to keep all of these things under review.

I am happy to confirm that preparations are now well advanced for the implementation of the new LEADER programme for the period 2023 to 2027. As these preparations have progressed, the Department has engaged on an ongoing basis with the representatives from the stakeholder organisations on the design of the new programme. This process has included direct engagement with representatives working with island communities. The new LEADER programme will continue to be based, in the main, on areas aligned with county boundaries. However, it is important note that I am very well aware of the views of the island communities on LEADER and of the important and beneficial role LEADER can play on the islands. With this in mind, I have introduced a number of new requirements for the groups that will deliver the new LEADER programme on the islands to ensure the voice of Island communities is heard and plays an important role in the next LEADER programme. I can assure the Deputy that the important contribution island communities make to rural and island development has been taken into consideration in the design of the new LEADER programme and I am confident LEADER can continue to make a real contribution to island communities in the years to come.

One only has to look at the spending on LEADER and the difference it made to the development of the islands when there was a specific local action group, LAG, in the period 2007 to 2013. More than €527,000 was spent on Mayo islands in that period compared to €129,000 in the last round of LEADER. If one looks at the Galway islands, it is very stark, in that €1.5 million was spent in the period where they had their own LAG versus €197,000 of expenditure in the last round of LEADER. That is a decline of €1.3 million, which is considerable money and has a considerable impact on the islands. It is extraordinary that in the 1990s, 30 years ago, Comhdháil Oileáin na hÉireann was recognised as a LEADER company but we have fallen back so far. This is completely in contradiction to the new islands policy and I ask the Minister to look at this again.

I understand the Minister said she has engaged with the islands but the reality is she has not listened to them. The islanders have been very clear about this. It is a totally different situation for islands. My colleague, Deputy Kerrane, outlined how the funding has drastically decreased for the islands but the situation of islanders is not being taken into consideration either. The administration of LEADER on the islands cannot be done correctly unless there is proper funding in place because, of course, people having to travel overnight to the islands increases the burden as well.

I am not sure why the question was not grouped but that is the privilege of the Department. I hear the Minister telling me that she listened to the islanders. When I visited a packed AV room meeting, they told me that for 38 years the islands have been fighting to be recognised as a subregional area and socioeconomic development specific to the offshore islands and so on. They tell us there is no basis in EU rules or regulations for precluding the Irish islands from being recognised as a subregional group. Tá siad ag streachailt ar feadh 40 bliain chun an t-aitheantas seo a bhaint amach. They have specifically asked for the recognition as a subregional group. I welcome the Minister having listened and made some changes but that is not what they have asked for. It is especially important if we are serious about a new plan for the islands that will ensure their continuation in a sustainable way.

A dedicated island LAG is not included in the model for the new LEADER programme. However, I am aware island communities have particular needs and priorities and the LEADER programme can play a key role here in the context of the emerging national islands policy. In recognition of this, a number of important elements are included in the new LEADER model. Any group selected to deliver LEADER in an area that includes island communities will be required to include representatives of the island communities in the decision-making process of the LAG, including our LEADER strategy, specific actions to cater for the challenges faced by island communities developed in consultation with the communities and indicative budgets in their LEADER strategy for the implementation of such actions. We have listened and taken on board concerns. This is a good arrangement that will benefit the islands because they will have a specific role in LEADER groups.

My Department's mission is to promote rural and community development and to support vibrant, inclusive and sustainable communities throughout Ireland. My Department's social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is our country's primary social inclusion programme. The current programme began on 1 January 2018 and will run until the end of 2023. The programme provides funding to tackle poverty and social exclusion at a local level through local engagement and partnerships between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations and public sector agencies. SICAP is managed at a local level by 33 local community development committees with support from local authorities. It is implemented nationally by 46 local development companies. I was delighted to secure an increase of €1.3 million under budget 2023, increasing the annual funding to €44.3 million. Additionally, €10 million is being provided under SICAP from budget 2023 to allow local development companies to continue to support arrivals from Ukraine. My Department also funds a range of other programmes that target those most in need, including the empowering communities programme, the community development pilot programme and the place-based leadership programme, all of which seek to address the toughest challenges experienced in disadvantaged areas. Another measure in this vein is the new funding rate allocation model for the community services programme, CSP, currently being introduced. CSP organisations that are operating in areas of high disadvantage, employing individuals from the prescribed programme target groups, will benefit from the higher funding rate category. A range of other programmes in my Department focus on social exclusion. We support the public participation networks, PPNs, nationally. One of the three pillars under that is the social inclusion pillar. My other Department has a roadmap for social inclusion too. I will not talk too much about that. The main aim of that is to have increased incomes and improved public services. We have the senior alert scheme. A number of organisations under the scheme to support national organisations in the voluntary sector, SSNO, work in the area too. Under the Dormant Accounts Fund, which we published last month, €54 million was granted to 44 projects across all Departments in that area. I note the Deputy's core question is on the slightly different matter of energy costs, which I will pick up on in the supplementary answer.

They recently outlined how they feel they will end up having to withdraw many supports because they will run out of funding later next year. They are facing higher operating, energy and fuel costs, and many more costs. I acknowledge the community support fund and the social inclusion and community activation programme, as well as the new community and voluntary energy support scheme. They are welcome. However, there are gaps. Some community groups are slipping through those gaps. A building might be owned by an education and training board. There might be a number of other reasons. Funding is being released in a number of tranches for these schemes. Will groups that have not got funding be carried forward? Will the Minister of State modify the scheme so that groups which have been disqualified or are unable to get funding will be eligible for it in later rounds and be supported in that way? I understand that not all applications to the community and voluntary energy support scheme were granted. The social inclusion and community activation programme funding was allocated as part of budget 2023, so it will not become available until later next year. Is there a way to advance that into the early part of the year? Many of these groups will have, and have already, suffered from those inflated energy costs.

I will try my best in the time I have to assure the Deputy that we have constructed two different models in our Department to try to capture everyone with regard to energy costs. The Deputy mentioned the community and voluntary energy support scheme. We have reopened that as of Tuesday and tweaked it because there were groups that we were not catching. The Deputy might check in on the eligibility for that. There were some organisations that had a large number of community halls. For example, a Catholic diocese might have had 70 or 80 halls in an area. The system was not set up adequately to capture all of them in an efficient way so we tweaked that. It has been reopened until 20 January. There are other groups which we are keeping an eye on. We want to hear who is falling between the cracks. The support scheme that is being run through the local community development committees is aimed at capturing smaller groups which may not have legal status but which do good work and pay bills. Depending on the programme and organisation, another Government Department might have the most relevant energy support scheme. I keep thinking of IRD Duhallow. It is the engine in Deputy Moynihan's area when it comes to much of the social inclusion work and I commend it. While I mentioned the increased SICAP allocation for 2023, the allocation for this year was 10%, which is the largest increase in allocation that SICAP has ever got. I secured it in last year's budget. I would like to hear if there are funding issues with SICAP. It should be adequately funded for this year. There are issues in using up some of the allocation for this year in other areas. If the Deputy can give me detail on who is falling through the cracks, we would like to hear it because we want to make sure that we capture everyone who is dealing with increased costs.

It is vital that those different community groups can be funded. I acknowledge that the Minister of State is taking lessons from that earlier round and possibly making improvements on the more recent ones. I asked about SICAP under budget 2023, which would not be expected to be spent for some months yet. Can that be advanced so it is ready to release to groups at the earliest possible time?

I would be interested to hear where the issues were with SICAP allocation because there was a large increase last year.

We have allocated €362,000 to Cork County Council. I am not sure what stage the county council is at in opening that. It should be soon if it is not open already. People should be able to submit applications to that. I ask the Deputy to let us know if anyone has fallen through the cracks. The community and voluntary energy support scheme is something we had not done before. We did not know who or how many would apply for it. We were open to tweaking it and have done so. We thought we were catching everyone but I ask the Deputy to let me know if someone has fallen through the cracks.

Key to this is the establishment of the national implementation office to assist in the delivery and implementation of the policy and to co-ordinate stakeholder engagement at a national level. This office is also responsible for supporting town regeneration officers in driving the implementation of the policy at a county level. The national implementation office has now been established and the head of the office appointed. Similarly, local authorities around the country are in the process of appointing town regeneration officers who will drive the development of town centre first plans at local level. Central to the town centre first approach is the range of support funding in place and this includes the Department's town and village renewal scheme. Indeed, the Minister yesterday announced over €27 million in approvals under the scheme. This was in addition to the €115 million announced in November for 23 regeneration projects across rural towns under the Department's rural regeneration and development fund. These projects focus on combatting vacancy and dereliction by regenerating iconic town centre buildings such as old hotels, banks, schools and courthouses and are thus central to the town centre first approach. The new oversight and advisory group for town centre first policy is also due to meet for the first time next week to ensure there is clear stakeholder visibility on the implementation of the policy. The Department remains committed to ensuring the continued roll out of the town centre first policy will work to deliver on the goal of revitalising rural towns and villages, as set out in Our Rural Future.

Those town regeneration officers are going to the critical to the roll-out of this policy and will have a key role in ensuring all actions are implemented. Due to their being based in their own areas through the local authorities, they will have good knowledge of the situation on the ground and the towns in question. Is there a timeline for having all those officers in place and appointed? On the Croí Cónaithe scheme, it was raised with me last week that you cannot get the €30,000 or €50,000 granted from this fund until the end of works. Would it be possible to look at that and perhaps at the possibility of providing that funding in stages? I do not know of too many builders, especially in rural areas, who would have that level of money up front to assist somebody who owns a property, or has bought one.

I will give an update. We want the regeneration officers appointed as soon as possible. The money has been allocated so the authorities need to do this as soon as possible. We have nine appointed and three are expected to be in place early in the new year as well, but there are still a few to appoint. I will have to liaise with the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage on Croí Cónaithe as it is not our scheme. I acknowledge it is envisaged the plans will cover the importance of place-making, town centre living and the social and economic purpose of the town. They should respond to emerging opportunities, such as those linked to remote working, climate action and digitalisation. The plans will also be central to addressing vacancy and dereliction. In addition to developing the plan, the funding can be used to cover any underlying analysis that may be undertaken to inform the development of the plan, capacity-building required locally for the town team or the initial delivery of some small interventions in the town, where the budget allows. This is the €100,000 allocation the 26 towns have got. The Deputy will be aware there were some in her constituency, namely Strokestown and Gort, I believe.

This is an important policy, especially for towns in rural areas that really suffered after the 2008 crash and throughout that period. In many cases they are yet to recover from that. There is much vacancy and dereliction across many rural towns and I have no doubt this policy, once implemented fully, will make a difference but putting those regeneration officers in place and ensuring they are there as soon as possible will be key to that. On the Croí Cónaithe towns fund, I appreciate it is under the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, but it is mentioned in the policy. I was surprised because if one is looking at putting a €30,000 grant into a building, it would be unusual for a local builder, especially those in rural areas, to have that level of money to put in while the homeowner is waiting on the grant and will not get it until the end. I thought that was unusual and that giving the grant in stages should be looked at. The builder who is doing the work should obviously be verified, but I suggest it be looked at

The point is taken. I will take it back to the Minister. We in the Department are part of an oversight group together with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, the Local Government Management Agency, LGMA, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications, Irish Water, the Irish Local Development Network, ILDN, Irish Rural Link, Chambers Ireland and there is a local enterprise office representative and the National Transport Authority, NTA, as well. We are all around the table and can bring issues like that up where it is ostensibly the role of one Department but really it impacts policy as a whole. It is important we maintain pressure on the local authority to recruit the regeneration officers as soon as possible because we need them on the ground as soon as possible.

The town and village renewal scheme aims to assist with the rejuvenation of rural towns and villages throughout Ireland, making them more attractive places to live, work and visit. In line with the commitment in Our Rural Future, the 2022 scheme prioritised the renovation of derelict and vacant buildings in our town centres with a view to bringing them back into use. Since it was first introduced in 2016 over €149 million has been allocated to more than 1,600 projects across Ireland. It has supported a range of activities, from improving public realm areas to initiatives such as the development of enterprise hubs and remote working facilities. These projects have been identified and developed by local community groups and businesses in conjunction with their local authorities. Each year the priorities for the scheme are reviewed and revised as appropriate by my Department. This year priority was given to projects that brought vacant and derelict buildings and sites back into use as multipurpose spaces to make our town and village centres more vibrant and attractive places to live and work. I was delighted to announce details of allocations worth €27 million under the scheme yesterday. This incorporates a wide range of locally-driven projects that will breathe new life into towns and villages across rural Ireland. Full details of all the approved projects are available on my Department's website.

I certainly want to thank her for this week's announcement. In her reply she mentioned vacancy and dereliction and how the Government is prioritising the scourge this represents in many communities, towns and villages. It is important to note the amount of funding - €149 million - going in to support these types of projects. That demonstrates the Government's commitment to addressing this. I welcome the funding for villages such as Balla, which has received €120,000 for the redevelopment of its courthouse building. That will provide an enormous benefit to the locality as a community and enterprise hub. Projects like this will brings jobs into rural towns like Balla, which is very welcome. I hope we can continue to bring this funding into rural communities and villages.

I was delighted to visit Balla. The Deputy brought me there and I saw exactly what people are trying to do with the redevelopment of that space. That is what the town and village renewal scheme is about. As I continue to say, it is about engaging with communities and helping them realise their vision for their areas. It is the ground-up approach that makes the difference because the people in Balla know exactly what they want. They are volunteers. I met them and we had a lovely chat. They have done so much there and the refurbishment of this old building will make such a difference to their plans for the town.I was pleased to make that announcement. I know the Deputy is keen that that project, among a number of others in Mayo, such the €100,000 for the market square enhancement in Claremorris, be supported. As a local Deputy, he knows the benefit this sort of investment brings to our towns and villages.

It was a very positive visit in terms of the work that is happening on the ground with community organisations and the local authority in addressing dereliction and vacancy and bringing new life back into rural communities. There was another huge announcement in Belmullet, with more than €500,000 for the redevelopment of Canal House. Community parks are also central so people can have amenities on their doorstep when they want access to them. The Department has certainly stepped up in this area by providing the platform for communities to access essential funding that will enhance their quality of life, and bring people back living, working and enjoying that quality of life in rural areas. I compliment the Minister and the work she has done over the last number of months and years on this. I look forward to hopefully working her on this in the new year.

It has been very successful in 2022. I will be considering its continuation in 2023 but no decisions will be made until the priorities for 2023 are decided on. The building acquisition measure has helped many towns across the country. We need to move with the times. Times are changing. These buildings are no longer being used for their original purpose, which means we can repurpose them for 21st-century use. We need to embrace new technology, IT and all the opportunities they present us. We are absolutely committed to remote working and facilitating enterprise creation in towns and villages because it brings the footfall back in. It means there are more people there and that is what brings economic activity.

I did not think I would, given the time restrictions. I will go back to the funding for the islands and recognising the islands as one subregional area. The Minister said she has had interaction with the islands and has brought changes but the islands have asked for that recognition. When the Minister brought in those changes, which I resume are positive, what interaction did she have with the island representatives? She should bear in mind that we had a packed AV room in November where they told us how important this recognition was.

The offshore islands will continue to be included with their relevant county for the delivery of the LEADER programme. While an island-specific area is not provided for under the new LEADER programme, any group delivering the new LEADER programme in an area that includes islands will be required to include specific provisions such as island-specific actions with a ring-fenced budget and dedicated representation from the island community as part of the decision-making body. I have introduced these new requirements in recognition of the particular needs and priorities of island communities, and in light of the important role LEADER can continue to play in delivering real benefits for island communities. I am also satisfied that these new requirements will ensure island communities will have a direct and meaningful involvement in the delivery of LEADER on the islands. The expressions of interest stage to select the groups to deliver the next LEADER programme is now open, with a closing date for receipt of applications of 16 December. I encourage all interested parties to now submit their proposals to ensure we can continue to build on over 30 years of successful LEADER delivery across rural Ireland.

What interaction did she have on those changes with the representatives of the islands? Is she telling me they are happy with those changes and have abandoned their campaign to be recognised as a subregional area? This is very important. During the presentation in the AV room, the representatives pointed out that they had been looking for this recognition for almost 40 years. The funding was upped for a specific period and then went backwards. They pointed out that islands are specifically mentioned as a separate entity in the European Green Deal, the just transition fund, the clean energy for the EU islands policy, the Memorandum of Split, the structural funds and so on, and Articles 174 and 349 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union. The message they are giving us is that there are no obstacles to recognition from a European point of view in relation. The obstacle is due to the mentality here and the bureaucratic decision made to exclude them.

Department representatives met with the chair and the CEO of Comhar na nOileán on 25 October. There has been engagement between my officials and the islanders. I am particularly conscious of the needs of islands. I outlined this earlier. There are specific requirements whereby, where islands are included in the grouping, they will have an important role to play. There is no island-specific local action group, LAG, but we are developing the islands strategy, as we discussed earlier. I am satisfied that the needs of the islands will be taken into account and will be delivered upon as part of this structure we are proposing.

My difficulty is that during the presentation in the AV room, the islanders told us it was absolutely essential to have the recognition as a subregional area and that alignment with the counties does not suit the sustainability of the islands. It is as simple as that. The interaction the Minister had was prior to this presentation. They made their views known in November and they have made them known to all of my colleagues and all the Deputies here. I ask the Minister to please not persist with this structure of funding. It is not to the benefit of the islands. There is no EU barrier. The barrier is somewhere in the minds here. It is bureaucratic. The Minister said the policy for the islands will be in her hands before the end of December and published next year. She might give me a date for that. It has to be funded properly. If the islands are not recognised as an entity, the funding is not fit for purpose. I am sorry but I have to disagree with the Minister on this.

In 2016, the European Parliament adopted a resolution on the special situation of islands. Through EU policy, islands are to be treated as distinct territories. That seems to be totally against what the Minister and the Department have decided with regard to LEADER. Why can the islands not be dealt with as one subregion, as recommended by EU policy? We saw the impact when there were county-wide budgets. There was minimal delivery for the islands. Some counties ring-fenced funding and one county made no allocation and ring-fenced no funding at all. There were no island-specific actions during that period of 2014 to 2022 through LEADER, despite the major challenges islands face. When those islanders came into the AV room, they acknowledged those important elements, as the Minister called them, but said they were not enough.

Ní hamháin go ndeir siad siúd é ach tá na grúpaí atá ag dáileadh amach LEADER faoi láthair ag rá go bhfuil siad sásta an obair sin a thabhairt go LAG ar leith do na hoileáin.

Alignment with the counties benefits some islands and there is no doubt about that. I was in Árainn Mhór and the communities there benefited not only from a roads programme but also from development under rural regeneration funding that came through, and was driven by, the local authority in Donegal. There is a fabulous theatre on the shore. That would not have happened without Donegal County Council driving the project forward and making it happen. Certain stakeholders, but not all, have expressed a preference that the new LEADER programme would include a dedicated LAG for island communities. A dedicated LAG is not included in the model for the new LEADER programme. As I have said, island communities have particular needs and priorities and the LEADER programme can play a role in the context of the emerging national islands policy. The new structure we are looking at will include representatives of the island communities in the decision-making process of the LAG, which is an improvement. The LEADER strategy will include specific actions to cater for the challenges faced by island communities. LEADER is only one part of the jigsaw. There are many other funding sources. I want to see the islands benefit from that and I am happy to work with them to ensure they get their fair share of investment from my Department.

I also bring to the attention of other organisations that may not qualify under CVESS that Limerick City and County Council would have received an allocation of approximately €250,000, which will be run through the local community development committees, LCDCs. That money will be available for smaller community groups. We hope that by reopening the CVESS and the community support scheme through the LCDCs, we will have captured everyone. If groups are falling between the cracks, we would like to know about it. Pobal is the main stop for the CVESS and we have tweaked it to make it more doable for individual organisations that would have a large amount of facilities across a county. When it was introduced, the scheme was not efficient enough for them, but now that we have tweaked the administrative process and reopened the scheme for applications until 20 January, it should make it more doable for people to apply.

It will be published. I heard some Deputies say we could have debated the plan this week. I would have preferred to do that but we will have plenty of time. There will be time over the Christmas break for Deputies to be able to read what is quite a long document. I hope to have an extensive debate in the new year, which would be just as appropriate if not more so. It will give us time to consider and listen to some of the views of the Opposition. The Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 significantly strengthened the legally binding framework for climate governance in Ireland. It requires delivery of successful climate action plans and long-term climate strategies supported by a system of carbon budgeting and sector emissions ceilings. The introduction and adoption of these budgets and ceilings this year has set out a clear pathway for meeting our carbon budgets and Ireland's commitment to a 51% reduction in emissions by 2030. Those ceilings will be reflected in the next climate action plan which, as I said, is due to be published next week. It is the first action plan to be developed under the provisions of the 2021 Act. Therefore, the plan will reflect the specific requirements of that Act, to include policies, measures and actions for each sector to ensure compliance with our sectoral emissions ceilings and on the pathway to net zero emissions by not later than 2050. I will point to what I see as some of the highlights of the plan while noting it still must be agreed by the Government and, therefore, remains provisional. It will show a significant scaling up of our ambition and in the delivery of new renewable powers. The war in Ukraine and the high price of fossil fuel gas at the moment is going to drive that, but the plan is going to set out a scale of delivery in that respect that is like nothing we have seen before. We will have to continue with, and double down on, the measures that promote energy efficiency to ensure we use such energy wisely. In transport, there is significant change away from just looking to improve the electric vehicle fleet towards reducing transport demand and shifting to public transport. In agriculture, the plan will promote significant diversification to new ways of earning income and getting work for farming communities, which will help to reduce emissions and move away from a reliance on dairy and beef as our main agricultural outputs. The plan also has applications in respect of the development of the circular economy, which is an industrial application issue. That is another area that will have responsibilities. Those are the core areas where the plan will set out new measures.

We and others in the Opposition have been critical about the approach the Government has taken, particularly in respect of the design of schemes. Many of the retrofitting and electric vehicle schemes are unfair because they are inaccessible to many people. At root, it is clear we are on the wrong trajectory. The Energy in Ireland report stated that, last year, emissions increased by 5.4% instead of reducing by 4.8%.The same is likely if not worse this year. This places a huge challenge on meeting next year's target. Including the upcoming climate action plan when does the Minister believe our first carbon budget will be exhausted? Will it be exhausted next year or in 2024? Will the climate action plan deliver the type of step change that is needed? We need corrective action at this stage to get back on track because we are so far off it.

Our targets are not set on a per capita basis, they are fixed quantum so when an additional 70,000 people come into the country, and in fact there are far more if we include migrant workers and others coming, as well as natural population increase, it presents huge challenges. I believe we can do it. There were significant increases last year due largely to transport and agriculture. Transport is coming back because of post-Covid-19 activity and agriculture because of growth in the dairy herd primarily. To be honest it is uncertain. I look forward to the final figure from SEAI. There are slightly different statistics. The Central Statistics Office, CSO, came out the other day with an assessment of a reduction in transport overall use. We will review those SEAI figures. This work has advanced and developed the modelling capability in the State. We are working collectively on that. We can and will meet the targets and the budgets. More than anything else it requires political commitment. There is no shortage of it on this side. However, much of what feeds into this is in local government and in future Governments to make sure we deliver on what has been set out.

I have heard that a few times from the Minister. Deputy Ryan is the Minister with responsibility to deliver on this and he said we are going to meet our budgets. We are not going to meet our first carbon budget. It is very clear that we are not. I am not saying that in order to score political points. Of course there is a need for significant movement in local government. We know that in regard to delivery of active travel. However, there needs to be a recognition that the Government’s approach is not delivering. It is a challenge and the Minister does not have to accept everything that the Opposition says in regard to the design of schemes but it is clear, as the SEAI said yesterday that there was an increase of 17.3% in electricity generation because we are heavily reliant on coal, oil and gas. We support the Minister on delivery of renewables. We want to see that happen. That is why I have a question later on which will deal with that. When will the first carbon budget be exhausted? That is a straight question. I would like a straight answer to it. I do not doubt the Minister's own commitment to this but I severely doubt his Government's commitment to delivery. We cannot get from the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage to the Committee on Environment and Climate Action. It is very serious. I do not accept that there is a Government commitment to deliver on these budgets. I think they will be missed. There needs to be an acknowledgement of that.

I use the word "can". It is not certain. It will require incredible change, a scale of change that nobody really understands yet in the political system. Work being done here is on the basis of real, detailed modelling of what is actually happening in our country and what would happen if we took certain steps. If we look at that SEAI press release and what it says about what we need to do to get back on track, and we need to come back on track, those are the broad measures that are included in the climate action plan. It is based on a realistic assessment of what is happening throughout the country and what could happen. It is not certain. Nothing is certain in this world. It is changing very quickly. We are going to give it our absolute best shot. The best shot is set out within the climate action plan. I am absolutely committed to doing everything I can to make it happen. Nobody should underestimate the scale of the challenge. The challenge of transport, just to pick one, involves the reallocation of space. When I go around the country to all the councils to ask what they are going to do to deliver that, it is not easy. More than anything else it will require political commitment in this House and at local government level to take some brave, ambitious decisions which will benefit this country. It is not certain but we can do it.

Our country is heartbroken this morning. More will be said about that later but I join with the Minister in his condolences with the family of the lost soldier. Will the Minister make a statement on the ways in which the ongoing review in energy security will integrate sectoral emissions ceiling and carbon budget obligations, his plans to ensure that as-demand reduction measures are prioritised in the review, and the ways in which the principles of a just transition will be integrated into the review?

The review is considering the risks to both natural gas and electricity supplies and a range of measures required to address these risks. This includes the need for additional capacity of indigenous renewable energy and also the need to import energy, energy storage, fuel diversification and renewable gases such as hydrogen. The review set out a range of options for consideration and demand side response necessary as part of those options. For example, the gas mitigation package includes gas storage, renewable gas, green hydrogen and demand side response. Similarly, the electricity mitigation package includes demand side management and batteries. The consultation document has also highlighted that the most secure energy is the energy that we do not use and therefore, energy efficiency should always form part of our response to energy security. As part of the review my Department carried out a consultation seeking views from interested parties on policy measures that could be implemented to support Ireland's security of supply framework. The consultation closed on Friday, 28 October and over 400 responses have been received. My Department is now working through these responses carefully. The completion of the review will be a key priority for Government. Insofar as just transition is concerned Climate Action Plan 2021, which will be replicated in the one due to be published next week, sets out a just transition framework to guide our approach to implementing our climate action policies. It is to be a central component of everything we do in this time of change to make sure that it delivers social justice, ecological justice as well as energy security.

We are particularly concerned to see this concession made by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Agricultural methane emissions from livestock account for 95% of Ireland's methane emissions overall. Methane emissions from livestock have increased in recent years, not reduced. The briefing document stated the pledge to cut methane emissions allows for individual countries to pledge lower amounts. What is the Minister's view of these briefing documents prepared for the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue, and do they speak for the Government?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	93	I saw the reports in The Business Post but I have not read the full briefing documents. The issue of methane is somewhat separate to the energy security issue. It relates primarily to our climate targets and the need to reduce those short-lived greenhouse gases. We are committed within the European Union, in the wider global context, to deliver on that 30% methane reduction. I attended a meeting of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition in COP27 in Egypt. The Climate and Clean Air Coalition is the United Nations body charged with organising and delivering those targets in regard to reducing short-lived greenhouse gases. There was a clear understanding there that the first immediate priority is particularly in the area of fossil methane because the solutions can come very quickly and can actually save a lot of money. The leakage of gas from pipelines and the flaring of gas from the well-head is a huge source of such methane emissions which can be reduced very quickly.That is the immediate focus. It was agreed there. We are very much involved and we have a member on the board of the Climate and Clean Air Coalition. We are very supportive and we are funding the work that is going to be done to show how land-use methane emissions can also be reduced. This is complicated because it includes, for example, rice growing, which would be a major source of methane emissions, and while we could change the practice, we do not want to risk food security. Ireland will have to reduce its methane from agriculture as well, and that is recognised within our climate plans. I believe it is increasingly recognised within the agriculture sector that we cannot just continue to ignore those rising emissions which we saw last year from agriculture. Methane, as well as nitrous oxide and carbon dioxide from other elements of agriculture, will have to be reduced in line with our overall plan.

We would have liked to have seen a commitment closer to a 30% reduction. The lower ceiling which is in place instead was accepted on the basis that it could not be exceeded. However, going by this report in the newspaper at the weekend, no credible pathway has been established by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to achieve the less ambitious commitment it made. Is it not concerning for the Minister not just that the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine clearly is not on board but, potentially, the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine is not on board?

As evidence, the new agri-climate rural environment scheme, ACRES, the new mechanism to try to improve the environmental performance of farming, is massively oversubscribed. If we look at farm visits at the moment in the organic sector, there are huge numbers coming in because they realise the high emissions alternative is increasingly expensive. Yes, I would have liked a higher target of 30% in agriculture, but we work with people and work with the agricultural sector and the farming community. Pointing the finger, blaming and shaming them, and saying they are the problem will not get us very far. What we need to do is ask for their help and make sure the change that is coming is good for Irish farming, for young people and for family farms in particular. It is less intensive, less industrial, with less emissions but with better income and better outcomes for Irish farming. It is more stable and secure and is not dependent on big global markets, where the big processing companies, whether in beef or dairy, are the ones who make all the money, which is characteristic of the system we have seen develop in recent years. I think agriculture is ready to play its part and we will work with it to make this happen.

I am particularly interested in the area of gas storage and the emergency backup that is due for delivery next year. With regard to the scheduled capacity that is due to come on stream, I understand there is a challenge in delivering that.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	97	I referred to the energy security review in an earlier response, so I might immediately respond to the Deputy’s questions in his verbal presentation. With regard to backup generation, which is critical, we have all been watching this in the past week, when our wind power was very low because of the high pressure across north-west Europe. With the very cold conditions, there has been very high demand for electricity and, obviously, we have been very tight in terms of availability. I am glad to say our system has held up in probably the most challenging conditions and, in the coldest, darkest part of the year with the calmest conditions, we were able to provide power. Nothing is guaranteed through the rest of this winter and we could lose plant or have other circumstances, and interconnection with the UK might be tricky because France and the UK have similar problems. However, I am glad we are managing through the immediate very cold period. We will introduce a further 245 MW of procurement of emergency power. Work is ongoing on that in North Wall and Huntstown, which is the second location, to deliver that next autumn. Work contracts have also been signed. I was very appreciative this House agreed the legislation which will allow us also to purchase a further 450 MW of backup generation just for use in the last eventuality, if other plants are not available. Again, contracts are signed. The critical timeline to deliver it will be on the planning side with regard to whether it is delayed or how quickly we can get it through the planning system. There is also ongoing work on the T-3 auctions and T-4 auctions, which will deliver further backup. We need gas-fired power generation to provide backup in periods like this when wind is very low. Critically, this will allow us to turn away from coal and oil, which have the highest emissions and which is the reason our emissions are so high at the moment. It is one of the biggest problems we have and we need to switch those off. The generation coming out of those T-3 and T-4 auctions are now our first priority and we need to deliver the majority of those. We can and will deliver that. I will come back to the Deputy on the storage piece in the second part of my reply.

There is the storage piece and there was also a question mark over the viability of projects that were to be delivered next year and in the years ahead, related to the January auction by EirGrid. The last time we spoke here, the Minister said the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, was looking at it. I ask for an update as to whether those projects are going to be delivered.

I would be interested to hear the Sinn Féin view on storage. I do not know if Sinn Féin was one of the 400 consultees in terms of which type to use. There are a variety of options. There is the option, which is coming back into view, of looking at the Kinsale gasfield, which had been used as a storage facility in the closing years of its operation and which has the right geological characteristics to be able to do that. We would have to put in a larger wellhead and, obviously, there would have to be a build-up because while it has existing cushion gas, it would need a further layer or volume of that. That is now being looked at by some people as one viable option. I had a very good meeting with Gas Networks Ireland, which would have views on what is possible. In the work I have seen it do, it has cited examples in the US where there can be significant onshore storage facilities that will provide some of the flexibility and backup we need. Others are arguing for commercial locations and various types of LNG facilities. We will need storage, and we need it for security reasons as well as flexibility reasons. Picking the right one for the State's interest is what will be key. I look forward to hearing the Sinn Féin view in that regard.

If we are saying Kinsale might be an option, it is important it is State-owned and non-commercial to avoid the potential of lock-in and, importantly, to ensure it is transferable to zero emissions gas or hydrogen, as appropriate. We will support the Government if that is the direction of travel of the Government, and we think it needs to happen at pace. With regard to the generation capacity that is to be delivered next year, there was a question mark over this. Will it be delivered? Has the CRU delivered a judgment or when will it do so in regard to the index-linking or financial viability of those projects?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	101	The decision on that index-linking issue relates to the T-3 and T-4 auctions, which will not come next year, and it is in 2024 and 2025 when that generation was always expected to come. The generation that is due next year is the emergency procurement and emergency purchasing, which is done to close the gap from the failure of the auction back in 2019 to deliver a similar quantity of about 700 MW of power. As I said, I am very confident now that, on procurement, the first transfer of 250 MW will be delivered next year and the 450 MW additional is on track, but the key constraint in regard to how quickly that happens will be the planning system.In that, or through the legislation we have passed here, we have given a clear direction to An Bord Pleanála and mechanisms to accelerate the planning and to ensure that happens. In reality, that is probably the biggest challenge. We are meeting EirGrid and CRU to assist as part of our ongoing reviews of the delivery of that. We need all three, the emergency procurement, the purchasing, and, critically, the T-3 and T-4 auction supplies, which will come in later years, in 2024 and 2025.

It is a devastating thing to happen for those families. Will the Minister provide an update on all carbon reductions achieved as a direct result of implemented targets in the Climate Action Plan 2021?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	103	The Climate Action Plan 2021, which was published in November 2021, set out a detailed roadmap for meeting our climate ambition under the Climate Action and Low Carbon Development (Amendment) Act 2021 and included indicative ranges of emission reductions for each sector of the economy. The update for this year will follow on from the ambition set out in that and will reflect a strengthened climate governance framework. Recent EPA reports have indicated that, as we have emerged from Covid-19, our national emissions have begun to increase again, by 4.7% last year, as some sectors have recovered. This has followed an overall decrease of 3.6% in 2020. The increase in total emissions in the past year has been driven by the use of coal and oil for electricity generation, as we have just discussed, as well as increases in both the agriculture and transport sectors. The recently approved sectoral emissions ceilings set out a framework for meeting our carbon budgets and our commitment to the 50% reduction in emissions by 2030. These will be reflected in the climate action plan due to be published next week. Examples of where there have been reductions and where measures have actually been delivering in the past year are where we connected 700 MW of renewable power so far this year. That is a record year and we have never connected as much. What is really interesting is we are starting to see new sources such as solar power, which have been delivered through this auction process. That renewables capacity is critical to meeting our climate reduction targets. A second example would be peatland restoration. To date, 10,511 ha have been rehabilitated across 35 bogs. That has delivered an emissions reduction of 68,000 tonnes of CO2 and will continue to do so each and every year because that is a permanent reduction process. That is 10,500 ha out of the 33,000 ha we have committed to do. As the Deputy would know, there are also great benefits in biodiversity as well as carbon benefits, together with benefit in just transition where some of the same people who have been employed and have skills in extracting turf have now been redeployed with other skills. A third example would be the national retrofit plan, which was published last year. We are on target to what we said this year. A total of 27,000 houses have been upgraded with an estimated 33,000 tonnes in carbon savings, together with 131 GW hours in energy savings. Real change is happening and we are on track to do what we said we would do in retrofitting and renewables and in the rehabilitation of bogland. We need to do far more and to multiply the delivery but we are delivering.

I have great concerns. I have said repeatedly that I very much want the Minister to succeed in government because we need him to do so. I have worked in this sector for 20 to 30 years and I am becoming increasingly downhearted by the fact that I do not believe this Government will meet the targets or achieve what needs to happen. My biggest fear at this moment is that the Minister does not recognise that, that he thinks everything is still on track and, as he said earlier on, that he is slowly turning the ship around. Our emissions went up last year. We have the second highest emissions per capita in Europe and this Government has not met a single one of its targets yet. The Government talks about retrofitting 27,000 homes. How many of those homes will be retrofitted to B2 standard? The Minister's target is for 500,000 houses at B2 standard in six to seven years’ time. I do not have faith that is going to happen. I wish that was not the case. I have the annexe to the Climate Action Plan 2021. There are 493 actions on 250 pages, yet 166 delayed measures were still not done by November of this year, and the Minister’s Department has failed to action 41% of its own actions on time. The Government is very good at producing documents, proposals, plans and coming out with very big headline statements, but delivering is where the Government is falling down. Where is the Government actually delivering and what changes is the Government going to make in the new climate action plan that reflect the reality that emissions have gone up and there have been delays in meeting targets?

The Deputy is correct in that no one should be in any way complacent or have a false optimism, because the challenge and scale of the changes is so large and they will not be easy to deliver. We do not give up. Resilience is part of what we need in this whole climate approach. There are three real restrictions which are holding us back. One is in planning. We all know our planning system is not functioning or delivering for either the environment or for the development of our country, and that is why we are introducing significant legislative changes to make that work better. The second is our people. Our economy is at absolute full throttle and is growing 8% a year. It is very difficult to get many of the people we need. Bus drivers alone, if I can give one example, are a constraint in respect of the switch to public transport. The availability of bus drivers is our biggest problem. We are pointing in the right direction and there are actions taking place. We have 8,000 apprenticeships, which is the biggest number ever, going into retrofitting and other industries to help us make it happen. It takes time but we are addressing the obstacles. The biggest obstacle still is politics, to be honest. There are Deputies in this House, and I would not doubt any of those present, about whose commitment on this issue I would wonder. We all know we can go around the country to every council and into any debate here in this House, and when it comes to the actual changes we need to make, the real political consensus, sense of urgency and hard decisions are still politically difficult. That is one of the things we have to change.

People and communities need to understand, and the Minister needs to help them make the changes they need to make. The Social Democrats have sent a proposal in respect of solar to the Minister, and I will keep on talking about it because it will reduce people’s household energy demand by 40%. For some reason, the Government is not funding or doing this. That is a big gap in what the Minister is doing. The Minister talks about the 700 MW of renewable power. That is very welcome, but how many hundreds of megawatts of emergency generation has the Minister allocated and granted this year to coal and gas-fired generation because he has allowed data centres to continue at pace with the pressures they have put on our energy grid? The Minister cannot look at these issues separately and there must be a holistic approach. All arms of Government need to be working on this. I fear the Minister is not being given the support from his colleagues in this. A whole-of-government approach is needed.

That is as much renewable energy as we have ever developed in the past 20 years just in solar energy in the next three years, and this gives the scale of change. What makes me think we can actually do that? First, we are seeing those renewable auction systems, and there is a series of them. We learn as we go through each one, refining and changing them. Indexation could be one example of where we might adjust and change.I am confident that a very significant proportion - I cannot remember the exact figure but at least half - of the solar we need is already on-stream and coming through that auction process. We need to change and go further, including looking at the concept around private wires in order that industry might be able to self-generate at scale to provide some of the back-up power we need and, significantly, deliver that quickly within the next three years. We also need to change the rules on farming to allow up to 6 MW of solar power to be delivered outside the auction process in order that we do not get caught up in all the complexities of that. Every school in this country in the next three years will use the carbon fund to install solar panels. I could go on. These are real measures that will make a real difference to us meeting what is an incredibly ambitious target. That is what we are doing. That is what is happening on the ground in reality.

What actions has the Department taken to accelerate the delivery of offshore wind energy to ensure that Ireland meets the target of 7 GW by 2030?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	111	As Ireland's maritime area is seven times the size of its landmass, and our location is at the edge of the Atlantic, I am critically aware that the potential for offshore renewable energy in Ireland is enormous. The offshore wind delivery task force is central to realising this potential and to meeting our targets. The goal of this task force is to accelerate and drive delivery of offshore wind by public bodies. To achieve this, it is developing a single system-wide plan, bringing together the work ongoing across Government to deliver on our offshore wind ambitions. This includes matters relating to supply chain, ports policy, skills and workforce, and regulatory consenting. I intend to bring this system-wide plan to Government for approval in early 2023. With respect to work under way in my Department to accelerate delivery of offshore wind, the Government recently approved the terms and conditions for the first offshore wind auction under the renewable electricity support scheme. This is expected to provide a route to market for at least 2.5 GW of offshore renewable energy, ORE. This auction will take place in the first half of 2023. Furthermore, in advance of the establishment of the Maritime Area Regulatory Authority, MARA, in early 2023, I have the legal authority to assess maritime area consent, MAC, applications from a set of prequalified ORE projects. Initial decisions on the first MACs have been issued, with legal documentation now being finalised, which will allow successful projects to apply for planning permission from An Bord Pleanála. We are on the verge of starting this first auction process through issuing the MACs and then allowing the companies go into this auction process, which was set out last month. Central to this will be the designation by the Minister of State at the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Noonan, of special protection areas, SPAs, and special areas of conservation, SACs. This will allow us to get the environmental planning of this right in order that we can go into the planning process by the middle of next year, and get projects through that process in timelines that will allow us to deliver power in 2025-26 or to start building power plants in that timeframe.

They are on a theme, which is the Opposition trying to push the Government in a direction I believe the Minister wants to go. I will say again, however, that I am not convinced that members of the Government are entirely in tune regarding it. A number of these issues are cross-departmental. From talking to those in the sector, there are two major concerns in the area of planning. The targets now being talked about are for 2035 instead of 2030. The Minister recognises that. That is happening, as I see it. A major, immediate concern relates to ports and planning. There is a concern in the planning sector that MARA will not happen in time and that An Bord Pleanála, or whatever the structure will be to clear applications, is not adequately resourced. Is this a major priority for the Minister? What is being done in respect of it?

The Deputy is right to focus on planning constraints being the real obstacle but An Bord Pleanála is now being resourced with the key expertise it needs in that section. A special unit and team of people are being assembled, with the maritime, ecology and marine planning skills that are needed. That will be aligned with the establishment of MARA, which will be done on time. We got that legislation through the House in time to be able to introduce that body next year, when it will take over the running of that consenting format. There is also the wider legislation that the Government considered the other day, which related to overall improvement of our planning system, the development of marine protected areas and, as I cited, the Minister of State, Deputy Noonan's work on the SPAs and the SACs, which is probably the most critical issue we need to get right. Everyone is agreed that this is the first priority in the economic development of the State, as well as in our climate plans. We will deliver it by 2030 and not beyond.

Does the Minister have the detail of the staffing complement for that unit? How many are employed there in position? Will this unit have a unique focus on offshore wind and renewable projects? My understanding is that they will also be responsible for active travel projects and other projects not related to the delivery of offshore wind. Will their time and focus be diluted? Ports are a major pinch point. How will they be prioritised in the year ahead?

Fair enough. That legislation was critical and key. The Deputy is right in that I do not have the full detail on how many new people An Bord Pleanála has taken on. My view is we will have to massively increase the staffing of An Bord Pleanála and not just on the marine planning side. In the areas of transport, energy and housing, I see An Bord Pleanála resourcing as the greatest constraint on delivering what our people need. We will see reform of An Bord Pleanála in that it will be massively scaled up, not just through the numbers of positions we have seen advertised to date but with far greater resources that will be needed, because that resourcing constraint is the biggest obstacle and block to delivery of housing, transport, energy and water infrastructure. That has to change.

The targets are particularly challenging because of increasing electricity demand, including demand from data centres, and the electrification of heat and transport. Our principal tools to ensure our emissions are on track is to use renewable electricity to power our grid and to ensure demand growth is sustainable, flexible and consistent with the legally binding ceiling. We are already producing more than 40% of our electricity from renewable sources and we need to increase this to 80% by 2030 to meet our sectoral emission ceilings. The Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU, has determined in its November 2021 direction that new data centre connections offers must be based on them having adequate on-site dispatchable generation or storage or both as back-up.In July of this year, the Government published a new statement on the role of data centres in Ireland's enterprise strategy. The statement addresses sustainable data centre development to align with Ireland's renewable energy targets, security of supply, sectoral emissions and climate priorities. The policy is clear that islanded data centre developments, that is, developments not connected to the electricity grid and powered mainly by on-site fossil fuel generation, would not be in line with national policy. The forthcoming climate action plan will set out a comprehensive pathway for the decarbonisation of our electricity sector in line with the sectoral emission ceilings. While I am not referring to the Deputy himself, a large number of Deputies in this House seem to believe that all our woes and all our ills in respect of meeting our climate targets are down to the development of data centres. Ensuring that demand and supply match and that everything forms part of a decarbonised future is a real issue but we can do it. We will need and want data centres in our country because they are a central part of our economic strategy and security. However, they must be part of a plan for decarbonisation and, in my mind, they want to be. The companies behind these data centres are going to have to work with the Government, as I believe they will, to ensure we keep the economic strength that comes with data centres while not missing climate targets or seeing an impact on our energy security.

If all of these projects are completed, the power demand capacity will triple. The disorganised nature of this rapid growth in the sector is problematic for our climate ambitions and for families who are worried about the lights and heat going off this cold and dark winter. The Government needs to institute a moratorium on new connections until it gets to grips with what is happening. Those making these proposals have been labelled as too drastic but power outages and climate chaos are drastic outcomes. It is not just those on the Opposition benches who have been raising these concerns. We hear it privately from Government representatives as well. Indeed, a Government backbencher was making these very same points on national radio during the week.

If contracts are breached, what can the Government be trusted to do in any other circumstances? Such breaches end up costing far more because people price in the risk associated with not being able to trust those who do not abide by contracts. It is therefore in our interests, as a State, to be honest and to abide by contracts we willingly enter into. That is not to say that we do not work with industry and tell it that it must be play its part in helping us meet decarbonisation targets. That is a key part of most companies' commitments, especially in light of the new accounting rules coming in. We will have to manage this. There will be an expansion. New data centres are already contracted for. There will be an increase. Additional capacity of 80 MW has been required each year for the last three years. The increase is likely to continue along those lines, although reducing somewhat in later years. That is what is expected in the medium term. That does not stop us from working with companies to ensure that their back-up power can help us to create a secure network, to ensure that this power comes from low or zero-carbon sources rather than failing to help us meet our carbon targets and to manage demand and choose locations in a way that helps us to balance energy security and climate considerations. We are working with the companies to make sure that is what happens.

Despite this, we continue to prepare to build new gas-fuelled electricity generation plants. Even if all future data centres were to run on renewable energy, it would leave shortages of clean energy for other sectors. Gas is wrongly being peddled as a silver-bullet transition fuel. As the Minister knows, the effect of carbon emissions is cumulative. Is it not fair to say that we are locking in this infrastructure without a national plan?

It is not just about data centres. There is a whole range of areas in which Gas Networks Ireland must be told to stop expansion. These include the delivery of gas to new homes and new data centres because it will only cost us later as we will have to take that infrastructure out. We have made it clear to Gas Networks Ireland that this is not where we are going under Government strategy. We are going to move towards very large-scale deployment of renewable energy. That will not be easy but I believe we can deliver it. That will give us a more stable fuel source for data centres at a lower cost while emitting less carbon. Electricity is the primary source of energy for the heating, cooling and power systems these data centres need for their operation. I will again refer to a meeting I attended at COP27 in Egypt with the largest of these new data centre companies. That company said that it was going to switch to measuring carbon associated with delivery hour by hour rather than just buying up renewable power supply. It recognises that it must ensure its operations move towards zero carbon hour by hour and we are going to work with that company on this. As a country, we can provide that capability through our renewables system, through grid management, which we are good at, and through energy management and balancing capability. We have every reason to help companies with delivering on this. This industry will not be gas-fired into the future. It will have to be zero carbon.

Many of us awoke with horror at the news that has come from Lebanon. I express my sincere condolences and sympathies to the bereaved family of the soldier who died and to those who were injured this morning. Unfortunately, there is a connection to our local area. I wish the individual well and hope for his speedy recovery, which we are praying for. My question is on the national development plan, our carbon targets and capital projects contained within the plan. With the Galway ring road, we all saw what can happen with new road projects when these things are not brought into consideration. Will the Department of Transport carry out an audit to see whether all projects can be completed while complying with the targets set by this Government in the Climate Action Plan 2021? Will the Minister indicate what the ramifications and impact of those targets will be?
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	127	The Climate Action Plan 2021 set out policies, measures and actions to support the achievement of Ireland's legally-binding emissions reduction targets for 2030 and 2050. The 2021 plan was a cross-departmental effort with inputs and commitments from a range of Departments and State agencies. It provided indicative ranges of emissions reductions required for each sector of the economy to reach our 2030 target while also setting out the actions needed to deliver these targets. A review of the national development plan, NDP, was undertaken by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in October 2021 and an assessment was provided on the contribution that Exchequer-funded capital spending in the NDP will make to seven climate and environmental outcomes, namely, climate mitigation, climate adaptation, water quality, air quality, waste and circular economy, nature and biodiversity and the just transition. Priority investment programmes included in the NDP were assessed on the above environmental outcomes and given a score of +3 to +1 if the estimated impact was positive, 0 if it was neutral and -1 to -3 if negative. Departments were initially asked to self-assess their programmes based on the criteria above and those scores were reviewed by a panel of experts across the public sector. It was not the role of the NDP review to set out a specific blueprint for the achievement of the climate action plan actions nor is it the role of my Department to undertake an audit on the capital infrastructure projects contained within the NDP. Rather, Departments in receipt of the capital investment allocations are directly responsible for developing a detailed suite of policies and measures to maximise the impact of this planned investment in delivering actions and achieving targets detailed in the climate action plan, including staying within the sectoral emissions ceilings agreed by the Government last July. Furthermore, in bringing forward proposals for consideration, Departments must set out for the Government the climate impact of those proposals.

I am not necessarily coming here with a wrecking ball, but the State has put everything into the national development plan that we intend to build in all facets of infrastructure. It must, though, consider other plans put forward by the Government. My great concern is that, if we look at the calculations for the capital development of new projects around the emissions of those projects, I understand the Department of Transport and the agencies within it would be tasked to the 2018 emissions levels. If we look at those levels, they will show us very quickly that not much was going on in terms of major capital development projects in infrastructure in 2018. I refer to projects at an advanced stage and where a great deal of heavy activity was under way. Building public transport and roads involves the use of a significant amount of machinery and manpower, from a mechanical and emissions perspective. It would be worthy to look at this aspect, because we need to know if these targets are realistic.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	129	The targets are based on science, in respect of what was agreed in Paris in 2015, as well on what has been further agreed on by science since. If we do not, as an example of a developed country, halve our emissions this decade and get to net zero by 2050, then we risk going over certain tipping points where climate change will become a runaway phenomenon. It is impossible to know exactly where these tipping points are and the choice made in the context of the Paris agreement of the 1.5°C target, to not allow the global average temperature increase to go above that level, gives us not the certainty but the probability that we may avoid this runaway scenario. This is, though, based on the targets set. Even with all the challenges that come with this, especially in a country with a growing population, a rapidly growing economy and the emissions that come from some of the solutions, as the Deputy said, in the context of building a railway system, which involves emissions in its own right, we must still make this change. We have committed to it our national law but we have also seen this being committed to in European law. We are not going to go to the EU and ask it to count Ireland out of this green transition. Equally, if the Deputy were to look at many of the large industrial players in his own constituency, the big foreign direct, FDI, investment companies in east Cork, these are also committing to this climate target. They will want to work with countries and governments similarly committed. We do not, therefore, have an option. We must go for this. It is hugely challenging but it is the right thing to do.

It is a bit ironic that the national development plan has projects in it that are being brought to court and then subsequently being blocked because of our climate action targets. What has happened in Galway has created a precedent that will impact other areas of the country if the planning process is not done right. I know there is an error within the documentation from a planning perspective, but I have come here with a valid point. All I am asking is that some degree of an audit is carried out in this regard. I say this because, effectively, if we want to build new public transport infrastructure, as well as roads, we must also acknowledge the fact that the 2018 targets in respect of capital development of new infrastructure is so low that it is very difficult to give the State agencies that must carry out this work the space they need to do it. I know exactly how important it is that we tackle our climate emissions target. I am just making the point to the Minister, however, that the new limits in place now are prohibitive when it comes to putting in new public transport infrastructure and roads. I ask the Minister to please take this point on board.

We also have read newspaper reports in recent weeks that a similar appraisal tool is to be used now for the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. Is a body of work under way at Government level to develop appraisal tools to ensure decision-making in that context is climate-proofed, emissions-proofed and climate-aligned?

The case does relate to environmental issues. It is important, though, that projects in the plan should be pushed forward. If there need to be special settings of courts or special courts to deal with issues concerning environmental and other climate change issues, then these should be set up urgently. The people of Ardee are faced every day with huge heavy goods vehicles, HGVs, polluting the atmosphere around people as they are walking up and down the town, going about their business, to and from schools, doing their shopping, etc. This is not good enough. I am not blaming the Minister personally, but we must have significant action from the Government to ensure there is a finite time for all these legal actions by having quick and due process in the courts.

I hope I was not lecturing the Deputy but when he asked whether the targets were feasible, from my perspective it is important for us all to understand that while these targets are extremely challenging, the question is whether it is feasible for us to let this go and to take this risk. I do not think it is. This, then, forces us to be challenged and to reach these targets. In terms of doing so, we must constantly review what we are doing in the context of the climate action plan. To answer the question from Deputy O'Rourke, as well, this will include a rethink of how we appraise projects. We must do this, and we are already doing it. The national investment framework for transport in Ireland, NIFTI, is a new way of looking at investment policy that knits in with our climate targets. We do need new appraisal structures, as the IDA has, in transport and every other sector to ensure we meet these targets. Turning to the query from Deputy O'Dowd, the planning legislation the Government considered this week includes measures, such as new environmental courts, which will help to improve our planning system and consideration of environmental issues. We cannot, however, ignore this aspect. This is why An Bord Pleanála, correctly and independently, to my mind, made its decision that it could not ignore, or that it had ignored, this aspect. I must be careful here because it is a legal context and I do not wish to say much more. The board recognised, though, that the climate must be considered. Much of this will happen at local authority level, such as in Galway. A new metropolitan transport strategy must be developed there next year and it must have climate as its core, or else it will fall at the first hurdle. Every local authority must develop climate plans next year to ensure it is in tune with what we are doing. As I keep saying regarding the scale of this undertaking, no one yet understands the impact it is going to have, but ignoring it or not doing it is not an option.

Earlier, I read out some of the analysis of what has happened in recent years. The increase last year in our transport, agriculture and power generation emissions makes it harder. Every year we see emissions continuing to increase makes the scale of the change required on the other side of the equation all the greater. I believe, however, that we can do this for a variety of reasons. First, this is going to be good for our country. Let us take agriculture as one example. To meet the reductions necessary in this area, which are much lower than in other sectors, the action to be taken will largely be about providing new income streams to farmers in agroforestry. I do not know what the Deputy's expectation is, but I think the Government's new programme for forestry will take off. I think there will be huge demand for something new and innovative in the areas of riparian and other agroforestry schemes, because they pay and are achievable and deliverable. This is an example where this approach is better. I am just taking agriculture as one sector now, and the switch to anaerobic digestion gives us energy security, provides a new income stream for farmers and it is a known technology. It is not impossible. This is being done all over Europe.Why can we not do it here? I am absolutely convinced we can. Our diversification into the likes of tillage or other markets would give us a more stable and secure agricultural system, particularly for the north and west of the country. The country is divided agriculturally very much into the north west and the south east with different characteristics, different climates and different soils, with one dairying and more intensive and one less so. For the north and west, there is significant potential here to turn it into an income stream by going genuinely orange and green and marketing ourselves. However, to be able to market it, one must do it. The worst crime here would be to greenwash - to say we are green but not in practice. It is deliverable. My sense is - I do not know what Deputy Ó Cuív's is - that most of the people who I meet around the country buy into it, want to play their part and do not want to leave their children with the planet destroyed. If we can show them the way, which is not a punitive or a shaming way but a better way, we can make the leap, but it is a leap.

On the real big wins, of the ones that have the real opportunity to change everything, the one outstanding one, of course, is renewable energy from the ocean, whether it is wind, wave or tidal. I wonder how quick are we progressing towards harnessing that enormous resource of energy which could not only energise this country but could provide Europe with a lot of energy. Could the Minister tell me, in terms of forced policy on planning and on the environment, how quickly we are progressing and what is his expectation in relation to wind energy? Will we achieve what we set out to achieve by 2030 in terms of renewable generation of major sources of power?

However, this is not simply about replacement of income for landowners and farmers, etc. It is also about food production. In a world where there is a scarcity of food where millions of people are dying of starvation, we may well find ourselves in the not-too-distant future facing a serious food shortage. It is not only about one issue of replacement of income. It is about a number of issues. We need to take as much action as can be taken on the alternatives, maximise them, and try to keep our food production and keep our independence. There are those who say that it cannot be done. It can be done with the help of science.

It is not only offshore wind. We also have to develop further onshore wind. Many State companies, such as Coillte and Bord na Móna, have considerable potential to do that if our planning system can free up and deliver some of the projects that are stuck in planning. Solar and offshore wind will be a significant part. The offshore wind is in three phases. We are now starting the first phase. As we speak, consents are starting to be issues, the auction process is starting and it is going to planning next year. We have to develop ports for the deployment of that. We have been appraised of that, in terms of connecting it together. There are about five megawatts of projects to go to their first auction. They will not all get through for a variety of different reasons but we expect a significant element to do so. The second phase will probably be broken into two or three phases, with further development in the Irish Sea in the south east. This will be very much connecting into the grid, because that is the biggest constraint. The power grid is a real challenge. That is next year. We will start to set out, map and develop those and start the consenting. Quickly afterwards, in the lifetime of this Government, we will start in looking south and west and going towards both floating and conversion to hydrogen.

In truth, the big power is to the west and north west, if one looks at where the resource is - where the really strong winds are - and where our largest sea area is. Critical to that is getting the environmental conditions right and, therefore, one designates marine area protections and special protection areas, SPAs. Bird life is the critical constraint. We have done a lot of work. Deputy Ó Cuív will be familiar with High Island in Connemara. Over the years, we have done an assessment of how the Manx shearwaters and other birds go out into the Atlantic, what their feeding patterns are, etc. We can use some of that historical data to make sure we match the areas where we put the turbines with good ecological restoration. That is one of the key things we need to do. We will do all that in the remaining lifetime of this Government, so that we will begin to see the turbines coming and set in train a process that will not stop where that power powers our country and powers part of Europe too because we have a surplus. That is why this is an economic opportunity.

When the Minister goes for the big winds, he will wind up with an energy surplus. The Minister has a target in the climate action plan of 1 million electric vehicles, EVs, by the end of the decade. At the rate of progress to date, is that likely to be achieved? The second part of the question relates to hydrogen. The Minister, quite rightly, mentioned hydrogen because that could be a transportable type of energy and used for energising heavy goods vehicles, railway vehicles, etc. Will we achieve the 1 million EVs by the end of the decade? When will we start producing hydrogen at scale on this island?

On the sale of EVs, although I cannot remember the exact percentage, roughly one in five new cars is plug-in electric or plug-in hybrid. Everything I see with the car companies shows that they are all switching because of better cars, maintenance is lower, and running costs are lower. That target is the one that is most achievable. I cannot remember the exact figure. It is less than 1 million. That is not the key target. The emissions issue is key. If we only replaced all the cars we have currently with electric cars, we would also have a remaining problem, which is the congestion problem that comes with that.

It is not only about switching one car for the other. It is about reducing the demand for travel by the likes of remote working and other mechanisms, and not everyone having to drive to Dublin or to move to the big city. For example, our towns being revived would be a way that we could reduce the emissions and reduce the demand for travel. In regard to hydrogen, there is already hydrogen being used in many industries, but at a small scale. The deployment of it for new and additional sources is starting across Europe. It is at early stages. It is usually on industrial sites, such as refineries and heavy industrial use where they have hydrogen in their fuel mix. That will be in the next two to three years. The large-scale deployment of hydrogen, and our use of it as a way of storing some of the wind power we have, is towards the end of this decade and, more significantly, into the next decade. This Government has decided to set aside 2 GW of the new power offshore we have for such so-called "power-to-X" solutions as a way of saying we want to be in this new industrial revolution, we want to be good at it and we will do it as we are developing the offshore industry.

For domestic installations, solar PV is installed on new homes, as one of the measures to achieve compliance with Part L of the building regulations. They are also installed on existing buildings through grant supports offered by Government, through the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland, SEAI.The microgeneration support scheme approved by the Government last December set a target of supporting more than 380 MW of new microgeneration capacity. This amounts to more than 60,000 homes and 9,000 non-domestic installations, including small businesses, schools and community groups. With the success of the scheme to date these targets are expected to be increased under the forthcoming climate action plan in 2023. Since the introduction of the microgeneration support scheme domestic solar PV grant earlier this year, the SEAI has seen application levels increase significantly month on month. It is expected that applications will exceed 15,000 by year end, with more than 8,500 supported. To put this in context, the SEAI supported 4,000 applications for solar PV last year under the previous iteration of the scheme. It has more than doubled in one year. For 2023, the SEAI is expecting to support more than 12,500 homes and more than 1,000 small businesses and community organisations. While the overall level of interest in the grant schemes indicates that the microgeneration support scheme is working well, its operation and effectiveness will be kept under review and adjustments made where necessary. A new solar PV scheme for vulnerable customers registered as being dependent on electrically powered assistive devices is also being finalised with stakeholders by the SEAI which will operate the scheme. This €20 million scheme is targeted to provide direct support to more than 3,000 vulnerable customers who may have limited opportunity to reduce their demand. The scheme will provide customers with a 2 KW solar PV system with a hot water diverter in order to meet some of their electricity and hot water requirements. The increased target of 5 GW of installed solar power capacity will be addressed through a combination of increased microgeneration, small scale generation and renewable electricity support scheme connections in the coming years.

We can all agree there is great potential and appetite for solar power, particularly for residences, businesses and farm buildings. There is a barrier at residential level and we can see it in the design of the scheme. From the large number of applications we can see there is demand. I believe the demand goes beyond the scheme, and it needs to do so to reach 5 GW. Cost is a significant barrier for people. Sinn Féin has proposed tiered support. At present the upper level of support is €2,400. A decent system could cost in the region of €8,000. Is the Minister looking at increasing financial supports, tailored financial supports or tiered financial support to expand the audience for residential solar power?

The first is the workforce. The people installing it say there is not a shortage of demand but a shortage of skilled workers. These workers will come. I mentioned the apprenticeships the Minister, Deputy Harris, is delivering at scale. These will start to address this. This is the first big constraint. Installing solar PV is difficult to do as every house is slightly different and we need to see whether it has the right system, whether it is working and whether the right equipment is in the house. The second obstacle is that for scaling up we need aggregation, whereby 50 or 100 houses would be done at a time. There are people doing this. Recently I was in Lahinch in County Clare where voluntary local community groups are aggregating the delivery. This is the best way to reduce the cost. It needs further work from the SEAI and others so it becomes a community issue and an entire road is done at the same time. This, more than increasing the grant, would be the way to reduce the price and get as many houses as possible done. Aggregation and the workforce are the two issues we need to develop.

We have seen in other schemes where many of the 500,000 B2 rated premises are the relatively warm homes of relatively wealthy people who can afford solar. They get solar PV installed, it takes the building up to a B2 rating and one of the 500,000 target premises is met. We need to look at those who are living in energy poverty or at risk of energy poverty and ask how many of them are getting solar PV. If aggregation is the solution well and good. Will the Minister keep a clear eye on where the works are being done? The Minister mentioned private wires as a key enabler. This is something on which there is agreement across the political spectrum. Like a number of things, it seems to be taking far longer than it should. When will legislation or regulation be introduced to address this?

It is reported the Minister recently said he would seek to ban oil burners in 2025. I am not aware of this being in the programme for Government but I am aware of a concerted effort by that industry to encourage the conversion of oil burners to accommodate hydrotreated vegetable oil, HVO. This is a transition fuel that has the impact of reducing emissions by 85% over a ten-year period. It would be advisable and I encourage the Government to look favourably on this commitment as a means by which homes can transition and retrofit at a scale that is not akin to the €40,000, €50,000 or €60,000 that many cannot afford. These are certain stages of improvement that need to be considered, allowed and catered for. I encourage the Government not to put any barrier in front of such a proposal.

On the coldest nights of the year, they cannot benefit from the €200 electricity payment. I have asked the Minister to look at this. Perhaps he can answer the question now. It is unacceptable that the poorest people in the coldest dwellings or in caravans cannot benefit from the payment. It is unacceptable on these appallingly cold nights. I dread what might happen to some of the older vulnerable people among them.

I will come back to him. To respond to Deputy Cowen, it was interesting to meet some solid fuel supply companies yesterday and hear them state they are interested in developing low carbon alternatives for use in solid fuel heating systems. They see this as a big opportunity to develop a new market. There is an issue with regard to HVO because it will be in a lot of demand. It is a waste product that has real value. I am sure the Deputy Cowen would be the first to agree the aviation sector, which is of critical economic importance to the State, has its eye on it as a sustainable aviation fuel, as does the land transport industry in which it is used to increase the blend of low carbon fuels. Transport is probably the most difficult sector. There is no alternative for truckers in haulage vehicles. There are no easy alternatives. We need some of the material for this sector rather than for domestic heating for which we can turn to other alternatives. To respond to Deputy O'Rourke, we will have to do a variety of things differently. For years we have not allowed people to sell back power to the grid and now we are. For years we had planning restrictions for solar power. This has also changed. For 20 years I have heard arguments here and in meetings as to why we could not have private wires. We need to start to do this now because this is the scale of the change we need to make. It is not only private wires for industry. It is also looking at hybrid interconnections where there might be a wind farm with a good grid connection. Could we use solar power in the surrounding area or nearby area to make best use of it? Wind and solar power often complement each other. On a cold day, such as today, when there is no wind, we would get quite good solar output even at a dark time of the year.We are going to have to do so much. It might just be a line in the climate plan that people think does not say much, but there are several key lines in the plan that have real legal strength behind them now. We are changing direction in a variety of ways in this regard and the solar revolution will be central to this.

NBI has advised that 15,711 premises in Cork are passed by the NBP high-speed fibre broadband network and are available for immediate connection. Some 11,196 premises were passed in Cork in 2022 to date and 4,091 premises in Cork have been connected to date with 2,989 of those connected in 2022. Strategic connection points, SCPs, are a key element of the NBP providing high-speed broadband in every county in advance of the roll-out of the fibre to the home network. As of 2 December 2022, a total of 823 SCP sites, including 280 broadband connection points, BCPs, which are publicly accessible sites, and 543 schools, have been installed and the high-speed broadband service will be switched on in these locations through service provider contracts managed by the Department of Rural and Community Development for BCPs and the Department of Education for school SCPs. Further details are available on the NBI website. In County Cork, 24 BCPs have been installed to date, of which two were installed in 2022, and 85 school BCPs have been installed to date for educational access, of which 55 schools were installed in 2022.

I am coming across a lot of problems in County Cork where there are properties that Eir has the capacity to connect, but is not allowed to because they are in the amber area. Has there been any progress with Eir on that issue? For example, in one case the pole that provides the connection is at the entrance to a farm yard. The farm house could not be connected, yet a house 200 yards down the road could be connected. Four other houses in the area could not be connected because they were within the amber area. What engagement has there been with Eir? We could connect a huge number of additional houses in a very short timeframe. The infrastructure is there but because properties are in the amber area, Eir is not allowed to connect them.

I do not have this data to hand but the final schools to be connected across the entire country are to be completed by June 2023. The next question was on the number of homes that Eir will not connect, because they are in the intervention area, or is "not allowed to" connect as the Deputy said. Eir can connect a home anywhere in Ireland if it wants to. The provider is not excluded from providing broadband in rural areas and it does so in many cases, and we have double fibre connections going into homes where it is easy for Eir to do so. Therefore, Eir is not prevented from doing that. Let us consider a person on the border of intervention and non-intervention areas. I understand that people on the edge of the area may feel frustrated if they do not have broadband but the person next door has. In the same way, the person next door may be in County Tipperary and you may be in County Cork and you cannot play for the other person's team. That is the nature of deployment areas. The next question was on how engagement with Eir works. I meet with Eir extremely regularly. I met with representatives this and last week. I am constantly meeting with all the industry players, including NBI and, in fact, with every broadband company and mobile operator in the country. Deputy Ó Cuív asked where we are on targets. We met the target for this year two months ahead of schedule. We had a target of 102,000 that was to be met by the end of January 2023 but was met by 1 December 2022. It is a seven-year project that started in 2020 and will be complete by the end of 2026. It has doubled the deployment speed this year compared to last year, in other words the number of homes being passed. It will complete on time and according to budget.

I understand when a property is in the amber area, Eir will not engage.

It is because it has to compete with a State-subsidised provider. National Broadband Ireland has to provide 25 years of fibre broadband to people for the same price in a rural area as it would cost them in an urban area and we have State-aid approval from the EU to do that because of the market failure in those areas. It can be difficult for commercial suppliers to compete in such areas because they are competing against a provider that is State subsidised. It does occur particularly at the edges of urban area that is just as easy for commercial suppliers, such as Eir, Virgin Media, or SIRO, to deploy fibre. There are two options then for the customer which is great as they have double approval. I would need to engage further with the Deputy to understand better exactly what is the issue. I regularly meet with all the players in the industry and I am happy to talk the Deputy. We also have the mobile phone and broadband task force, which meets will all parts of the Government, local authorities, the Department of Rural and Community Development etc. I am happy to meet with the Deputy to try to better understand the issue.

A Defence Forces medical officer and chaplain are currently at the hospital. There will be a full investigation into this fatal incident and this evening the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is in New York, will meet with the UN Secretary General to discuss the sad loss of our Irish serviceman and the inquiry to follow. The Taoiseach, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, and the Chief of Staff have said the Defence Forces will do everything to provide care and support to the bereaved families and those of the injured, as well as providing ongoing support for all of the personnel in Lebanon. Every day of the year, far from these shores, hundreds of Irish soldiers stand guard for the cause of peace and human rights. In various UN missions, they join colleagues from around the world to form what is a thin blue line. The very first Irish peacekeepers arrived in Lebanon in 1958 when 50 officers joined the UN observer group on the border between Lebanon and Israel. Today there are Irish officers in places as far apart as Mali, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Kosovo and the Golan Heights. Five years ago, I had the privilege of visiting Tibnin, where a memorial stands to commemorate the more than 40 Irish peacekeepers who have lost their lives serving in Lebanon and to lay a wreath in their memory. I remember it well and it was a poignant and stark reminder of the danger in which Irish personnel place themselves every day. I also witnessed the close links between Irish forces and the local community in south Lebanon. It was one of those moments where the boundaries of culture, language, race and religion fall away and we are reminded of our shared humanity. The Irish battalion in south Lebanon has helped restore stability to an area that was once wracked by conflict. It showed clearly why our personnel continue to serve with distinction around the world to end conflict and bring stability and peace. Today the House is united as we mourn this sad death and pray for the injured. Let us think of that memorial in Tibnin, the loss it commemorates and the hope it symbolises.

Private Shane Kearney and two others were also injured. We hope and pray for their speedy recovery. I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and friends of Private Seán Rooney of Newtowncunningham in County Donegal, the soldier killed, as they try to cope with an immense and overwhelming loss. It is devastating news to receive at any time, but that this family will bear this sudden and incredible grief at Christmas is truly heartbreaking. No words expressed in the Chamber will be enough but I hope the family will take what comfort they can from the knowledge the people of Ireland hold them in our hearts and thoughts. My thoughts are also with the members of the Irish Defence Forces, Óglaigh na hÉireann, especially those serving overseas. I will make special mention of those serving with UNIFIL and the soldiers of the 121st Infantry Battalion for whom the coming days and weeks will be especially difficult. Our peacekeepers are heroes. They define the Irish spirit of courage, compassion and caring and our inherent desire to keep people safe. This tragedy underscores the very serious risks and real danger they face in the name of peace. They carry out their duties on the ground with communities and protect people by putting their lives on the line. We do not, nor will we ever, take for granted their bravery, integrity and inspiring sense of duty. We also recognise the resilience of their families who often go for very long periods without seeing them. The legacy of Irish peacekeeping missions for decades stands as a testament to the very positive role our Defence Forces play in a challenging world - a world that is often volatile, violent and unpredictable. Our peacekeepers bring calm, stability and safe haven by working to prevent war. By standing for protection against suffering, our peacekeepers have done Ireland and humanity some service, and it is for these reasons the people of Ireland are so very proud of all of them. It is for these reasons the death of Private Seán Rooney, an Irish peacekeeper so far away from his home, reverberates with grief to the four corners of our small island, the country he went away to serve. It is for these reasons we stand in sorrow with his bereft family. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis. Tá teaghlach agus náisiún in éide bhróin tar éis báis thragóideach choimeádaí síochána Éireannaí sa Liobáin. Is nuacht fíorbhrónach é. Tá caillteanas d’fhulaingt roimh a theaghlach agus a chairde. Léiríonn an tragóid seo an baol agus na contúirtí atá roimh bhaill dár bhfórsa síochána le blianta fada anuas in ainm na síochána ar fud an domhain.

I also extend my deepest condolences to the family of Private Shane Kearney who we hear has been injured and to the others injured and, indeed, to the families of all those who are serving abroad in Lebanon and on other UN missions for Ireland at this time. We are all conscious of the immense courage of our Defence Forces personnel and the immense sacrifice both they and their families give in being away from home for so long. It must be especially hard at this time, with this shocking news, for the families of all Defence Forces personnel serving overseas and, indeed, for all of those who are abroad on peacekeeping missions. The Defence Forces have a proud, well-deserved reputation and record as peacekeepers in Lebanon and elsewhere. We have a very strong international reputation as peacekeepers and, yet, this horrific news reminds us of the serious and immense danger faced every day by our peacekeepers abroad. It also reminds us of the 47 other Defence Forces personnel who have been killed while serving overseas. We are all thinking of them and their families at this time. On behalf of the Labour Party, I extend my deep condolences, sympathies and thoughts to the families of all those affected and I hope and wish for a recovery for those who have been injured in this horrific attack.

Ireland has a long and proud tradition of UN missions in Lebanon. However, this is a stark reminder of the dangers and risks that our soldiers face in conflict zones in the quest for peace. My immediate thoughts are with the victim's family, friends and colleagues in the Defence Forces and with those injured in the incident. Along with my party colleagues in the Social Democrats, we wish them a full recovery during this extremely difficult and traumatic time. As a nation, we stand in solidarity with those members of the 121st Infantry Battalion who remain in south Lebanon and acknowledge their unwavering commitment to maintaining peace in the region. The Defence Forces play a unique role in that they put themselves in harm's way in the name of peace. We are forever grateful to them. This reminds us of the dangers they place themselves in for that cause. I offer our deepest sympathies.

On my behalf, on behalf of members of the Regional Group, and of Deputy Cathal Berry, I extend my heartfelt sympathy to the Rooney family and to the community of Newtowncunningham on the tragic death of Private Seán Rooney. Seán's death reminds us all of how difficult and dangerous the work is that our Defence Forces personnel carry out in such volatile regions on behalf of each and every one of us and of the State. Seán has made the ultimate sacrifice in the defence of international peace. I also take this opportunity to wish a full and speedy recovery to all those who have been wounded. My thoughts and those of my colleagues are with the entire defence community at this time, both overseas and at home, serving and veterans, and their families too. When those of us who come from towns with Army barracks hear such news headlines breaking in the morning, we all take a deep breath because we are all impacted and we do not know where, how or what news will come out. Our thoughts and prayers are with everyone who has been impacted by this tragedy. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

I wish a speedy recover to Shane Kearney and the others who were injured and traumatised by what I understand was a very hostile situation and serious incident. Irish peacekeepers are recognised all over the world. I visited Lebanon with Deputy Noel Grealish some years ago and heard first-hand how they are held in high regard, as they are in many other areas of the world where they have served, going back to the Congo and beyond. My hometown, Clonmel, had a proud tradition with an Army barracks. There is a huge connection with the people. When we heard this chilling news, whether late last night or early in the morning, we immediately thought of the families. There are a number of families from my village, including the Corcoran family and the Fitzpatrick family in the next village, Castlegrace, with members who are on that mission, but they are thankfully well. They will need our support, prayers and continued counselling, because it was and will be traumatic, especially with the time of year, as we approach the holy season of Christmas. It is so difficult. It reminds us of the vulnerability of our proud Óglaigh na hÉireann. We must make sure it is a peacekeeping role that they maintain and will continue to do that, not other ideas that people may have for them, because life is too precious. A young, gallant man has had his life swept away and others have been injured. Ar dheis Dé go raibh a anam dílis.

A delegation went to Egypt. We happened to meet the secretary-general of the Arab League to discuss various important issues. Before we could say a word, he said that he wanted to say that they will never forget what Irish peacekeepers have done in Lebanon. He said that when militia came to attack a village, Irish soldiers held the line and said, "You shall not pass. We will keep the peace." That may be little comfort to the Rooney family this morning but I hope that our thoughts and prayers go to them. We recognise that our soldiers, including Seán, put themselves at risk for the highest values, highest purpose and most important need, which is for us to try to protect peace in the world. The loss for his family and friends must be colossal. It is also remembered by the rest of the country. It is a loss for us all. I pray that Shane Kearney and his colleagues who were wounded make a speedy recovery and, please God, return home for Christmas.

Tá an ECB leis an ráta úis a ardú arís. Beidh an ráta tar éis dul ó 0% nuair a bhí an samhradh ann go dtí 2.5%. Mar atá a fhios ag an Tánaiste, tá teaghlaigh ag streachailt ó thaobh costais mhaireachtála agus beidh tionchar ag an ardú seo ar daoine a bhfuil morgáiste rianúcháin acu agus ar theaghlaigh a bhfuil a gcuid morgáistí díolta do na creach-chistí. The European Central Bank is expected raise interest rates by another half a percentage point today, which will bring the rate to 2.5%. Somebody on a mortgage of €200,000 will see their repayments increase by more than €3,000 per year. This will have an immediate impact on the 194,000 households who have tracker mortgages. The fate of those on variable rates or whose fixed rates are due to expire lies with the banks and whether they decide in the coming months to pass this interest rate on. We in Sinn Féin have repeatedly made our position on this clear but I will repeat it - the banks should absorb these interest rates in the interest of their customers. They are profitable, have an increased market share and have paid out dividends to their shareholders already this year. Not only that, they are uniquely positioned to profit on the back of rising interest rates, although they should not. They should do the right thing. I ask that the Tánaiste, on behalf of the Government, echo that call. In October I asked the Tánaiste and his Government to examine options to introduce a targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief for struggling mortgage borrowers who are facing, and will continue to face, sharp increases in costs due to interest rate hikes. Will he clarify whether the Government has undertaken any of this work? As he knows, there is another cohort of borrowers who are now at the sharp edge of interest rate hikes. Over the past number of years, tens of thousands of borrowers have had their mortgages sold off by the banks to vulture funds and for years Government Minister after Government Minister has told the Dáil, these same borrowers and the public that vulture funds offered the same protection and safeguards to mortgage holders as the banks. At the time of Permanent TSB selling its split mortgage loans to a vulture fund, the Tánaiste told the Dáil, and assured homeowners, that they would be no worse off. I never bought that line and now more than ever the truth is laid bare. Vulture funds are aggressively hiking rates higher and faster than the banks. One borrower, who is a mother of three, wrote to us and told us how her interest rate from Pepper has increased from 3.7% to 6.4% Her monthly repayments have been hiked by more than €300 per month, which is over €3,500 per year more that she must pay, in interest alone, and that is before the ECB puts the interest rate up again today. The borrower has rightly said this would not be the case if she remained with Permanent TSB. Another borrower wrote to us. He is also a Pepper customer. His mortgage loan was sold by Permanent TSB. His interest rate has been hiked from 4.5% to 6.5%. In his own words, "This is the sentence we have been served by these vultures… how are we supposed to sustain this… factor in cost of living rises and our two kids, we are very worried about the future". Again, the ECB interest rate hike will put that individual's interest on his mortgage at 7% and in the case of some others it will be more than 7%. There are thousands more such cases. There are 100,000 people who have had their mortgages sold off to vultures. This puts to bed any notions that vulture funds treat borrowers in the same way as banks do. Does the Tánaiste accept these borrowers who had their loans sold to vulture funds are now in a worse position with the interest rate hikes? Will the Government commit to examining options for a targeted, tailored and time-bound mortgage interest relief? What actions will the Tánaiste's Government take given more and more families are likely to face repayment difficulties in the months ahead?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	176	I thank the Deputy. We understand the ECB will make an announcement on interest rates today. We do not know what it is going to be but it is anticipated there will be a further increase interest rates announced. We hope it is the last one, or failing that, the second-last one. As the Deputy will appreciate, the ECB is independent in its functions and it has a particular remit to bring inflation under control and down to something around 2%. That is the reason interest rates are being increased by the ECB but obviously this is going to be extremely unwelcome news for mortgage holders and other borrowers, who will see the cost of their repayments rise and that is coming at a time when the cost of everything is rising. I am conscious it is going to be unwelcome news and difficult for many families and other borrowers in the period ahead. To answer the Deputy's question, we do not have any plans at present to reintroduce mortgage interest relief. It existed in the past but did so, generally speaking, at a time when interest rates were much higher than they are even now. It is not something we will rule out for the future but there are no current plans to do so. It would involve reopening the budget and all the consequences that would derive from that. When it comes to variable interest rates, it is a commercial decision of the banks and other lenders to set those and they will have to take into account a number of factors. When interest rates go up, the cost of borrowing for banks goes up as well, because banks get a lot of their finance from the ECB and there could also be an impact on deposit rates too. However, my message to the banks is they should not use rising interest rates as an opportunity to increase profit margins, and that is the message we will convey to them with regard to interest rates. It was the case for a very long time that interest rates paid by Irish borrowers were very much higher than the European average. We have seen that narrow in recent months because many of the banks have not passed on the increases, which is welcome. When it comes to funds I will have to talk to the Minister for Finance and then come back to the Deputy. My understanding is when loans or mortgage transfer the contractual terms remain the same and cannot be changed unilaterally. Provided the person adheres to the contract the lender must honour the contract, but the Deputy is telling me that is perhaps not the case. Certainly, if he has individual cases or examples, I would be happy to examine them and take them to the Minister for Finance for further examination.

They always had the ability to do this, just like the banks have the ability to pass on interest rate hikes, which they are not doing because they have long-term interest. The funds have no such interest. That is why family homes should never have been allowed to be in the hands of vulture funds. We have people who are going to get another letter after today, the fourth such letter since the summer, saying the interest rate on their mortgage has increased again. For people that is going to put an extra €4,000 in interest on the repayment of their for mortgage. For many families, that tips them over the edge. When families are sitting down at the end of the day, it does not matter whether that is €4,000 to heat the home or €4,000 to keep a roof over their heads, it is money they have to find somewhere. There is a particular need now to examine the issue of mortgage interest relief that can be tailored, that can look at the increase we are seeing, which is brought on by inflation, which is a result, in the main, of the war in Ukraine and the issues with energy and so on. Therefore, just as with other one-off, time-bound measures, we need to look at a relief for mortgage holders in terms of the huge interest spike they face right now.

I absolutely appreciate that interest rates going up will be very unwelcome for tens, if not hundreds of thousands, of families across the country. Those with tracker mortgages, for example, will receive that letter, the fourth such letter in only a few months telling them their repayments are going up. The same will apply to people on variable rates and that is not welcome. As the Deputy will appreciate, the ECB makes its decisions independently of European governments. It is raising rates in an effort to bring down inflation which, if successful, will be of benefit to everyone. However, that is no consolation to people who have seen their repayments rise, and rise very sharply, over the last couple of months. We passed a budget in this House only a few weeks ago and that did not include the reintroduction of mortgage interest relief. As the Deputy noted, it is not something we are going to rule out. It existed in the past when interest rates were, generally speaking, much higher. We will be happy to look at any proposals the Deputy has but I do not want to raise false expectations. The budget was only agreed recently and we have only just signed off on the Finance Bill. To reopen the question of the public finances after only a few weeks, indeed before the budget even comes into effect, would have other consequences we would have to consider.

I want to bring to his attention the publication just this morning of the final report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Gender Equality, which I had the honour of chairing. Our report is entitled Unfinished Democracy: Achieving Gender Equality. What we have set out to do in this report is devise an action plan for the implementation of the 45 recommendations of the Citizens' Assembly on Gender Equality, which amount to a blueprint for achieving a truly gender-equal Ireland. At the launch this morning, we saw the audiovisual room packed with stakeholders, civil society groups, academics and many of those who engaged with us and indeed many members of the citizen's assembly. I expressed our thanks as a committee to the assembly, to Dr. Catherine Day who chaired the assembly and to all the stakeholders who engaged with us.What we heard from those present was a real desire to see the report implemented, to see the actions we recommended taken up by the Government and progressed over the coming term. There are some clear measures there that need to be acted upon urgently. I am seeking from the Tánaiste and his Government a commitment on recommendations 1 to 3 of the citizens' assembly. Those recommendations relate to constitutional change, both to the equality guarantee in Article 40.1 of the Constitution, to make it more inclusive and refer specifically to gender equality, and crucial changes to Article 41 of the Constitution, that is, the family article. The citizens' assembly asked us to do three things with Article 41, namely, take out the gendered language that currently refers to women and mothers as having lives and duties within the home; create a more inclusive definition and protection for care within the Constitution; and extend the definition of family beyond the current narrow definition based on marriage. In our work, hearings and deliberations, the committee devised a single set of wording to be put to the people by way of referendum that would achieve the desires of the Citizens' Assembly and create a more inclusive and more equal document. It is probably the first time an Oireachtas committee has devised wording for the Constitution. We were able to do so through the extensive consultation and engagement we have had, particularly with the Tánaiste, the Taoiseach and other Ministers, including the Minister for Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, Deputy O'Gorman, on the idea of a constitutional referendum. We are all very conscious that there has been a number of false starts on this referendum. There have been previous attempts to delete the gendered or sexist language from the text but they have come to nothing because there has not been a cross-party or cross-civil society consensus on this. We have come a long way towards achieving that. Will the Government commit to holding a referendum on those three recommendations in 2023, as all members of our committee have asked?

I was grateful for the opportunity to speak before the committee some weeks ago. I recognise Deputy Bacik's work as Chairperson, and all the members of the committee for the work they did. Politicians and parliamentarians often do not get credit for the kind of work that gets done in committees but it is often the work that is most valuable, rather than what happens here in the Chamber. It was in my previous role that the decision was made to establish a citizens' assembly on gender. That was decided weeks after the referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, as the next important step in advancing equality between men and women. It has taken quite some time to get to this point, to have the assembly and have the Oireachtas committee do its work and make its report. I can certainly give the Deputy a commitment that responding to the report will be on the agenda of the Government in 2023. We will respond to the recommendations in a structured way and in early course. I am in favour of constitutional change to provide a modern definition of family in our Constitution and to remove gendered language. It is extremely useful to have this report because referendums are easy to lose and often hard to win. The fact that we have cross-party wording is very helpful in that regard. I cannot make a commitment today on a referendum next year. It is something that will have to be discussed with the new Cabinet and the new Attorney General. However, I can give the commitment that this is work I really want to make progress on and follow through on. While I do not agree with every recommendation, the citizens' assembly did a great body of work that points to the way forward. The committee built on that and we want to make sue we move this agenda forward next year. I will certainly commit to a structured and meaningful response to all the recommendations in early course.

That is very welcome. I again thank my colleagues on the committee who engaged so constructively and intensively in the work we carried out. There was an immense range of issues that we had to cover in a short timeframe. We had a superb secretariat working with us on that and I thank them as well. I am also conscious that we will have the opportunity to debate the report in both the Dáil and the Seanad in the new year. I reiterate that we have done a huge amount of work to achieve a singular set of wording that could be put to the people by way of referendum and that we believe has moved us on in respect of that pathway to holding a referendum on this. I understand the Government will want to ensure there is a clear consensual basis for moving forward with that referendum but I think our engagement has provided a good pathway on that. We also produced an interim report on this July. We engaged with stakeholders since that report was published and that is what has led us to this clear recommendation for constitutional change. I again urge the Tánaiste to take up that challenge and ensure that referendum is held within the next 12 months.

Just in the past few months, we have introduced legislation around the gender pay gap and we are seeing that come into effect now. That will help us understand better what the gender pay gap is in businesses and organisations and how it can be closed. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, is bringing legislation through at the moment on work-life balance, which will benefit men and women but will benefit women in particular. In addition, there will be a significant reduction in childcare costs in the new year, which will benefit families but will benefit women in particular and will help more women get back to the workplace sooner if they want to. This Government has a good record in advancing this agenda. The same applies to the representation of women on company boards, where we have gone from 15% to over 30% and are aiming for parity. This is an issue the Government will want to pursue in 2023 and 2024. We will certainly give early consideration to the recommendations. It will hopefully be possible to have a referendum next year but I do not want to make that firm commitment without consulting with the Government and the new Attorney General, once he or she takes office.

Over the past 100 years, members of the Garda have served us with distinction and pride. We owe them a sincere debt of gratitude for their outstanding commitment and dedication. Over the years, the force has developed and expanded. It has constantly embraced new methods and technology. It is in a persistent battle to keep ahead of sophisticated and dangerous criminal activity. Over the past ten years there has been a concentration on putting in place Garda oversight bodies. Many gardaí will say they are now under more scrutiny than the criminals. Members of the Garda are swamped with paperwork and uploading data. More and more, I encounter Garda members who are unhappy, unfulfilled and disillusioned. Gardaí are our front-line protectors. They stand between law-abiding citizens and the multitude of dangerous elements within our society. We need to acknowledge and appreciate their heroic efforts in a tangible way. The pay, terms and conditions of rank and file Garda members should reflect their primary role in our society. Concerns are mounting about the increasing numbers of gardaí who have quit the force. Worryingly, these figures include some who are leaving before they have even completed their probationary period. When resignations are added to retirements, we have 400 fewer members of the Garda now than we had this time last year. At the other end of the scale, the scant number choosing the Garda as a career is a grave concern. The Government set a target of 800 new trainees for 2022. Currently, there are just 96 recruits in Templemore Garda Training College. Increased resignations and a significant lack of trainees screams of problems within the Garda force. Decisions by Garda management to amalgamate large districts across the country are now proving impossible to effectively control. As a result, people in towns and villages in Tipperary and across the country are left feeling vulnerable. People are growing increasingly afraid for their security and safety. Fear like this cannot be ignored. We need a greater Garda presence in our communities. We need to return to old-style visibility. Confidence and respect for Garda authority has faded. It is imperative that we take initiatives to revive it. The ongoing dispute over rostering is damaging morale. There is growing discontent amongst members.They are united in their view that it is more efficient and effective to continue working their current 12-hour shift on a four days on, four days off roster. To date, their voices and concerns have gone unheard. The growing frustrations of members of the Garda and the escalating fears of the public are not things that can be put on the proverbial long finger. A full review of all Garda operations must be a priority for the incoming reconfigured Government.

I look forward to an early meeting with the Garda Commissioner in order that I have a chance to tease through some of these issues with him. We are in the process of reforming oversight of the Garda to establish the new office of the police ombudsman and I hope that reformed office will complete investigations into complaints in a more timely way. It is absolutely right that Garda members should be held to account but the fact that complaints can take years to be investigated is unfair. Those investigations can be left hanging over people. We hope it will become a speedier operation. We have negotiated pay increases for Garda members, as the Deputy will be aware. Those increases are kicking in at the moment. They were accepted by the relevant organisations by very large majorities. Recruitment and training of Garda members was significantly and understandably disrupted during the Covid restrictions but despite those restrictions, gardaí continued to be trained and attested during the pandemic, albeit in smaller numbers than we had planned. While the Commissioner is operationally responsible, the Government is committed to delivering the necessary resources to the Garda Síochána and bringing the total number of Garda members up to 15,000 and beyond. Budget 2023 provides for funding to enable 200 recruits to enter the Garda College every three months. I was pleased that 92 new trainees entered the college at the end of November. Some 369 gardaí attested in 2022, bringing the total number who have completed their training this year to nearly 500. Despite a competitive jobs market, I take great confidence from the significant levels of interest shown in the most recent Garda recruitment campaign and take confidence in knowing that a further recruitment campaign next year will ensure a pipeline of suitable candidates. As of the end of the end of October, there were 14,200 members of the Garda across the country. In 2015, there were 12,860. We have seen a meaningful increase in the number of gardaí in the past six or seven years. The Garda is also now supported by over 3,000 Garda staff, which is a 50% increase on the numbers five years ago. That has freed up more than 800 Garda members from back-office duties to front-line policing.

It is also fair to say that arising from a trend towards violent disorder and aggression, the need for mental health and psychological support among members of the Garda force is growing and is a big concern. Up to the end of October of this year, €780,000 was spent on providing such support to members. That figure exceeds the entire amount spent in 2021. The figures show that 480 members were referred for psychiatric or psychological assessment, or for some form of mental healthcare, in 2021. Overall, almost €2.3 million has been required to provide psychological support to members of the Garda and staff who have dealt with traumas of some kind since 2020. The increased numbers of resignations, the relatively low intake in numbers, dissatisfied members who feel unheard and the growing need for mental health support all pose a significant problem. I am asking that a full review of Garda operations will be high on the Government's agenda in early 2023.

He is correct to raise the issues of the mental health and well-being of gardaí. Being a Garda member has always been a tough job but it has become harder in recent years with the changing complexity of demands, some violence, quite frankly, and an increase in disrespect being shown to the Garda. One of the things we want to progress very soon is the use of worn body cameras, which can be an important protection to Garda members. I know they are in favour of that and we are keen to get it done next year. That requires legislation. Garda management has introduced measures in recent times to support members, including a new employee assistance service, which is open to all Garda members and retired gardaí and their families. There is a 24-7 telephone helpline, a counselling service provided by Inspire Wellbeing and a peer support network. Arising from the cultural audit conducted this year, the Garda Commissioner acknowledged that while there are many positives in the service, it is clear that the organisation has more to do to ensure that people are being supported in their very challenging work. I am advised that the resignation rate stands at 0.7%.

Various people have held the position of Minister for Health and there have been various CEOs of the HSE. When the HSE was established and CEOs were drafted in, there were many promises that it would make a big difference. More recent appointees have been on a huge salary scale. There was a promise that such a structure would bring a new order to our health service. The current Secretary General of the Department of Health has a special pay arrangement to bring his expertise to the matter. Notwithstanding all of that, our health system seems to be in a permanent state of crisis. We have learned that some people have waited 116 hours for a trolley. Others have waited for three hours and 15 minutes for triage, when that should be carried out within 15 minutes. Eighty people are on trolleys today in University Hospital Limerick, UHL. On the same day last year, there were also 80 people on trolleys in that facility. This year, we have been told that respiratory syncytial virus, RSV, is the issue. Last year, it was Covid-19. This year, there are only 15 people in intensive care units across the country because of Covid-19. Last year, we were told that the health service was facing existential collapse because of the threat posed by Covid. There were 105 people in intensive care units because of Covid last year. This year, the problem is RSV. Essentially, the problem seems to be that people are getting sick. If people stopped getting sick, our health service would work perfectly. People pay taxes in the hope that when they become sick or need care, they will receive it. Our tax burden in Ireland is not very high by international standards but nor is it very low by international standards. Our health spend in Ireland is pretty average by OECD standards. However, I do not think that anybody in this Chamber or in the community thinks that our health system is adequate in return for that tax spend. When is our health system going to move beyond crisis into something that provides the service for which people pay their taxes? When is there going to be a value for money audit across the HSE and our health system? Why is it going to move beyond crisis and towards something that resembles a First World healthcare system for which people pay First World taxes?

At the outset, we should acknowledge that there are some very good things about our health service. Life expectancy continues to rise in Ireland. It is at 83 now and that is, in part, because of the improvements that have been made to our health service in recent years. Stroke survival rates are improving all the time. When I was working as a doctor, a stroke unit was very rare and there is now one in nearly every hospital. Cancer survival rates are improving every year and there has also been an improvement in the treatment for heart attacks. Many of the patient outcomes in Ireland are as good as, if not better than, our European peers and are better than those in the National Health Service, NHS, which is often used as an example that we should follow. We have also seen great improvements in chronic disease management. People with diabetes, for example, are managed at community level by their GPs in a way that was unthinkable only ten years ago. There is some evidence that waiting lists, having risen dramatically in part as a consequence of Covid and the cyberattack, are now starting to level off and, if anything, are perhaps going to fall a little. The word for that may not be "encouraging" because waiting lists should not be as long as they are, but levelling off is perhaps the first step before improvement. I acknowledge that we face real barriers to access. Most people would acknowledge that when a patient gets into the health service, the treatment, generally speaking, is very good. That is what most people say when they are asked in patient experience surveys. However, we have a real problem with access. People are waiting far too long to see a consultant or to get an operation or investigation that they need. People are also experiencing unacceptable conditions in most of our emergency departments, including in UHL, which Deputy McNamara has mentioned many times.We are pouring resources into the health service as the Deputy himself noted. In the past two years alone we have added over 1,000 beds to the system, 930 in the acute hospitals and 340 in the community. There are 15,000 extra staff now compared with two years ago including 4,500 extra nurses and midwives. There is a narrative to the contrary but the facts speak otherwise. We have 4,500 more nurses and midwives working in our health services than we had two years ago and 1,400 more doctors and dentists than was the case two years ago and more than 2,000 additional health and social care professionals. That is happening against a backdrop of a rising population and an aging population with much more complex needs. That is the situation with which we are dealing. We will continue to strive to make further improvements in the years ahead and turn the tide on waiting lists which I think is achievable.

We have a GP crisis which has been going on for a very long time. My predecessor from County Clare, Michael Harty, was elected to this House on the basis of the GP crisis and the fact that the number of rural GPs in particular was reducing. It would not be unfair to suggest that his experience here was somewhat frustrating and through no fault of his or no lack of effort on his part the situation was not any better when he left than it is now. We still regularly read in the newspapers of a GP crisis. We learn that one in three consultant positions is either unfilled or filled from an agency. There are 59,000 people waiting for healthcare across the mid-west. Resources are being poured into it but of course the population is aging due to a number of factors including dietary and health outcomes. I also learned that more than 200,000 PPS numbers were issued this year in Ireland. While we are pouring resources in our population is also growing. I struggle to have confidence in how the Government is going to meet these targets it repeatedly issues.

The number of people who are waiting more than six, 12 or 18 months is now falling. That is a result of the additional resources being put in. The target should really be 11 or 12 weeks, not six months or a year. We are at least seeing some progress in regard to the long waiters. In regard to GPs there is a big shortage. On Friday I met some GPs in east Galway. They are offering positions in their practice at €120,000 for a four-day week with a practice nurse and with a manager yet cannot get any applicants. That shows the kind of challenge we face. In response to that we have doubled the number of trainees but we need to do much more work with them to encourage them to stay in Ireland because there is an exodus of GP trainees from the country and they are not coming back. In regard to consultants, ten years ago there were 2,500 consultants. There are now 4,200. There has been a huge increase in the number of consultants in Ireland. However, we have vacancies and many positions filled by locums, as the Deputy mentioned. We think the new consultant contract is very attractive with a salary of over €250,000 a year. Anyone would agree that is a very good offer for a 37-hour week. However, we are asking in return that those consultants who take up that contract commit to public practice and work those 37 hours in a public hospital and only do private practice on their own time in a private hospital.

Yesterday the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, confirmed that this transfer would take place on 1 March next year but failed to clarify whether the €65 million in one-off funding which was promised in September's budget would be distributed to services before this date. Both Ministers, Deputy Donnelly and Deputy O'Gorman, have told services that the release of the funding is depending on the transfer. These services are in a precarious situation with increased energy costs, operational costs with staff leaving for better pay and conditions elsewhere and the services need clarity on the release of the funding. If its release is depending on the transfer of services which we are told will not happen until 1 March 2023 that will have serious and devastating consequences in regard to the delay these services are facing into the new year without much-needed funding. I know the Tánaiste aspires to higher offices at the end of the week, but will he ensure that the one-off funding is immediately released and that the moneys will include community and voluntary services which are not section 38 and 39 organisations?

One of the key recommendations is to have a constitutional referendum to expand the definition of family beyond the marital family. I wish to raise a specific issue around treatment of cohabitants that could be addressed by Government through legislation. Some time ago my colleague, Deputy Kelly, raised the awful situation of Johnny O’Meara who last year tragically lost his partner of 20 years and the mother of his children, Michelle Batey, who died of breast cancer. Upon her death John became starkly aware of the abject lack of supports for him and his children simply because he and Michelle had never married. Within the Seanad Senator Wall has been pioneering our labour legislation, the Social Welfare (Surviving Cohabitant’s Pension) Bill, which would ensure that the surviving partner of a cohabiting couple would be entitled to a widow or widower’s pension. Will the Government commit to bridging the legislative gap in inequality to ensure protection for cohabitants in these situations, pending the holding of a referendum to recognise a more inclusive definition of family?

It acknowledged once again the huge financial pressure placed on a person and a person's family who has experienced a cancer diagnosis. Last year the Social Democrats brought a motion to the Dáil on the cost of cancer. We were relieved to see the Government listen to the Social Democrats and agree to the lifting of inpatient hospital charges. However, we can and should go further. We need to see medical cards for every cancer patient, the removal of hospital carparking charges, the abolition of prescription charges and absolutely do away with any debt collection agencies going after cancer patients who are experiencing this horrendous diagnosis and the costs that follow.

We are acutely aware of the costs for cancer patients and indeed for patients across the country. We have taken numerous steps. We reduced the threshold for the drug payment scheme from €114 to €80, we abolished pediatric hospital charges and we will abolish adult hospital charges now. In the next few months we will be issuing GP cards to an additional 500,000 men, women and children. We will continue with the relentless focus on reducing costs for patients right across the board. In regard to the call for cancer patients having medical cards the consistent advice we have from an expert review on this issue is that we should not create a hierarchy of diseases such that a person with one disease should get a medical card and a person with another disease should not. We are progressing on an age basis for GP cards and on an income basis with a view to reducing radically and continuing to reduce costs for all patients.

Vertex, which is based in Ireland, is denying 35 children this vital drug. It has the Government and the HSE over a barrel. More importantly it has the families over a barrel.This company has made billions of dollars in profits yet it is insatiable for more profits. Can the Minister give the families comfort over Christmas in regard to access to this drug? I understand the health technology assessment is going to be done but it could take up to six months before it is processed. These children do not have six months - it is as simple as that.

The Deputy will be aware of a very strongly worded letter which issued from the consultants and of their views on how this company was behaving. We need to get this drug for these 35 children as quickly as possible. I can assure the Deputy that the Department and I are working very closely with the HSE to make sure the processes that have to be gone through are gone through as quickly as they possibly can be.

Jacob is nine months old. He was born with complex medical needs and requires 24-hour nursing care, and he was approved for that. Having spent the first four months of his life in hospital, he has been five months at home with his family, a family of six children and two adults. The parents get two hours sleep a night and are currently trying to run a business while looking after Jacob. Having represented this case to all of the agencies, prior to the first Question on Promised Legislation and since, I have received no response.

I support that and we must all support the Garda. However, the Dickensian condition of Clonmel Garda station has been raised in this House for the last 40 years, if not more. It is not fit for purpose. The Department of Justice has been playing games. It was bundled as a group with two other stations, one at Sligo and one at Macroom. Now, the Department has decided in its wisdom to bundle it in with a new children's court building. They are two different animals altogether. There are contractors and consultants out there who do Garda stations, but a Courts Service building is very different in regard to aesthetics but also building function. Will the Government get it out of this bundle and get the Garda station built? We have a site that was an Army barracks and it is has been invested in, thankfully, although we should never have lost the Army, and we also have planning permission and design. All we need is to get the building done. The conditions are simply appalling. The Tánaiste has been there and he has seen it. It should never have been bundled with the Courts Service building, which is only a trick of the loop to delay it further.

In most villages of Ireland, people can get newspapers from whatever country they want to in these islands and they can certainly get television channels from wherever they want. People are concerned about rising prices but if newspaper prices go up, they can stop buying them and if a Sky or Virgin subscription goes up, they can stop paying it. What they cannot do is lawfully stop paying the television licence. It is paid in return for public service broadcasting and it raises €200 million per year, all of which goes to RTÉ. TG4, which most people think provides public service broadcasting, is funded directly from the Exchequer. Given people are concerned about rising prices, will the Tánaiste commit that the licence fee will not be going up for the remainder of this Government?

I cannot make that commitment for the duration of the Government but there are certainly no plans at the moment to increase it. I appreciate that it is de facto a compulsory charge. Anyone who has a television has to pay it, although, in fact, people who do not have a television even though they are watching the services, perhaps on an iPad or different device, do not have to pay it but are still availing of those services. The main thing we want to do is find a way to increase collection. I understand about 10% or 15% non-payment is the current issue, plus the cost of collection. What I would like to see is a better means of collection-----

I agree the statistics that he articulated would indicate that the economy in Northern Ireland is outperforming other parts of the United Kingdom when it comes to trade. Perhaps that is linked to the advantages of the protocol, which give Northern Ireland access to the European Single Market but also give it access to the Great Britain market. Coming to an agreement on the protocol is a priority. I appreciate the political sensitivities around it and the opposition that is there from the unionist community in particular. We are very keen to work, through the European Union, with the UK Government to amend or modify the protocol so it can become acceptable to both communities, and all communities, in Northern Ireland, thus facilitating the re-establishment of the Assembly and Executive, which is long overdue.

Figures from the Department of Education show that in Dublin 8 alone there are about 3,500 primary school pupils and there are currently second level places for less than a third of them. A new school is badly needed. There is an old SIPTU college site on South Circular Road, with an under-used Office of Public Works, OPW, warehouse abutting it. The college is already zoned for educational use. There is a Dublin City Council site on Marrowbone Lane. These are two sites that could easily be used to address this imbalance. Can the Government commit to providing a new school to address this imbalance? More widely, we need to look at how we do school planning because it just is not working.

He made the ultimate sacrifice, as did Private Michael McNeela in 1989, who was also from Dundalk. Seán Rooney grew up in Dundalk. He lived there until about the time of his junior certificate and he has huge family connections with the Defence Forces. His home unit is the 27th Infantry Battalion in Dundalk. He and his mother relocated to Donegal when he was 15 but he spent a considerable amount of his life in Dundalk and had relocated back to Dundalk.Our thoughts are also with the injured, in particular with Private Shane Kearney. We know that there will be an investigation at some stage.

Concerns have been raised with me by a number of small rural services about the early childhood care and education, ECCE, funded seasonal preschools. They outlined to me concerns about possible closure. One preschool, for example, is attached to a primary school and it feels it may not be able to open next September based on the core funding model. I acknowledge the very significant funding that has been provided for day services, for example. There is a great diversity in the different services being offered and there is room there and the need for all of them. We need to see these smaller childcare services continue in our rural areas. If they close, there are no alternatives available to people. Is there a way of ensuring these vital services continue?

Some details will have to be worked out and I am aware of some small providers, in particular, who have a different cost model based on the fact they are small and it costs more to run a small organisation or business per client, per customer or per child than would be the case for a larger business. I know the Minister, Deputy O’Gorman, is keen to engage with the sector to try to iron out any difficulties that arise, with a view to keeping services open.

This is very sad day. I want to raise a point about the four schools in Ardee, three of which have DEIS status. One of them, Scoil Mhuire na Trócaire, had its appeal for DEIS status refused. This outcome means the 288 girls in this school are excluded from additional education supports and, indeed, school meals. These benefits apply to the other primary schools in the town of Ardee. Indeed 60%, six out of ten, of these girls have siblings in other DEIS schools. The appeal of the school has been turned down, but can a way be found to review this decision? It seems to me and to the families that there appears to be a gender inequality somewhere, which may be unintended but is there nevertheless, whereby these 288 girls are denied what all the boys in the primary schools in Ardee have.

In her email she said it is one year since the provision of services transferred from the Brothers of Charity to the HSE. During this year the situation has been intolerable for her family, with having to beg at ministerial level for services. Her child is one of thousands, and in our own community healthcare organisation, CHO 2, 1,600 children are waiting for that initial contact from the disability network teams. Vacancies are obviously rife right across those network teams. If the network teams cannot be staffed, and many of them are yet to be staffed, an alternative needs be found to ensure these children get the services they need, when they need them, and not years later. That is not to mention the thousands of children in Roscommon, Galway and throughout the State who are waiting for various services under primary care.

Considerable progress was made in reducing the numbers waiting from more than 70,000 down to the low 50,000s. Unfortunately, the HSE is complying with a court ruling around assessment of need, which means that progress has stopped for now, and we are aware that a great amount of resources, unfortunately, had been pulled into the assessment of need area. These resources, from a policy perspective, should be deployed in treating the children themselves. Nonetheless, the Deputy has hit the nail on the head in that the single biggest challenge and opportunity is hiring people into the progressing disability services, PDS, teams on the ground. We are finalising a new strategy with the HSE, and from my perspective, the direction I have given to the Department and to the HSE is that the single greatest priority is to find ways to attract in these therapists and to get these children the care they need.

I have raised this matter so often with this Government that it is deeply frustrating for me. I can only imagine how bad it is for patients affected. For almost two years now, patients with medical cards cannot access dental care. This includes patients who are seriously ill with diabetes and even with cancer. To give an example, Drogheda, the largest town in Ireland, has not one single dentist treating patients with medical cards. That is replicated across the State. No matter how often the Minister states he is working to resolve this, there seems to be absolutely no urgency about it. The Irish Dental Association said recently that the previous time it had met with the Minister was in a Zoom meeting in 2021. At what stage do people have to wait for these services? On top of that there are tens and tens of thousands of schoolchildren who have not even had their first routine check-up. It is shameful. When is this going to be resolved? Does the Minister have a date so that people can have access to proper dental health care?

A number of pharmacists who are finding it extremely difficult to source medicines have contacted me in the past couple of days. Two pharmacists informed me this morning that they are out of penicillin. There is a virus circulating at present for which penicillin is the best medicine but they are finding it impossible to get it. Pharmacists clearly said to me that the lack of medicines in the Twenty-six Counties is due to the amounts reimbursed by the HSE. I will cite one example given to me by a pharmacist yesterday, that of phenergan, a psychiatric drug. The reimbursement for that drug in our jurisdiction is €2.08 while in Northern Ireland it is €8.07. Manufacturers are making economic decisions not to supply us with essential medicines. The reimbursement for drugs needs to be looked at as a matter of urgency.

I see at first hand the great work they carry out throughout west Cork. I met a large number of home help workers in Clonakilty last week. To say they are frustrated is an understatement. They work long, poorly regulated hours. They aid Clonakilty home help, which serves areas east of Rosscarbery, such as Ardfield and Timoleague, to the Bandon boundary but, for whatever reasons, they are not getting their new contracts. This is different from the home helps in other surrounding areas who are working under better conditions with their new contracts. The workers are pleading with their bosses for the new contracts only to be fobbed off continuously. These home helps deserve better, as do the people of Clonakilty. The workers I met are so frustrated they said they would issue strike action in the new year. Will the Tánaiste communicate to the HSE this wrong being done to so many good, genuine home help workers in the Clonakilty area? Will he get the HSE to give them their long-awaited contracts?

The crackdown and oppression by the regime in response has been incredible. Approximately 500 protestors have been killed, including 68 children, and around 20,000 protestors have been arrested. On Monday of last week, we saw the second execution of an anti-Iranian Government protestor in less than a week.

In reply to Deputy Paul Murphy, I express the Government's solidarity with the people of Iran, who are struggling to see their democracy restored. They have not experienced democracy since the Shah was reinstated and Mohammad Mosaddegh taken down in the 1950s. They are demanding basic and equal rights for women and, in some cases, ethnic minorities and people from LGBT backgrounds. We are in full solidarity with the Iranian people in their efforts to change their country for the better. We condemn the crackdown. We also believe that the executions are absolutely wrong and should stop. On Deputy Verona Murphy's question, I express my horror and sadness about what happened to Alejandro in Enniscorthy. I have seen the pictures of this young boy. It is horrible to think about what has happened to this beautiful young boy. I hope he makes a recovery. His injuries will be life-changing but it is to be hoped he will recover as much as is possible, given the injuries he has endured. A Garda investigation is under way, which is very important. I will not comment on that. There will be a review of our laws around dangerous dogs and dangerous breeds, which is necessary. The point the Deputy made on dog wardens is very valid. We can have any laws and regulations we like but if we do not have people to enforce them, they are not worth anything. We will certainly make the issue of the proper resourcing of local authorities around dog wardens part of the review as well. In response to Deputy Wynne, I am a huge supporter of the Coast Guard. I had the honour to work with its members for a number of years when I was Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport. There are some Commission on the Defence Forces proposals to bring the Coast Guard together with the Defence Forces, which we are examining at present. I do not want to give the Deputy a definite "Yes" or "No" answer to her question, but I heard what she had to say. I will certainly make the Minister for Transport and the Minister for Defence aware that it was raised in the Chamber. They may come back to the Deputy directly.

In moving this Bill, I remember those whose cases propelled many people in this country into action, and into campaigning and fighting, for that right to choose, namely, Savita Halappanavar and Miss X, who are just two in a litany of names and numbers that became synonymous with a cruel and punishing Ireland for women. This Bill, like the repeal movement, insists that abortion is a health issue. This Bill supports the belief of the vast majority in this country that someone who needs abortion care should never have to travel abroad for such care.Again in line with the beliefs of the majority in this country, it aims to ensure that abortion is treated like other medical procedures and that it is never a matter for criminal law. It aims to achieve full decriminalisation of abortion in line with the World Health Organization guidelines. It will also see the removal of the mandatory three-day waiting period and 12-week gestational limit. Abortion is a health issue for women and the insertion of the three-day waiting period says to women that their decision to do what they want with their own bodies must be questioned, that the healthcare they are seeking access to is somehow different from care for other aspects of their health and that we are going to place obstacles and hurdles in their way. This suggests that there is something wrong with that choice. We totally reject that and the burden it places on women. We know that, in many places in this country, accessing abortion care or seeing a GP who will treat you is difficult if not impossible. When you get an appointment, take time off work and travel, you must then go away, think about it, consider your choice and make your way back again for the treatment you are entitled to. This Bill rejects that continuing heartbreak and trauma we are putting women through in the case of fatal foetal anomalies. Two out of every five women who need abortion care because of fatal foetal anomaly have to travel. The National Women's Council has done a lot of research. Before I sum up, I will quote some of it. The research showed that, two weeks before the close of a public consultation, 71% agreed that abortion should be treated like any other medical procedure and that it should never be a matter for criminal law. That review still has not been published. We are about to close the Dáil today and it is pretty shameful the Minister for Health has not published the abortion review in time for this Dáil to consider it. The research also showed that it is absolutely critical that the Government listens to the lived experience of those accessing abortion care, recognises the barriers put in front of women and takes forward evidence and recommendations from people. There is no medical evidence to support the three-day waiting period. It was not recommended by the citizens' assembly or the Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution. It was inserted by the Cabinet. Research also shows that the overwhelming majority of people who have had to wait the three days found that it added stress and anxiety to their physical and mental health. They describe the wait as ridiculous, patronising, unnecessary and demeaning. My last point relates to the issue of fatal foetal anomaly. It is heartbreaking to see hundreds of women having to travel to Britain since the law was introduced following repeal. In most cases, they must travel because medical practitioners cannot say for certain that a foetus with a fatal foetal anomaly will not live beyond 28 days. This Bill extends that period from 28 days to a year. The details are in the Bill but, to summarise, it will provide abortion on request for fatal foetal anomaly, abolish the three-day waiting period and provide for abortion on grounds that are likely to lead to the death of the foetus either before or within a year. It will also allow for abortion where there is a risk to the life and health of the woman and entirely decriminalise the provision of abortion. I commend the Bill to the House. I look forward to cross-party support because, when the review is published - shame on the Minister for not having published it before today - we will find that the evidence from those who have experienced abortion care is quite shocking compared with what the repeal the eighth campaign stood for and what the people of this country heroically voted for in light of what Savita and the other women I have mentioned, in whose name we passed a referendum to repeal the eighth amendment, went through.

I thank Deputies across the House in this regard. We will sometimes have charged discussions or disagreements regarding policy, but on this issue, in the main, we have been able to work constructively together. The next phase is important. It involves moving to a Government decision, implementation and starting to help people to get their homes and their lives back together. I fully acknowledge the difficulties homeowners and residents of many apartments and duplexes are facing, and the stress caused when defects arise in relation to their buildings and where there have been many incidences of failures and non-compliance concerns coming to light in apartment buildings. This is particularly the case with many of those built during the building boom. Many of these are in my constituency. I know constituents, residents and friends who have been living with this awful situation. I said that as Minister I would grasp the nettle on this issue and that the Government would as well. We are doing this. For the information of the House, earlier this week I hosted a webinar with residents affected right across the country. We had more than 290 participants. I thank the Construction Defects Alliance, CDA, and the Apartment Owners Network, AON, for facilitating this meeting where I was able to directly answer questions from residents from across the country. I thought it was useful and I will continue to do this. I have committed to another session with residents in the first quarter of next year. As I mentioned, thousands of residents across the country, and we estimate about 100,000 properties nationwide, including thousands of residents in Dublin Fingal, the area I represent, have been affected by issues such as construction defects or fire defects. I have worked and campaigned on this issue since the first day I came into the Dáil way back in 2007. In Opposition, when I was Fianna Fáil's spokesperson on housing, I called for a scheme to be put in place and for us to work together to help residents, not just to put their homes back together but to help them to put their lives back together. That is why, in the programme for Government negotiations, we sought and received a firm and clear commitment that the nettle of construction defects would be grasped and dealt with once and for all. This commitment was further supported by actions contained in the Housing for All policy. In this regard, I established the working group to examine defects in housing. This working group was chaired by Séamus Neely, former CEO of Donegal County Council, and its membership included professionals from a range of backgrounds, including fire safety, engineering, architecture, chartered surveying and the legal and public sectors. In recognition of the importance of hearing the voices of those directly affected by this issue, two members of the group were nominated by the Construction Defects Alliance and the Apartment Owners Network. I take this opportunity to commend all those, including my officials, who worked so hard via the working group to prepare a most comprehensive report in what was a tight timeframe. The working group set its own terms of reference. I did not set a timeframe for it either. It concluded its work in an efficient and professional manner. As I said, the working group set its own terms of reference and it focused specifically on fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects in purpose-built apartment buildings, including duplexes, constructed between 1991 and 2013. I received the report of the working group at the end of July. Given the importance of its work, I did not pressure the working group into finishing the report sooner or speeding it up. It needed the time to consider the scope and scale of the issue. The level of consultation and engagement that the working group undertook with stakeholders and interested parties here and abroad was extensive. As a result, the report is rich in data regarding the nature and scale of defects, as well as the cost of addressing them. Some 28,000 homes participated in a survey undertaken by the working group. As a result, for the first time, we have a proper handle on the type of defects, their scale and scope, and the breakdown within that context.The report found what many of us present know to be the case, that fire defects are the most prevalent of the defects. It is estimated that between 40% and 70% of the properties are affected by fire defects. Water ingress affected between 20% and 50%, while structural defects, though still very important, affected somewhat fewer, estimated at between 5% and 25%. We now have a handle on the average cost, although I am aware that some residents are being presented with bills well in excess of that amount. The average cost, as far as we could estimate, is approximately €25,000 per unit, which means a potential cost to the Exchequer of between €1.5 billion and €2.5 billion. I am acutely aware that many residents have already remediated their homes. Up to 12% of the properties have been fixed and made safe and over a third of other affected properties are either in the process of being fixed or work is being planned to undertake that remediation. I am now moving on to implement many of the recommendations contained in the report of the working group. First, on 27 September, I brought a memorandum to inform Government of the content of the report and of the next steps that I plan to take. Second, I established an interdepartmental and agency group to consider the recommendations contained in the working group's report and to elaborate on the options for the potential sources of financial support and the potential channels for deployment contained in the report. I received the final report of this group yesterday. Third, an advisory group has been established to develop a code of practice, in the context of the Fire Services Acts, to provide guidance to building professionals and local authority building control services and local authority fire services. In addition to the development of this code of practice, a separate code of practice has been developed as a result of a specific recommendation in the 2018 Fire Safety in Ireland report. This code of practice, which is due for publication shortly, will provide a framework for the ongoing management and maintenance of buildings with respect to fire safety and contains guidance specific to buildings containing flats and apartments. It will provide for clarity and consistency of approach nationally in making reasonable provisions for occupant safety. It is expected that this code of practice will be of assistance to building owners and operators in providing standard guidance and advice on the range of duties with respect to fire safety. It will complement and provide updated guidance to the existing suite of guidance documents published by my Department. Fourth, my Department is engaging with the Housing Agency for the provision of advice in relation to implementation of the recommendations of the working group's report. In parallel to the steps I have outlined, I have met and corresponded with homeowner representative groups such as, as I have mentioned, the Construction Defects Alliance and Apartment Owners Network and, indeed, residents from specific estates, and I am committed to keeping them updated on progress. As I mentioned earlier, we had a well-attended webinar earlier this week with nearly 300 residents and residents' groups attending. That was a useful exchange of views but it also further broke down the scale of the complexities of different situations in which people find themselves. I thank all those who shared those stories with me. The feedback that we received from that meeting will form part of a further submission that we are working on. I have heard that the excess levels on insurance policies held by residents of some apartment blocks are set so high that it nearly deems those apartments uninsured. I have had a positive initial engagement with Insurance Ireland in this regard and will continue this engagement as matters progress. I will also be engaging with the banks, and particularly mortgage lenders, as we move through the process. It was an important engagement with Insurance Ireland to inform it as to where Government is going with this because we would like to see the sector taking a different view with regard to insurance as it can see that a Government scheme on remediation work will start. I also advised residents of that at the meeting on Monday. I am also engaging with the Housing Agency in regard to the provision of advice in relation to implementation of the recommendations of the report. I intend bringing a further memorandum to the Government next week setting out proposals in more detail. I wish to assure residents of affected apartments and duplexes that the Government will help. We will help them to get their homes and lives back together, but we need a robust scheme. It will take a little time to bring the legislation required to underpin such a scheme forward. I advised Deputies of that last week also. In the meantime, as we discussed in the House last week, there will be interim measures we can take, subject to Cabinet approval, and we should take them. I do not want people holding off on work they have planned already, particularly on the fire safety side, in waiting for a scheme to come through. In fairness, all Deputies across the House, and my Government colleagues, fully understand the need to have a scheme that is grounded in primary legislation. However, there are interim measures that we can take and I will be bringing forward proposals in that regard to Cabinet next week. The hundreds, if not thousands, of people right across the country whom I have met in respect of construction defects deserve that response and help from the Government and they will get it. I assure them of that. As I mentioned, we need bespoke legislation. We cannot, although there have been other suggestions in that regard, use existing legislation. I do not believe that is the way forward. I appreciate the suggestion, having said that, but we can work together on bespoke legislation in this regard. I will be seeking the continued co-operation and support of Members opposite when we bring forward that legislation. The Joint Oireachtas Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage will have an important role in that. The members on the committee are experienced in this issue too. That will help the deliberation on and the structure of the scheme. We can make sure that it is robust and it moves forwards. There are other elements within this. It is not only a question of how we structure the scheme. We also must be clear about how it will be rolled out and how we categorise the different defects within it, such as in the case of the different apartment blocks and estates that are affected. We will do so using the principle of remediating the worst first. We have to do that, with a particular focus on fire safety. We will then have to deal with the issue of certification. When works are carried out - we need them to be carried out by experienced and qualified professionals - it needs to be certified. That certification needs to be accepted, particularly within the insurance sector and the banking sector. We will need to ensure that when work is done, it is properly certified so that homes can be properly insured and, should a homeowner so wish, be sold with the value of that home reinstated. As Minister, I am absolutely committed to bringing this scheme forward, getting Cabinet approval for it, moving on interim measures that can assist people now, and then moving forward with the legislation to put the scheme on a solid basis from which we can move on. I will continue to make good on the commitment we put into the programme for Government to tackle this issue once and for all, make people's homes safe and allow them to get back on with their lives. I campaigned for that in opposition and I am now in a position to do something about it as Minister. I welcome the opportunity to debate this matter this afternoon. I look forward to updating colleagues in the Dáil again following Cabinet approval, should I receive same next week. I suggest that early in the new session we return to this where we can look at the recommendations and work it through. We will let the joint Oireachtas committee get involved then. I am anxious that we move on interim measures in advance of a scheme so that people can continue with, or go ahead and do, scheduled work but there will be a particular focus on fire safety. There are other important issues, such as water ingress and, obviously, structural defects. We must look at the fire safety piece for people's safety first by way of the interim measures. As part of my memorandum next week, I will also be bringing for discussion to Government the issue of retrospection. Between 12% and 14% of properties have been already remediated and they are fixed.We have to make sure they are properly certified and the work is done. We take it that this is the case. This issue came forward very strongly in the working group's report. I know of residents in my constituency who have fixed their own homes at great cost to them and their management companies through substantially increased levies. We also need to help them. We must focus on work on apartments and homes not remediated, particularly from a safety perspective. I look forward to the contributions from Deputies on the Opposition and the Government side. I confirm I will bring forward a memorandum to government next week at Cabinet.

I extend my thanks and those of my party to the members of the working group, including the departmental officials in their advisory capacity. The report is significant. It will be seen as significant as the original report on pyrite and defective blocks in terms of giving us a solid grounding for the scheme, which we all hope comes soon. I acknowledge three organisations. The Apartment Owners Network represents homeowners campaigning on this and many other issues with regard to reform of the sector. The Construction Defects Alliance, especially since 2018 and especially in the run-up to the general election of 2020, has put a political focus on this issue and ensured it found its way into the programme for Government. The more recently established Not Our Fault 100% redress campaign emerged out of a number of specific developments and has dovetailed very well with the two other groups. All three are co-operating well and more will emerge in time. I want to spend my time talking about the scheme rather than the report. This is not in any way to sideline its importance. Really we are now at the stage where we have to ensure we get the scheme right. From our party's point of view, we want to work with the Minister in a constructive and detailed way. While some of the remarks I will make are critical, it is because I want to ensure, as we go through the process the Minister has outlined, that we do it in a collaborative way in the best interests of all those we represent who are today living with significant structural defects. The scheme has to follow the principles of the original pyrite remediation scheme. It has to provide 100% redress in the same way the original scheme did. This is only just and fair. It is the only right way for things to proceed. It has to be an end-to-end scheme. I appeal to the Minister not to repeat the mistakes of the grant-led scheme that exists and the revised scheme for defective blocks. I do not think that was ever the right approach, certainly with the benefit of hindsight. It would be a particularly inappropriate approach for multi-unit developments. Individual grants, either to homeowners, categories of homeowners or owners' management companies, would not be appropriate to address the issues involved. It has to be done through owners' management companies and there is no doubt about this. I have long supported the proposal of the Construction Defects Alliance for an agency to manage the scheme. Not only should this agency be responsible for the inspection, approval and contracting out of the works, it should also have the capacity to project manage in a way that voluntary directors of an owners' management company simply cannot or will not. To avoid any confusion, and again I am open to amending my views on this, I have never argued that the 2014 legislation underpinning the Pyrite Resolution Board is sufficient for dealing with this. My point is we need a stand-alone agency. My only concern with establishing a new agency is that the recruitment of staff and other matters will take time. I have always been of the view that new underpinning legislation for a new scheme is required. The Minister has a choice to make and I urge him to explore it. If the Minister accepts the need for a stand-alone agency, should a new one be created or should the remit of the existing agency be expanded? This could be done with new underpinning legislation to shift the remit beyond pyrite resolution and into wider defects resolution. Ultimately, I do not mind what the mechanism is so long as it is established quickly and does the job that is required. With respect to the legislation, we want to work with the Minister but I will be critical on this point. There was enormous frustration in the committee at the lack of even a small amount of time to do adequate legislative scrutiny and deal not with amendments drafted by us but amendments initiated by homeowners on the enhanced defective block scheme. It was not an ideal process. Notwithstanding the difficulty the Minister put us in with the Bill, the accelerated pre-legislative scrutiny, as I like to call it - other members of the committee call it something else - had a real value. The three sessions we had were enormously important. Nobody wants to delay the legislation, especially not those of us on this side of the House who, like the Minister, have been campaigning on this for a very long time. There is a difference between delaying and giving legislation adequate time. I appeal to the Minister not to make the mistakes that were made with the defective blocks Bill. Homeowners are not happy with the Bill and the Minister knows this, whatever about what people say on the floor of the Dáil. When the scheme eventually opens, many of the concerns and issues homeowners asked us to raise in the House will become apparent. Therefore, if we are to take the Minister at his word, we will get adequate time to scrutinise legislation. We will also get adequate time to table amendments if homeowners, in particular their representative groups, ask us to do so, as they did with regard to the defective blocks, to ensure we have cross-party support. It would be absolutely brilliant if this work had the unanimous support of Members of the Oireachtas. It would give homeowners incredible confidence in the scheme in a way that is currently not the case with regard to defective blocks. There is a genuine problem with the funding. Even if we get a scheme up and running next year, there is no financial provision. There was a small uplift in the combined funding for defective blocks and pyrite. It is difficult to see this funding extending either to the emergency measures the Minister spoke about, which I welcome, or to applicants and drawdown for a remediation scheme. Therefore, there will need to be additional provision next year not just for this but also for defective blocks if it is to be done properly. I have set out my views in a letter to the Minister. Again, these are our views at the start of the discussion and I am open to better ways of doing it. We need to be very clear about who gets full remediation and where can the State recoup some of the costs. My strong view is homeowners for whom the property is their principal private residence, social housing landlords, whether local authorities or approved housing bodies, and single property landlords with one property should all be included in the scheme for 100% redress through the owners' management companies. There is a big challenge in the scheme with multi-unit landlords, especially institutional landlords in places such as Beacon South Quarter. To allow the scheme to happen quickly, upfront 100% funding should be provided through the agency. Multiple unit landlords should have to pay for remediation. This should be recouped through the agency and the Department. If not, a charge should be placed on the property. This would allow ease in getting the works done and ensure landlords, particularly institutional landlords who can pay, and in some cases already have paid, for remediation, do so. At a later stage there will be a need to return to the wider issue of the industry's contribution to this. All I would ask is for the Minister to look at the attempt of his predecessor Phil Hogan to establish a levy. He should publish some of the information from that time and share it with the Oireachtas committee. Let us have a conversation about what is the best way to ensure that industry, especially profitable sectors of the industry in areas that played a role in this, can contribute to the ultimate cost. As we all know, this will be multi-annual, it will be multibillion and the taxpayer should not have to foot the full bill. I welcome what the Minister said about a risk-based approach, retrospection, interim measures and emergency funding, although the proof will be in the pudding. I would like the Minister to put more focus on the role of the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, and what the State can do with respect of NAMA's often very negative role in cases where there are defects. The Minister has met the insurance industry but more needs to be done on its role as we move forward. The timeline is crucial and I have made this point to the Minister previously. More than one year ago he announced the enhanced defective blocks scheme.I accept these things cannot happen overnight, but we still do not know when the enhanced scheme will open and whether it will it be early or mid-next year. We do not know how long it will take to process applications and, ultimately, we do not know when families in Donegal, Mayo, Clare and Limerick will be able to draw down that much-needed funding. That is an exceptionally long time. I suspect the first drawdown under the new scheme is likely to be in the latter end of next year. I hope I am wrong, and I will stand corrected if I am, but that would be two years from the announcement of the scheme before people can access it. That is too long for families affected by defective blocks as much as it is too long for families in this other situation. We would like to hear the new year updates on the wider reform of building control and consumer protection, which is in the programme for Government. I do not have time to go into it today, but the one thing I would say is that it was very disappointing to read a story last weekend in the Business Post about a change in the national building control and market surveillance office's report, from the initial to final draft, on defective blocks in Donegal. The lines that were removed are very important. We should all accept that building control is the poor cousin of our planning regime. It is under-resourced, undertrained and understaffed, which is no criticism of the officials there. We have to get that right and improve. Let us be honest and accept the criticism and collectively work together to improve the situation and ensure the kind of scandal, which we will have to spend billions of euro to fix, never happens again.

It is great there appears to be some light at the end of the tunnel for homeowners for whom this has been an utter nightmare. The devil is in the detail and we will see that detail in time. When it comes to home defects, it is hard to know where to start. Throughout the country, there is no community without a story about defective apartments. So many people scraped together and saved money to buy their dream home. A few years after residents moved into these homes, cracks and leaks started to appear and these cracks and leaks turned the dream into a nightmare. These defects were not created by the homeowners. Homeowners bought their homes in good faith. They bought them because they believed they would be built well because the banks approved their mortgages and the councils that gave many of them mortgages would not have done so if the buildings were defective, one would have thought. The surveyors said they were grand. The glossy brochures said they were dream homes. What could have gone wrong? What went wrong was the Government's light-touch regulation. Developers could put up whatever they wanted because there would be no one out to check on the defects. I spoke to a council official last week who said the lack of regulation gave the green light for junk to be built. All the cracks and defects have appeared and homeowners cannot afford the money required to fix their homes. No one would want to buy the defective homes. In my constituency, there were issues of fire safety in Longboat Quay South and water ingress in Gallery Quay and Poolbeg Quay. The owners of apartments in Poolbeg Quay need to be supported financially to resolve the issues. They should not have to pick up the tab because of the Government's failure. Some owners will be out of pocket to the sum of €20,000 to €25,000. Ordinary families cannot afford this. It is also important not to forget that defective apartments are not all privately owned. Much public housing is also defective. York Street apartments, which are 500 meters from here, would be classed as defective. These apartments are just 15 years old and they received plenty of architectural awards, but awards mean nothing when a person is living in a defective building. Last year, a water tank burst in one of the blocks in York Street apartments and the residents had to move to neighbouring accommodation where they remained for two months. Dublin City Council has spent millions fixing the defects and millions more will have to be spent to remedy these defects. I am regularly contacted by residents living in flats that have chronic mould and dampness. Flats in Whitefriar Street have serious issues. I was contacted by a family living in a flat in St. Andrew's Court on the other side of Merrion Square. The mould and damp in many of these flats is shocking. These flats are defective and unhealthy to live in and need to be pulled down and rebuilt. Young families should not live in these conditions. One child living in overcrowded conditions has what is like a smoker's cough due to the extent of the mould, condensation and dampness. Defective apartments are not all privately owned. The flats in Mercer House, Pearse House and Countess Markiewicz House are beautifully designed but they are not fit for purpose anymore. Their day has come and gone and they need to be refurbished and regenerated. This is what needs to be done for residents in the inner city who have so often been forgotten and neglected by the Government and Dublin City Council.

This is a serious issue for many homeowners, families and households. Like other colleagues, I have met many residents of affected apartment blocks, as well as with the Construction Defects Alliance and others. In July, I raised this issue in the Dáil with the Tánaiste and sought a commitment from Government for an adequate and effective redress scheme for those affected, and I was glad there was a positive response to that at the time. The Minister set out the steps he is taking and those he proposes to take. He said he received the final report of the interdepartmental and agency group yesterday, which looks at the recommendations in the working group report. He also said he would bring a memo to Cabinet next week on that. It is somewhat unfortunate we are debating this in a vacuum because we have not yet seen either the interdepartmental group report or the memo being brought to the Cabinet, nor will we have an opportunity to debate the report until the new year. Will the Minister of State bring back the call we would all make, cross-party, to have an early debate on this issue again in the new year, when we will have sight of the interdepartmental group findings and the memo to the Cabinet? We would then be clearer as to exactly what the Government proposes to do for those who are seriously affected. This cuts across many different constituencies and affects throughout the county. In my constituency of Dublin Bay South, I have met apartment owners and residents from Rathmines, Ballsbridge and across the constituency who are affected by defective construction in their buildings and homes. Many are already out of pocket because they have expended money on remediation works, either personally or through fees to their owner management companies, and we should not forget that many more who have not spent that money yet are living in danger. A home should be a safe place. Housing is a human right. Last week I stood alongside many colleagues outside these Houses with people whose homes are not safe because of defective building. It is five years since the Grenfell Tower fire tragedy in London, which showed us so starkly the carnage that can result because of defective building practices. I note an Irish company was involved with the supply of cladding that was involved in that tragedy. Tragedies such as these are always at the back of our minds when debating construction defects and defective buildings because they can have such real and tragic consequences. All those living in defective homes are deeply aware of this, as they are of the huge expense and distress remediation works have caused. A woman in my constituency said her daughter risked not being able to go to college because the family were so out of pocket. After receiving such an enormous bill for remedying defects in their apartments, they could not afford education costs for their children. That is the sort of impact this is having on families. We know from the working group report that up to 80% of apartments built between 1991 and 2013 may be defective. Of the 100,000 units, which is a massive figure, up to 90,000 are affected by the most serious issues, the fire safety defects, that arose primarily through shoddy work for which all sectors of the industry - professionals, contractors and subcontractors - were responsible. Limited regulatory oversight by State bodies was also a key contributory factor. We know from the working group that the estimated cost for remediation is approximately €2.5 billion and the report was clear the State should provide redress to owners to address defects through management companies, if necessary, and that retrospective financial support should be provided to owners who have or are paying towards remediation.I am conscious we had a cross-party briefing on the owner management companies issue last week. We know owner management companies are the most effective mechanism to deliver the whole building's safety that is essential in ensuring those living in multi-unit developments can live safely and be assured of appropriate remediation work. However, owner management companies, as we all know, are largely run by volunteer directors who may often lack the necessary expertise and experience to discharge the critical responsibilities they are doing voluntarily. The funding challenges being faced by many such companies encapsulate the real difficulties here. In practical terms, owner management companies cannot borrow. They will face lengthy processes to recover debt. They can only operate with the cash they have to hand and, therefore, the Government will need to provide proactive, hands-on support to such companies to ensure they can manage remediation works effectively to deliver safe buildings and outcomes. Any approach that only partially funds owner management companies for remediation works will risk leaving buildings unsafe and families in those buildings therefore unsafe. We need a public sector body underpinned by primary legislation. I know the Minister has acknowledged the need for legislation. We need a body to take charge of managing the remediation programme, as the Pyrite Resolution Board has done, in conjunction with owner management companies. The works should be fully funded upfront by the State and cost recovery should operate through the tax system. In addition, we will all be conscious that people who have already paid or are paying towards remediation costs will have to be included in the scheme because to do otherwise would lead to many owner management companies being unable to complete remediation works already under way. We need to ensure inclusion for owner occupiers and social landlords too, because housing associations form part of the occupiers and landlords for many multi-unit dwellings. We will be conscious of that as well. Support can be provided by means of grants based on the production of confirmation of payment of remediation costs by the relevant owner management company. I will highlight the need for the construction industry to contribute substantially to the cost of the remediation support scheme. That has been acknowledged. We in the Labour Party have called for a 2% levy on construction profits of construction companies from 2024 onwards for a period of at least ten years. It is necessary for those directly involved in creating the risk to also have a direct responsibility to bear a substantial portion of the costs. That is a crucial issue, not only to deal with past defects, but also to ensure one prevents and deters companies and construction operators from building defectively into the future.

I would like to believe I have continued the good working relationship the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, had with these organisations before me. Following on from the Minister's endeavours, I set about assisting them through a hearing before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, which provided clarity and a platform to voice their concerns and desires for redress and, in particular, the setting up of a working group which clearly had cross-party support. Shortly after this briefing, a working group was set up by the Minister to examine a defects and redress process. The figure is still unclear but an estimated 100,000 homes in this State are affected by defects which currently put people at risk of living in unsafe and uninhabitable homes, ranging from fire to structural and water-ingress defects. Since the report by the working groups examining defects was published this summer, we have eagerly and patiently waited for the Minister and the interagency working group to publish the proposals. This week, the Minister outlined the Department's proposals and it is both reassuring and welcoming that the Minister has listened to the concerns of homeowners through his engagement with the stakeholders and Department officials which I understand will include long-term solutions but also a set of interim measures. To my knowledge, the Minister and his Department are working under a worst-first strategy, which will ensure safety and fire issues are dealt with promptly. I welcome the establishment of a fire remediation section within the Housing Agency in order that those who apply to the scheme will have assistance from experts who can guide them through the process. I noted earlier that the Minister, Deputy Catherine Martin, had worked extensively with parties affected by defects in the Thirty-second Dáil. She began preparing a Defective Dwellings Bill with the professional expertise of barristers Deirdre Ní Fhloinn and Mr. Conor Linehan who did a considerable amount of research and put in a considerable amount of time putting together the Bill. We are one of the only countries in the world not have legislated in this manner to protect homeowners. Now is the time for such legislation to allow people to protect their homes from defective construction practices. The purpose of the Bill is to:make provision for the law relating to the liability of builders, developers and others involved in the carrying out of residential construction works; to specify certain requirements applicable to residential construction works; to provide for certain duties to apply to such works; to provide for a means of redress for persons affected by housing defects and to specify the limitation periods relating to claims for such redress and to provide for related matters.I introduced the Defective Dwellings Bill in the Dáil last September and we would be very grateful if the Minister would bring the Bill to Second Stage, as a Government action, considering its merits in providing a clear pathway for homeowners to find redress when confronted with a defect in their home.

As other Deputies said, this is not just private homes that are in landlords' possession. There are also private homes which are ordinary citizens' properties and homes which now belong to Dublin City Council and other approved housing bodies. We have seen reports in the newspapers in the past couple of days on the Herberton complex in Rialto, part of the former Fatima Mansions scheme, which was bought by Dublin City Council from Kennedy Wilson in lieu of the Part V provisions that are supposed to be on all building sites. Kennedy Wilson wished Clancy Quay to be exclusive. We opposed it at the time. It had the facility to offer a severely defective block of apartments to Dublin City Council. There are major questions as to why Dublin City Council bought those properties knowing, as I believe, that there were defects. The council fitted them out, told people they would be ready in January of this year and, lo and behold, it was not and still is not because the defects are on such a grand scale. It is not just the likes of Herberton. The Crescent Building in Park West is another case and there is the Metropolitan, Tramyard and many other complexes in the Dublin 8, 10 and 12 areas I represent in which we know there are defects. The scale of them is such that sometimes the first residents hear of defects is when a fire officer issues a potentially-dangerous-building notice. Think of the panic that puts in people's minds when they have to take immediate action not to use the car parks or the bins or, in some cases, even more restrictive impositions to protect themselves and other residents in the buildings. These buildings are a fire trap and that is why insurance is not available. That is why we need to act as quickly as possible to give the commitment, as seems to be the move, that the State will help those and ensure full help is there in order that those who are ready can go ahead and draw down money, if the banks are willing to lend it, to start remedial works in order that they can stay in their properties, rather than have to move or to address the issues as quickly as possible to give them relief so they can sleep at night.This is not the fault of any of those who live in these complexes. They did not build them. They bought or moved into these properties with the best will in the world. Suddenly, their dreams are being shattered when they are faced with bills of €60,000 or €70,000 to make good something they were not aware of in the first place which involved shoddy workmanship and incompetence by the State and the local authorities, which did not do a job they should have done. That is the biggest scandal. Caithfimid déileáil leis seo chomh tapa agus is féidir chun faoiseamh a thabhairt do ghnáthphobal a bhfuil cónaí air sna tithe agus na hárasáin seo.

The best way to prevent defects from happening again starts with a robust planning and building control system. Yesterday, the Dáil passed legislation to remove the planning process from some social housing which will be built next year. If we had a great, robust building control system in this country which has rarely ever failed us, one might make some excuse for that, but given that we have an appalling track record, ripping up some of the safeguards in the process is the wrong approach. Unfortunately, while that legislation is for a one-year temporary suspension of planning for social homes, I predict that at this time next year, we will be asked to extend the legislation again. Safeguards relating to fire safety defects are one area where people could start to raise concerns if they felt that high-risk construction methods were being used. They were able to flag issues in the planning process. That has now been removed with respect to social homes. The Minister made comments about interim measures and bringing the memo to Cabinet next week. We do not want residents to hold back from having fire safety remediation works take place. We know that is happening in a small number of cases. The Minister signalled that he would prioritise fire safety works. I can absolutely see the logic in prioritising the highest risk first. There is a potential problem with that since residents often have fire safety and water ingress defects. If the memo says the Government will give some guarantee of retrospective funding if residents do fire safety works in the near future, but cannot give a guarantee for other works, does that mean some residents will hold back because they will carry out the works at the same time? The Construction Defects Alliance gave a briefing to Oireachtas Members recently. Kevin Hollingsworth showed us photos of where people working on developments had deliberately broken through concrete separations between floors in a bid to save about €30 worth of building materials and those works had put the lives of everyone in that block at danger. Some very deliberate work was done. Another key point it made is that owners' management companies are already struggling to get management fees paid. They are run by volunteer directors. They cannot borrow, in practical terms. Landlords are already the worst payers with regard to non-payment of fees. There are already issues where they cannot continue with works because some landlords will not contribute to the cost. It is essential that there is up-front funding and that multi-unit landlords have a way to recoup that, either with a charge with interest in the units, through taxation or otherwise. A receiver acting on behalf of an arm of the State, NAMA, has been pursuing residents and homeowners in Carrickmines Green to force them to take on responsibility for construction defects. It is scandalous that the State, which has failed abysmally to enforce building standards through one of its agencies, is pursuing residents and homeowners to shoulder the costs. That is absolutely wrong. If this Government is committed to fairness in this area, it would put a stop to that straight away. Regarding the National Building Control and Market Surveillance Office, there are reports today that local authorities are buying construction materials which do not comply with EU rules and standards for building materials. That shows what needs to be done about accountability. The draft report on quarries in Donegal was given to the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, last June. It criticised the lack of oversight of the quarry industry and the lack of resources available to regulators in the sector. It stated, "quarries in Ireland have been poorly regulated regarding planning, environmental and market surveillance compliance perspective due [to] no overall responsibility for quarries within the local authority set-up." I do not know this from reading the report because this was all taken out of the report after it was sent to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, last June. I know this from reading media reports since. Why were critical parts of the report taken out? How can we learn from past mistakes if these criticisms are deleted from official reports? Did the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, or his Department play any role in seeking the removal of these criticisms from the report after he received it last June? It was published only last week. Why do the Government or Minister seem to think the public does not have a right to know about this? How can we possibly learn if that is how it will happen? Another part of the report stated that quarries and pits in every townland in Ireland could open and close in a matter of hours. That is a key issue for regulation. It also stated that, critically, it is only when disaster strikes that such services are properly resourced, until they gradually become under-resourced. It is referring to market surveillance. It states that millions are spent on planning and billions on remediation and fixing non-compliance when, in comparison, very little is spent on building control, inspection and market surveillance. That is of critical importance and was removed from the draft report so that none of us would find out about it.

Many people have been in touch on an ongoing basis over the past year. We have raised concerns in different ways. Since April, we have spoken with homeowners in St. Gabriel's, Granitefield Manor, Cabinteely, Dún Laoghaire and Blackrock, who are all affected. At a recent residents' association meeting, people in one area were advised that a ballpark figure for the cost of an apartment could be in the region of €25,000 for the remediation of defects. I have spoken with one family who have outgrown their apartment but they cannot sell it given the current defects. It will impact on their lives in an ongoing way until this is redressed and they have a clear plan. It is very difficult. I spoke with one lady who, at considerable cost to herself, addressed the defects in her apartment. It is not exactly money she had lying around. She found the money and was able to invest. She had saved and saved to be able to do the work and found other ways to finance it. She is concerned about whether a retrospective measure may be included in any scheme to be of assistance to her with the work she has already done, and how the equity of that might be spread out between her and her neighbours. I am aware of, and have to be sensitive and careful about, a matter which is in front of the courts, which relates to the ongoing issues with Carrickmines Green.It is currently in front of the courts so I must be very sensitive about mentioning anything in the House. I simply wish to acknowledge that while these things are pending, whether in the courts or any other place, the stress for individuals and families is considerable. I spoke with one lady in that project who is concerned about the morality of allowing anybody to continue to live there as a tenant until she knows what the situation is. I speak to that ongoing stress and uncertainty, which is personal, moral and financial in nature. This is why the development of a scheme, and clarity for people in every possible way, is so important and urgent. It is a matter of equity that it be addressed as soon as possible.

I ask the present Minister of State, who is at the Department of Justice, to ensure Ministers read back the transcript of what we are about to say. In particular, my constituency colleague, the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, should do so. It is important he hears what I have to say. On the background to the defective blocks in Donegal and the west of Ireland, as many as 13 or 14 counties are affected. I can speak with great authority about my home county of Donegal. I live in Buncrana on the Inishowen Peninsula. It is the epicentre of an absolute disaster caused by the utter failure in regulation of the construction sector. People have been left utterly traumatised and devastated by all this. After many years of campaigning and trying to get to the truth of what happened, the Government of the day came up with a 90:10 scheme. People wanted to give this a chance; it was better than nothing. That scheme has become utterly discredited. On the back of that, the people of Donegal and Mayo rose up. That culminated a year ago in 20,000 people marching in this city to demand justice and a scheme that would allow them to rebuild their lives. The Government said that would happen. The months dragged on but then in July of this year, it finally came up with the updated scheme. The homeowners were engaging in good faith and it looked like the issues they were asking be addressed would be. The proposals were entirely reasonable and many would cost nothing to the State, but they were left out of the scheme. We then forced some degree of pre-legislative scrutiny at the housing committee. Limited as it was, at least it was something. It was a day of scrutiny. Then there were all the amendments. There were 80 amendments for the homeowners but all put forward by the Opposition were turned down. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue challenged my party on what legislation we had brought in and what amendments. Did he not pay any attention? He was not present, did not pay any attention to the pre-legislative scrutiny and did not listen to the concerns of the homeowners. When it came to actual legislation coming through here he did not seem to contribute a whole pile. He made a bit of a speech. Did he not witness the Opposition collectively putting forward 80 separate amendments on behalf of the homeowners? Those are the amendments he was looking for. He asks now about Sinn Féin publishing amending legislation. For his information, we will be working with homeowners. Maybe he does not understand the legislative process but when legislation is passed, it takes six months for amendments to that legislation to be accepted by these Houses. Those six months will have passed in mid-January. After mid-January, we will introduce legislation to amend the Government legislation, which still has not been enacted by the way. We will introduce that in co-operation with the families and we will go back at those issues again because we believe this updated scheme is entirely flawed when it comes to bringing justice and 100% redress to our people. The Minister, Deputy McConalogue has challenged us on that issue. I am sorry he did not pay attention back in July to the debate that took place. He did not listen to the homeowners or follow their amendments. We are going to bring them back in again in mid-January, if he is so concerned. I hope he can support this and finally get behind the people of Donegal and do what is right by them when the opportunity comes again. I wanted to put all that on record because I want all the homeowners affected by defective apartments who were in the Gallery recently to learn from what happened to us in Donegal and those in Mayo. They should know when you are engaging in good faith in a process you could be betrayed in a moment's time. They should learn from our experience to ensure that all the i's are dotted and all the t's are crossed. People are entitled to 100% redress. No matter where you live in this State, if you are a victim of pyrite, defective blocks or of the cowboys who built houses during the Celtic tiger for pure greed, you are entitled to justice and to 100% redress. Do not accept assurances. Check everything and get it right. I tell the Minister of State at the Department of Justice, Deputy James Browne, that we will be back come January and we will try again to make the Government do what is right by the victims of this utter travesty and scandal.

Every time we have asked about this over the past number of months, we have been told the Minister is going to bring a proposal to Cabinet before Christmas. It is going to happen at literally the final meeting of the Cabinet before Christmas. I really hope it is just a coincidence that it just so happens to be a time when there is no Dáil sitting to discuss what is being brought forward and the media will have their attention elsewhere and will not be significantly reflecting discussion on this. I hope I am wrong about that. I hope it is purely a coincidence but it is suspicious to say the least. It is also very striking that in the Minister of State's remarks there is no history to this at all. It is like as a society we just slipped and fell into a situation where 100,000 families have apartments or duplexes with latent defects that make them unsafe in many circumstances and leave them with an average bill of €25,000. Most of those people do not know they are affected yet. There is no explanation of how we got here. Why is that? I assume it is because the regime of self-certification that was introduced into the Dáil when Fine Gael was in government and then passed as legislation when Fianna Fáil was in government. Those parties were warned about such an approach at the time, and very clearly. Eamon Gilmore, then of the Workers' Party, said:The principle being enshrined in this section is very dangerous. It will expose people who are buying homes to buying products which are sub-standard against which they will have no comeback.Despite that warning Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil went ahead with the legislation and opened the door to developers and builders cutting corners, putting people's lives at risk and costing them huge amounts of money. It is absolutely scandalous. That brings me to the next point, which is that the Minister says, and has said repeatedly, that the Government will help. From my experience of the people affected by this issue, that language drives them absolutely wild, because it implies this is their fault but the Government is going to very generously step in and give them a dig out and some sort of assistance with the problem. This is not their fault. If the Minister had been outside the Dáil last night he would have seen many people outside chanting "Not our fault. Not our fault". They feel it extremely strongly because it is the fault of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil for introducing this legislation and it is the fault of the cowboy developers and builders who used this legislation and abused it in order to cut corners. It was not just a small number of them either, as perhaps 80% of buildings from between 1991 and 2013 are affected. What the people affected by this want is not help but very clear 100% redress, full retrospection, for it to be done rapidly and for the State to pursue the builders responsible. It is very simple. I do not understand why we are so long on now from the original report from the working group and why we cannot have the proposals before us. I am not saying the implementation of it can be done overnight, as of course it cannot, but the principles should be announced immediately. If the scheme does not meet those things it will not be accepted. I say that very clearly.I asked the Minister for Finance about this on Leaders' Questions a couple of weeks ago and he said we would not be satisfied no matter what. If it is those things, I will be satisfied, and the homeowners will be satisfied. If it is not, they will not be satisfied at all and the campaign will be kicking up a gear. To reflect on the points Deputy Mac Lochlainn made, these people are very aware that those affected by mica got a scheme that said "100% redress" in the headline but then there was a bit of small text that meant it was not 100% redress. They will be on the lookout for that and they will not be fooled. Finally, I pay tribute to those who have spoken out, who are living in conditions where they sometimes cannot sleep because of the fear of what could happen to their homes. They have put their energy into campaigning, to protesting and speaking about their own personal experiences, and to putting massive pressure on the Government. They are a formidable group of people. If the Government gives them anything less than 100% redress, it will be making a very big mistake.

These people have been left with the bitter consequences. Of course, the mica and pyrite families and households had to fight every step of the way and are still not being given the support and full redress they deserve. One very specific example is the Carrickmines Green apartments. There are 235 apartments in that complex. NAMA took it over and the receiver acting on behalf of NAMA was informed by the residents of the fire defects. They pleaded with the receiver to remediate them. Eventually, under pressure, it remediated them but when the residents did another audit, they found there were still fire defects. The remediation has not been done and now NAMA and the receiver want to sell some of those apartments to Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council for social housing, with the defects still there. Even though NAMA has remediated other developments, it will not do it for these. It is trying to force the residents in Carrickmines Green to carry the can. It is absolutely outrageous. I have brought this up with the Minister for Finance and the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, as have others. What is being done to these people, when a State agency, NAMA, is involved, is an absolute outrage. As well as the more general demand for 100% redress, I am asking the Government to engage with those residents and to tell NAMA to remediate these homes, given that it is responsible for that estate.

It is really tough for them. There are 100,000 homes impacted by this, including a number of estates in my area. I am not going to name them, not because their names are not in the public domain - they kind of already are - but because there are people there trying to sell their homes. I spoke to a young couple recently. They bought a starter home at the height of the Celtic tiger, just before we were about to feel the full lash of what Fianna Fáil had done to this State. They bought a small apartment. It is now not big enough for them and their family and they cannot sell it. They are stuck there, in overcrowded accommodation that is also unsafe. Not alone is it not a good place to live because of the size of it, it is not a good place to live because of the defects. The report of the working group examining the defects on housing made tough reading for anyone but if you were sitting in one of those apartments, I can only imagine how angry and frustrated you would be. These people are paying their mortgages every month, knowing their apartments are defective through no fault of their own, having done the thing we are led to believe we should do, which is to grow up, get a job, get a mortgage and get somewhere to live. They did that. They followed, as they would say, all the rules. I would agree with Deputy Paul Murphy on this. The response from the Government seems to be saying that it will give them a hand with that or will help them out. It is a language thing and maybe it is unintentional - I hope it is - but it implies that somehow it is their fault and it is not. They bought homes in good faith. A couple of weeks ago we brought forward a motion for 100% redress. We should not have to say that 100% redress should mean 100% because it should not mean any less than 100%. The families in Donegal, Mayo and everywhere else impacted by mica and pyrite know that when the Government says 100% it has a different figure in its mind. It says 100% but in truth they know it is not going to mean 100% to them. Fair play to the people who stand outside the Dáil because they were brave enough to come and do that. When they say they want 100%, they need the Government to understand that that is actually 100%. They should not be punished for the light-touch regulation that was a big feature of previous Fianna Fáil Governments but was also, let us be honest, enthusiastically supported by its best friends in Fine Gael. Today we are discussing the report of the working group examining defects in houses. In 2018 we had the Safe as Houses report. What happened to that report? It is a bit of a Father Ted moment - "Is there anything to be said for another report?" We are going to arrive, and I believe we have already, at a stage where we can say this issue has been reported on ad nauseam. What is actually needed is action. The recommendations from the Safe as Houses report have not been implemented as yet. Where are the measures to reform the building control system to give homeowners and tenants greater protections and ensure we do not have a repeat of the Celtic tiger era building defects scandal? For years we in Sinn Féin have been campaigning for a redress scheme for homeowners and tenants impacted by Celtic tiger era defects. Our party spokesperson Deputy Ó Broin has a long track record on this issue. We need serious action for these people very early in the new year. I remind the Minister of State that 100% has to mean 100% because these people were 100% let down. They now need to be 100% compensated through that redress.

Hundreds of thousands of families have been put into a situation where they bought a house or an apartment in good faith, took out a mortgage on it and are still paying that mortgage for a home that is now defective. There is widespread anger about what has happened to innocent people who were trying to pay their way in life to make sure they had a home for their family. They were not relying on the State to provide it for them. They were not asking the State for anything other than good governance and a proper regime to ensure that any construction done in this country could stand up and be looked at with pride. As someone who worked in the construction industry for a long number of years, it gives me no great pride to have to come in here and talk about defects in buildings and houses. This has come about because decisions were made in times past to dispense with very good practices, which we had. I will give an example. When I was building local authority housing, the National Building Agency oversaw the construction. The clerk would randomly visit sites with his box and would take samples of electric cables, timber, door locks or copper pipes. He would take a sample of each component that goes into making a house, bring them away and get them tested.The place they were tested at the time was the Institute for Industrial Research and Standards, which did all the testing. If any faults showed up, that particular component of the house would have to be stripped out and the same would happen in every other house under construction. We also had a regime for testing concrete blocks and cubes of concrete. They were tested in the university in Galway at the time. There was a seven-day test which would give an indication and there was a 28-day test which could be stood over. That seems to have been lost in transition. We may have got too self-confident that we were well able to do things without any controls. All of those good practices were dismissed as trivial and unnecessary in the construction industry. We moved towards self-regulation and self-certification. When we turned that corner, we found that we were moving into fog. Self-certification and the regulations attached were there but who was enforcing them? Who was refereeing the match? Who was blowing the whistle when something went wrong? That is how we found ourselves in the position we are in now whereby a taxpayers' bill of €5 billion to carry out rectifications is probable. Joe Public is still going to pay for this, no matter how we look at this issue. Introducing a levy on the manufacture of concrete does little other than create an increase in the cost of material for which Joe and Mary Public will pay. We are not learning at all in what we are doing here. We are talking about bringing in more regulations. We are talking about more certification that can be done by architects and engineers. We are talking about improving regulations. We are over-regulated but any enforcement is totally absent. Our local authorities, the building control agents for the State, are totally underfunded to do that particular job. They do not have the numbers or funding to do it, nor have they the wherewithal because it is just an ad-on within a planning department. It is not dealt with in a serious way. A building control officer might call out to a site at random and look at something. He or she would say to the certifier for the client that there is something wrong and work should stop. How many such visits are paid per annum to how many sites in the country? I asked the Department how many building control officers we have in this country and was told that is a matter for local authorities. We are not learning anything from all of this. In my time, there were three aspects to building control. There was sampling and testing of materials. There was sampling and testing of products to ensure they had CE certification and stood up to the standards required. Visual inspections were also carried out to ensure that where the materials were acceptable, they were being installed properly so that we had what we are entitled to have, that is, proper buildings that are fit for purpose and with no risk of defects. During the Celtic tiger era, we also got a crazy idea that every house in the country needed to have a structural guarantee. The people paying for that were the couples and individuals who were building the houses. Those were the people who wanted to do something for themselves and not be a burden on the State. The banks and the Central Bank demanded it. Local authorities are still demanding it for local authority mortgages. A bond at the moment would cost €600, €700 or €800. What is it worth? What is it worth to any of these people who have taken out and paid for a structural guarantee, an insurance bond, and are getting nothing in return? Where are the companies that underwrite this risk? They have disappeared away from the scene but still have the gall to offer structural guarantees on houses now. Even worse, our banks and local authorities will not give out mortgages without structural guarantees in place. It is futile. Those guarantees are a waste of money because they are not worth the paper they are written on. That is a fact. Until we wake up and realise that unless we put proper enforcement in place, we are still going to put ourselves and the taxpayers at risk of being required to fund another defects crisis down the line. Writing out regulations, memos, instructions and directives for local authorities is not worth the paper they are written on if we do not stand up, man up and say we will never let this happen again. The way to ensure it does not happen again is by investing in building control and not in remediation. I concur with everyone who has said that for the people who have been visited by these enormous problems, we, as a State, must ensure that everything is done to provide 100% redress because we owe justice to them, their families and ourselves.

We can all agree that many homeowners and residents of apartments and duplexes have found themselves in a difficult and stressful position when defects have arisen in respect of their buildings through no fault of their own. As the Minister said on a number of occasions, this is a nettle that this Government is determined to grasp and we are committed to providing support to affected homeowners. Given the personal impact of these problems on the homeowners involved, the Minister would like to reach a broad political consensus on these vital issues. In this regard, he has written to the Opposition leaders requesting their specific written input on the options laid out in the report of the working group to examine defects in housing and any additional steps they believe should be undertaken to meet these challenges. The Minister would like to thank those who have responded to date and would encourage those who have yet to do so to submit their proposals for his consideration as soon as possible. The Minister would also like to see some practical details included in the proposals and has requested, in particular, that relevant detail on administration, implementation and costings accompany the proposals. This Government fully acknowledges the calls that homeowners and residents need support at the earliest possible opportunity and I assure the House that the Government is committed to addressing this issue as a matter of priority. The Government's commitment is demonstrated by the fact that one of the Minister's first actions when he took office was to establish the working group to examine the defects in housing. In response to Deputy Ó Broin, I can say that the regulations for the defective concrete blocks grant scheme will be published in January. The establishment of the working group was an important initial step as it was the first time that we could establish the scale of the issue involved. I reiterate the Minister's thanks to all members of the working group for the considerable work they undertook in a relatively short period of time. The scale of the issue we are trying to address is quite substantial. It is worth reiterating that the number of apartments and duplexes constructed between 1991 and 2013 affected by one or more of fire safety, structural safety and water ingress defects is likely to range between 50% and 80%. That equates to between 62,500 and 100,000 apartments or duplexes built within this time period. The average cost of undertaking the remediation of defects is likely to be approximately €25,000 per apartment or duplex, which translates to a potential overall total remediation of between approximately €1.56 billion and €2.5 billion. It is no small task to determine how best to put in place support for affected homeowners in a considered and structured way. To this end, as the Minister informed the Dáil earlier today, a number of steps have been taken to progress the implementation of the working group's report to ensure that the affected homeowners are provided with the support they need.We have taken a number of steps to progress the implementation of the working group's report to ensure the affected homeowners are provided with the support they need. This includes the establishment of an interdepartmental and agency group, the establishment of an advisory group to develop a code of practice and considerable consultation with relevant stakeholders and homeowners' representative groups. He intends to bring a memorandum to Government next week, which will seek Government approval of the next stage in the process. As is evident from the detail that has been outlined to the House, a considerable amount of work is being undertaken and this reflects the urgency this Government believes is necessary to address the issue for affected homeowners. This is in the context of the finding of the working group that there is no single cause of defects. The working group determined that defects tend to arise due to a variety of design, product inspection, supervision and workmanship issues occurring either in isolation or in various combinations. However, as recognised by the working group in its report, given that the overall potential scale and estimated cost to fix the problem is so considerable it will take many years to address all buildings affected. Resources and works will therefore need to be prioritised. In this regard it would not be appropriate for those in charge of defective buildings to delay the undertaking of any remediation work that is considered necessary from a life safety point of view. It is worth remembering that persons having control of premises, including apartment and duplex buildings, have statutory fire safety responsibilities under the fire services Act. The person having control may be an individual person, a number of persons or an organisation such as an owners’ management company, approved housing body, real estate investment trust, a housing authority or property services company. In general the person having control is required to guard against the outbreak of fire on the premises and to ensure as far as reasonably practicable the safety of persons on the premises in the event of an outbreak of fire. Given the scale of the apartments potentially affected, the defects working group report advised on the importance of planning, prioritising and adequately resourcing any programme to address defects. In this light the Minister, Deputy O’Brien, is working to bring forward specific proposals to Cabinet followed by new legislation, interim measures and administrative processes to respond to the report of the working group to examine defects in housing as quickly as possible. I will conclude by reiterating this Government’s commitment to assist affected homeowners who need support to address defects that have manifested in their apartments and duplexes through no fault of their own. This has been a useful debate. The Minister, Deputy O'Brien, looks forward to updating colleagues in the Dáil following the approval of the memorandum to Government which he plans to bring to Cabinet next week.

I hope they get time to enjoy it with family and friends. I wish Deputy Ó Broin, his colleagues and all colleagues a happy Christmas. This is probably the last housing debate this side of the new Government. We wait to see what Saturday holds. I wish colleagues a very happy and peaceful Christmas and hope people get to spend some time with their friends and families and have a little down time. We are all acutely aware of the challenges in the housing sphere. At the forefront of my mind over the Christmas season are those who do not have a secure home and live in emergency accommodation. They are the number one priority of this Government. In regard to the matter of the review of income eligibility for social housing supports, I welcome the opportunity to outline among other things the recent changes to the social housing eligibility thresholds and set out my proposals to deliver an enhanced social housing income model in the first half of next year. I recently approved changes to income eligibility for social housing which will see thresholds increase by €5,000 across all local authorities from 1 January 2023. They will broaden the base of households eligible for social housing supports and ensure those in most acute need are prioritised. The changes will soften the impact for an estimated additional 16,000 households, of the increases in the cost of accommodation and the cost of living in recent months, as well as ensuring that social housing supports, including the housing assistance payment, will be available to those who need them most. While the changes will come into effect from the new year, I am pleased to say they will be retrospectively applied to some extent. I am keen to ensure that the changes will be implemented in a fair and equitable manner and that unintended consequences are mitigated as much as possible. Accordingly any application assessed and deemed ineligible between 18 November 2021 and 1 January 2023 and which would have met the new income thresholds can be resubmitted. Moreover, any household removed from the local authority waiting list since 18 November 2021, but which would now qualify under the new thresholds, will be able to retain the time already accrued on the list as well as any time they would have accrued if they had remained on the list. Impacted households will have until 30 June 2023 to resubmit their social housing applications and avail of these transitional arrangements. That is in response to the number of cases I, and other Deputies across the House, have dealt with. We need to make sure that those who were marginally above the previous limits and were removed from the list after spending substantial time on it can now be reinstituted at the original place and also get credit for the period of time they were removed.  I am conscious that not all households will be aware of the changes or the implications for them. Accordingly I have instructed local authorities to take all necessary measures to ensure all affected households are given the greatest opportunity to reapply. This includes, at a minimum, writing formally to the respective applicants to advise them of the changes and possible impact for them. The current social housing income model, the respective income thresholds, and the local authorities assigned to each income band were introduced in 2011. Prior to this many local authorities did not apply income eligibility limits. To the extent limits were in place, they tended to vary from one local authority to another. There were also very significant variations in how income limits were defined. The result was an inconsistent approach across all local authorities with applicants for social housing support on similar incomes being treated very differently, depending on where they happened to live in the country. Accordingly the current model was introduced in 2011. The model is standardised and more consistent with a more equitable approach to assessing eligibility than previous approaches. Importantly, the current model reserves housing support for households that cannot support themselves and have a continuing long-term need, while at the same time ensuring constrained public resources are provided to those who need them most. Eligibility is assessed against objective criteria, including level of income. Local authorities are grouped in three bands for this purpose. The bands and thresholds were developed with reference to the income needed to meet a household's basic needs, plus a comparative analysis of the local rental cost of housing accommodation across the country at that time. The thresholds also included an uplift of €5,000 to broaden the base from which social housing tenants are drawn to promote sustainable communities and provide a degree of future-proofing. Ultimately, those who qualify for support, for all social housing supports, including in more recent years the housing assistance payment, are then placed on the housing list to be allocated a suitable tenancy in accordance with the relevant local authority's allocation scheme. Notwithstanding an increase in the thresholds for a small number of local authorities earlier in October this year, they have remained largely unchanged since 2011.In the meantime, accommodation costs have increased significantly nationwide while annual real household disposal income has increased at a slower rate. For this reason, I approved the recent increases to the baseline income thresholds by €5,000 for all local authorities. While I have no doubt this was the right thing to do in the short term and that approximately 16,000 households will benefit from much-needed State support, the changes will be implemented pending the development and roll-out of an alternative or revised income eligibility model in 2023. Given the time elapsed since the current model was introduced, and the limited changes to the thresholds over that time, it is appropriate that we carry out a comprehensive root and branch review of the current model and determine if the original underpinning objectives are being met. It is opportune to assess whether the current broad system of bands and thresholds is appropriate and, if so, whether the thresholds adequately relate to the cost of securing suitable private rental accommodation across local authority areas, given the income constraints of low-income households. To this end, my Department recently commissioned expertise to review the current model and develop proposals for an enhanced approach that continuously accounts for existing needs. The review will involve analysing the effectiveness of the current model in meeting and identifying long-term need, developing options for an alternative or revised model, and recommending the optimal approach vis-à-vis strengthening or replacing the existing model. The new model will be based on some key principles or objectives. There will always be households that will have difficulty meeting their housing needs. Accordingly, the model will seek to support disadvantaged and other vulnerable households unable to source adequate accommodation from their own resources, providing such support in the context of constrained supply. Supporting wider housing and social policy objectives of addressing poverty and social inclusion, like the current model, it will seek to target assistance towards households with the greatest needs. It will also try to avoid creating strong inequities between recipient and non-recipient households, for example, avoiding the cliff-edge thresholds that can arise in such models. At the same time, it will need to be sustainable into the future. To this end, the model and relevant thresholds need to be capable of being adjusted regularly to reflect changes to housing costs and incomes, that is, adjusted downward as well as upward, potentially, according to prevailing circumstances. In bringing forward this work, we also need to be cognisant of the impact on the wider housing and welfare system. It will be important to consider the impact on the demand for social housing, the risk of creating “false eligibility gateways” and the danger of exacerbating demand-side pressures in the housing market generally. That said, while care will be taken not to increase thresholds to a point where supports are de-targeted from the lowest incomes, an appropriate balance will be struck between adequate eligibility thresholds, on the one hand, and ensuring supports are provided to households with greatest need, on the other. I am pleased to say work has already commenced in this regard. It is being managed by the Housing Agency on my behalf and I expect proposals for a new model to be submitted for my consideration in quarter 1 of next year. While a complex piece of work, when completed it will significantly strengthen the social housing assessment process and place it on a more equitable and sustainable footing. The work is of the utmost importance to me and the Government and is essential in its own right, given the benefit it can yield for so many struggling to make ends meet. However, it is still only one element in a much larger jigsaw under Housing for All. Without substantially increasing supply of housing, public and private, the impact of any changes will be limited, and the year-on-year progress in reducing housing waiting lists could very easily be reversed. In this regard, increasing housing supply continues to be my No. 1 priority. Boosting housing supply is key to resolving the housing crisis. It will help us better meet demand while also moderating rental costs and house price inflation. It is very easy to ignore the reality that housing supply in Ireland, like much of the EU, has been impacted by Covid-19 and the Russian invasion of Ukraine earlier this year, with rising inflation, labour and supply chain disruptions, and reduced construction activity. The progress we are making is not often acknowledged by the Opposition but we will move on from that. Last year, we delivered just shy of 21,000 homes and not only will we meet this year's target of 24,600, but we will likely significantly surpass it. By the end of September this year, we had already exceeded last year's output and we are optimistic that we may in fact hit, if not exceed, 28,000 new build completions this year. Moreover, while we have seen the number of planning permissions and commencements decline in recent months against a backdrop of market uncertainty, rising interest rates and viability challenges, the prospects for 2023 are equally positive. The significant uplift in supply in recent years should continue and we expect to come very close to the target of 29,000 set out in Housing for All for 2023. The recent slowdown in construction activity may yet impact delivery in 2024. However, here again, the Government has responded quickly and with certainty to tackle emerging viability challenges and ensure planning permissions translate into commencements and, in turn, completions. Key measures, among others, include the introduction of the first home scheme in July this year, and we are already seeing people able to buy their home at an affordable rate, with over 700 approvals since July and growing. The significant investment of €450 million for Croí Conaithe will help to further activate supply. There have been strong expressions of interest in Project Tosaigh, through the Land Development Agency, to activate stalled planning permissions and bring forward affordable and social housing in those developments that would not otherwise have been built. I expect to be able to provide an update on that to the House early in quarter 1, hopefully in January. I have recited it often but it is worth repeating that the Government is providing record funding to address and increase the supply of social, affordable and private housing - more than €4 billion annually. We have a costed and comprehensive plan that is taking hold and gaining momentum. It will deliver the scale of social, affordable and private homes required to resolve this housing crisis, providing 90,000 social homes and at least 54,000 affordable purchase and cost rental homes over its lifetime. Next year alone, local authorities and approved housing bodies, which play a crucial role in delivering social housing, particularly in our two main cities of Dublin and Cork, will deliver almost 12,000 social homes through build, acquisition and leasing, and the vast majority of these will be new builds, which is the focus I have had in this plan. Some Deputies opposite, in particular Deputy Boyd Barrett, must realise that approved housing bodies build homes too. In addition, 9,000 new tenancies-----

I think even Deputy Boyd Barrett may say that is a significant uplift and it is welcome to the 10,500 households, many of whom I have the pleasure of meeting right across the country, who are getting their safe and secure home for life. What is important as well is that, for the first time in nearly a generation, we will have affordable homes to purchase through our local authorities, through the first home scheme and through the Land Development Agency, which many Deputies opposite also opposed. In addition, there are hundreds of cost rental tenancies in place and hundreds and thousands more on the way. There are massive opportunities for cost rental. We are doing a piece of work in regard to a further revision of cost rental and we have made changes to the cost rental equity loan, CREL, scheme funding arrangements which have already yielded results, with additional cost rental schemes coming over the last few weeks.

Also, just this week, I approved another 142 cost rental tenancies which will be delivered late this year and early next year. There is a really strong pipeline coming through. We would always look at acquisition, which is important, where appropriate. We are looking at schemes at the moment. I have already mentioned dormant or stalled planning permissions, where we are looking at partnering or purchasing to deliver affordable and social homes. I want to use the opportunity to reiterate the importance of the purchase for tenants in situ scheme. We have made it abundantly clear to local authorities and I also ask Deputies to be very clear. All local authorities have been instructed that where a home is being sold where there is a tenant in situ who is a HAP or RAS tenant, they are to buy that home.There are more than 700 such tenants and the number is growing every day. I will be providing a breakdown, as I have committed to doing, when we have the data between the purchase with the tenants in situ together with pure acquisitions. That is having an impact and I ask Deputies, if they come across any cases where they believe the local authority is not acting on that, to let me know directly. I have received some cases where we have been able to help move them through. I have met directly with every chief executive in the country and every director of service for housing, and I met them again the week before last by way of a webinar, to reiterate the point. This power has been devolved to them, they now have the power and the resources to do this, and I want them to do it. This is a good measure in increasing our social housing stock and, most importantly, in ensuring that where people who have received a notice to quit in those two categories I have mentioned, they are able to purchase the home and to secure that home for those people for life. I want to reiterate one thing as I am aware Deputy Boyd Barrett was not here for the very start of my opening remarks. The changes I have made in respect of the income threshold of €5,000 is an interim step. I have brought in a transitionary measure. Many Deputies both in government and in opposition have raised cases with me where people were marginally over the limit over the past year. I thank my officials for the work they have done. They have worked through this with local authorities and there is a retrospective nature to this in the form of a look-back provision that can go back 14 months. If someone is taken off the list, he or she can reapply and go back on the list at the space they were on, with additional time added for the period they were off the list. I have asked each local authority to contact directly in writing those applicants or people who would have been moved off that list. People will have to reapply then and will then get back to their original place on the list. They will have until 30 June next year to do that. I will be bringing forward in the first quarter of next year the recommendations and proposals around a new social housing income scheme which will be more flexible than the ones we have been dealing with, in particular since 2011. I have outlined that already in my remarks which, I believe, have been circulated to Deputies. I look forward with interest to the Deputies' contributions. As I did at the outset to Deputy Ó Broin when was the only Member here on time, I wish the other Deputies a very happy Christmas. I hope they get a break, spend time with family and friends, and I thank them for all for their engagement during the course of the year. While I have not always agreed with everything, it has been interesting.

In that, I include all of the official Oireachtas staff, the clerks, the ushers, and let us not forget the catering staff, the cleaners and, in particular at this time of the year, the long-suffering Bills Office staff who have to deal with enormous volumes of legislation at the last minute, and do so with exceptional professionalism. We all owe them a debt of gratitude. As the Minister knows, our party members, along with others and many in his own party, have been calling for an increase in and widespread reform of social housing income eligibility thresholds for quite some time. As the Minister himself has said, they have not been changed since 2011. Notwithstanding the fact that real incomes have not increased significantly since then, we all have many examples of hard-working modest and low-income constituents who have either been denied access to social housing support or, indeed, been removed from the social housing list, in many cases losing significant numbers of years on a list because of the failure of governments to act on this issue. When the decision was announced to increase the threshold by €5,000, we all welcomed this, and how could one not? The decision itself, however, raises a whole set of questions, and even with the publication of the review of the income eligibility thresholds that were subsequently published, many of the questions have still not been answered, notwithstanding the fact the Minister is talking about a wider reform which will take place at a later stage. There is a need for a better understanding of why he has taken these decisions at this point. I am not so sure we will get that today given the nature of a Dáil debate, but I have a recommendation which I would like the Minister to consider at the end. My first issue is that I still do not understand where the €5,000 came from. In the first instance, it is always good to understand the rationale for it. I have read the eligibility review report twice and it does not explain in any clear or concise way where that threshold came from. While I welcome the clarification the Minister has given us today on the retrospective nature of it back to 2021, a point I will come back to later, it is just not clear why that figure of €5,000 was picked. In fact, when I read some of the report, it seems the underlying logic of decisions that were made subsequently has less to do with whether that is a sufficient amount of income to meet the needs of low and modest income working people but, rather, has more to do with the absence of an increase in Exchequer expenditure in respect of direct housing provision, as the report at one point states. There seems to be a concern that if we were to increase the threshold by too much, even if people needed it, that might have an adverse impact on the size of waiting lists, the length of waiting times etc. If that is the case, that is the wrong way to make such a decision. The second issue I will raise is the continuation of the three bands system, even on an interim basis, which I believe is crazy. It would have been a very small number of households, according to the Minister’s own report, which would have been brought into the social housing support net if the remaining five counties had been brought into band 2. There is just no logic to this, and in fact the Minister’s own departmental report says a table that discusses this matter illustrates that the current three band structure is no longer internally logical given the movement of rents over time. I just do not understand why band 3 remains. I am not arguing against bands. There is a certain logic or validity to having some differentials between the very high areas, predominantly urban and commuter belt counties, and others, but those five counties which remain in the lowest band are getting a very raw deal, particularly given what is happening in rents in some of those counties. That is going to cause significant difficulties. There are two other areas I wish to refer to which do not seem to receive any meaningful consideration in the report. The first is the thresholds for additional members of a household. It is referred to but there is no consideration of it. In particular, one of my concerns is that we have a growing number of adult children who do not want to remain in the family home after they reach working age but are forced to because of the rental crisis. There is no consideration of whether there could be some level of disregard for their income, given the fact they do not want to be there. Again, I have had cases in my constituency where somebody has turned 18 or 19, gets a job and puts the family off the list. In one case the family lost 11 years on the list because of that. For rent-setting purposes, I know income should be taken into account, but given those people will be living in that household on a temporary basis until they get accommodation, that is unfortunate. Likewise with income disregards, I have never understood why people in receipt of the working family payment could be removed from the list. It is one of the things that even one some of the Minister’s own back bench colleagues have been raising for some time. I had a very sad case of a family who were awarded family income supplement, as it was called at the time, where as a consequence of that they were €1,000 a year over the list threshold, lost their list position, and then, because they had to pay the housing assistance payment, HAP, were much worse off financially. They will not benefit from any of this because they are outside the scope of the Minister’s retrospection. The family income supplement and the working family payment, given it is a recognition by the State that this household does not earn enough money to meet a basic standard of living, should be disregarded. I urge the Minister to consider that in his wider review. The other issues I was going to raise have been outlined now by the Minister as part of his future review. I will, therefore, comment on a couple of those. I would say, however, that given that it took such a long time to get to this interim measure, I certainly hope it does not take as long to get to the end of the review. I am not making that as a partisan remark. The Minister was given the report of the review of the income eligibility in November of 2021. He has not produced anything comprehensive since then and has produced, as he has admitted himself today, relatively minor and modest interim measures. If it takes as long or longer to produce anything more comprehensive, the five years of this Government’s term of office may be over before anybody gets the benefit of those.In addition, all those people who lost out in the meantime may not get the benefit of any of these measures and, therefore, time is absolutely of the essence. One of the issues in the report that concerned me was there seemed to be an implication that when the report assessed affordability for low-income households just above the threshold, it used 35% of net disposable income on rent as a measure. That does not work for households which should be in receipt of social housing. That is why we have differential rent of 10%, 15% or 17%. I urge the Minister, in his further review work, to have a much clearer and more appropriate metric for determining what eligibility may or may not be, because some of the data on this are quite concerning in that respect. Index linking would be very valuable. We should not wait another ten years for further changes. There has to be some mechanism, whether it is linked to wages or rents, or some index that could be prescribed by way of regulation. It would be very valuable to capture information on those two things. I also have no idea why a significant chunk of the section of the report on affordable schemes and cost rental is redacted. I have a strong idea of what the information is on that. It should be published for all to see. It makes no sense to me whatsoever. I urge the Minister to republish the report without redactions. I am very disappointed that even in this interim measure, the flexibility we have called on the Minister to introduce with respect to the 12-month look-back on income assessments has not been introduced. Deputy Boyd Barrett and I have been working on a case together for a very long time. In this instance, that case would be resolved because of the raising of the thresholds, although this would follow a year of extreme trauma and emotional discomfort for the family in question. The 12-month look-back is badly designed, however. It is too inflexible and needs to be resolved. I urge the Minister to give greater clarity on it. At this point, some of our local authorities are applying a deliberately rigid interpretation to try to force the Minister's hand, which is a very bad way to operate. In the absence of the Minister introducing flexibility on that, it will a cause a problem. I am happy to discuss that at a later stage. The Minister needs to come before the Joint Committee on Housing, Heritage and Local Government early next year - I will raise that with colleagues - and not just regarding this report. I understood the Housing Agency did some work on foot of receipt of this report. I presume there has also been some dialogue with the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Finance. The joint committee should be given all of that information. Let us have a very thorough discussion of this with other Members, such as Deputy Boyd Barrett, who are not on the committee but regularly attend its meetings, to inform the Minister's work in order that the subsequent review to the review of the review he is now undertaking can be done in a timely and comprehensive manner. This measure is good for those people who benefit from it but many people have been left behind. The sooner we deal with those people the better.

I was relieved to see the increase. It is not perfect. There are questions and issues to be addressed, but I was relieved. The issue of income thresholds was something we increasingly saw in our offices. It created a number of problems. It added to the group of people who fell in that gap between being able to afford a commercial mortgage and qualifying for social housing. That is still very significant. While we can talk about cost rental, cost purchase and so on, it is not anywhere near enough to the income scales. I have previously raised with the Minister the need to significantly increase the targets in that regard. The second problem the thresholds created was for people who were just in or around the income limits and were removed from the housing lists. I do not think that was the intention but last year's circular added to that problem because there was an increased rigidity to the approach taken by local authorities. I met with officials from the Department - I thank them for meeting me - on that issue, which unintentionally added to the problem. For those of us fortunate enough to be in a position to buy or own homes, and to live in homes we buy, we think in terms of deposits, equity and so on. The phrase I always use in respect of people on social housing lists is that time spent on the list is "money in the bank". I believe the Minister understands this but I am not sure that everyone in this institution understands that this time is equivalent to money in the bank. It is tangible and something people come to rely upon. When that is removed from them, it is a crushing blow. I welcome the fact there is a look-back. It should be longer because this problem has been going on for a long time. This issue is potentially likely to arise again. I will make a suggestion. Of course, inflation will continue and wages will potentially increase and so on but I am of the view that local authorities should be in a position to indefinitely pause or freeze an application. Anyone can have a good year or two. That does not mean they will ever be in a position to buy their own homes in the long run. A file could be put on ice for a year or two and if after two years people do not accumulate credit time but exceed it, they could then be restored to their place on previous credit time.

The increase in income thresholds is very welcome. I believe the levels should be greater than what is proposed. Inflation, which will continue, was mentioned. The thresholds have to be more flexible. We have called for an increase for years. For too long, workers and families have been penalised for getting slight pay rises into better paying jobs. I spoke to a number of employers this week who said they looked to increase staff wages but their employees said not to do that. It is very important we ensure that people get a fair reward for work that does not hinder their prospects of getting a new home. It is always shocking to see the councils, as has been mentioned, being very rigid in removing people from the housing lists. People are then caught. They cannot afford to rent, certainly not in Dublin Bay South, where rents are exorbitant. I looked at Daft.ie earlier; it is €4,500 a month for a three-bedroom apartment in that location. When you think about it, it is daft that any family would have to pay that. People are then caught in limbo in low-standard accommodation. They are trying to rent, cannot get public housing and cannot afford to buy their own place. That is a huge issue. I welcome the increase. It should be more. The retrospective period should be longer because people have come to me, and other colleagues, regarding that.
#GeraldNash	unknown-#GeraldNash-party	unknown-#GeraldNash-dob	unknown-#GeraldNash-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	276	I appreciate the opportunity to speak on this important debate. It is important that we have the opportunity to make statements and have a debate on this very important social issue we have been grappling with for quite some time. I also wish the Minister of State, Deputy James Browne, the Minister and all their colleagues a happy Christmas. I thank, as other colleagues have, all the staff in this institution, and the Minister's staff in the Department, who he has kept especially busy over the past period. The Minister is one of the few people who is not too nervous as he enters this weekend. In fact, Deputy Boyd Barrett may have done him a favour this week with the no confidence motion, which turned into a confidence motion. His position is probably now more galvanised than ever. I wish everybody across the Chamber, and all those who support the work of this House, well over the Christmas period, in addition to a happy, healthy and peaceful new year. As I said, this is an important debate. I welcome any initiative by the Government to help support people who require additional security and supports to keep a roof over their heads. There are a multiplicity of reasons the income thresholds have not been amended for a decade or more. We will see 16,000 more individuals and households captured by the increase in the income threshold over the next period. The Minister asked us to consider these measures in the context of the overall jigsaw that is Housing for All, an initiative all of us on the Opposition side of the House criticised and critiqued at length when debating the motion of confidence earlier this week.We do not have faith that Housing for All will achieve even its own modest stated objectives. That is why we in the Labour Party believe that we should be spending at least €1.5 billion more on social and affordable housing next year. The reality is that, when we bring an additional 16,000 households into the ambit of the social housing scheme by way of changes to the income thresholds, we will still have too many people chasing too few properties in the private rental market. That, in itself, will have an impact on the economics of this matter. It is described as an interim measure. As the Minister said earlier, he intends to develop a more sustainable and modern model. That model needs to be capable of capturing changes in the employment market, changing wage rates and changing rates of inflation. It needs to be nimble and agile enough to respond to such changes so that we do not leave people behind, we avoid cliff edges and we avoid the poverty traps we experienced with the old rent supplement system. Colleagues have mentioned individual cases they have been dealing with that illustrate the problems with the income thresholds and some of the issues in that regard. I deal with such cases all the time. I was recently dealing with the case of a family who are now being threatened with removal from the social housing system because adult children have returned in recent years, a situation Deputy Ó Broin referenced, which is having an impact on the overall net household income. As the Minister of State will understand, that is problematic. We need to be very conscious of this area given the reality and the lived experience of far too many people these days as a result of the inadequacy of housing supply and the reality of adult children in their 20s, 30s and, in some cases, 40s returning home to live with parents who are on a housing assistance payment by virtue of being on the social housing waiting list. I hope that any new model will reflect that reality and be able to absorb such circumstances. I wish to make one more point, which is a significant one. The current system, with all its rigidities, does not capture this reality. There are three bands. That needs to be addressed while ensuring policy consistency across the system. I will raise an issue that routinely comes up in my own constituency. The challenge of house prices in the southern part of my constituency, that is, south Louth, Drogheda and east Meath, is more akin to that in Meath and north County Dublin. Housing happens to be much cheaper, albeit still not available to the extent that we would like, in areas like Dundalk and Ardee. I would make the case that any new system or model will need to take account of those realities within counties. I would make the case for intracounty thresholds to be introduced, reflecting the reality of the housing cost challenge within counties. I know this is something the Minister and the Department are aware of. It is a constant challenge for Louth County Council. As I said at the outset, we welcome any initiative that is designed to financially support those who are in difficulty in keeping a secure roof over their heads or in obtaining housing. We look forward to working with the Minister on a new model that is sustainable and agile enough to respond to changes as they occur or at least on an annual basis.

They are very timely. The old limits, which were set in 2011, belonged to a totally different world. Over the years, when I asked when these changes would take place, I got the tired old answer that the matter was being studied. For those who were suffering under incredibly low thresholds, being told that the system was being looked at did not give much satisfaction. I am glad the Minister just went and did the simple thing. I often think that, in politics, we have an infinite ability nowadays to make the simple things complicated and to leave people who need something hanging on and not able to get it. Under the previous limits, I encountered the absolutely ridiculous situation in my constituency of people with big families whose sole income came from the Department of Social Protection - there might have been a carer's allowance thrown in for a child with a disability but the sole income was from the Department - being over the income threshold. I know of one family who moved from County Galway to Galway city, where they were just under the threshold because a different band applied. The rents at the edge of Galway city are no different from those just into the county area. The Minister made a welcome move in giving Galway county two jumps. He moved it from band 3 to band 2 and then gave the same general rise that was given across the country. That rose the income limit by €10,000. I welcome that. The decision made is very welcome and timely. It is simple but it is a big improvement for those who come into our offices looking to get on the housing list. Of course, the system is afraid of encouraging demand. However, demand can only be encouraged among people who need a house. Most people who have the opportunity to buy a house would do so in preference to getting a local authority house because then it is theirs and they can do what they want with it. I do not believe there are too many people seeking to get on a housing list who are otherwise able to buy a house. It is a spurious argument. It is interesting that, up to 2011, there was no income limit at all in some local authority areas. If people said they needed to, they could go on the list. This is fascinating. It would be very interesting to look at whether the demand was absolutely enormous in those counties or whether they did not have an income limit because the demand was not big and because home ownership was more affordable in those counties because lots of people were able to build on their own sites. The next point I will make in the few minutes I have is that we are great at getting experts and academics to look at things. I am not against that if the second part of the process is followed. No matter how many degrees he or she has or how scholarly he or she is, someone who is far removed from an issue will take an academic approach to life and is very likely to come up with a scheme that is based on what he or she perceives to be the way in which people should act. However, we all know from our constituency clinics that the way people actually act in this world is much more varied and complex and is not necessarily the way people should theoretically act. We all have experience of people in very similar circumstances coming to us. Whether they own their house or are looking to get a local authority house and no matter what their life circumstances are, you will find that different people handle money very differently. Some people can make money go much further. Some people on very modest incomes could aspire to own a home and, if given the money, could get a loan for a house and pay it back. Such people did in the past when things were a bit easier. There are other people who might have a higher income but who would never be able to handle that for one reason or another. I am not making any moral judgments. I am saying that this is what you find. Life is complex and the theoretical models people create often do not match the realities of people's lives. The income limits should be set in a way that allows for an overlap up to the threshold at which people can get a loan to buy a house. Let us be honest about it, some people on quite reasonable incomes find it very difficult to get even the State loans from the local authorities. These are hard-working people. It is possible to find out by practice the level at which the vast majority of people can get a loan. This becomes one threshold. The people beneath that level would be eligible for local authority housing. It cannot be that the cut-off level is that of the most parsimonious, the most careful, the most prudent or the most whatever. It is necessary to take a much more nuanced view. I also think that sometimes changes are made and the system thinks it has come up with great ideas. The first bad idea was the housing assistance payment, HAP. If people are now eligible for permanent local authority housing, then they are also eligible for HAP. If the limit is raised for one, it is also immediately raised for the other. This has consequences. It does not allow for much social nuance in the way the old system did, where we had the social welfare system paying the mortgage or rental supplement. That system was completely independent of eligibility for housing and was done on a different type of means assessment. The two systems were not inexplicably linked and the accusation could not be levelled that private rents were being increased. One of the problems we all know about concerning the HAP system is that it is a great rent inflator. The landlord gains but not the tenant. They are just chasing each other around. Money is then being put into pockets way above the differential rents to try to make up the difference. This is a very flawed system. The answer to all of this, of course, is to build more houses. It is very simple. One other major change, though, would be to bring the limits down. By being very fussy about eligibility, we have stopped working people being eligible for local authority houses. We have reduced the social mix in housing estates. In my constituency, certainly, the only people eligible are those who are unemployed. We therefore get issues regarding the public perception of social housing, which was not as prevalent in the past, if we go back to the time between the 1930s and the 1960s, when most people who would have been in social housing were working people with jobs. I would like to see many more integrated estates, and raising the income limits is key to achieving this aim. People who make the jump from being dependent on welfare into work should not be immediately cut off. To come to a parochial point, regarding a big issue in Galway, when people apply to Galway City Council for housing, a choice of areas is allowed where people would like to live. There is Galway city east and Galway city west, but it is also possible to put down the county area as a choice. This is the area of Galway County Council. When people apply for housing to that local authority, they can put down areas in the county, but also those in the city. I have yet, however, to see anybody on the city list getting a house in the county and, even more so, it is highly unlikely that anybody on the county list will get a house in the city, because there is huge pressure on housing there. After about five, six, seven, eight or even nine years, the people who put down the option, in good faith, of the city and then county, thinking they would be assessed and considered in the county, equal to everybody else who was same length of time on the list, find they are not really being considered at all by the local authority with which they are not registered. These people are then on the horns of a dilemma. If, for example, they change from the city list to the county list, which would not be as long and they might be more likely to get a house, they then find they have to go back to the end of the queue. I have contacted the Department, because this policy is Department-driven. It was part of its great amalgamation plan, regarding the two local authorities in Galway, that they wanted this area to stretch from the River Suck in Ballinasloe all the way west out to Clifden, Inishbofin and Ballyconneely. This is halfway across the country and more. It is time the Department resolved this issue and said that people on the city or county list should be considered equally for their earlier preference, regardless of which list they are on. As we said several elections ago, a lot has been done in the past two years, but nothing was done in the previous nine years except regression. A lot has been done and there is a lot more to do. Until everybody has the opportunity to get permanent, secure tenancies, we cannot rest on our laurels.

This was long overdue. For many people, this will make a difference. I come from the Harbour View Road in Knocknaheeny, which is a social housing estate. The provision of social housing gives people, especially working-class people, the opportunity to have homes of their own. My father still lives in Knocknaheeny. He was able to buy his house under the tenant purchase scheme, and my two sisters and I were able to buy or build our own houses. What was important, though, was having the safety net of social housing. I highlight the importance that social housing holds for people and communities. This is why this increase is so important. Deputy Ó Cuív mentioned the social mix, and he is right. What we have now with the current situation is that anyone who does better for themselves, who gets a better job or has more people in the family working, will find they are being denied access to social housing because they go over the limit. I dealt with a case of a family where, during Covid, the husband got a promotion in work. After almost 13 years on the social housing list, this man and his family were finally able to get a house in an area they wanted to live in. The family went in, got assessed and then got Garda vetted perfectly. Going through their finances then, though, they found they were €800 over the limit. This was after this family had been waiting for 13 years and after they had done everything right. This man was absolutely distraught. Where was the fairness and justice for him? Now that we are looking at this issue, I ask the Minister to consider some discretion that local authorities could give to people who were under the threshold but may have gone over it in the past year or two. I know dozens of people who have gone over the threshold by small amounts. I am talking about a couple of hundred euro. Will the Minister look at this issue, consider the people who came off the list in recent years and contemplate some allowance or consideration for these people? People have been waiting nine, ten, 11 and 12 years or more. I sincerely ask the Minister to look at this issue to explore what can be done for these people and families. The other issue I wish to discuss concerns affordable housing schemes. These were supposed to provide an opportunity of home ownership for those above the social housing income thresholds. For some people, this increase will bring them back under the threshold and this is welcome. The pricing of these schemes for many people, though, is not affordable. We have schemes in Cork where the minimum price is €300,000. The income threshold for a large family on the social housing list previously would have been €42,000. This now means someone earning €43,000 will not be able to afford to buy a home for €300,000. It is just impossible. We must help people and bring affordability back because many people are not going to be able to access affordable housing. The situation we have now is that some people can access social housing, some can access affordable housing and others can get private housing.We have people who are trapped in the middle again and that needs to be looked at. There are people spending ten, 11, 12 or even 14 years on housing lists. How can this be considered social housing when people are waiting that length of time and when there are children growing up in housing assistance payment, HAP, tenancies, some of which are poor accommodation? They are losing their childhood. We have had local authorities before the Joint Committee on Housing, Local Government and Heritage, of which I am a member, for the past couple of weeks and they tell us that if they meet all the Government targets for delivery of social, affordable and cost-rental housing, the housing lists will be bigger in 2026 than they are now. The only solution to social housing is the provision and the building of more housing. Local authorities are not doing direct builds. That is something on which the Minister needs to work with local authorities. I live in Gurranabraher. It was built 80 years ago by the old Cork County Council. We need to get back to doing that.

The Minister has a tendency to leave the Chamber during these debates before either I or Deputy Boyd Barrett speak. We do not take that personally. We merely note it. I will extend Happy Christmas wishes to all my other colleagues in the Dáil, and especially to all the staff who do tremendous work, including the cleaning staff, the catering staff and the ushers, and very much the staff of the Oireachtas service in the Bills Office, who are put under pressure at the end of term in a way they should not be in terms of legislation being rushed through. It would be good in future years if that were not done. All of us are mindful at this time of year of all the people without homes at Christmastime. This year, to our shame as a national parliament, the number of people living in homeless emergency accommodation is at its highest ever level. The impact that has on all the individuals and the families and the children without a home this Christmas is immense. We were told, especially during the freezing weather conditions, that there is no shortage of emergency beds for people who are homeless and are sleeping rough. I challenge some of the commentary around that because it is still the case that some people are refused access to emergency accommodation. There was a student from Brazil recently who became homeless and was refused access to emergency accommodation. Then there are complexities around people who are offered a bed but for whom the offers that are made to them are, for various reasons, wholly inappropriate. There is some badly run private emergency accommodation in this country. I do not refer to all providers. Some people have left that emergency accommodation and feel safer sleeping on the street because they have been robbed and assaulted. That includes, in one hostel, being robbed and assaulted by staff in the hostel. There is a lack in some of the privately run emergency accommodation of any professionally trained social care staff. We have situations where the only security couples who are homeless have in their lives is their relationship and they are told they can get into emergency accommodation but they will have to break up, literally bringing us back to the conditions of the poor houses when family units were broken up. Horrifically, people who have been sexually assaulted and who do not feel safe sharing accommodation with people from whom they feel at risk are told this is their only option, with the result they feel their only option is to sleep rough. We cannot be silent on those issues. On these measures, while this is a welcome step forward from what has happened, the delay in doing this has caused untold trauma, distress, anxiety, mental health problems and some very severe problems for people who have been getting knocked off the list. These measures will not sort the situation out for everyone. It is a pity this was not done sooner and had not been delayed. On a human level, given what this has done to some people, it is unforgivable it has taken so much time to do this. I am aware, as we all are, of people who have gone through absolute hell as a result of this. It has had all sorts of consequences. I am aware, as others would be, of people who worked overtime during Covid to keep food production going in factories who do not get overtime otherwise. They were doing overtime because there were people out because of Covid. They will not get the chance to do this again or to get an increase, and they are getting knocked off the list. We have people in other situations working hard and getting promotions in work who are getting knocked off the list but who have no possibility of being able to buy and have a secure home of their own. According to the Minister's comments, the €5,000 threshold is effectively arbitrary and he will get experts to look at the thresholds and the models. If that is the case, as the Minister has said, I do not understand why it has taken him so long to do this as a temporary measure. I echo the real issue of adult children either returning home or taking up part-time jobs at a relatively younger age of 18, 19 or 20 and that having the effect of, all of a sudden, knocking the household off the list. That has to be addressed. We are talking about adult children who would like to move out and find somewhere affordable to rent. They may even have moved out and had to come back because otherwise they would be homeless. They have no other options. That having the effect of knocking the family off the list is cruel and unfair and has to be addressed. The Minister talked about wanting to broaden the base in terms of public housing and mixed communities, but he has failed dismally to do that in his term of office. The Minister is halfway through his term now, and if he wants to do this, I would urge him to get on with it. Having sat on a report for this long only to tell us he needs to get more expertise and more reports does not show any commitment or the urgency we need on this.

This is something I first brought up in the Dáil on 15 February of this year. I will speak in the context of what I know best, which is my own constituency of Limerick city and north Tipperary. I am conscious there is a Tipperary Deputy present. I refer to Newport, Ballinahinch and Birdhill, to be more precise, in Tipperary. Constituents of mine were not qualifying for the local authority housing. They were above the income limit, in many cases only barely above. I had a look at the previous scheme. It had an increase of €5,000 and, at that time, the average industrial wage was €38,500. I looked at the average industrial wage today. At roughly €46,000, it is approximately a 20% increase. I looked at the bands. There are bands 1, 2 and 3. Band 1 is the higher band. That was €35,000 and it has gone now to €40,000. Band 2, which relates to my constituency of Limerick city, is going from €30,000 to €35,000. Band 3, which is going from €25,000 to €30,000, would include Tipperary. I took it that the €5,000 was effectively a 20% increase on the €25,000 and I put that proposal directly. I was not aware of any report that was being completed or the details of that. For me, it was quite logical. The income limit for social housing should be based on the average industrial wage at a particular time. I very much welcome the measure. That is the logic for me.We have to look at the average industrial wage and benchmark social housing against it. It will make a huge difference to people in my constituency whereby they will qualify for the social housing list and the housing assistance payment. In the long term they will qualify for a local authority house in a number of years. This will give them security. Many of them have no possibility of getting a mortgage. I have a fundamental principle that I hold to. Everyone should aspire to have their own home and be able to aspire, if they can afford it, to purchase a house. This is why we want to make it affordable. There are situations where the State must step in. This is done through the local authority housing lists. Many people in time end up purchasing by way of a tenant purchase scheme. This is a natural progressive way of doing it. I commend the Minister on introducing this. I feel very strongly about this. I deal with it every day in my constituency. This will involve 16,000 people nationwide. This will include a substantial portion of people in my constituency. I will be able to get them on the social housing list. The number on the list will increase but I do not have an issue with this. We have to look at what the realities are. For the next cohort of people who are above the income limit of €35,000 in Limerick and €30,000 in Tipperary, we must get them to qualify to purchase their own home. There is a local authority affordable housing scheme. At present it has discounts of between 15% and 40%. If the discount is above 20%, people will not qualify for the help-to-buy scheme. I have made a proposal in the House, which is with the Department of Finance, that if the discount is above 20%, the loan-to-value ratio would not be based on the market value of the house but the discounted value of the house versus the mortgage. This would mean people would qualify for the help-to-buy scheme. Furthermore, it would give scope to the Government to provide grants larger than €75,000, which applies where the density is between 35 and 50 per hectare. If the density per hectare is below 35, the grant is €50,000, and if it is above 50, it is €100,000. This would provide scope for the Government to give a higher grant to the builder. We must make houses affordable so that people can buy them and make them viable for builders to build them. If the State has to step in and provide a higher grant and take an equity stake for that grant, so be it. This is how we will get affordable houses built. I have made a calculation. If a house is worth €300,000 and there is a 40% discount, at four times' earnings, someone on a salary of €41,000 will qualify under the scheme. This would mean the State would take a 40% stake in the house and the individual would have 60% but they could purchase it back over time. It is about an amalgam of issues. There are other issues we need to consider. As it stands at present, any land purchased prior to July 2021 is not required to have Part V affordable housing if planning permission is obtained prior to July 2026. I would like to see this changed. Every new estate built should automatically have 10% affordable housing. We pay the builders what they require financially to be able to build these houses. This is about money. I am very open. Local authorities can build. Developers and private builders have skill sets we cannot ignore. We must work with them to build. I want to see every private estate being built having 10% of houses available for affordable housing. As it stands at present, many do not because the land was purchased prior to July of last year. They are not required to provide affordable housing if planning permission is obtained before July 2026. There are 70,000 houses and apartments with planning permission in the system. Not every one of these will be built or viable. We need to look at them and see which can be built, fast-track building them and work with the developers and owners of the sites. They do not require planning permission. This is another way to get houses built quickly. We need to make people fully aware of all of the schemes such as Croí Cónaithe. In Limerick, the living city initiative is very important. I have got the scheme further revised so that the incentives available for people who will live in the city centre are now increased. It is all about affordability. It is all about catering for every area of society. The increase of €5,000 in the income limit reflects the realities. The benchmark is the average industrial wage. People on the average industrial wage cannot get a mortgage. They are paying very high rents. Now, at least, many of them will be under the limit. People might say it does not go far enough. It is about making certain we bring in something that caters for the realities. We need to ensure everyone above the social housing income limits is able to purchase homes. If the State has to take equity stakes in these houses, I have no issue with that. If we have to work with builders and developers, I have no issue with that. It is all about controls. It is all very well to say the State can build everything. If local authorities are building houses, who will build them for them? It is builders. They will go out to tender. Those builders have to make a return. It is frustrating for me because people come to me with termination notices or because they want to purchase houses that are not available. It is all about supply. If we build houses, it will take pressure off the rental market with regard to demand. We are building 28,000 units this year. These are very welcome. It will be a similar number next year. We should be looking to exceed this. Where are the areas we can do this? We can look at the 70,000 units that have planning permission to see which of them are viable and progress them. I expect not all of them will be progressed but a certain share of them will be. We can get these built. Following this we need to look at the local authority affordable housing scheme to make sure people can qualify for the help-to-buy scheme where the discounts they receive are 20%. The rules on density should not be applied universally throughout the country. There are areas where very high density is not appropriate. There are also areas where it is. The blanket model does not work. The problem is we must think outside the box. We must build the type of units people want to purchase. What do people want? They want starter homes, terraced homes and, in the main, semi-detached houses. This is an area we need to push. We need apartments but not exclusively.

We are still not reaching that minimal figure. The Deputy's argument is right but there is also another argument. A colleague of Deputy O'Donnell in government, Deputy Ó Cuív, said there should not be a threshold and that people should be allowed to be on the social housing list if they want to be on it.Those who want to be on it would be on it, and those who want to be on the affordable housing list would be on the same list but they would be able to afford to purchase the property if that was their wish. There would be differential rent. There is a way of dealing with this, but we have made a basket case of it in this country. I refer to those who are lucky enough to have a job, such as a general operative in a council. If he or she is married and both of them are working, they are off the list. That is absolute madness. That is because the threshold imposed never grew. If it was right in the first place, it would have been indexed linked. One of the problems with the thresholds of the HAP scheme, and rental allowance before that, is that it was chasing the figures that were being set by the industry and chasing a reduced number of properties. The Minister was correct when he said we need more houses. Everyone in the Chamber agrees with that but we need them now. We need them built quickly. We also need to stop institutions competing against young couples who have an income. In part of the constituency that I and Deputy Joan Collins represent, there are old Dublin City Council properties. They are concrete houses that are not going to fall down but they are not plush houses and do not have huge amounts of land. They are selling for €400,000. The people who grew up in those estates and were born in those houses cannot afford them. They are being forced outside the city and, once again, as happened during the Celtic tiger years, they are being forced out of their own areas where they grew up and went to school. There is no possibility of them affording or renting them. The cost to rent a house in Ballyfermot on Decies Road, a road on which I lived not long ago, is €2,500. It is absolute madness for any society to allow that amount of rent to be demanded for a house. A house next door is being sold for nearly €300,000, which is again absolute madness. We have to get to grips with this. More houses must be built but we also have to be realistic that the threshold for social housing is too low. Deputy Ó Cuív and others made the point that if we want a social mix in our communities, we are not going to get it if we force working people out of those communities. Youth workers living in Ballyfermot will not be on the social housing list nor will they be able to afford a house there because their wages are not high enough. That is why an open-ended list would work, as it works in other countries. We still have not got to the stage where the leases for properties are 20, 30 or 40 years long, as they are on the Continent. We should start approaching that and imposing rent limits, as well as rents that are fixed over a period of time. We are way behind where we should be. While the action being taken on income thresholds in Dublin, which come into effect in January, are welcome, it is a small step. It is not going to make a huge bit of difference to a lot of people who have been forced off the list, have lost their time on record and, reluctantly, have to start the process all over again. I thank everybody for their help during the year. Bíodh Nollaig Shona agus séasúr maith agaibh ar fad, agus bíodh sos ag an bhfoireann agus ag na Comhaltaí.

I thank you all and hope you have a good Christmas. A young mother with a teenaged son is watching this debate. She is four years in emergency accommodation. She works as an agency worker for a State agency looking after vulnerable children, which is ironic as her teenaged son's mental health is absolutely on the floor because they have spent four years in emergency accommodation. She was three years on the housing list last November when she was told she was about to be housed. Her income was reviewed and she was then told she was off the list. Not only was she not getting a council house, she was now not entitled to HAP. She had to look for a new place and we had to fight to prevent her from being evicted from the emergency accommodation. There is a lot at stake in this debate. I have been asking for this debate for months. We have been asking for the review of the income thresholds for a decade. In that time, literally tens of thousands of people have been removed from the list. Up to 2019, in the previous five years, the number of people entitled to social housing dropped from 46% to 33%. That rate is now probably below 30%, before the rise in the income threshold comes into effect. Tens of thousands of people have been taken off the housing list and left in limbo. In my area, if you were to pay one third of your income on the average rent, you would need to be earning €84,000. You would need to be earning about €150,000 to pay for the average house price. Although this is welcome, even the mother I mentioned, who is just over the threshold, is not guaranteed that she will get her time back. She just texted about her work saying, "Thanks again. We have critical low levels of staff again and I can't do overtime. I can't go for a promotion either even though I have been encouraged." If she did, she might go over the new thresholds. There are major staffing shortages where she works. That is the position people are in. It is absolutely outrageous and it has gone on for years. A letter that was sent to the Minister on 23 November reads:Dear Minister.I am writing to you today for you to listen to my story. I am a mum of two teenaged girls - 13 years of age and 16 years of age - and a wife to a hard-working honest man who has paid his taxes all his life. We unfortunately cannot fix our situation by ourselves. Our home is being sold. We are being evicted. I am 55 years living in my home. My parents were living in it since 1958. They are since deceased. I was led to believe all my life we were safe, as we were lifelong tenants. When we were in a position a few years ago to get a mortgage, we were told our home was not for sale. Now it is for sale, the bank will not give us a mortgage anymore because of our age and income. The woman who is selling the house doesn't even know me or my family. She is the sister of our landlord who died two years ago. I need you to help us because we cannot fix this situation. We are running out of time. When you are at home at Christmas, sitting having your Christmas dinner and sitting back enjoying your family, please have a picture of my family sitting in our car at the side of the road having no Christmas because we do not have a home. My darling, beloved husband will be put into an early grave as he is a broken man. As the dad of the house, as a husband, he cannot fix this.I do not have time to read all of the letter. That family got a notice from the court, with an enforcement notice, that they will be evicted from their home where they have always paid their rent and did absolutely nothing wrong. They will almost certainly not benefit from the new measures because they will be above the new thresholds. This is a one-income family on an average industrial income. They have no HAP support, nowhere to go and they are pleading for help. What is going to happen to them? Is the Government going to purchase houses in situations where people are not on HAP or RAS, but they clearly do not have the income to afford the rents and house prices I just described? We need to know the answer to this question. They need to know the answer to this question. They cannot be left in a car at the side of the road. If that happens, this State will be a disgrace. Something has to be done about that.I have two cases, the detail of which I will not go through because I do not have time, of to people who, because they were homeless or their family came to join them in the case of a family reunification, had to get properties where they are overcrowded. They could not find anything else. They are not being given HAP because the properties are overcrowded. That is bureaucratic madness. They do not have anywhere else to go but they are not being given HAP. It has to happen. The Government needs to recognise the nurses, teachers and the considerable number of people who cannot afford the rents and house prices. They are not entitled to any support if they are over the threshold. The ultimate answer is to deliver the public and affordable housing on public land that is not being delivered. The real figures for this year are an additional 1,600 AHB and local authority houses as of the first six months of this year, which is pathetic. We need to do something about it such as using the unspent €700 million to buy properties where people have been evicted and getting a higher proportion than the 10% or 20% of social housing, immediately and urgently, to have houses for those people. It also means having thresholds that reckon on the incomes people have as against the rents and house prices in their areas. Otherwise, thousands of working people will be left in a serious position. I hope the Minister is listening.

I hope they enjoy their Christmas and have a healthy and prosperous new year. I recognise is the increase in band 3 to which Deputy O'Donnell referred. We are in band 3 in Tipperary. The increase is most definitely welcome and the €5,000 will bring many more eligible applicants in for housing support and get them on the housing list. I would be a bit greedy and say we need to go higher than €30,000. I have been lobbying for this increase for a number of years and will continue to do so. Even though it is definitely welcome, €30,000 is still a very low threshold. There are families who, even with only one person working outside the house, are unfortunately falling outside the threshold but they cannot afford to build their own house. The threshold needs to be kept under constant review but the increase is most welcome. I will make a few points specifically on issues with housing in County Tipperary. We are a rural county and what applies to some of the major urban centres just does not work well in Tipperary. We need to in reintroduce long-term leasing as an option for small-time landlords. There are no significant commercial land operators in most rural counties and the leasing issues that adversely affected the more urban counties were not an issue in Tipperary. Small private landlords, who are often incidental landlords, provide a useful support service in accommodating those who are in a position to avail of social housing supports. This is especially the case where there is no significant demand that would facilitate a new-build scheme by a local authority in a rural village. A private landlord may well be able to address that need. Such a landlord also acts to ensure the connectedness and support provided by local communities and families are retained in that rural area. The use of leasing for small-time landlords is not expected to be the main challenge of housing delivery but an important ancillary delivery support that will address the needs of particular circumstances. With regard to the commencement of a target leasing scheme to be rolled out by the Housing Agency, it relates to new builds only and is for projects of 20 units or more that can be located around the county. While this is a welcome initiative, it is unlikely to be delivered by developers in my constituency given its rural make-up and will not address the key objective of this proposal. Tipperary also needs to be able to assess units already constructed in small towns and villages. We need a second vacant housing officer given the size and length of Tipperary and the volume of work required to address dereliction and vacancy. Tipperary is a large county and addressing dereliction and vacancy is heavily personnel dependent and is a slow and cumbersome process. Greater activity and results could be generated with a second vacant home officer. A repair and lease scheme could provide for a tax-based incentive scheme for those property owners in towns of 20,000 and less that is targeted at over-the-shop living. The current repair-and-lease scheme, as recently amended, is beginning to attract some attention for the more commercially-minded operators in the county. Most of the upper floors of our towns are owned by individual property owners who are not developers or significant risk takers. They are not willing to access this scheme because it is effectively a loan and there is a strong reluctance to go down this route. To get the upper floors utilised, it is considered a tax-based incentive scheme for those property owners in towns of a population of 20,000 or less will actively generate more interest and update the scheme to release much-needed units for accommodation in our towns. I wish to see the introduction of a targeted, time-limited and location-appropriate tax incentive and other innovative financial support mechanisms that will deliver housing on lands that have planning permission including, but not limited to, reduction of VAT on new builds; an increase in the Central Bank multiplier for purchases to give a better standard of homes being built and lower operational costs of running same; and the consideration of all section-23-type incentives that are targeted, time limited and location specific. The key delivery challenge in Tipperary is the lack of any private sector new builds either for the affordable first-time buyer or the step-up buyer. The view is that a social housing delivery pipeline will address the key net social housing needs by 2026. I compliment Tipperary County Council on exceeding its targets for social housing. However, those citizens who are seeking to purchase their own home or wish to step up to the next home have no opportunity to do so due to a complete lack of activity by the private sector. It is the key dysfunctional element of the housing market in Tipperary. Only 3.8% of all transactions in the county in quarter 1 of 2021 related to new builds and these were generally one-off housing. The view is that it is now essential the Government steps in to assist in the correction of the private housing market, in a limited way and for a limited time, to activate the sector to deliver. It is not reasonable or humane to await the correction of the matter by itself, as citizens are struggling to find accommodation appropriate to their needs and the first home scheme is not set up to assist in addressing the need at this point in time. With regard to a housing for all loan to better accommodate those who cannot access social housing supports, in a number of cases individuals were paying private rent consistently over a number of years on current accommodation and are refused permission for a housing loan on the basis they have no substantial savings in place or a lack of a strong track record on savings. This is despite the fact the private rent being paid would be significantly higher than the monthly loan repayment being sought. Changes should be made to allow for positive consideration of such cases because, if the private rent had been lower, such persons would have been well in position to have a stronger savings record. In addition, the purchase of a property through the housing for all loan scheme will ensure a better quality of life and a more secure accommodation option. Every week I have people coming in to my office who are being refused mortgages by their lending institutions. They are going to the county council but few of them are getting through the hoops. We need to seriously look at this. There has to be a far more lenient attitude to giving people who are paying high rent the loan they need to purchase or build their home. The cap on the first home scheme in Tipperary needs to be raised from €250,000 to €290,000 to facilitate affordable housing development to occur. The current cap under the first home scheme in Tipperary will not facilitate any affordable units to be built or sold to first-time buyers. It appears the cap of €250,000 may be based on the sale price of units Tipperary under the property price register. The number of new builds in Tipperary is negligible and the vast majority of sales are related to second-hand housing units. In quarter 1 of 2022, new build units made up only 3.8% of all transactions in the county. The purchase price point for a standard three-bed new build in Clonmel in 2021 was €270,925 and €194,729 for a second-hand house.Delivery costs of three-bedroom units supplied by Tipperary County Council as part of our social housing stock currently, in 2022, average between €273,333 and €290,000 depending on the town location. The disparity between the cost of delivering a new-build, three-bedroom house and the purchase price of a second-hand, three-bedroom house is significant in Tipperary compared with the model affordability outputs based on the recent residential property price register data and the prices used as part of the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage's toolkit. With rising costs of raw materials, labour and energy prices and expected increases in interest rates, it is anticipated that costs of new houses will increase further, so we urgently need the home first scheme threshold to be increased. No individual will be in a position to purchase affordable housing if the cap is retained at €250,000 for the simple reason that it is not possible to deliver a house under that constraint. The final difficulty with the cap constraint is that Tipperary will continue to be extremely unattractive to developers to build new housing units, notwithstanding that the KPMG report on sub-county housing mixed analysis indicates that a second-hand market is unlikely to be able to accommodate the projected demand for housing, even if the current residential pipeline of existing permissions was activated. I hope that a home first scheme will provide the incentives needed for builders in Tipperary to commence the construction of those sites where active permission is in place, but it now looks very unlikely that the scheme will play any positive role in addressing the issue of housing for those outside the social housing support sector in County Tipperary if the cap constraint is retained at €250,000. I cannot stress how much we need that cap to be increased. The last point I want to make is about holiday homes which received planning permission on the basis that they were to be solely used for that purpose. With the current emergency, the lack of housing for lease and refugees coming into the country, that condition on planning needs to be relaxed. If a person wants to lease that house for a long term or for the purpose of housing refugees, that restraint on planning permission should be removed.

On one hand, we need to increase the thresholds because of the implications of the cost-of-living crisis but I have given examples in the House on multiple occasions of where I believe the Government has contributed to cost of living increases, which we have seen throughout the course of 2022. Naturally, any increase in the cost of living will have the largest impact on those who are least well off in society. Those on lower incomes spend a higher percentage of their incomes on essential items such as food, transport and heating. When those things rise, those on the lowest incomes have to sacrifice something else to help to pay for their essentials. These essentials have all seen large increases in recent months, although thankfully the cost of petrol and diesel is easing at the moment, though no one knows how long it will last. Nonetheless, those on lower incomes will still find it a struggle to make ends meet. This particular proposal to increase the income thresholds will have the most obvious impact on those who are currently just above the threshold to qualify for social housing. Over the past year or so, this cohort of people will have had their ability to save for their own house severely diminished. The added costs of house-building, through material and labour cost increases, also has an impact on the ability of people to buy or build their own home. We as a society and the Government need to examine why this has come to pass. Why are we in a situation where the person in what would traditionally have been described as a good job can no longer afford to buy what would traditionally have been described as an ordinary family home? There are major questions which cannot be addressed by piecemeal legislation or by tinkering around the edges. There are fundamental questions about the state of our country and the social contract which has developed over the decades since independence and is now broken. People above the income threshold are being squeezed in every direction. They cannot apply for a social house and rents in many places are hoovering up any potential for discretionary spending or savings that a person might have. People just below the threshold are turning down certain jobs, as we have heard from many colleagues already, for fear that they may no longer be able to qualify for a social house. The Taoiseach previously told my colleague, Deputy Naughten, that the idea of people not being able to progress in work or get an increase in salary because they would be marginally over the social housing thresholds needed to be relaxed. The income limits for social housing have not increased in line with property prices, which have doubled over the last decade, forcing people to turn down work or face the prospect of homelessness. This has to be turned on its head. Our tax and welfare system must actively support people to return to the workforce in any capacity. Work must always be a better option than welfare in the first place. We should start there with a radical overhaul of the working family payment, both with regard to the exclusions and the rates of support, to always make it financially better for families to access employment regardless of their make-up. On the other side of the coin, will an increase in income thresholds actually help anyone? It goes back to the analogy I used a few weeks ago with regard to the game of musical chairs. There are only so many chairs or, in this case, houses available. If we keep adding participants to the game, they might feel as though they have a chance of success, but the overall picture will simply show that there are still only the same number of participants who end up with a chair or, in this case, a house when the music stops. An increase in the income thresholds would place greater demand on social housing and will ultimately achieve little at the moment other than to increase the length of the waiting lists. Regardless of what the thresholds are, the fundamental issue is that not enough houses are being built, either by the public or private sector. Plans to increase the number of available houses are wonderful but the physical reality is that house-building is not progressing quickly enough to satisfy the demand which has built up. Satisfying the demand involves the State building social homes but also the Government ensuring that the conditions of the market encourage private builders to survive and operate. This includes large developers but small builders are too often forgotten. They have been crucial to our house-building in recent decades but, unfortunately, many were driven out of business by the financial crash and have not exactly been incentivised or encouraged to get back into the industry. In fact, many of the Government's policies have had the opposite effect and have discouraged the small builder. Overall, in light of the current circumstances, I agree that income thresholds should be increased, while recognising that the main issue is the lack of supply and the slowness with which that housing supply is being increased. While there is no shortage of schemes, most are only available if there are houses. Too many current schemes inadvertently increase the cost of building any housing unit. The planning policy dictated by the zealots in the Minister's Department means that the high-density developments are just not viable and will remain on paper rather than ever being built unless serious changes are undertaken.

For me, it sums up Fianna Fáil's approach to social housing. We have a long-standing commitment to the concept of social and public housing. There are criticisms of where that policy differed in the past. I repeat the line that I gave in the motion of confidence in the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, during the week, that a Fianna Fáil Minister in this new Government has provided more money so that local authorities can build more houses, and homes will be available to more people.This increase in the local authority income limits is one example of that. Now the increasing number of local authority houses we are building are available to 16,000 more people. I wish to acknowledge the Minister's bravery, though maybe that is not the correct word because I do not think he wants to take credit here. I acknowledge his decision to increase the social housing list by 16,000. Let us be honest that over the past ten years, there was a lack of bravery in not increasing the income limits. Successive Ministers did not increase the limits because they did not want to increase the waiting lists. As a previous Deputy said, that was a denial of reality. The Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, has recognised you cannot have a situation where income limits do not increase for ten years and subsequently people who were on the list for those ten years are removed from it, because either they or a family member have earned more or improved their position, while in no way coming near a situation where they could either privately rent with security for the long term or purchase a home. Then you can ask yourself the question of whether there should be an income limit at all. It is one we should ask. The introduction of the cost rental model has answered that to some degree because we now have what is effectively public housing support for people right up to what might be close to an income of €80,000. Therefore, people under the income limits for social housing, as well as those above the limits, have access to public housing. In one format it is through local authority housing and on the other side, it is through access to cost rental. However, you must ask yourself whether that is an artificial divide. Perhaps we should be moving to a situation where we use the differential rent calculation and make it available to people of very significant incomes and make public housing available to a much broader group of people. I argued for that when I was in opposition and when I was in the local authority. An argument put to me by other councillors, officials and so on was they wanted to maintain an income mix in any new developments. We must address that because the argument was that to provide an income mix by having these two pools of eligibility, you could mix the income in an estate. I believe in the issue of mixed income. That is not to stigmatise anybody but to recognise the genuine reality that when people are dependent on social welfare, it is often for significant reasons and that when we concentrate large numbers of people in an area, that puts huge pressure on services and on community. It challenges community and Governments have never supported community in that way. I believe in mixed income, not because I believe in stigma but because I believe in community and in the capacity of community to respond to those issues. Returning to this idea, on a short-term basis, cost rental on one side of the divide and local authority housing on the other can be argued for because it helps us build large new communities. Oscar Traynor Road, for example, will be entirely public housing with 40% cost rental, 40% local authority and 20% affordable purchase. I understand the planning application for that from Dublin City Council will go in either in the next week or so, or early in January. That will allow us build nearly 1,000 houses for people on a mix of incomes and it will be 100% public housing by having those two pools. However, in the long term, we must move to a situation where local authority housing is available to far more people. That is a significant step forward and will increase the ability of people to access housing. It will remove the stigma wrongly associated with people who live in local authority housing and brings us closer to the European model. I get a little annoyed sometimes when the lead Opposition party talks about Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael being in power for the last ten years. It is even harder to listen when it is followed by the Labour Party standing up and criticising housing when it must be acknowledged its members were in power for five of those ten years. They are not here but Opposition Deputies who actually voted for the vulture fund budgets have stood up and criticised me on this side of the House when I spent ten years in opposition criticising them. Apparently, it is all our fault but there were ten years when Fianna Fáil had no access to Ministers, was not in government and did not have the influence we have now.

We are committed to public housing. We want to deliver it. I accept the politics of competition where we all have to criticise each other's performances and so on but by any objective assessment, the tools we have given local authorities will mean we will be able to build more public housing over the medium term. An Opposition Deputy said something to me in confidence and so I will not name him. He said "We will probably be cutting the ribbons on houses you guys are building". That is probably true because the Housing for All plan is going to serve this country for more than a decade and we are going to build thousands and thousands of houses, just as we did in the past. That is unashamedly a Fianna Fáil commitment and I am very proud of it. I am again in agreement with Deputy Ó Cuív that this change to the income limits is an example of Fianna Fáil's commonsense approach to implementing policy. We could go off and have a full report on this. We could have experts and all sorts of other things coming in and I have no doubt that would add to the decision-making in the Department. However, the Minister was clearly frustrated with that process and said he would not wait any longer. He decided to increase the income limits by €5,000. Perhaps it is a bit arbitrary. Perhaps it is based on Deputy O'Donnell's assessment that it has gone up by 20% with the average industrial wage and therefore that is a good figure to apply. What is clear is the Minister did not want to wait any longer and wanted to implement this change. It is not a change that has a budgetary impact and that is one of the reasons I am so critical of my coalition colleagues' ten years in government, as they did not get housing. I say that with respect to them because I think they understood that more than anybody else, after the last election. They did not get housing. They did not get it for ten years and they did not do what we have done with them and our Green Party colleagues over the last two and a half years. This was a very simple change. Regardless of what advice an official gives a Minister, he or she could make this change and the current Minister has done so. It is an example, for me anyway, of the difference between the two lead coalition parties here, because we in Fianna Fáil understand the housing need of people who need local authority housing. There is a further reason it is so important we have increased local authority income limits. It is a smack in the face to tell somebody they and their children can benefit from the social inclusion programmes we have put in place, which include breakfast clubs, study groups, free books for schoolchildren, access programmes for university allowing their children to study anything any other person on any other income can study and when they graduate they can get a good job, and then to cancel all that, as well as their ten years on the waiting list, because we helped improve that family's ability to earn an income. It is absolutely counterproductive to say to people we are going to help them and their families improve their lives and give them more equal opportunity but when they get it we are going to take away their right to have the local authority house they so desperately need. I commend the Minister on increasing the limits, if for no other reason than that it says to people that if they go out and have the ability to educate themselves and so on - there are people who cannot for good reason and all the rest of it - they should not lose out. I commend the Minister on that and look forward to the further review. I am happy to cede the rest of my time.

Deputy McAuliffe talked about the Fianna Fáil approach to housing. I grew up outside a town that very much benefited from that Fianna Fáil approach to housing. There were two council estates. They were called "estates" then and not "developments" but it is the same difference. They were very mixed. A large cross-section of society could live in those and the whole society benefited from it.It enabled people to get housing or stay at home. There was also a factory there that has since closed down. Unlike many parts of rural Ireland, it was not ravaged by emigration to the same extent. There was a lot of emigration but it was not quite as bad as other areas. A small part of that was perhaps due to those estates. What Deputy McAuliffe forgot to say was that those estates had to be built by Fianna Fáil builders, although that is another matter. It is just a matter of fact. That was generally the case across Clare, but I suppose Clare was perceived to be de Valera's county - a Fianna Fáil county. How could you possibly hope to build houses in a Fianna Fáil county if you were not a Fianna Fáil builder? That is an aside. I want to focus on the present. I do not want to be churlish. There was a huge societal benefit, but that approach has changed. That is not necessarily because of Fianna Fáil but I do not think what the Minister is heralding is quite a return to those glory days of the past. In Clare at the moment, the threshold is €35,000. If I am not mistaken, for a family of two adults and two children, the income threshold to qualify for social housing is now €38,500. That is an improvement. I welcome every single improvement, and I appreciate that improvements are difficult. They are particularly difficult in the field of housing but €38,500 is still substantially less than the average industrial wage of €45,000. As I mentioned, there was a factory in Scariff. People who worked in that factory could get a house in that estate and live there. Other people who could not get a job in that factory, or perhaps at times could not get a job anywhere, could also get a house in that estate. It was mixed. That is not the case now. That factory is not there. Even if it was, most factories pay close enough to the average industrial wage. We are not really returning to those days. At that threshold a couple, both of whom who were on the minimum wage - they might be a husband and wife, or they need not be married, or it might not be a male-female relationship - with children would not qualify for social housing in Ireland. While I welcome what the Minister has done, describing it as brave is maybe a little too much. We should hold off on any plans to take down any of the bronzes around here and put one of the Minister up instead. It is welcome but it is not the stuff revolutions are made of. Hopefully, we can go further in the lifetime of this Government. I appreciate that the Minister is moving in the right direction. I also appreciate Deputy McAuliffe from the Government back benches. It is not easy to be a Government backbencher. I was a Government backbencher too once, albeit at a time when there was not very much money available. I hope such times will not return during the lifetime of this Government. I do welcome this change but we have a long way to go to return to the days of social housing in Ireland when a huge number of houses were being built, regardless of who was building them. I do not care who was building them or how the builders were selected. There was a huge amount of social housing built. I acknowledge that it was built largely by Fianna Fáil Governments but that does not change the fact that Fianna Fáil is in government now and there is a housing crisis. Nobody is expecting the Government to be able to turn it around in 24 months but we have lot further to go with regard to the limits on social housing before we can say we have a genuinely inclusive social housing policy in this State again.

As far as I am aware, this is an interim measure and a broader review of the public housing model is to be completed next year, which will be a review of the review. I hope that in that broader review, the housing income threshold will be increased to at least the average industrial wage. According to the CSO, that is €45,500 per year, although others have said it is €50,000. I am aware that it is not the gross income that is considered for the threshold and limits but the net income. With Dublin City Council, a single person has to earn less than €35,000 to get onto the housing list. That goes up to €42,000 for three adults plus four children. It is €40,250 for two adults and four children. This €5,000 increase is an improvement and will assist more people to get onto the housing list but it is not what we really need from the point of view of access. An awful lot of these people who are earning less than the average industrial wage are the ones who are facing massive rent increases and cannot afford to get a mortgage. They are the 20-, 30- and 40-year-olds who are living at home. It goes without saying that if more people are on the list, the State must build more housing so these people will not be left languishing on the housing list for ten, 15 or 20 years, as some of my constituents in Dublin South-Central are. It must be State-led, through a State building company, using public lands. There is enough land there to build 100,000 homes. They must also be appropriate homes. That is important. There are also a number of complications around the housing list. I will flag two instances that need intervention in this broad review. A woman working in retail approached us recently. She and her son are 15 years on the housing list. She got an offer through choice-based letting for a two-bedroom house but at this stage her son is working and contributing to society. She was over the income threshold of €35,875 for one adult and one child because his income was taken into account, and the offer was withdrawn. She had to apply again to the council for one-bedroom accommodation and her adult son had to apply for his own spot on the housing list. This is literally separating families. What is happening there is outrageous. Another family were on the list for a three-bedroom house for 15 years. Their eldest daughter is now working so they had to go down to a two-bedroom house and the daughter had to go on a separate application. There are huge complications and a lot of messiness around the housing situation. Public housing should cater for bus workers, railway workers, post office, retail and community workers, right across the band. That is the way it used to be and that is the way it should be again.

There is no doubt that the social housing income level threshold is far too low. I have been raising this issue for some time now. Thankfully, the Minister has agreed to do something about it, although it is not enough. It is clear that the Minister has also recognised this issue at this late stage. He agreed earlier in the year to increase the social housing eligibility threshold by €5,000 in counties Carlow, Clare, Laois, Westmeath and Galway but has now extended that to across the country from January, which is welcome. It is obviously welcome because anything is better. If there is a disaster, having slightly less of a disaster is slightly better. It is shocking. Every week and every month people come into my constituency office, people earning €32,000 or €33,000 a year with four or five kids, and I say to them they are never going to get on the housing list. They ask me what they are supposed to do. They can never get a mortgage. I tell them there is nothing they can do. I have to tell them there is nothing I, or anyone, can do for them. This Government does not want to know about them. That is the reality of the situation. Those people are suffering in that way all the time. A young family earning up to €50,000 or €60,000 a year will never get a mortgage and will never be able to buy a house the way things are at the minute. That is the reality of the situation. I do not think there should be any income limits in respect of the housing list. Everybody should be able to be on it. Deputy McAuliffe said earlier that this was a very brave thing to do.The reality is that the numbers on the housing list are used as a way of deciding how many houses are provided. The Government works in a bizarre way. It thinks that if the numbers are kept down artificially, it suggests there is not much need so it does not have to provide many houses. That is the reality of the situation. The more people get onto the housing list, the better because the bizarre way the Government and the Department think about the matter is that if more people are on the list, more houses must be provided. If more people are on housing lists, we might get to the point whereby we provide more houses. We do not want lists to be used as a way of controlling the delivery of houses. That is the reality of the situation. That is why it is there and exists. It is vital that we get to the point of having a decent and realistic list for people who cannot afford housing. The so-called market that the Government is in love with and enthralled by will not provide houses for those people. They are being left behind across the board. The point of any government or state is to step in and step up to the mark for those people. The Government has not done so. Its representatives can say anything they want about any Fianna Fáil Minister. Housing and public housing started to become run down in the 1980s and 1990s under the watch of Fianna Fáil. Fianna Fáil might not do it as quickly as Fine Gael but it will do it because that is what it has set out to do. That is the sad part about it.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	298	I thank Deputies for their valuable contributions to this important discussion. As stated earlier by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, the income eligibility thresholds for social housing supports were introduced in 2011 with the key objective of reserving housing assistance for households unable to secure accommodation from their own resources. As a direct response to the increase in the cost of accommodation and the cost of living since the thresholds were introduced, the Minister has acted responsibly to assist vulnerable households who have been most impacted and increased the thresholds by €5,000 across the board pending the development and introduction of a new model in 2023. The increase will bring an estimated additional 16,000 households into the net, lessening the impact on disadvantaged and vulnerable households of the increase in the cost of accommodation and the cost of living generally, and ensuring social housing supports, including the housing assistance payment, will be available to those who need them most. The changes will come into effect from 1 January 2023. This timeline provides local authorities with a minimum notice period to effect any administrative changes that may be needed prior to the revised thresholds coming into effect. It is important to reiterate that any negative impact on households from the timing of the introductions will be mitigated by the transitional arrangements the Minister has already outlined. While households can reapply and qualify again at any stage, in the normal course of events they would lose time already spent on the social housing waiting list. While such an outcome arises any time there is a recalibration of the income thresholds, such changes should ensure fairness is maintained across the system as a whole and any unintended consequences are mitigated to the greatest extent possible. The transitional arrangements effectively mean that any household deemed ineligible under the previous thresholds and removed from the relevant local authority waiting list since 18 November 2021, which was the count date of the 2021 summary of social housing assessments, but which now again qualifies because the thresholds have increased, can retain the time already spent on the list as well as any time they would have accrued had they not been removed in the first instance. The effect is to backdate such an application by 18 months. These arrangements will remain in place until June 2023, which will ensure that local authorities have sufficient time to notify impacted households and for those households to resubmit their applications for consideration under the new thresholds. Households that resubmit applications after 30 June 2023 will not be able to retain time previously accrued or which would have accrued to them had they not been removed from the list. The transitional arrangements do not apply to households who applied since 18 November 2021, were deemed ineligible but now qualify, and who were not on the housing list at the time they applied. The changes have been made prior to introducing an alternative model in 2023. The development of the new model, which includes a review of the effectiveness of the existing model and consideration of alternative approaches, will be completed and proposals submitted for the Minister's consideration in quarter 1 of 2023. This work is not without complexity. It is not simply a matter of increasing the thresholds by €1,000, €5,000 or €10,000 merely because doing so will qualify additional households for support. The analysis required is complex. It is critical that any new model, or even a simple recalibration of income limits, reflects the spatial variations in housing costs and incomes, accounts for different household compositions by reflecting commensurate differences in housing and other costs, and targets housing supports towards households with the greatest need. Assessing income, life cycle and other household characteristics is key in this respect, particularly insofar as they determine disadvantage induced by housing costs. The consequences and impacts of any changes also require measured consideration. There may be implications for the private rental market, including inflationary impacts on rents. There will be implications for cost rental and affordable purchase, and other similar policy interventions. The most recent changes to thresholds have already reduced the differential between the social housing thresholds and the cost rental eligibility ceiling of €53,000 in those areas where affordability interventions will be delivered, and any further adjustments will have to be carefully considered. We must also consider the risk, given demand is likely to exceed supply into the medium term at least, that widening income eligibility thresholds will hinder supports from being targeted at those on the lowest incomes. While the Government is committed to ensuring supports are available to households with the greatest need, it must strike a balance between doing so and setting thresholds at appropriate levels. All of these issues and more have to be considered before any more fundamental changes can be made. The overarching principle of social housing support is to secure adequate housing for those households which are unable to provide accommodation from their own resources and have an identified long-term need. The determination of such a need, and of whether a household meets the income criteria, is based, among other things, on their preceding 12 months' net average income prior to the date of receipt of application. This approach, which was introduced in early 2021, reflects the long-term nature of social housing support. It ensures the most comprehensive picture of current and previous income is available at assessment, it ensures fairness and equity, and it ensures those with a continuing long-term need are prioritised. Concerns have been raised with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage regarding the unintended consequences of this approach. For example, households, some of which have been on waiting lists for long periods, are being removed from the lists unfairly following assessment under the new requirements and have fallen foul of unintended consequences arising from the policy. Of course, while the Minister, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, is sympathetic to the very challenging circumstances faced by households in such cases, he believes local authorities are correctly interpreting and applying the requirements. Similarly, the Minister is not aware of any anomalous outcomes arising or any difficulties being experienced by local authorities applying requirements, and the outcomes in these cases have been consistent with the policy's intent and the principles of social housing support. Demonstration of long-term need will continue to be a key pillar of the social housing eligibility model. This will not change. It would not be appropriate to assess and determine such need by merely reviewing a household's current income. To do so would be contrary to the intent of the policy and would be an assessment of very short-term rather than long-term need. It would require local authorities to make decisions in respect of circumstances that may or may not continue beyond the short term, thereby introducing uncertainty and inequity into assessments and undermining the principle of social housing as a long-term support. I will conclude on a general note. There is no doubt but that there are very real problems currently in housing. The Minister is working tirelessly to resolve these problems and doing so will remain his absolute priority. The measures outlined this evening will help to ensure that the most hard-pressed households can access secure, good-quality housing, and that sustainable mechanisms are in place to meet current and future demand for social housing supports. The Minister accepts we do not have nearly enough social housing to meet our needs. While increasing the supply of housing is not something that can be delivered immediately, we are clearly starting to see considerable progress and homes are being built at record rates. Many things have changed in the 15 months since the initial launch of Housing for All. It is all too easy to criticise and wilfully ignore the significant external shocks the system has experienced on foot of the Covid-19 pandemic and the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Despite these shocks and the subsequent rising inflation, increasing labour and material costs, increased interest rates and supply chain disruptions - it is convenient to forget we have limited control over these matters - we are significantly increasing housing supply in this country on the back of measures introduced by this Government under Housing for All, and we will continue to do so into the future. This year, we will deliver some 8,000 more homes than in 2021. We expect to deliver a similar, if not greater, number next year. While Housing for All is a plan for everyone, it is appropriate that it places a significant focus on providing social housing. To this end, it commits to delivering over 9,000 new-build social homes next year. Increasing our social housing stock will reduce the demand on our private rental market and the reliance on the rental market to house those on social housing waiting lists. The Minister continues to make progress and deliver on the commitments under Housing for All. Beyond the measures in Housing for All, the Minister continues to respond urgently where there is most need as he has already done through the winter eviction ban, the renter's credit and the delegated sanction for local authorities to acquire properties where this can prevent homelessness. The Government is committed to putting in place the measures needed to increase the supply of social housing supports. In the meantime, it will continue to protect the vulnerable and provide as many social, affordable and private homes as are needed to end the housing crisis.

I have the height of respect for the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, but we need a housing Minister to deal with this issue. Irish Water is running and hiding from Ballingeary. It needs to answer to somebody and it should be the Minister in this House. I must note my frustration with that. The outdated sewerage scheme in Ballingeary is discharging into the river below the village. Some 15 years ago, the water authority received a conviction because of that pollution. The Irish Water sewerage scheme is impeding housing in the village. As matters stand, locals struggle to get planning permission in the village but they can only be considered if they put in their own treatment plants. That is hugely expensive and also uses space in the village. Irish Water is charging a fee to connect to a sewer that is not working and all the while residents have to pay for their own treatment plants and maintain them in the village. You could not make it up. It is difficult for people to get planning permission in many rural areas, including around Ballingeary where Irish Water's treatment plant restricts this further in the village, both for houses and businesses. Ballingeary is also a Gaeltacht area and the language depends on people being able to live locally. Without that there is no language. Irish Water is threatening the Gaeltacht by its inaction. Cork County Council was advancing Ballingeary wastewater plant and a number of other plants many years ago. It even prepared a planning application at the time. While the other plants in what was known as the western bundle have since been officially opened, no progress appears to have been made by Irish Water on Ballingeary. This is despite the pollution, the water pollution conviction and the housing need locally. When there is a flood in the Bun Sílinn river the sewage spills out onto the GAA grounds and the club has to do a clean-up ahead of any training session. There is no point waiting for Irish Water. It takes a “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” approach. It has not advanced the plant in the past number of years, during which county council reports have indicated that it has been asked to advance business cases to justify Ballingeary treatment plant. The water pollution conviction does not appear to have driven any sense of urgency in Irish Water. For months, the company has not responded to queries on plants on Ballingeary or the influence of water convictions. It was only in recent weeks when I tabled this Topical Issue matter that it has been in any way forthcoming with information. It takes a consistent “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil” approach, while continuing to perpetrate pollution locally. Various authorities, including the Environmental Protection Agency, are now investigating Irish Water discharges into the Bun Sílinn river below Ballingeary, which flow into the River Lee. It appears that Irish Water believes it can continue to pollute the river for years to come. That is not good enough. Irish Water needs to wake up and advance the sewerage scheme for Béal Átha'n Ghaorthaidh.

I thank the Deputy for raising it and allowing me the opportunity to outline the position in respect of Irish Water's responsibility on this matter. The Water Services Acts 2007 to 2017 set out the arrangements in place for the delivery of water and wastewater services by Irish Water and the scrutiny and oversight provisions that apply in respect of these arrangements. As the Deputy will understand, the wastewater infrastructure in Ballingeary, County Cork, is a matter for Irish Water in the first instance. Irish Water takes a strategic, nationwide approach to asset planning and investment and meeting customer requirements. The prioritisation and progression of individual projects and programmes are a matter for determination by Irish Water. Irish Water's capital investment plan runs until 2024 and is prepared within the regulatory framework which is set out in legislation. Under this framework, Irish Water submits its proposed investment plans in advance to its economic regulator, the Commission for Regulation of Utilities, CRU. The investment plan follows an extensive CRU-Ied stakeholder consultation process and is based on a clearly defined set of priorities. My Department has made inquiries with Irish Water on the issue of wastewater treatment infrastructure at Ballingeary, as raised by Deputy Moynihan. Irish Water confirmed to me that it has received a number of inquiries in recent months from various Deputies, councillors and members of the public regarding the inclusion of the Béal Átha'n Ghaorthaidh or Ballingeary wastewater treatment plant in its next capital investment plan. Irish Water has commenced a feasibility study on the upgrade of the wastewater treatment plant to consider fully the viable options to address the infrastructural issues associated with the plant, its impact on receiving waters and its capacity to cater for growth. This feasibility study report is planned to be completed before the end of 2024. The necessary upgrade works, if approved, would then be included in the 2025-29 capital investment plan. The Government is aware that significant and sustained investment is needed to ensure the continued operation, upgrade and repair of the country's water and wastewater infrastructure and to support economic growth in the years to come. In this regard, as part of budget 2023, the Minister's Department secured funding of more than €1.68 billion to support water services. This includes €1.557 billion in respect of domestic water services provision by Irish Water. The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in our public water and wastewater services. In light of the time left to me, I will take on board exactly what Deputy Moynihan said in regard to the local GAA field, what members of the community are experiencing there on a regular basis and the impact on the environment and the community. I will raise this matter with the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, because I do not know if the community can wait until 2025.

The other schemes in that western bundle are now open and operational, yet what is being described from Irish Water is pretty much at stage 1. I note it also refers to “recent” queries from people. There have been ongoing queries and representations from people for many years. This is just more of Irish Water's “hear no evil, see no evil, speak no evil”. It is time for it to wake up and serve the people of Ballingarry. How many other treatment plants would have a water pollution conviction against the water authority? How many other situations like that would be allowed to persist, year after year, and then, Irish Water gives us a plan, if we can call it that, suggesting that somewhere off in never-never land, it will take action. Surely a conviction in the court carries some weight. Is it not time for Irish Water to step up to the plate?

The Deputy will understand that the progression of individual wastewater treatment plants and infrastructure is a matter for Irish Water and I can assure him the Government is committed to ensuring that substantial funding is provided to Irish Water. The programme for Government commits to funding Irish Water’s capital investment plan for water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis. The national development plan 2021-2030 commits almost €6 billion in capital investment by Irish Water in the period 2021-2025, of which more than €4.5 billion will be voted Exchequer funding for domestic water services. In regard to overall investment, the programme for Government states that the Government will fund Irish Water's capital investment plan for drinking water and wastewater infrastructure on a multi-annual basis and deliver the €8.5 billion funding package committed in Project Ireland 2040. This overall funding commitment is key to addressing Ireland's shortcomings in water and wastewater infrastructure. The Department is making progress on the challenges it faces and the Government will continue to deliver strongly on the commitments in regard to water services contained in the programme for Government. It may be helpful to note that Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representations and queries from public representatives. I will take back to the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, Deputy Moynihan’s frustration that the Minister is not here this evening to take this query, as well as its nature and the urgency attached to it. I thank the Deputy for raising it.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	304	I thank the Minister of State for attending. It is a pity the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage and the Ministers of State at that Department cannot be here but I know they have been on their feet all day. There is a major problem affecting water supply for 10,000 people in east Cork and impacting on areas south-east of Midleton such as Ballinacurra, Cloyne, Aghada, Ballycotton, Churchtown, Trabolgan and all of the rural areas inbetween. The problem has been there since early January 2016, which is almost seven years ago. It has resulted in boil water notices being put in place for varying periods of between two weeks and a number of months every year since 2016, sometimes more than three times in the same year. The most recent boil water notice was issued on 29 October 2022 and remains in place two months later. This means people either have to boil water, at alarming cost, or else bear the cost of purchasing water in plastic bottles, which adds to the overuse of single-use plastic, which we are all trying to avoid. The Minister of State will appreciate this is adding to household costs in a major way, as well as the disruption it causes to households. I understand that on 30 November last Irish Water confirmed it was examining tankering water into the area, although I have not seen that happen yet. This water will still have to be boiled for use, so there is little advantage. To be fair to Irish Water, as far back as October 2016 it put in a new filtration system with two microfiltration units, and a UV disinfection unit has been installed at a cost of over €1 million. New shuttering controls were also put in place to prevent any inadequately treated water from entering the water supply. However, the fact quite a number of boil water notices have issued since 2016 indicates the spending of that €1 million has not worked. The most recent information from the Irish Water website talks about further works taking place involving the major upgrade of the water treatment plant, for which land has been acquired, and a contractor has been appointed to undertake design and construction. However, full planning permission will be required and the project is currently at detailed design phase. Irish Water is targeting early 2023 for the submission of planning and is anticipating the construction might commence in 2024, so, all going well, we might have a solution by 2025, if we are lucky. Irish Water told me that despite the cost involved to families, there is no way that it is allowed to compensate families, although businesses are entitled to a discount on bills which is applied automatically. Really and truly, we should look at some way of compensating families. Another issue that has arisen recently is the notification that Irish Water gives to households. I had a call from a woman today who moved into the area a number of months ago and was unaware of the boil water notice, and both herself and her child were drinking the tap water after that time. This raises questions about how the public, households and families are notified about the putting in place of a boil water notice. I contend that, at the very least, posters, like those we use at election time, should be erected in the geographical areas affected. It is not good enough to rely on newspapers and social media to alert people. This is serious because people can become ill if they are not notified properly. They should also be notified when the notice is taken down because, otherwise, it can become confusing. I want the Minister to act in four areas. First, he needs to deal with the costs to householders. The Minister knows it costs almost €1.30 to purchase 5 l of water and almost 10 cent each time a full kettle of water is boiled. We can imagine how much people would use in a day for drinking. Second, I want the Minister to direct Irish Water to ensure people are reminded on a regular basis of the boil water notice, and these updates should preferably include the erecting of posters in the area concerned. Third, I want the Minister to engage with Irish Water to see if anything can be done to have the problem rectified before the end of 2025. Fourth, other public representatives, such as councillors in the area, would like to engage with Irish Water, which I understand has so far refused to do so. Irish Water should present itself to the local municipal district meetings and explain to the councillors exactly what is going on and what it plans to do to rectify this.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	305	I thank the Deputy for raising the Whitegate boil water notice issue. I apologise that the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage is not present, and I am dealing with this matter on his behalf. The issue of safe drinking water has both national and local importance and I appreciate the Deputy's concern for those communities affected. I understand from inquiries made with Irish Water that the boil water notice currently in place for the Whitegate public water supply was issued on 29 October 2022 following consultation between Irish Water, Cork County Council and the Health Service Executive. This boil water notice was issued to protect approximately 9,500 customers in Whitegate, Aghada, Churchtown, Ballycotton, Saleen, Shanagarry, Ballinacurra and areas of Cloyne. The notice was issued as a result of increased turbidity in the raw water, which can happen at this source as it is susceptible to raw water quality issues after rainfall events. Boil water notices have been issued on Whitegate public water supply a number of times over the past few years. The Deputy will appreciate that the operation of Whitegate public water supply is a matter for Irish Water, which has statutory responsibility for all aspects of water services planning, delivery and operation at national, regional and local level. I would have thought Irish Water would also have a responsibility for the health and well-being of the people in the community. I understand that, in the short term, upgrade works to filters are under way and additional parts are on order, with delivery expected by the end of December. Following the implementation of these measures, the HSE will be asked to confirm that the criteria for lifting the boil water notice are met. In the longer term, the delivery of a new water treatment plant as the permanent solution to issues at Whitegate is under way and is expected to be completed by the end of 2025. Irish Water has a strong customer service focus through its water charges plan and customer charter, which outlines the standard of service customers should expect to receive. The water charges plan sets out a compensation mechanism when water quality is compromised and unfit for human consumption, such as when boil water and drinking water restriction notices apply. Business customers who pay charges are entitled to a rebate under the customer handbook, as agreed with the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. Adjustments are made via the customers' bills.This only applies to water used for drinking. Implementation of a water charges plan is a matter, in the first instance, for Irish Water. Any issue which cannot be resolved by Irish Water to the satisfaction of the customers can be referred under the formal complaints process for the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. The Minister said that it is a priority to ensure that people's health is protected and that adequate water is available for all customers. We all want to see the notice lifted without undue delay.  I also take on board exactly what the Deputy laid out as the four key priorities. One is in respect of the cost to households which I will relay back to the Minister. The other is on the communication. For families who may have been away on holidays, or people moving into the area for the first time, not knowing about these issues can put themselves at risk. The Minister will engage with Irish Water on this as a priority because of the health and safety issues here. Finally, as public representatives at a local and municipal area levels, the very minimum we would expect from Irish Water is that it would come before the local municipal authority and be accountable to the people who are accountable to the public.
#DavidStanton	unknown-#DavidStanton-party	unknown-#DavidStanton-dob	unknown-#DavidStanton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	306	I thank the Minister of State for her response and for her usual honesty and straightforwardness in dealing with this issue. I will give the Minister of State some idea of what is happening here. On 1 February 2021, a boil water notice was issued. On 12 March, it was lifted. On 28 October 2021, it was issued again. On 5 November, it was lifted and on Christmas Day 2021, a boil water notice was issued. On 3 June 2022, it was lifted and was again then issued on 29 October this year and is still in place. Trying to keep track of all of that and whether or not it is in place is quite difficult for the public as they have other things to be doing. It is quite a challenge to inform people on how this is done. The Minister of State is quite right in that if people are away on holiday or if they move into the area, how are these people to know that a boil water notice is in place? If there are people who are vulnerable, who have health issues, or babies or small children, and if they drink this water, which the HSE tells us may be unsafe, then people’s health is at risk. The Minister of State’s final point there is that she wishes to see the notice lifted without undue delay, which we all want, but only when the HSE and the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, confirm that the water supply is safe. If people do not know they should boil water and drink the water out of the tap that is not guaranteed to be safe for them, that is very serious. I ask that the Minister of State convey back to the senior Minister, Deputy O’Brien, that we need to instruct Irish Water and the HSE to erect posters in the area when a boil water notice is in place and to take them down when it is lifted. If they leave them up, they will lose their effectiveness. Otherwise, people will not know. I cannot think of any other way of this happening, but perhaps the Minister of State can. People should also be compensated for the very significant cost they are incurring and the inconvenience of having to do this, which is also quite a worry. On top of that the Minister should ensure that Irish Water engages with public representatives on this. In the past, Irish Water used to have a clinic in this House, where it used to come in and we would meet the company officials face-to-face. Perhaps the senior Minister should put that back in place where we could meet the officials and talk to them. That might be something Irish Water might do. I cannot understand why it is going to take until the end of 2025 to get this done given that it is going on since 2016.

I appreciate his interest in this matter and I understand his frustration. I acknowledge the patience and the co-operation of the residents and businesses in the Whitegate area who have been affected. This is 9,500 people over prolonged periods of time. The Government’s priority is to ensure that people’s health is protected and that adequate water is available for all consumers. We all want to see the notice lifted without undue delay but only when the HSE and the EPA have confirmed that water supply is safe. Both our water and wastewater systems require substantial sustained investment over a number of investment cycles to bring the system up to the quality and resilience standards required of modern services, to provide for population growth, and to build resilience in the face of climate change. As part of budget 2023, the Minister secured, as I said earlier, funding of €1.65 billion to support water services. The overall investment will deliver significant improvements in the public water and wastewater services and will support improved water supplies right across Ireland, including rural Ireland. It supports a range of programmes delivering improved water quality in our rivers, lakes, and marine areas. Irish Water has established a dedicated team to deal with representatives’ queries.  The Deputy makes some very valuable suggestions there on Irish Water in re-engaging with public representatives. I remember a time when Irish Water came into the House. These were some of the best clinics ever held in this House because we had a list - no matter whether it was in Deputy Stanton’s area, in my area or in Deputy Martin Kenny’s area - of constituents who were affected and impacted by such issues. When it is the health, safety and well-being of people, particularly in the area of Deputy Stanton where there are 9,500 people, I believe the Deputy’s ask in respect of clear communication and signage is completely valid. I acknowledge the issue of climate change but if Irish Water wants to use the back of our election posters to put up the notices, we can do that too.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	308	I am glad to have this opportunity to speak to the Minister of State. I engaged with her probably a year and a half ago, or more, on this particular issue. As she is aware, there are a number of families, mainly in south Leitrim, who have children with severe disabilities. Most of them are young adults at this stage and their parents are becoming quite elderly and are getting on. One of them, a neighbour of mine, in fact, passed away recently. This is really becoming a crisis for these families as they look to the future. This situation is a worry for them in many respects. The Minister of State held a meeting at the end of May this year in the Bush Hotel in Carrick-on-Shannon and I want to thank her for that. We brought together all of the stakeholders, including the HSE, the service providers, the parents, people from the local authorities, local councillors and the other Deputies in the area. We came up with the bones of a solution to move the situation forward, and I commend the Minister of State on that. We need to use a site in Carrick-on-Shannon, which is owned by the HSE, and which has been set aside to build a proper respite service for them. It was agreed at that meeting that a team would be put together to work on this. That team has been put together, has done some work and has met regularly, but I am not sure if a great deal of progress has been made. That is disappointing and I await the Minister of State’s reply in respect of that. We need to see a proper residential care unit built on that site, together with a respite unit, because in some case these parents have had no respite for years. The nearest respite service they have is in Tullaghan in County Leitrim, which for many of them is a great distance away, and is very near Bundoran in County Donegal. We need to see this put in place immediately and we need a proper plan to be put together to build those services. In the interim, until that is built, we need to have a respite service for these young people. We had a solution that day, which the Minister of State is aware of. We looked at the Cloonamahon site, which is near Collooney in County Sligo and is not a very significant distance from south Leitrim. This site was available. There are two purpose-built bungalows there, which were built 20 years ago and are fully kitted-out. At present they are used as residential units and there are six residents in those units. Work is currently under way to move those residents out into what is called a decongregated setting in the community. That is happening apace. The units are purpose-built and comprise two five-bedroom bungalows. When we talked about what we were going to build, which would be HIQA-approved, figures being talked about were heading close to €1 million and yet these buildings are there, are being used and are HIQA-approved. On the day, the remark was made that all they needed was a lick of paint. I have good news because a man called Ivor Parke, a local painter and decorator contracted by the HSE, went in less than two weeks ago and painted both of them from floor-to-ceiling. That has been done because the HSE evidently has a plan to turn these buildings into offices. The country is coming down with offices but we do not have a place to provide services for children and young people with disabilities. The person who came up with that idea needs to be dragged over the coals because to even talk about it is a scandal, never mind to even do it, considering that these purpose-built and HIQA-approved units are in place. All we need to do is to ensure we use them for respite services for the young people concerned. I understand the HSE is going around the country trying to find private services to provide the services, which in many cases do not exist, or do not exist to the level of quality we would require and HIQA would approve. These buildings are there and they should be used. Apart from the problems these parents and families have, which is a pressing crisis we need to resolve, a secondary scandal would be if these two buildings were turned into office space. The Minister of State, or any other Minister, could not stand over allowing the people who have responsibility, as employees of the HSE, to provide services for people with disabilities, to do this. They need to block the use of these units as office space. It is scandalous that they would even think of doing such a thing.I look forward to the Minister of State's reply. I hope she has good news, not for me but for these families who are at their wits' end in trying to get a solution to this crisis.

It is more than six months since I travelled to Carrick-on-Shannon to meet with parents - from what I understand, they represented many more parents - and public representatives. HSE representatives were present at the meeting on the day. When I reflect on it, we had a very good conversation. There was real energy in the room. My script does not reflect what I am about to say.

We had a very good conversation in that room. I felt there was energy and pace in the room to find a solution. My goal in travelling was to find a solution for the people of County Leitrim, especially the people of south Leitrim, whose options were very limited. In fact, they had none. I acknowledge the role of local authority members who were present at that meeting. They were tasked with a job, which was to find a site and to see whether sites were available. All of a sudden, they found sites. They found HSE sites that were available. That has been set in train and a development group has been set in place. We will take that. While that is being developed, the Deputy is correct that we also identified Cloonamahon as an option for transitional space in the interim because we know that Tullaghan is operating on five over seven nights. Even if we moved Tullaghan to seven over seven nights, it means that 136 families will need to access it. No matter what respite service I open, it will not exceed supporting more than 80 families so there is a shortfall of 56. With the best will in the world, going to seven over seven is part of the solution but it still does not meet the whole of the solution. The Deputy is quite right that it was agreed on that day, and HSE estates representatives said clearly at the meeting, that they could go in to the building at Cloonamahon, give it a lick of paint and make it functional. From talking to Ms Edel Quinn, HSE head of disability services for the area, for whom I have huge time and respect - I spoke to her at 3.30 p.m. today - the building will not be operationalised to support many of the families because people with higher-sized wheelchairs might not be able to access the building. I take that on board because she is the lead and everything else. However, it will be able to support many more people, as it should. If Tullaghan is the place where larger-sized wheelchairs have to go, they will be prioritised to go there but, in the interim, we should use one of those bungalows that would support families and be the only met need in south Leitrim. The Deputy is not alone in his ask because his colleagues, including Deputy Marc MacSharry and the Minister of the State at the Department of Health, Deputy Feighan, have advocated the same piece. Common sense and a dose of reality needs to come in. We have a building that can provide support while we are constructing a new purpose-built, respite and residential facility in Carrick-on-Shannon. My ask of Ms Quinn was to go back again today. Her ask of me was to engage with the CEO of HIQA to ensure that HIQA would give the HSE a delegated function to operate on the site. I need HIQA to approve operation on the site of one of those bungalows so that while we are de-congregating the other building could be used. We have gone to HIQA this evening to find out whether we can get a derogation. Could one of those bungalows be used while we decongregate? I will engage further with the Deputy in my next response.

My frustration is that on the day - the Minister of State is right to say we had a very good meeting, there was energy in the room and we felt that everybody was on the same page - I detected a little hesitancy on the part of some of the HSE officials to use Cloonamahon. I did not know or understand why. I still do not understand why. The prospect that there may be difficulty with some oversized wheelchairs needs to be examined. Maybe that is the case. I am not sure if that is the case. I would have to be convinced that problem exists there because these bungalows were built 20 years ago. This is not something that goes back to Victorian times like the rest of the building, which houses an old convent. This is a modern, new building. It has hoists in place, rails in the ceilings and everything is there. It is HIQA approved, as it stands, and yet there is this reluctance to use it. The Minister of State mentioned "in the interim" until we get the others built. It should never ever be used for anything else other than providing services for which it was built in the first place. If that ever happens, it would be a scandal. I take the Minister of State's word that we can move quickly but we now have a Christmas break. When we return after Christmas, whether she is in the same role, which we will not get into, and regardless of who is in that position, I want to see a proper respite service in place for those families that is convenient for them, works for them and that they are satisfied with. There is huge dissatisfaction and despair among all those parents I have spoken to and engaged with over the past couple of years. There is a major problem here. It is so easy to fix it and yet there is this hesitancy to fix it. We sometimes ask why people in senior positions in the HSE and other places do not do their jobs. Sometimes I think what needs to happen is people need to be given their P45s and told to get out the door if they do not do their jobs. If the State is sued, loses and has to take that cost, it is a hit the State should take because the next person who gets that job will do his or her job, as that individual will know there are consequences for not doing it. That is what it is down to. There are people in this State in senior positions who, for some reason or other, will not do what they are paid to do. In this case, these people are paid to provide services for people with disabilities and they should bloody well do it.

It is also very important to recognise, when we talk about the HSE, that two, three or four different rule books are in operation. The operational side of the HSE has a different rule book from the estates side of the HSE. They go at two different paces and have two different ways of delivery. To be very fair to the director of services for the south Leitrim area, she wants nothing more than to ensure that there is plenty of adequate respite care for the people of Leitrim. That is for sure. HSE estates representatives were at the meeting that day. The Deputy is correct that there has been a reluctance since then because two different answers were given. One was about going in with the paint brush and the other was about saying, "Hold on. Maybe we cannot do this because of HIQA, this, that and the other". That is where my office has intervened.

I understand, however, it is not investigating the disclosures made by Aontú because of that Department's interpretation of the Protected Disclosures (Amendment) Act. In recent months, I was contacted by an individual who alleged that she and her siblings were severely abused while in foster care in this country in the 1980s and 1990s. Tusla has ascribed the pseudonym "Alice" to the individual and has produced an internal case review of her life, dated 2020, known as the Alice report. Alice has furnished me with a copy of that report. "Morning Ireland" has also broadcast a piece on Alice's life. It interviewed her sister, Miss H. A major discrepancy exists between the findings of Tusla's Alice report and a recent email exchange between Miss H and the Garda data protection unit. Tusla states in the Alice report that the biological son of Miss H's foster mother was accused by Miss H of child sexual abuse, that he confessed the child sexual abuse to the Garda, that a file was sent to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, and that the DPP decided not to prosecute.In an email exchange with the Garda data protection unit this year, Ms H was informed that the Garda has located a PULSE entry relating to her report of abuse in 1999. However, the Garda noted that no suspected offender is named nor is there any detail lodged. In a separate email, it is stated that it does not appear the incident was forwarded to the DPP. This statement from the Garda is obviously completely at odds with the Tusla statement in the Alice report, which claimed the DPP had decided not to prosecute. In its moves to clarify this matter, the Garda has been inconsistent, has raised more questions than answers and has retraumatised Alice and Ms H. Again, the Department of Justice has been furnished with all of the documents I have quoted from. The Minister, Deputy O'Gorman, met with Alice over the summer and I am very grateful to him for doing so. The reason I am raising this matter with the Minister of State today is that my parliamentary assistant was very recently contacted by an individual who sent an image that appears to show the alleged child sex abuser, the person who allegedly abused Ms H, as having recently been appointed to a role within a sports club. The screenshot sent has been furnished to the Minister of State's Department. The individual who contacted us wanted to know how an alleged abuser could have possibly got through the Garda vetting system. The answer is simple. Despite Tusla recording that this alleged abuser actually confessed to the child sex abuse of Ms H and despite the existence of a PULSE reference number on that case, An Garda Síochána has openly admitted it has no record of any detail logged, of a confession or of the name of the alleged abuser. Therefore, a Garda vetting search of the alleged abuser's name would presumably return no results whatsoever. This is an extraordinarily concerning development that could call into question the entire Garda vetting system. It is not unique to this case. How can we possibly have faith in the vetting system if files and confession statements that should be in the PULSE system have simply gone missing?

However, I will answer the question that was posed, which sought to discuss with the Minister for Justice the technologies and methods used as part of the Garda vetting process. On behalf of the Minister for Justice, Deputy Humphreys, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue in the House today. The Deputy will appreciate that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the management and administration of Garda business. This is laid down under the Garda Síochána Act 2005 and includes the technologies and methods used as part of the Garda vetting process. Additionally, the national vetting bureau Act of 2012 makes it the responsibility of the chief bureau officer of the Garda National Vetting Bureau to establish and maintain the database of the bureau. The Minister for Justice has no role in these independent functions. The Minister is advised by the Garda authorities that, in general, the vetting process follows a number of steps. In the first step, the vetting subject manually completes and forwards to a relevant organisation a vetting invitation form and provides proof of identity. In the second step, the relevant organisation confirms proof of identity and sends the vetting subject an email with a link attached inviting him or her to complete a vetting application form. The third step is that the vetting subject completes the vetting application form online and submits it to the relevant organisation. In the fourth step, the relevant organisation reviews the vetting application form and submits it to the Garda National Vetting Bureau. The fifth step is that the bureau processes the application and forwards a vetting disclosure to the relevant organisation while the sixth is that the relevant organisation accesses the vetting disclosure through the online portal. The Deputy may wish to know that the bureau provides applicants with a tracking number for their application and that, concurrent with the vetting process, they can track the progress of their application online. The Minister is advised that standard turnaround times for vetting run at five to eight working days and there are currently no delays or backlogs. As the Deputy will appreciate, some applications will take significantly longer for a variety of operational reasons. I can also inform the Deputy that a Garda vetting review group was established in April 2021 and meets regularly to discuss potential amendments to vetting legislation. This group includes members of the Garda National Vetting Bureau in An Garda Síochána, officials from my Department and from Tusla and other relevant stakeholders. The primary focus of the group is strengthening the vetting legislation in an effective manner. Issues to be considered by the group include any changes which may be possible in the area of re-vetting. The Minister hopes the group will be in a position to report on its work early in the new year. I can also confirm to the Deputy that technology will be addressed in the working group's report.

All of us in the Dáil are responsible to the citizens we serve in the State. The case I have raised is anonymous so the Minister of State actually can refer to it. Ministers refer to many specific cases regularly in this Chamber. The Minister of State is responsible for ensuring the Garda does its job properly. It is not the case that he can just sit on his hands and say it is somebody else's business. It is the responsibility of this Government to ensure citizens are protected. Alice is a very brave woman, as is her sister, Ms H. They have been relentless in the pursuit of justice. They have been knocking on the doors of a great many agencies over the past two decades. They have had to do that because of responses similar to that the Minister of State has given here. Her name is well known to Tusla and in the local Garda station because of her persistent campaigning. At one point, she triggered a Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, investigation into the way her local Garda station handled her abuse case. At the same time as this investigation was under way, she was applying for a house. During the GSOC investigation, the Garda station under investigation told the local authority that Alice had broken the law. One presumes this would have had the negative effect of reducing the chances of her housing application being successful. The Garda has since said this was an error and apologised to Alice for providing the local authority with a fabricated and false record. I believe the Minister of State will agree that, when agents of the State who are meant to protect individuals and vet people properly admit they do not have documents within PULSE records and when they tell a local authority a lie regarding an individual's track record which could reduce his or her opportunity to get a local authority house, it is our responsibility. I would like the Minister of State to answer the question I asked him in the first section.

Again, on behalf of the Minister for Justice, I thank the Deputy for raising this issue today. I again emphasise that the Garda Commissioner is responsible for the administration and management of the Garda vetting system. The Minister for Justice has no role in such matters and cannot direct An Garda Síochána in the operation of the vetting system. The primary purpose of the employment vetting carried out by the national vetting bureau is to seek to ensure the safety of children and vulnerable adults. This important work needs to be carried out thoroughly and correctly. As I have mentioned, the Garda vetting review group is working on issues relating to the strengthening of the vetting legislation and the Minister looks forward to the group's report, which is anticipated early in the new year.

I hope to hear good news. Chuaigh mé chuig Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin i bhFionnghlas an mhí seo caite. Is scoil iontach í le hiarscoláirí agus múinteoirí iontacha. The school is doing a great job in a very poor building. Schools are often very slow to talk about the failings of their premises because they want to project the best possible impression. They want to attract children and they want parents to have confidence in the school. Before I say anything else, I will say that I have full confidence in the teachers and pupils of Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin. What is letting them down is the Department of Education not providing for the building they are in. The school is the former De La Salle school. It is a school I know quite a lot about. I attended it myself and my grandfather was on the committee that raised the funds to establish the school along with the second level school that was established when free education was introduced in Ireland.The Minister of State might be surprised, as I was, that the windows are the same as those my grandfather fundraised for. They are wooden windows. Where there are holes in those windows, they are covered with cardboard. Where they are not covered in cardboard, they are covered in bits of plywood. Walking around the edge of the building, we would think it is an abandoned site that the Minister might build houses on. Instead, every day, children go in and out of the school and do a great job learning our national language and getting a great education. The Minister for Education has given me an update in recent months by way of parliamentary questions that this school is part of the accelerated delivery of architectural planning and tendering, ADAPT, programme and that a design team will be appointed for a 16-classroom extension and for two special education needs, SEN, classrooms, which I know the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will be very pleased about as well. The school, though, is still unsure where it is on the project timeline. It has very little confidence after having waited many years. Any additional information the Minister of State can provide us with would be very welcome indeed. The classrooms are old and do not have toilets. The logical place to put such toilets would be where the windows are failing. We could probably get money to put in new windows, but we would end up ripping them out in a year or two to allow the toilet extensions to be put in. What is required here is a proper new school, as promised. I believe in the necessity of dealing with embodied carbon and retaining as many of our buildings as possible, and big chunks of this building could be saved, repurposed and reused. It is regrettable that a Deputy must come before this House to talk about the arrangements of toilets in a school. Our national Parliament should not be dealing with these issues. I do this, however, out of a sense of frustration that we have not been able to progress this issue any further. I hope the Minister of State is as committed as I am to the progression of this school. I also hope that we can get good news for a great school and, as I said, its great pupils as well.

The Deputy has been working on it for some time. I am providing a response outlining to the House the major building project that will be undertaken at Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin, and also recent interactions between the school, its patron body and the Department of Education on the current condition of the existing school building. The school currently occupies a building constructed during the 1950s, over two storeys, on its site at Glasanaon Road and the building fabric and finishes are typical of a building of that type and age. Under the Department's emergency works scheme, refurbishment works to the boys' toilet areas were carried out in 2021 and a tender report for works to the girls' toilet areas is awaited. The Department of Education recently approved funding to provide interim accommodation on the school site to facilitate the establishment of a special class for the 2022-23 academic year. A Department architect visited the school earlier this year and advised the school authorities to make the appropriate applications for necessary emergency works. The Department has assisted the school in appointing a building surveyor to carry out a survey in support of that emergency works application. The application has not yet been submitted to the Department of Education. In a meeting earlier this week with the school's patron, the Department officials were further apprised of the current conditions in the building. At that meeting, the Department officials agreed with the patron that there is a need for further maintenance and to provide additional accommodation for special needs pupils in the coming months. A major building project to provide new suitable accommodation for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin is included in the Department's construction programme, which is being delivered under the national development plan, NDP, as part of the Project Ireland 2040 framework. As per the brief formulation document to be supplied to the incoming design team, the options of an extension-refurbishment of the existing or, alternatively, a new school building for Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin and the demolition of the existing school building will be fully considered by the school and its design team at stage 1 of the architectural planning process.

I do not need to come before the House to talk to the Minister for Education because I get the opportunity to do so every week at our parliamentary party meeting. I am sending the message here to the officials in the Department of Education as well and to those people in the school building unit that Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin cannot wait any longer. We have a principal here listening to the response from the Minister of State as we speak. She kindly sent me the reply I could read out on her behalf. She is basically saying that she acknowledges what we have done and the progress made. The school, though, will not last the five years that we expect the ADAPT programme will take. We need to accelerate this process, therefore, as quickly as possible. We must ensure we are not wasting public money and spending emergency works funds now only to subsequently have to pull out stuff we have just put in. The principal in this school has been extremely diligent in how she has approached this project and who has told the State how it can save money, get new SEN classes and improve the facilities in the school. I want the people in the building unit to listen to the principal and teachers in this school and to respond to them by telling them how long this endeavour is going to take, the process involved and by confirming that guidance will be provided through this undertaking step-by-step. I acknowledge the progress made to date, but we need to do more. I hope the Minister of State will take this message back to the Government. I know he will. I am fundamentally committed to increasing the number of SEN places across the whole of Finglas, Santry, Ballymun and Glasnevin. I acknowledge the principals who have opened autistic spectrum disorder, ASD, classes. This is a huge improvement. Education must be for everybody. Principals can only do this, however, if they are not fighting fires on every other front. While Gaelscoil Uí Earcáin is doing a great job, it is fighting these fires.

The Department will shortly advise the school authorities of further developments in respect of the appointment of the design team, which it is anticipated will be completed in quarter 2 of 2023.

I wish to refer to some of the correspondence I have received and then the Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, will know exactly where I am coming from and how frustrated the families are. I was told that the following are some of the concerns families have regarding the CareChoice nursing home in Ballynoe in County Cork. During the Covid-19 pandemic in 2020, it was stated that this home was well managed in respect of infection control as well as the maintaining of communication. The provision of updates to family members was also very good. Families, however, have concerns regarding how this nursing home in Ballynoe was managed from Monday, 14 December 2020. Many of these concerns are reflected in what has been expressed by other families who lost loved ones in this and other nursing homes in the county. Concern has been expressed as to why, on Friday, 14 December 2020, the director of nursing left her position, two senior clinical nurses left their positions and the assistant director of nursing also stepped down from her position in this nursing home. There were also misgivings regarding the residents having been moved out of their rooms without families being aware of this development. Some residents were moved several times. To this day, some families do not even know what room or part of the nursing home their loved ones died in. Equally, disquiet has also been expressed that some families were informed that their loved ones had tested positive for Covid-19 while others were not. Some found this out accidentally from a carer during a phone call, while others only found out when their loved ones died. Some families also have questions as to why their loved ones' remains were not released to the funeral home until two days after their deaths. In addition, some of the families are also concerned about the lack of communication, phone calls not having been answered, promised phone calls having not been received from the director of nursing and that medical updates on their loved ones were all similar and standard updates. In one case, a family member was given a medical update by the director of nursing on another resident and not on their family member. More concerns were raised about the obvious lack of staff from Sunday, 31 January 2021, and about the impact this had on the care and well-being of the residents. The families were also extremely concerned, shocked and upset by what was revealed by the whistle-blowers at a later date on the "RTÉ Investigates" programme. Major concerns were also expressed regarding how residents were cared for. Families also learned that on Tuesday, 2 February 2021, a staff member contacted HSE and the Minister for Health, Deputy Donnelly, begging for help and for someone to come and save the residents. No one came in and lives were lost that could have been saved with the proper help. This plea for help should have set alarm bells ringing, but the HSE handled this situation by emailing the home.Before staff made this call, there were five deaths. On Tuesday, 2 February 2021, the day of the call for help, there were three deaths. After this date, there were a further 19 deaths in the home. There was a total of 27 deaths, 22 of which were over a 12-day period between 31 January and 11 February 2021. The lack of response and help from the Government has forced families to go to the courts to get access to their late family members' records which the nursing homes are refusing access to, and also to get this Government to put in place a public inquiry that is needed into these deaths. There is concern that private nursing homes do not come under the Freedom of Information Acts and that private nursing homes are a law unto themselves in regards to accountability. A HIQA report request by the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler, has caused concern and upset to families, as when the families saw a copy under the Freedom of Information Acts it was heavily redacted. The question is, "Why?" What is being held back from the families and what has been covered up? These are the concerns of some family members. They have not got accountability. They have not got the responses. What they are looking for is an independent public inquiry, specifically, on Ballynoe nursing home or the nursing homes in east Cork. I await the Minister of State's response.

I am taking it on behalf of the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Butler. I would also like to take this opportunity to reiterate my sincere sympathies to all those whose loved ones passed away in nursing homes, the one the Deputy raises here but nationwide as well, during the pandemic. I want to emphasise that quality care and patient safety is a priority for the Government, and the delivery of safe, high-quality services is of paramount importance and focus. Nursing home providers are ultimately responsible for the safe care of their residents. The Covid-19 pandemic has presented one of the greatest and most wide-ranging public health challenges internationally in recent history. International evidence shows that the virus disproportionately impacts older people, and people living in long-term residential care facilities have been identified as particularly vulnerable to Covid-19 by the World Health Organization. Recognising the particular vulnerability of nursing home settings, the State quickly put in place a comprehensive package of supports for nursing homes in line with the National Public Health Emergency Team, NPHET, recommendations in early 2020 and many of these supports remain active. These include more than €145 million provided under the temporary assistance payment scheme, TAPS, with outbreak assistance extended up to December 2022. Other supports included: free personal protection equipment; Covid-19 regional response teams; public health and infection prevention and control advice and guidance; accommodation support; and serial testing for staff. Nursing home residents were also the first to be vaccinated under the State vaccination programme. Since the start of the pandemic there has been significant and ongoing consideration of the impact of Covid-19 and the evolution of the response to it, as evidence and knowledge emerged, and as national and international understanding of the virus evolved. Throughout, this has included a specific and sustained focus on older persons, in particular, those resident in nursing homes. Various examinations and reports with a focus on Covid-19, its impact on nursing homes and the pandemic learnings that can inform future policy, regulation and the model of care for older persons have been undertaken. In particular, the independent Covid-19 nursing homes expert panel was established in May 2020 to examine the complex issues surrounding the management of Covid-19, and to provide real-time learnings and recommendations to inform the ongoing approach to the management and mitigation of risk to older persons resident in nursing homes as the pandemic evolved. The Taoiseach has indicated that a comprehensive evaluation of how the country managed Covid-19 will provide an opportunity to learn lessons from our experiences in dealing with a pandemic. This will help ensure that we are in a better, stronger position if another pandemic or another similar-type emergency arrives. Separately, the Minister has also asked his Department to consider the options available for undertaking a potential review of the management and impact of Covid-19 in nursing homes, taking account of the experience of, and learnings from, other review processes undertaken in recent years.

It states, "Separately, the Minister for Health has stated that he believes that a review of the management and impact of COVID-19 in nursing homes is warranted". The Minister of State, Deputy Rabbitte, mentioned in her response the €145 million provided under the temporary assistance payment scheme. Some €145 million is spent and 27 families in this nursing home still have not got a response to any of their questions. Having the HSE investigate itself is like the Garda investigating the Garda; it does not work. These families tried their best to be diplomatic. They tried to engage with the Minister for Health. The families mention that Ballynoe is in Cork, the Taoiseach's county, and yet he has not met with these families and the families of other Cork nursing homes. There is a lot in this. What I am calling for here is that the Minister with responsibility for this issue engages with the families and also listens to them because I know what they want. All they want is answers. The redacting of information under the Freedom of Information Act for family members must be soul destroying when they are only looking for simple answers as to how their mother died, where did their dad die and whether it was in the same room as they were all the time. These are simple questions. When one gets people so angry on this, it also gives it an air of suspicion, and the more one covers it up the more suspicious people get. That is why these people and these families asked me on their behalf. We are coming into Christmas and here we are talking about Covid and deaths of elderly people and the most vulnerable again. All these families want is answers and they are asking for an independent public inquiry into what happened in this nursing home.

I understand the significant particular impact that Covid-19 had on families who lost loved ones in nursing homes. My colleagues, the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, have met with some of these families and have heard first-hand of their experiences. We all remember how difficult that period was when visiting had to be restricted and when normal grieving and funeral processes had to be set aside. One of the most important things we can take from experiences over the past two years is our learning and our understanding of the challenges facing the nursing home sector and how we can enhance and strengthen the quality of care. The independent Covid-19 nursing home expert panel produced a substantial package of 86 recommendations. These included: immediate actions required at the time for ongoing protection and support for nursing home residents during the pandemic; and medium and longer term recommendations in relation to broader systems reforms to enhance and better integrate nursing home care and older persons care more broadly. Many of the short and medium-term recommendations have already been implemented and progress has been made on reform, including the draft legislation to provide HIQA with the new enforcement powers published in October. The patient advocacy service commenced roll-out in private nursing homes in November 2022 and amendment regulations have been published to standardise and enhance requirements for a complaints process. The findings of the first National Nursing Home Experience Survey were published in November 2022 and give us essential insights on the views of residents and their families. I confirm that the Minister, Deputy Stephen Donnelly, and the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, are fully committed to further reform to ensure an improved quality of service and experience for individuals using health and social care services into the future. I wish to conclude by offering my sympathies to the families that the Deputy speaks about.

I thank Deputy Rabbitte for all the work she has done on the housing area. It is unfortunate, on the second last day before we finish up, that the Minister of State is asked to deal with this housing issue. It is an extremely important issue. There are a large number of people getting caught in the middle-income groups. They cannot get bank loans and they cannot get a local authority house. We have raised a criterion in relation to qualifying for a local authority houses but what is frustrating - it is one of a number of problems I have had over the past number of months - is the timescale in considering loan applications by local authorities.It is too much of a delay. People have lost purchases because there was a substantial delay in signing off loan applications by the local authorities. We must also look at the income criteria. In the past two weeks I had a case sent to me in which the people involved met all of the qualifying criteria. They were saving very hard. They were paying rent of €1,600 per month. If they had been able to draw down the loan they applied for, they would have ended up making repayments of €1,200 a month but they were refused. I do not understand why this is happening. My understanding is that a large number of applications are being turned down by local authorities throughout the country because of the smallest of issues. We need to look at all of the local authorities and have a full review to see what is the timescale from when an application is received to a decision being made. What are the criteria local authorities are using to turn down loan applications? In another case a person was turned down who had full capacity to make the repayments that would be required. He was turned down because three or four years ago he defaulted on the repayment of a personal loan for three months. That loan was fully cleared. It is accepted that he did default because he ran into difficulties when changing jobs and he did not pay. Now it is being taken as an excuse for not giving him a home loan. These are all people who are working hard. They are saving. They are trying to put the package together for themselves so they will not be dependent on the State. Here we are. These are people who are not reliant on H.AP They are not reliant on local authority support for the rent they pay. We are turning down their loan applications. I want the Department to review what has happened over the past 12 months with regard to loan applications. How many loan applications were made? How many were turned down? Is there a need for a more detailed review of local authorities on an ongoing basis with regard to home loans? I recall acting as solicitor in the purchase of three houses a week. One man with four young children wanted to buy a semi-detached house. The deposit on the house was £100, which he did not have. He was able to borrow it from the bank and buy a three-bedroom semi-detached house. We now have a situation whereby if the same person came in to me in the morning with €100,000 in the bank a local authority would not even consider him for a loan. We need to look this. How can we facilitate people who are making every effort to look after themselves and not be dependent on the State when we find the State is not giving them the support they require?

As part of Housing for All a newly expanded local authority home loan was launched in January 2022. Like previous local authority mortgages, such as its predecessor the Rebuilding Ireland home loan, it is a Government-backed mortgage for first-time buyers and other eligible applicants delivered through local authorities. The scheme provides mortgage financing for those who are unable to secure a sufficient commercial loan. The Department has no direct role in processing individual applications. The final decision on loan approval is a matter for the relevant local authority and its credit committee. Decisions on all housing loan applications must be made in accordance with the regulations establishing the scheme and the credit policy that underpins the scheme in order to ensure prudence and consistency in approaches in the best interests of borrowers and local authorities. The Housing Agency provides a central support service that assesses applications on behalf of local authorities and makes recommendations to the authorities to approve or refuse applications. Between January 2022 and November 2022, 2,138 applications, including 214 Rebuilding Ireland home loan applications, were processed by the Housing Agency. Of these, 90 were invalid applications. Of the 2,048 valid applications assessed 889, which is 43%, were recommended for approval and 1,169, which is 57%, were recommended for decline. Regarding the level of refusals, it is important to note that approval for the scheme requires the applicant to be eligible for the scheme and capable of repaying the money borrowed. There are several reasons refusals can occur. Applicants may not meet the eligibility criteria, such as being under certain income limits. Even if they meet the eligibility parameters, they may have issues with their credit history or their repayment capacity may not be enough to meet the monthly repayments required on the mortgage. It is inherent in a mortgage scheme that there will be refusals, particularly for a scheme aimed at those on relatively lower incomes who were unable to source a sufficient mortgage from a bank. It is important to protect both the State and the borrower from taking on unsustainable mortgages. This is the function of credit policy and the credit assessment process. The Department closely monitors the local authority home loan. It offers the assistance or guidance that is required to support the processing of these loans. The Minister is committed to ensuring that the local authority home loan remains an effective support for homeownership for first-time buyers. The Deputy has made some valuable points. As a former banker who is a qualified financial adviser, I know that a timescale can be put in place. For the mortgages that are approved there is nothing wrong with having approval in principle. This allows flexibility. We know it takes time to get a mortgage approved. Once it is approved it should be good enough as approval in principle for a minimum of six months so the person can shop around or see what is available. It should not be specific to one location or one particular property. There could be choice. We should look at the income criteria and make easy-step manuals available for people so they are able to do a ready reckoning and know what criteria they need to meet as part of the submission so it is not declined immediately and there is a mechanism to appeal in the system.

There is a 57% refusal rate. This is 57% throughout the entire country. We must remember this is an average. I understand that the refusal rates of certain local authorities are as high as 70%. This is the concern I have. If the average is 57%, it means some local authorities are proactive in assisting people. I ask that the Department look at the local authorities where the percentage is much higher than the average of 57%. I still think 57% is a very high refusal rate. We need to look at this. If we build a local authority house, and this is not a criticism of people who avail of local authority housing, it costs the State €300,000 on average. This is being provided by the State. Here are people who are saving and once they get the mortgage they will not be dependent on the State for support. We need to be far more proactive in trying to see how we can streamline this and make sure that local authorities do not delay processing loan applications. We must also make sure that common criteria are applied by all local authorities and that one does not have a 70% refusal rate while another has a 35% refusal rate. This issue needs to be looked at.

I have listened to the issues he has raised. Local authority mortgage lending has been successful to date. Between February 2018 and September 2022, approximately €517 million was drawn down by almost 3,100 borrowers through the Rebuilding Ireland home loan and the local authority home loan. Of this €517 million, €30 million was drawn down by 72 borrowers under the new local authority home loan up to September 2022. It is important to note the approval rate has no direct comparator in commercial bank lending as bank refusals are not available by comparison. We cannot see whether local authority home loan refusals are relatively high. A detailed credit assessment process is required to ensure that applicants do not take on unsustainable debt. I will take on board what the Deputy has asked regarding whether there could be a county-by-county assessment to see whether there is standardisation throughout the country. I will bring this to the attention of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien.

#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	347	As the Minister of State will be aware, Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 has been the backbone of the provision of much-needed social housing stock across the State for many years. Without the requirement that each private developer provides a percentage of social housing for the local authority, it is hard to imagine how much worse off the housing crisis would be. These housing units have been essential in trying to protect inner-city communities that are being pushed out by big high-tech companies. The Government does not like to hear any criticism of high-tech companies, but there is another view of the high-tech companies in the inner-city community of Pearse House, Markievicz House and Mercer House and this is due to the huge, negative impact these companies have had on housing for the local community. To see developers using loopholes in outdated legislation is infuriating for local communities in the city who, time and again, feel forgotten and left behind by the State. The moment the previous Minister scraped the height guidelines in 2018, it created a hole in housing legislation for developers to exploit and that is exactly what they are doing. Two years ago, I introduced a Bill aimed at plugging this hole, blocking this exploitation and ensuring there would be fair treatment of the local community and developers building homes. My proposal was on foot of a local campaign in Ringsend that was built around the planning permission that was granted for the development of a seven-storey apartment block on York Road, Ringsend. Having been granted planning permission for the seven-storey block, the developer was exempt from providing social units. He then reapplied for planning permission to change the build to a 15-storey apartment block. Had the developer been successful in this application, it would have resulted in 48 new homes and no public housing for the local community. This application was blocked because of the amazing campaign put together by the local community in Ringsend. In a housing crisis, to allow such blatant dodging of Part V requirements is bonkers. My Bill was opposed at the time with the then Minister saying that York Road was a one-off development and that no other developments would use this loophole. Since then, I am aware of developments on Lime Street and Sandwith Street both of which used the size of the site to be exempt from providing any social units. Both these developments are within 15 minutes of Leinster House. How many examples of the use of this loophole are seen throughout the State? I do not know, but I can guarantee you if they are being built 15 minutes away from the Dáil, they are being built right across the State, particularly in built-up urban areas. What happened on York Road was certainly not a one-off. Will the Government review the position it has taken in the past and address the need to update this flawed legislation, thereby ensuring the gap that developers use to exploit loopholes in the planning laws are closed? If there is already an exemption for small developments of fewer than ten homes, why is there also an exemption based on the area on the ground? That is the loophole developers are using.
#AnneRabbitte	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-party	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-dob	unknown-#AnneRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-12-15 00:00:00	Ceisteanna ar Sonraíodh Uain Dóibh - Priority Questions	348	I thank the Deputy for tabling this Topical Issue matter. Again, I am taking this matter on behalf of the Minister, Deputy O'Brien. The primary objective of Part V of the Planning and Development Act 2000 is to "ensure an adequate supply of housing for all sectors of the existing and future population". Accordingly, Part V allows local authorities to purchase a percentage of land, at less than the enhanced market value, and use it for social, affordable and cost rental housing. The Part V requirement is currently 20%, with no less than half of this to be used for social housing and the remainder for affordable and cost rental as the local authority deems appropriate. That said, section 97 of the 2000 Act also provides for an exemption to Part V for developments comprising four or fewer houses or developments on land of less than 0.1 hectare. The purpose of the exemption is to help maintain housing output and supply. A relatively small number of sites in urban areas, smaller than 0.1 hectares comprising a development of five or more houses, have been granted exemptions. However, without these exemptions, the developments would probably have been rendered unviable because of the cost of including social and affordable homes and much needed housing supply would not have been delivered. Such sites already face potentially substantial additional costs in urban settings given the machinery restrictions associated with infill sites, the need to stabilise existing adjoining buildings and conservation requirements. The Government is committed to achieving compact urban growth and making our towns and cities more sustainable and attractive places for investment and for people to live and work. Urban sprawl and the ribbon development that has blighted parts of our countryside need to be consigned to the past. The national planning framework targets a significant proportion of future urban development on infill or brownfield sites within the built footprint of existing urban areas. In this context, prioritising the development of smaller sites and providing a policy framework and conditions that incentivise rather than stifle such developments is critical. The Part V exemption is a key enabler in this regard. It facilitates the development of very small brownfield sites and in turn creates new homes, builds economic activity and reduces social decay. Removing the exemption will likely prevent such sites being developed. In urban settings, these sites tend to be already serviced, making them ideal for development. The lack of suitable serviced sites is generally understood as one of the primary obstacles to housing delivery. Moreover, removing the exemption may only marginally increase the capture of Part V units in dense urban locations, including in Dublin city, where brownfield and infill development on sites of 0.1 hectare or less takes place. Accordingly, given the limited additional return of social and affordable housing that would result from removing the exemption, coupled with the potential for unintended consequences and undermining housing supply, I suggest the exemption in respect of such developments and sites should be retained. However, there may be merit in considering the potential to modify the exemption and the scope for limiting it in larger urban areas, including Dublin, where urban density guidelines and changes to height restrictions may mean that these sites can contain larger numbers of dwellings than was previously foreseen. To this end, I have asked the Housing Agency to consider the scope and merit, if any, of modifying the current Part V exemptions. The conclusions from this work will be considered in the context of other changes that may be brought forward on Part V in due course.

The scraping of height restrictions has led to applications for ten- and 15-storey buildings. There was an application for a 15-storey building in Ringsend with public housing available on the site but that did not happen. We need to ensure this loophole is closed. There are other sites next to Pearse House flats, which are not too far from here, and Leo Fitzgerald House that are exempt from the Part V provision of public housing. It means local communities and families will miss out. There are many cases of three generations of families living in two-bedroom flats, such as in Pearse House.In one case, five people were living in a one-bedroom flat in Markievicz House until very recently. That is replicated right across the city. Conditions are overcrowded in many flats such as those on Rathmines Avenue, in Mercer House and Whitefriar Gardens. The overcrowding is completely unacceptable and it is equally unacceptable that developers are allowed to exploit loopholes in the legislation to get out of their responsibility to provide public housing for the local community. I acknowledge the work the Minister of State has done. I know she is here regularly. The Minister of State certainly deserves a Christmas break because she has got to be one of the most hard-working Ministers around. Gabhaim buíochas léi and I wish her a happy Christmas.

Importantly, the Part V exemption supports compact growth and the first of the ten national strategic outcomes of the national planning framework. It is also critical to the transition to a low-carbon and climate-resilient society as outlined in the Climate Action Plan 2019. It underpins successful delivery of Housing for All in helping meet housing supply targets, incentivising the regeneration of small sites in towns and cities and making housing more affordable and sustainable in the longer term. The exemption facilitates development of very small brownfield and infield sites in particular, in turn creating new homes, regenerating inner-city areas, meeting housing needs, building economic activity and reducing social decay. While exemptions for the development of five or more houses on sites of 0.1 ha or less are more prevalent in larger urban settings rather than rural ones, the number of such exemptions granted is still quite low. Removing the exemption would probably only marginally increase the yield of social and affordable housing for the State, even in Dublin city, and may result in unintended consequences and stifle much-needed development in housing supply. However, as the Minister has outlined earlier, the Housing Agency has been asked to consider the matter with a particular focus on larger urban areas and report back with its conclusion. His Department will consider actions and next steps. I wish the Deputy and everybody in the House a happy Christmas and I thank the Acting Chair for all his work.

Before I start, I extend my deepest sympathies to the family and loved ones of Seán Rooney from County Donegal who was killed overnight. The country woke up to shock and horror over that. There is no doubt Seán is a hero who put his life on the line for the protection of peace in a very troubled part of the world. Donegal has gone through great suffering in recent times and it is shockingly sad to see the county again struck by such sadness. I give our solidarity and condolences to his family and friends and to Óglaigh na hÉireann on such a sad day. I am pleased to introduce the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) (Pets) Bill 2021 on Second Stage on behalf of Aontú. This is the second animal welfare Bill Aontú has produced in this term. It is fair to say we have a very strong record on human welfare in the Dáil, being the only party to support human rights fully, but we are also a party very much dedicated to animal welfare and the protection of animal welfare. I thank Deputies Verona Murphy and Seán Canney, two colleagues from the Regional Group who have co-signed this Bill. Their support for the Bill is very much appreciated. I thank the Dublin Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, DSPCA, and Dogs Trust Ireland which are doing great work caring for stolen and abandoned animals. Their organisations deal daily with the damage being done to pets. I also thank them for the work they have put into this Bill. The first thing this Bill does is separate the theft of a dog or pet from the theft of a household good or inanimate object. Pets are very much central to families. In many ways they are members of families. They are great companions to children as those children grow and develop. Dogs are great company and security for older people in their twilight years. They are there to welcome us when we get home from work. They get us out for exercise and break the ice with strangers. The loss or death of a pet is a heartbreaking experience, and any family that has experienced the loss, death or theft of a dog will know it comes with grief. Most people will agree the loss of a pet is not the same as the theft of a laptop, phone or another inanimate object. It is not the same as the theft of a farmyard asset. This Bill seeks to treat the theft of a pet differently. It seeks to recognise the value and importance of pets in family life. This Bill was born out of the experience of so many people during the Covid crisis. Many families were stuck at home and many purchased a dog as a companion. This led to the price of dogs skyrocketing and in turn a lucrative black market for dogs. Professional criminal gangs made considerable money from the theft of family pets. We have heard many stories of thieves leaving marks on the road in chalk or tying pieces of string to garden gates to identify a home to be targeted later that night. These thieves came back to steal those families' pets. The stolen dogs are in many cases shipped to legal or illegal puppy farms in Britain. The price that some of these dogs fetch is north of €3,000. In the past couple of years, An Garda has found 32 stolen dogs which were estimated to have been worth more than €150,000. That shows the scale of the crime we are dealing with. This is big money. Professional criminal gangs are doing this type of work. Providing for a fine of €5,000 or €10,000 to try to deter that type of crime does not make sense. I do not wish for anybody to go prison but I wish for a deterrent strong enough to match the impact the crime has on families and prevent such a crime happening in the first place. I understand the Government will support the Bill on this Stage and, if I am correct in that, I very much welcome it. We have the opportunity to make sure that what are perhaps thousands of families annually do not have to deal with the theft of a central element of their family or go through the grieving process and disaster of that. I ask for a deterrent strong enough to prevent criminals from seeking to proceed in this manner. I welcome the support of the Bill and I hope others in the Chamber will support it as well.

I thank my colleague who is predominantly responsible for this Bill but I am very proud to support it.Last night, I posted some information on Facebook about the Bill and early this morning, I received an email from a constituent which stated:I am [a] Wexford based [constituent] and I run a Group on Facebook Missing Stolen Animals Ireland which I set up in 2020 at the height of pet theft during lockdowns. Over the past two years I’ve witnessed the pain and loss dog owners have gone through, the frustration of these thieves not being caught or punished. Dogs stolen in 2020 that are still missing from their families now. I have just over 10,000 members from every corner of Ireland. Animal lovers who are 100% behind a change in legislation.I’ve been doing some research on The Aontú Pet Theft Bill which passed the 1st stage of the Dáil 27/1/21. I also have been in contact with Aontu’s Emer Toibin. I was happy to read your post and see that you will bring the Bill to the floor [alongside your colleague Peadar] tomorrow evening.When I look back on the number of dogs of which were shared on Facebook and in my group specifically:- I recorded 91 dogs missing/stolen from 1st of January 22 to the 5th of July 22.- I also added up the number missing/stolen from the 6th of July to the 16th of October [There were] 84- Therefore the total from 1/1/22 - 16/10/22 = At least 175 dogs missing/stolen in Ireland.There may be more not shared on social media and this would bump up the total figure for 2022 even more.I cannot emphasise enough the impact this is having on families across Ireland. The not knowing, their much-loved family member vanished without a trace and feeling let down by the system [which will not] help them. The explanatory memorandum for this Bill states: "The purpose of this Bill is to provide for a mandatory minimum sentence for theft and certain related offences concerning pets." It also states: "Section 2 provides for the Short Title to the Bill and its commencement." It further states:Section 1 introduces a new section into the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001." This new section provides for a mandatory minimum sentence for adults who commit theft or certain related offences concerning pets, and defines the term ‘pet’ for the purposes of the section. The Bill states:(1) Where—(a) a person is guilty of theft, burglary, aggravated burglary, robbery or handling stolen property, and(b) that offence—(i) relates to property which is or includes a pet, and(ii) was committed after the person had attained the age of 18 years, the sentence imposed on that person on conviction shall not be less than 10 months imprisonment.(2) The operation of the period of 10 months imprisonment specified in subsection (1) shall not be suspended in whole or in part by the sentencing court.(3) This section applies to a person in respect of an offence referred to in subsection (1) only if that offence is committed after the coming into operation of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) (Amendment) (Pets) Act 2021.(4) In this section—‘farm animal’ has the same meaning as it has in the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013;‘pet’ means—(a) dog,(b) cat, or(c) any animal (other than a farm animal) kept, or intended to be kept for companionship.”.Subsection (1) provides for the ten-month prison sentence as a minimum. We need tougher sentences across the board for a variety of serious crimes which are treated too leniently at this point. This Bill at least toughens the sentence for the crime of pet theft. Subsection (2) prevents a court from turning that ten-month sentence into a suspended sentence. Suspending sentences trivialises serious crimes. It makes a mockery of justice and is akin to little more than a slap on the wrist. Subsection (4) defines what is meant by a pet as opposed to a farm animal and makes an important distinction between the two. The Government is accepting the Bill, for which I am grateful. The Ceann Comhairle will appreciate that pets are like family members to many people. I spoke about the dog warden for Wexford earlier today. There are 55,000 homes in Wexford. Current statistics indicate that 49% of homes have a pet, whether a dog or a cat. They are mostly dogs. That would mean there are over 27,000 households in Wexford alone that have dogs. We have to safeguard them. They are the only family members for many people. We know that they are companions. Just like my colleague, I do not like mandatory sentencing as a mechanism. All too often, however, leniency is not the deterrent we should have in the system to ensure that these things do not happen. Ultimately, if one of our children went missing or was kidnapped, there would be a hefty sentence for that type of offence. It needs to be the same in this instance. It means as much to people if their pet is stolen and not returned. One woman in the north of the county, who is in her early 60s, had her dog stolen last year. Six months after that event, her dog had not been returned or found and nobody had been prosecuted. She sold her house and moved, such was her grief. She was inconsolable. She did not want another dog. It was not just a dog; it was like her child. Some people just do not get that. I understand why, but for those who do and who have pets that they regard as family members, it is up to us to make people think twice before they steal one. It should not just be about money. I thank the Minister of State and Government for taking this on board. I look forward to engaging further on it.

We are all shocked and saddened by the news that he lost his life in Lebanon. I extend my sympathies to his family, friends, community and comrades. Private Rooney's death is a reminder of the risks and sacrifices that our peacekeepers make every day when on duty. I wish a speedy recovery to his colleagues who were injured in that horrific incident. I thank Deputies Verona Murphy, Tóibín and Canney for bringing forward this Bill and speaking on it this evening It relates to an important issue on which I have spoken previously. Pets are incredibly valuable to us. We saw that during the Covid lockdowns. We have an emotional attachment to our pets that goes far beyond property ownership, and the loss of a pet is far more than an economic loss. It is a loss from our lives and it brings a deep worry about what has happened to them. As public representatives, we regularly deal with constituents who have suffered the loss of pets and can see the distress caused. Pets are also particularly important to older people and vulnerable people. That is why there is a shared understanding of the importance of this issue across the House. This is a matter I have worked on since becoming Minister of State. I have had very useful and constructive input from the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and others. The Government will not be opposing the Bill. Before speaking to the specifics of it, and some concerns that arise, it would be useful to take stock of where we are. Demand for dogs was particularly high during the Covid lockdowns. Huge prices were being paid, and, unsurprisingly, that coincided with an increase in reported thefts. I liaised with the Ministers for Justice and Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputies McEntee and McConalogue, on the issue at that time. Information for dog owners went out through the Garda, and there was targeted enforcement and ongoing patrols. The Garda reported a number of search and seizure successes through this period, as did customs and excise officers at designated ports of entry. The message went out that dog theft was already a serious crime and that people faced serious sentences for it. As Deputies know, these prison sentences run to up to ten years for theft and for handling of stolen property and up to five years for possession of stolen property. Where a burglary is involved, the sentence may be up to 14 years' imprisonment. When imposing sentences, judges are not limited to considering the monetary value of a pet. The sentimental value and the emotional distress to the victim caused by the offence can be and are taken into account. The Animal Health and Welfare (Sale or Supply of Pet Animals) Regulations 2019 brought in new registration requirements which anyone trading in pet animals must adhere to. Both the person and the premises used must be registered with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Sellers must keep records of who they buy animals from and they may not sell animals younger than the ages specified. The Microchipping of Dogs Regulations also apply. All dogs must be microchipped by the age of 12 weeks. If one is advertising a dog for sale, the advertisement must now have the microchip code. Together these steps acted as a strong deterrent, and it is positive to see that most recent figures indicate a significant reduction in reported incidents of dog theft in Ireland in 2022. This reduction coincides with the preventative measures taken and the reopening of the country. To date this year, 47 incidents of dog theft, involving 128 dogs, have been reported. This is relative to a dog population of approximately 500,000. These numbers are comparable with those in other countries, such as the UK. The Garda Síochána takes pet theft very seriously. I encourage anybody with information to report it to An Garda Síochána. If people believe their pet has been stolen, I ask them to please report it to An Garda Síochána. Leaving aside for a moment whether property offences in general adequately capture the emotional impact of pet theft, I do not agree that current sentencing provisions are inadequate. Offences of theft, handling stolen property and so on are very serious, and potentially carry long sentences.There is a good, principled argument to be made that viewing pet theft as solely a property offence is too narrow a perspective. This was ultimately the conclusion the UK task force came to. The UK is introducing a new offence of "taking a dog without lawful authority", which distinguishes pets from inanimate property. It also puts in place some important practical measures, such as excluding disputes over pet ownership that might arise in a relationship breakdown, for example. I caution that changes to the criminal law can only be a part of the answer and that we need to look at pet welfare, control and ownership in the round. Everyone can play a part in deterring theft. There are two key practical actions, the first of which is microchipping. As I said, every dog must be microchipped by the time it reaches 12 weeks of age, or earlier if it is sold or moved from its place of birth. The microchip must be registered with an authorised database. Microchipping of all dogs protects the animals' welfare and assists with speedy identification and reunification of lost or stolen dogs and their owners. It is an offence to keep a dog aged over 12 weeks that has not been chipped. It is an offence to sell such a dog. Chips can be easily checked by a vet and by the Garda. They are by far the most effective means of tracking and identifying dogs. The second action is I would urge anyone considering buying a dog to ask to see the pup in its home environment with its mother. People should never buy a puppy from someone who offers to meet away from the puppy's home. People should ask for evidence the seller or supplier of the dog is properly registered. They should ask to see the certificate of registration of the microchip. It should never be the case that a person is buying a dog informally from someone he or she does not know, without any paperwork and without checking that the dog is microchipped. Deputies referred to the recent report of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine on issues surrounding dog welfare. The report makes a number of recommendations to improve legislation relating to dog ownership, welfare and breeding, including outright bans on certain practices and tighter regulation. Some of these recommendations will complement existing measures deterring pet theft. Colleagues in the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Rural and Community Development, and Housing, Local Government and Heritage are actively considering those recommendations. A cross-departmental review of the laws around the control of dogs is now also under way and being led by the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy McConalogue. A terrible incident occurred in my own home town of Enniscorthy just a couple of weeks ago when a nine-year-old boy, Alejandro Miszan, was attacked and severely injured by a dog. It was truly shocking. My thoughts are with Alejandro and his family and friends following the horrific ordeal he endured and to wish him well in his recovery. In more recent days there were two terrible dog attacks in counties Offaly and Kildare, where up to 70 sheep were killed. I heard the farmer, John Healy, on the radio talking about the harrowing scene of devastation he and his children came upon. Fifty sheep were killed in the attack on his farm, and that is any farmer's worst nightmare. I understand the Garda is investigating these incidents and as Mr. Healy said on the radio, somebody must know something about this attack on his farm. Those dogs would have arrived home covered in blood and their owners have a responsibility here. I encourage anybody who has information to come forward. The review being led by the Minister, Deputy McConalogue, will build on the work undertaken by the Department of Rural and Community Development in its consultation report on dog control earlier in the year. The goal, in short, is to ensure there is a culture of responsible ownership which will benefit dogs, owners and society more broadly. We all love dogs but if you own a dog, you need to look after it and you need to control it. I will make some brief observations on the Bill itself, some of which I have touched on already. As I have said, the Government is not opposing the Bill at this Stage. I hope these observations are taken constructively as the Deputies further consider their Bill. The Bill provides for a mandatory minimum sentence and does not provide any discretion for the sentencing court to not apply this minimum. As a starting point, involving the Oireachtas in determining minimum rather than maximum sentences is very much the exception, and for good reason. We entrust courts with the responsibility of determining what is an appropriate sentence based on the facts of the cases before them, including the specific features and gravity of the offence, the circumstances of the offender and the impact on the victim; in short, the aggravating and mitigating circumstances. Minimum sentences are used sparingly in Irish legislation and are typically appropriate for only the most serious offences, such as section 15A possession of drugs with a value in excess of €13,000 with intent to sell or supply, section 15 possession of a firearm with intent to endanger life or a mandatory life sentence for murder. It would be a significant departure from sentencing practice to impose a mandatory minimum sentence in respect of a pet theft offence, which, while very serious, may not be of comparable gravity to other such offences just listed. I will say something on minimum sentencing more generally. Deputies have referred to dogs being stolen by organised crime groups One of the weaknesses of minimum sentences is the people who are subject to them are usually not the ones calling the shots. They may be young people on the bottom rung for whom long prison terms are not the answer. Where minimum sentences are used, they are generally prescribed on a presumptive basis where judges may impose a lower sentence if exceptional and specific circumstances make it appropriate to do so. The Bill before us does not provide for such a possibility. As Deputies are aware, the Supreme Court struck down a non-discretionary minimum sentence as unconstitutional in the Wayne Ellis case in 2019. The assessment of the Attorney General's office is the offence proposed in the Bill would face similar constitutional difficulties. There are other technical legal issues with the drafting that would also need to be considered further. In policy terms, as I mentioned, the issue here is not that the sentencing powers are inadequate and the question is rather whether property offences are the most appropriate tool. These are areas the Deputies might reflect on and which might form part of the consideration on subsequent Stages. While it would not be possible to support the Bill as it stands to enactment, given the issues I have raised, and in particular the constitutional difficulties, it is an area of active and ongoing policy development and I look forward to working with Deputies on it in the future to see how these issues can be addressed. A Chathaoirligh Gníomhaigh, this would usually be the last piece of business before the Dáil rises for Christmas. While that is not exactly the case this year, I might nonetheless take the opportunity to thank the Ceann Comhairle, the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, all the Deputies who have acted as Cathaoirleach, the ushers, everybody working within the Dáil, Seanad and Oireachtas buildings, including those in the canteen and everyone who helps keep this place running. It is not an easy job at the best of times and I thank them for their help and support throughout the last year.

Ireland woke up this morning to hear this sad news. I think also of his colleague, Trooper Shane Kearney. We wish him a speedy recovery. Our thoughts are with their families and their colleagues in the Defence Forces. It reminds us all of the dangers that are out there on peacekeeping missions around the world. Ireland has a great and wonderful tradition of keeping peace and being out there to work on behalf of people in conflict-torn regions around the world. I wanted to take the opportunity to say that. I am glad to get the opportunity to speak on this legislation. We will not be opposing the Bill either. We see the merits of it and the direction it intends to travel. I think all of us acknowledge the love and compassion people can have for a pet and especially for a dog. We have Rua and Seoda, two large Irish wolfhounds, at home. They are certainly something all in our house care very deeply for. It is the same across the country for people who have pets. Often, a small house dog is something a person can give all their attention and the reflection of love they give back is unconditional. The dog always comes wagging its tail to you no matter what kind of humour you are in and that is something we all recognise and understand. If an animal like that gets sick or is stolen, it is a very traumatic thing for the owner. This legislation is trying to reflect that and to do something in respect of it. I understand that almost 250 dogs were stolen in 2021 across the country. That was an increase on the previous year. We are also aware of the issues with microchipping. The Minister of State has mentioned there has been work done in respect of that. I think there are four different databases that record microchipping and that needs to be streamlined to ensure all the information goes onto the one database in order that everything is accessible to all authorities, including the councils, which have a role here, and to the Garda and veterinary practices etc. across the country. The scanners used need to be more widely available. Generally it is only vets who have them. Members of An Garda Síochána should have them, as should community wardens working with local authorities. It is important because sometimes a dog or animal is found dead on the road and it is simply disposed of, with nobody checking it for a microchip. That dog could very easily be reported stolen at some stage and nobody knows what has happened to it. In other words, there are gaping holes in how things are processed and done in respect of that and we must acknowledge that as well. I return to the Bill before us.I understand the need to do something here and to raise this issue but I also have reservations about mandating judges to use minimum sentences. It is something we are always careful about and we need to be careful about it here. As the Minister of State alluded to, short sentencing is widely recognised by international assessments as something that does not create the best outcome. People who go to prison for short periods of time end up reoffending and going onto a conveyer belt. There are alternatives that must be examined. That is not to say we should not have very strong deterrents in place for people who would take a part of a family away, which a pet often is. We need to find a way of looking at that and coming up with a solution in respect of it.  There are a couple of things I would like to find out a little more about. Perhaps as the Bill progresses we can look at these things. For instance, does the Bill cover breeds on the restricted dogs list? We need to be careful about that. We are all very conscious of the devastating effect attacks have had, particularly on children. Unfortunately, the case in the Minister of State's county of Wexford was not the first. There have been others. Across the water in England, there have been many. There are issues around that. The control of dogs and everything like that needs to be tightened up big time across the State. We also understand that the welfare of animals in general is something we all have a keen responsibility for, to ensure strict guidelines are in place and have to be adhered to. A trade has developed in buying and selling dogs, particularly some of the bred dogs. They are similar to the wolfhounds we have at home, which are purebred. They are beautiful animals and people want to have them and cherish them and all of that. It has become quite a lucrative trade for some. That is fine provided they do it right and follow the guidelines and provided it is all above board and done properly. That is the key thing here. Many people recognise that there are large problems in respect of how well it is done, inspections and all of that, and ensuring people are complying with the regulations that are in place at present. Many of these incidents of the theft of an animal or a pet in a house or whatever take place in the context of a burglary, where a lot of other items can be taken as well. I have experience of people who have had their property vandalised or robbed. The one thing they always talk about being taken is the pet. It is more important than anything else that was taken. This legislation is trying to reflect that. There needs to be a recognition that it is not the same as a camcorder, a phone or a laptop. It is something that is part of people's lives. I commend the proposers for coming up with this legislation but there is work to be done on it. Hopefully we can all work together to get it through. It is very seldom that any legislation comes before us on First Stage or Second Stage that does not need to be developed or does not need the input, particularly on Committee Stage, of expert witnesses who can give us direction and support on how to make it better and make it effective. We want to make sure we do something that is effective, works, creates a greater deterrent to prevent people carrying out these kinds of offences, and ensures these kinds of offences end. That is one of the big things that need to happen. We want to stamp out the activity of those who violate people's lives by taking away their pets like that. I again thank the proposers. I commend the Bill. I am sure it will pass forward and go through the other Stages and hopefully be improved upon.

I reiterate what he said about Alejandro Miszan. I brought this up with the Tánaiste this morning during Questions on Policy or Legislation. He said there is a review under way as to how we resource our dog wardens. Clearly, 1.6 whole-time equivalents in Wexford, servicing 27,000 homes, is not effective. We can have all the laws we like but if we are not able to resource them into effectiveness and have them implemented, it is pointless. I thank the Minister of State for that. I would also like to pay sympathies to the family of Private Seán Rooney. What has happened is despicable. He lost his life in service on behalf of us in this country. It is devastating for the family. It is a particularly hard time when something like that happens. I wish them well. They will be in my thoughts and prayers, alongside his colleague from Cork who is seriously injured. I wish him a speedy recovery. I thank everybody in the House. It has been a very busy and tough year. I thank the staff and all my colleagues, who have been more than courteous at all times. I wish the staff in the Departments as well as the staff in the House, those who feed us and those who serve us, as they say, a very happy Christmas.

It would not have made it to this Stage if not for that important help. This is a very important issue to many people around the country. Legislation on animal welfare needs to be strengthened. We need to strengthen regulations to protect animals in this country, especially around puppy farms. You can have all the laws you like if you do not have the enforcement to implement them and make sure that law sticks. There is a significant weakness in that enforcement. I recognise that the Minister of State has a special interest and has made a special effort in this area. We also need proper regulation around dangerous breeds of dogs. I cannot imagine there is a town or village in the country that does not regularly see dangerous breeds operating outside of the law. The law is broken day in, day out, in that area. It will not be long until someone is killed, unless there is proper enforcement. We need a far more holistic view of the development of animal welfare legislation. It should not be done through the smallest parties in the Dáil tabling legislation. We all have a responsibility for pets and animals. It should be under the one Department. Right now, it is between a number of stools departmentally and it is falling between those stools, as far as I can see. We need to make sure the charities and experts have a big input into this. I am not a fan of mandatory minimum sentences either but we need to have some level of discussion around this. On many occasions we hear on the television or the radio about grievous crimes being committed and people walking away from them with suspended sentences. I will just give a couple of examples. Ireland is a place where a man can confess to the rape of a woman and still serve no time in prison. Many people walk away with suspended sentences for sexual assault in this State. One headline I looked at a while ago reads "Suspended sentence for man who broke into woman's home and sexually assaulted her in bed". There are suspended sentences for possession of child pornography. While we want leeway for judges to be able to make informed decisions, taking all the issues into consideration when developing a sentence, we must also realise that at times we do not have consistency in the delivery of sentencing. We need to make sure we impose a serious deterrent for what is a grievous wrong. Ní ionann madra ná peata agus teilifís ná guthán, agus níor cheart go mbeadh an pionós céanna ann don dá rud.

It has been a busy and important year in many respects. I thank all the men and women who work to ensure this Parliament functions properly. An enormous amount of work is done by very talented people and I hope they get some level of a break and a rest to re-energise over the Christmas holidays.
