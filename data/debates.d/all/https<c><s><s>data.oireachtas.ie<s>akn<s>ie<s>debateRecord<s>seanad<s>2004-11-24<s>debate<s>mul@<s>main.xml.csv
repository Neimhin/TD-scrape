I have selected the matters raised by Senators O'Meara, Kitt and Feighan and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule out of order the matters raised by Senators Scanlon and Coghlan as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matters.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	2	Yesterday we had the spectacle of a 77 year old great-grandmother from Limerick city about to be jailed for the non-payment of a small fine. I have discovered that last year in excess of 1,000 people were put in prison for as much as two weeks for the non-payment of a fine. I give notice that my party intends to introduce a Private Members' Bill on this issue. Unfortunately, the legislation in question, the Enforcement of Court Orders Bill 2004, was voted down in the other House only two months ago.The Fine Gael Party wants the Government to re-examine this issue. It is a scandal that people should be sent to prison and take up prison space at a cost of €4 million or €5 million per annum when white collar criminals get away with crime unnoticed on a daily basis. We must address this scandal and the only ways of doing so are through attachment of earnings or the payment of fines by instalments. New legislation is needed in this area and the Fine Gael Party will introduce a Bill on the matter early next week. I ask that the Government allocate time for its consideration at an early date to ensure the matter is addressed. In 1981, the Law Reform Commission produced proposals in this area, yet nearly 25 years later we still await Government action. I ask the Government side to give time to the Bill when I bring it before the House next week.I presume the House will receive a glut of legislation between now and the Christmas recess. To be fair to the staff of the Houses and Opposition and Government spokespersons, and to ensure the legislation is dealt with in an orderly fashion and sufficient time is available to debate the matters in hand, will the Leader indicate what Bills will be taken before the Christmas recess? We need adequate time to table amendments.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I note the House will sit on Friday. While I do not object to Friday sittings, I object when their sole purpose is to facilitate the Dáil rushing through legislation on Wednesday and Thursday before dumping it in the House on Friday. The Leader will share my view on the matter. I would be much happier if we started our meeting on a Tuesday to the effect that we cannot be used as a dumping ground for matters not dealt with in the Dáil. I do not object to the Order of Business as it is in place this week but it is a precedent along with which we should not go. It is the Dáil's problem if it does not deal with its business in time. We should question every occasion on which matters are rushed through this House.The issue raised by Senator Brian Hayes is crucially important. It is a joke that we are prepared to waste time sending people around to investigate dog licences and report to the Garda, which then wastes further time preparing a case and taking people to court, threatening them and deciding to send them to prison because they do not have a dog licence. There are enough problems in Limerick city already and the residents there will be less than impressed that State and Garda time, and prison space, are being tied up on such issues. It is completely wrong.Speaking for the small people, there is also very likely a miscarriage of justice in this situation. This great-grandmother was only feeding a stray dog which she had never owned. Nonetheless, she was threatened with incarceration in prison and her family must come up with the money to prevent this outcome. To do that to a great-grandmother, suffering from asthma and some other illnesses, reflects extraordinarily badly on our system of justice. I could not agree more with Senator Brian Hayes on the need to deal with this issue. It brings the whole system into disrepute. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last night spoke about building more prisons and the need for more prison space. This raises the question as to why such a high proportion of the population is incarcerated compared with other countries. The kind of nonsense we saw threatened in Limerick this week is the answer.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	4	Iman al-Hams, a young Palestinian was murdered by the Israeli defence forces in October. The Israeli authorities exonerated the army officer whose own troops saw him shoot the child. There is a transcript of the radio conversations taking place when that happened which demonstrates quite clearly that this was deliberate, cold-blooded murder. If a Palestinian had done it we would quite rightly condemn it and the world would rightly demand sanctions against the Palestinian authorities because of their failure to control terrorists.

It is a crime worthy of the summoning of an ambassador to the Department. Murdering children is not part of the war on terrorism, it is a disgraceful abuse of power and needs the voice of civilised people to deal with it.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I move an amendment to the Order of Business, namely, that the first item we should discuss is the Government's reneging on its pledge to meet the UN target on overseas development aid by 2007. The Estimates may provide a blanket to cover this issue. This is not just a question of abandoning the poor of the world but how the world sees a Government which feels free to make solemn pledges at a variety of international fora, to win votes to get itself onto the UN Security Council and abandons that pledge without so much as blinking when it becomes inconvenient.I am concerned that I cannot now trust my Government. How can the DUP trust a Taoiseach who goes to the UN and solemnly makes a promise to do something and then comes home and abandons it because it is a bit difficult? How can Ian Paisley trust the Government when the going gets rough with the sort of people who are carrying out surveillance on Ministers? As the Government has undermined our capacity to trust it, I call for a debate on the reneging of the foreign aid target of 0.7% of GNP.

I refer to the battered and bruised face of William Bartley, who was attacked in his home in Donegal, robbed and brutalised. Here was a 74 year old bachelor, almost totally deaf, who would have expected to live out his twilight years in peace. I do not think this is about policing; we are dealing with a malignancy in society of which we have seen so many examples. The only antidote we have to this type of thuggery comes from the community itself. Ultimately, the people in the community are the only ones who can find out who is causing this. How do we ensure this will not happen again?Can we set aside time to discuss the broader issues of society? Each time we come to this House, we look at some recent act that has shocked us in some way. There are deeper issues involved. Why is it that we no longer have respect for human life? Why is it that older people must lock themselves up at night, afraid that they too will be attacked? We should set some time aside to have a broader debate on that issue.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I second Senator Ryan's amendment to the Order of Business. I also want to briefly refer to the Limerick experience which has been spoken about. We have worse problems in Limerick than having to put a great-grandmother into prison over a dog fine. The contrast in the system can be seen with the deployment of resources. We read in the newspapers today that six gardaí took a lamb from the back of a house and put it in another location. However, we also saw the harrowing pictures of the man from Donegal and his experience of thugs who broke into his house. In that context, it may not have everything to do with policing and something to do with the community. Something is happening in Irish society when people resort to these horrendous crimes accompanying burglaries.There is a concern in rural Ireland regarding policing that is not just confined to County Donegal. We have to look at the deployment of resources. Are they deployed effectively? In the type of shift systems which operate in most urban communities, are gardaí deployed effectively at the times when crimes are more likely to occur? This has implications for rural policing.Rather than the Minister talking about increasing the number of prison places, he should look seriously at a situation where up to 1,000 people a year are in prison because of non-payment of fines. It has been advocated over the years by various reports that fines should be paid in instalments in order to ensure they are paid. In many cases, the fines imposed by the courts are quite steep in terms of the offence committed. I am amazed that this has not been looked at.

At such a time, the House should acknowledge the courageous and brave stand being taken by the people of Ukraine. In recent days, we have seen their protests against corruption and electoral fraud that has been documented and statistically proven by those who have observed the electoral process in that country. This issue is so important that the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should ask the Ukrainian ambassador, who I believe resides in London, to account for the electoral fraud that has been perpetrated in Ukraine.As a member of the Council of Europe, I have watched in recent years as many former Soviet states have reverted to totalitarianism and authoritarianism. Fraud, corruption and abuse of power are rampant in such countries. Ukraine is seeking to become a member of the European Union. I oppose any engagement with the EU, at any level, on the part of Ukraine's administration, as it seems to be a puppet Government.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	37	Can I raise an issue relating to the European Commission? The House can arrange for MEPs to come here. A former President of the European Parliament has addressed the Seanad. The situation in Europe is so serious that we should ask such people to come to the House to explain what is going on. I supported the removal of Mr. Buttiglione, but I also spoke against the candidacy of a woman who had a serious conflict of interest and a person who was being put in charge of tax matters but had no fiscal understanding whatever.We have now learned that Mr. Barrot, who was originally proposed as the justice Commissioner, had a conviction for embezzlement. People in Ireland are entitled to know what is going on in Europe. Why are totally unsuitable people being proposed as Commissioners? Why can decent candidates not be found?I would also like to ask for a debate on Iraq. I would like a specific and clear answer on the matter from the Leader today or tomorrow. I understand that she has certain difficulties. However, I will be placed in a difficult position if I do not receive an answer today or tomorrow — I will have to continue to demand an answer. I refer specifically to the Gulfstream jet that has been landing at Shannon Airport. It has been widely stated that the jet has been adapted to facilitate the transport of kidnapped persons to destinations where they may be subject to torture at the behest of the CIA. As Shannon Airport is being used, we are entitled to know how many times the aeroplane has landed there. Has it landed 14 times, or 16 times? Has the Garda used its powers to investigate the matter by boarding an aeroplane to search it?In light of the behaviour of the allied forces in Iraq, it is vital that we should get this information. They appear to be driving tanks over wounded people in the streets of Falluja. There is no doubt that they are murdering unarmed people in mosques. Can one imagine what would happen if someone attacked a church and shot unarmed elderly people dead? The press is being muzzled, since it has only embedded people there. They have assassinated reporters from various countries and bombed the offices of Al-Jazeera television. We are being denied information and war crimes are being committed in which this country is complicit. That is why the Taoiseach is refusing to answer these questions in Dáil Éireann, and it is imperative that this House gets the answer that I have sought for at least six weeks with the support of my colleague, Senator Henry. I have not received a single answer. The Leader has simply stated on every occasion that she notes my question. There is not much point in noting a question unless one gets an answer.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	38	I support Senators O'Toole and Brian Hayes regarding the plight of the Limerick great-grandmother. It is a poor use of Garda and prison resources to deal with a woman in her state in that fashion. However, that does not detract from the fact the control of dogs is an issue. Perhaps the Leader might organise a relatively short debate in this House, particularly in the run-up to Christmas. Much of the problem arises from pets being given to children at Christmas, a wholly inappropriate practice that should obviously be addressed soon. I was appalled to hear a County Clare dog warden talk the other day of several houses in the county with over 50 dogs. When one considers the damage to livestock and young children, one sees that the control of dogs is a real issue. We have seen appalling attacks by marauding dogs on young children and livestock. While we should not confuse the two matters, it is important that a strong statement be made on dog control.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	39	I ask the Leader to invite the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, into the House to debate the question of elected representatives having a voice in the administration of local health services. We heard her speak last night on setting up the new health service structure, but there was no reference to local input. She also said that a 12-strong team would be setting up the health service. It is important that we know the identity of those people and whether it will be done regionally. It is also important that local democracy be respected in the administration of health services. The present structure does not allow for adequate democratic input into the administration of the health service, and it is important that we have that debate. From the foundation of the State, there has always been local input into the delivery of health services. That is what people want, and it should be afforded to them. It would be for the betterment of health services.

I agree that we should have the debate proposed by Senator Ó Murchú. What influences the mentality of those who would go and beat up old people in the manner shown?I welcome, in so far as they go, the concrete increases of €50 million or €60 million in the overseas development aid budget. If Senator Ryan went over previous programmes for Government and manifestos back to 1981, he would find that many Governments had pledged during their time in office to achieve the target of 0.7%. All Governments, including Senator Ryan's colleague, Deputy Burton, have found it difficult to achieve as great an advance as they would have liked. It is good that there is a three-year rolling programme and that we will get, let us hope, close to 0.5%. The pledge has not been reneged on, any more than it has been reneged on or abandoned by 24 other OECD countries.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	46	It was disclosed in the press last week that not all genetic tests carried out in a private institution in Galway were accurate. Although it is attached to the university, this is a private institution. It has carried out work for ten years because the national genetics institution in Dublin is flooded with work and is inadequately resourced and staffed. However, the institution in Galway does not employ people with clinical acumen and, therefore, it is like not having people to accurately interpret X-rays for patients. This is a serious situation and I fail to understand why greater note is not taken of the lack of facilities for people with genetic diseases. A young man suffering from cystic fibrosis, who was awaiting a lung transplant, died in the Mater Hospital yesterday. While this is tragic, it is more tragic that, despite the Department of Health and Children establishing a cystic fibrosis group several years ago, which recommended that all newborn children be tested for the disease, nothing has happened, even though the earlier children receive treatment, the better the outcome.I have read the programme of priorities published by the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children. Will the Leader ask her to come to the House to debate genetic diseases? Sometimes people think this issue is related to abortion or  in vitro fertilisation and prenatal diagnosis but that is not the case. It relates to families in which one member has a genetic disease being in a position to find out the likelihood of another child being affected if the parents decide to have more children. People deserve better than they are getting.

I thank our MEPs for the support they have given us and I hope the application will be successful. Tugaim lán-tacaíocht don Rialtas as ucht an iarratais seo.

There was a great deal of violence on our streets over the weekend and I have frequently raised this issue in the House. A Lithuanian man was stabbed to death while another was stabbed in Tallaght and a 74 year old man was attacked in Donegal. A number of Members have wondered whether we are changing as people. This is not the Ireland of the welcomes with non-nationals increasingly falling victim to violence, an issue I have also raised. Yesterday, the Taoiseach referred to gangsters and thugs in the context of the young man shot dead in Dublin over the weekend; he said they were involved in activities to make money to buy properties in Spain. Drugs are fuelling much of this crime and the task force in this area is not doing enough to address the problem. Will the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to outline what is being done to get drugs off our streets?

Approximately 140,000 jobs are at stake in the tourism industry. Have we taken our eye off the ball? Almost 20 years ago in 1985, I attempted to bring a large group to Ireland, but was told it could not come because we did not have a national conference centre. I was delighted to hear the Minister say yesterday that it is hoped to have one by 2008. The conference industry is an enormously valuable business for Ireland. Will the Minister come to the House to tell us what he is doing about it? Clearly, we are not adhering to the policies and do not have the strength and commitment we should have.

Given that New Year's Day can, unfortunately, be an anti-climax in many respects, it would be appropriate to provide some special funding for voluntary groups or town councils to organise fireworks displays in their towns for young families. We normally see images from Sydney of New Year's Eve fireworks while New Year's Day is invariably a damp squib here. We should celebrate the beginning of a new year in that way. If a small sum of money were allocated to the various groups they could organise displays and make New Year's Day a more enjoyable family day.

Will the Leader endorse this and commit to a date for this debate? Does the Leader have any proposals for debate on the budget next week? In the past we have debated it almost immediately after it has been produced in the Dáil.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	56	Senator Quinn raised the issue of tourism. In the first week of February this year it was impossible to get a car parking space at the Giant's Causeway in County Antrim because of the number of British, European and American tourists. However, in Donegal, just 45 minutes away from the Giant's Causeway via the Magilligan ferry, there were only empty car parks throughout the month of July in tourist areas. We need serious debate on an all-Ireland strategy for tourism. We have Fáilte Ireland and in the north west we have North West Tourism, Donegal Tourism and Donegal Tourism Limited. We must have serious debate on the issue of tourism. Why are the car parks full in February at the Giant's Causeway, but empty in July in Donegal?
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Senator Brian Hayes raised the matter of the 77 year old woman in Limerick. In that context the wider question concerns the unsuitable use of Garda time, resources and prison spaces. The Senator intends to introduce a Private Members' Bill shortly and we will facilitate debate on that issue.Senator Brian Hayes stated that a glut of legislation is expected and asked that we have an orderly use of time, which we will. Senator O'Toole also raised this matter. On the wider issue evoked by that request, since the occasion approximately 18 months ago when we had a long contentious Bill in the House, we have sought not to have all Stages of a Bill taken together. We do not approve of that and do not deal with legislation that way. There is now time between Second and Committee Stages. It is proper that we provide time to debate legislation. I do not call the expected legislation a glut — that sounds excessive coming up to Christmas — but there will be plenty of legislation. We will use our time in an orderly way to debate legislation.I extend the same assurance to Senator O'Toole. There will be no rushing of Bills. He said he did not object to sitting on Friday in principle but he would object if the purpose was simply to be seen to mop up Dáil business. However, that is the way it is, we get Bills from the Dáil. Some legislation is initiated in this House and we will discuss such a Bill this week.

If the other House is tardy we cannot do anything about it but, as I have proved on several occasions, I will not stand over the rushing of any Bill in this House.Senator O'Toole also echoed what Senator Brian Hayes said, with which we would all agree, about the waste of State time on petty issues. When some issue that is glaringly unjust arises, we would have a rush of comment here on the matter but the case in Limerick was absurd. It was clear that it was not the woman's dog anyway so what was it all about? Her family paid the fine, not wanting to see her go to prison.Senator Ryan referred to the young Palestinian child, Iman al-Hams, who was murdered by the Israelis about which there is a justifiable wave of condemnation. He moved an amendment to the Order of Business which was seconded by Senator Finucane. I intended replying to this matter but my colleague Senator Mooney very ably dealt with it. Senator Ryan is fully entitled to his comments about ODA but I regret the linking of it with the talks currently going on in London. I hope we would all wish the team in London well. I felt a shock when Senator Ryan referred to Dr. Paisley and so on. The talks are ongoing and we wish them well.

He referred to a malignancy in society, which I agree is the case. That incident is every bit as ugly as what is happening in Iraq. We rightly condemned the killing of the dying soldier but what happened Mr. Bartley was equally ugly. Senator Ó Murchú called for a broader debate on the issues in society which are leading to that kind of action.Senator Finucane seconded Senator Ryan's amendment regarding ODA. Senator Mooney responded to the slur on the Taoiseach at a sensitive time. He also wants the Minister for Foreign Affairs to request the Ukrainian ambassador who is based in London to come here to explain what is happening. The people who oversee elections said there were faults in the system. Two people have claimed to be elected but we do not know what the position is.Senator Norris referred to the European Commission. We are all amazed that the French Commissioner appears to have come unscathed to the Commission. I accept that in the French system a presidential pardon wipes out all wrongdoing, which is handy.I have tried to get answers to Senator Norris's questions. He should not think I am being tardy.

I will try again today to get an answer on the Gulfstream jet and Shannon. It is Senator Norris's belief that people who were kidnapped have been transported in the manner he outlined. He wants to have the matter clarified or warns of trouble to come.Senator Dooley echoed the comments about the poor use of Garda time. He also raised the issue of the way pets are treated when they are given to children as presents; they are often disowned and thrown around the place when children tire of them after three days. Senator Bannon requested that local voices and input be provided for in the health system. I am sure the Senator will give great voice to his thoughts when the Health Bill 2004 comes before the House shortly.Senator Mansergh stated that no one over 70 years of age should be sent to prison. He welcomed the increases in the overseas development aid budget of €50 million to €60 million. These are generous sums of money and I will not enter into the debate on personal grounds. Nonetheless, people have every right to voice their disagreement on the general issue. Senator Henry referred to an institution in Galway and the fragile X syndrome, which I found very mysterious and could not understand. The Senator requested a debate on genetic diseases and how we are addressing the issue in Ireland.Senator Kitt referred to the issue of official status for the Irish language in the EU. In that context, this House agreed a motion to support that recognition and it looks as though it will happen. Senator Feighan requested a debate on drugs and violence. I thank Senator Brennan who congratulated Senator Mansergh on his nomination to the Council of State, on which I served once during former President Mary Robinson's tenure.

He welcomed the fact that a national conference centre is now mooted for 2008 and requested that the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism come before the House to discuss the matter. Senator Browne requested publicly-funded New Year's Eve fireworks. A young fellow like the Senator should have more to do on New Year's Eve than go to a publicly-funded fireworks party.

This week's business had already been arranged when the office was contacted by Senator Minihan but we hope to have such a debate next week. The Goldman Sachs report is on the website.Senators asked about the arrangements for the budget debate, which we were discussing earlier outside the House. According to tradition, we always hold the debate on the evening of the budget. We are in the middle of discussions with the party leaders to see if we can use Private Members' time to hold the debate at 5 p.m. The House will not sit that afternoon because Senators will be in the Lower House to listen to and observe the fireworks there.

I accept the Senator is concerned; he has often raised the issue of tourism in the House.Senator Hayes asked about forthcoming Bills and when they are due to come before the House. We are drawing up a schedule for Members. It is only fair that spokespersons should get sufficient notice of Bills so they can prepare and make comprehensive speeches on them in the House.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak in the House. I was with some Senators last night who are, should I say, of the right political persuasion or socialist persuasion and we had an enjoyable night. Some of the females ditched me but I managed to get home safely in any case.I am pleased to present to the House the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 on behalf of the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. Regrettably, the Minister is unable to be present due to other business and has asked me to convey his apologies to the House for his absence. The original purpose of the Bill, which was published in 1999, was to make some technical amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, based on the experience of the operation of the Act since 1996. The Second Stage of the Bill was taken in the Dáil in June 2000, but further progress was delayed pending the outcome of a number of court challenges to the Act at that time. The Bill fell with the last Dáil and was restored to the Order Paper in July 2002.However, following the publication of the second interim report of the Flood tribunal in September of that year, it was decided to provide additional powers to bolster the work of the Criminal Assets Bureau in pursuing the proceeds of all forms of crime, including corruption. To this end, a substantial number of additional proposals were drawn up for inclusion in the Bill which were moved by way of amendments to the Bill on Committee Stage in the Dáil.In its amended format as passed by Dáil Éireann, the Bill is now divided into five parts. Part 1 contains standard provisions. Part 2 deals with amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 while Parts 3, 4 and 5 deal with amendments to the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001, respectively. I propose to deal with the main proposals in the Bill, including those changes which have been made in the other House.Sections 1 and 2 of Part 1 contain the preliminary and general interpretative provisions. Part 2 comprises nine sections and contains the amendments to the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. Section 3 substitutes new definitions in that Act for "applicant", "proceeds of crime", "property" and "respondent". The new definition of "applicant" is a broader definition which will give the Criminal Assets Bureau the flexibility to take proceedings in its own name in addition to taking proceedings, as is already the case, in the name of a member or authorised officer of the bureau.The new definition of "proceeds of crime" replaces the reference to "the commission of an offence" in the existing definition, with the words "criminal conduct" and a definition of "criminal conduct" is included in the section similar to that used in section 21(7) of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001 in respect of the offence of "money laundering". This change means that it will not be necessary for the CAB to show that the criminal conduct was a particular kind of criminality if it is shown that the property was obtained through conduct of one of a number of kinds, each of which would be an offence. In addition, the extra territorial references are included in the definition of "criminal conduct" to link into the definition of "property" which can include property outside the jurisdiction.The new definition also takes account of the recent Supreme Court decision of 17 May 2004 in the case of McK. v. D. which found that the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 did not apply to foreign criminality. The definition of “criminal conduct” ensures that foreign criminality is now covered by the scope of the legislation where there are proceeds of that criminality within the State. As I have stated, the definition of “property” has been amended to provide for inclusion of a reference to property which is situated outside the State but where there are specific links to this jurisdiction, namely, that the respondent is domiciled, resident or present in the State and all or any part of the criminal conduct takes place within the State.The definition of "respondent" has also been amended to include a reference to wherever the person is domiciled, resident or present to reflect the fact that in some instances the service of proceedings may be out of the jurisdiction. An additional change provides that not only may the respondent be the subject of proceedings but also a person who, but for the Act, would become entitled to inherit the property of the respondent if he or she died. In addition to the changes in definitions already in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, new definitions are included for "consent disposal order" and "criminal conduct". The consent disposal order is a new provision which I will describe when I come to section 7. As I stated, a definition of criminal conduct is included.The combined changes relating to the definitions of "proceeds of crime", "property", "criminal conduct" and "respondent" will mean that the proceeds of crime legislation will apply in five specific scenarios as follows: where the respondent and the property are in the State and the criminal conduct occurs within the State; where the respondent is situated outside the State but the property is located in the State and the criminal conduct occurs within the State; where the criminal conduct occurred outside the State but the respondent and the property are situated within the State, provided that the conduct constituting the offence is also an offence in the foreign jurisdiction; where the respondent is situated within the State and the criminal conduct occurred within the State but the property is located outside the State; and where the property is located within the State, the respondent is situated outside the State and the criminal conduct occurred outside the State, provided that the conduct constituting the offence is also an offence in the foreign jurisdiction.Section 3 also inserts a new section 1A into the 1996 Act, the purpose of which is to make it clear that a person remains in possession of property even where the property, after seizure, is in the lawful possession of the Garda or the Revenue Commissioners or is subject to an interim or interlocutory order or any other order of the court or is subject to a letting agreement.Section 4 is largely similar to section 3, as published. The first change, contained in subsection (a), is a technical amendment consequent to the amendment already made in section 2(a), which provides for applications to court to be made in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau. The second change makes provision for an interim order made under section 2 of the principal Act to be varied so that income tax or other sums owing on foot of court orders may be recovered. At present, an interim order may only be varied on the application of the person against whom the order is made or by another person who claims to own part or all of the property. This additional subsection provides that the applicant, namely a person who is a member or an authorised officer of the CAB or the Criminal Assets Bureau itself, or any other person may apply for a variation of an interim order for certain purposes. The purposes for which a court may vary any of the terms of an interim order are set out in subsections (a), (b) and (c) of the new subsection 3A and include where the respondent owes a sum under a court order, recovery of any sum owed in income tax and to permit proceedings to be taken for the recovery of any other sum owed by the respondent. This new provision will enable other specified claims on the property to be met from the frozen assets and will facilitate further the tracing of other properties without cost to the Exchequer.The third change brought about by this section deals with giving notice of an application for an interim order under section 2 of the principal Act and follows on from subsection 3A, which enables the applicant or other person making the application to seek a variation of an interim order. The section also provides in paragraph (d) that a section 2 application is to be made by way of originating motion. Similar amendments are included in sections 5 and 6 with regard to section 3 interlocutory orders and section 4 disposal orders. The purpose of providing for applications by way of originating motion is to ensure a procedure by way of motion grounded on affidavit. As a result, defendants will be obliged to respond to proceedings on affidavit and so avoid the need for particulars and discovery at an early stage in the process. The court will still be able to order particulars and discovery and fuller pleadings when necessary. The effect will be to have the matter in a court list at the earliest opportunity with the full case of both parties set out in a formal manner.Section 5 is substantially the same as section 4, as published. In subsection (a), it reflects the changes in section 3(a) to allow an action to be taken in the name of the Criminal Assets Bureau. It also introduces a permissive element to the decision making process of the court, by providing that the evidence tendered to it may now consist of or include evidence admissible by virtue of section 8, whereas previously the evidence tendered to it was required to consist of or include such evidence. The effect of the latter change is to provide the court with more flexibility with regard to the matters it may take into consideration in reaching its decision as to whether to make an interlocutory order. The new subsection (b) inserts a new subsection 1A into the principal Act to provide for a consent disposal order to be taken contemporaneously with a section 3 interlocutory order if all the parties are in agreement.Subsection (c) of section 5 inserts an additional subsection 3A into section 3 of the principal Act. This additional subsection provides that a court may vary the terms of an interlocutory order following an application to it by the applicant or any other person for the same reasons for which it may vary an interim order, that is, to permit enforcement of any court order for payment of any sum, including an order as to costs; recovery of income tax due as well as any fees or expenses arising under section 962 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997; and proceedings to be taken for the recovery of any other sum owed by the respondent.Subsection (d) of section 5 substitutes a new wording for section 3(6)(a) of the principal Act, providing that notice of an application under the section be served by the applicant or other person making the application on the respondent unless the court is satisfied that it is not reasonably possible to discover his or her whereabouts.Section 6 contains the provision to which I have already referred to allow for an application for a disposal order to be made by way of originating motion.Section 7 is a new provision for a consent disposal order which was included on Committee Stage. Section 4 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 already provides that where property has been the subject of an interlocutory order for a period of seven years, an application may be made to the High Court by the Criminal Assets Bureau for a disposal order, whereby the property is transferred to the Minister for Finance. This amendment introduces the concept of a "consent disposal order" which will allow for that period of seven years to be reduced on application to the court with the consent of all the parties concerned. However, it contains a protection by providing that the court must not make such an order unless it is satisfied that no serious risk of injustice arises. This provision was sought by the Criminal Assets Bureau based on its experiences to date. It has pointed out that, in some instances, the individuals concerned want to see final closure on the proceedings and do not wish to wait for the seven year period to elapse. The consent disposal order procedure will allow this to happen.Section 8 amends section 6(1)(a) of the principal Act. At present, a respondent whose property is frozen under an interim or interlocutory order may apply to the court for an order which will enable that person to discharge reasonable living and other necessary expenses. This section will extend that facility to any person who may be affected by either an interim or interlocutory order under the principal Act. For example, it will enable a spouse or dependent of the respondent to make an application to the court in his or her own right for access to the frozen property.Section 9 amends section 8 of the principal Act in two ways. At present, section 8 of the 1996 Act provides that evidence of belief of the applicant that property is the proceeds of crime must be given in the case of an application for an interim order under section 2, either on affidavit or if the court so directs in oral evidence and, in the case of an application under section 3 for an interlocutory order, in oral evidence only. Under this new provision, such evidence at the interlocutory stage may be given on affidavit or, where the respondent requires the deponent to attend for the purpose of cross-examination or where the court so directs, the evidence must be given orally.This measure will enable the resources of the Criminal Assets Bureau to be used more efficiently, while, at the same time, safeguarding the court's role and the rights of the respondent. In the second change, a new subsection (6) is being added to section 8 of the 1996 Act. This new subsection is a consequential amendment arising from the earlier proposal which permits the Criminal Assets Bureau, as a corporate identity, to apply for orders under the principal Act under its own name. It provides for a rebuttal of a statutory presumption that a document purporting to have been issued by the Criminal Assets Bureau and signed on its behalf shall be deemed to be such a document and so signed.Section 10 is included because of confusion which has arisen in the past where proceeds of crime applications for interlocutory orders pursuant to section 3 of the 1996 Act were challenged on the basis, incorrectly, that they are actions for forfeiture so as to benefit from the two year limitation period provided by section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957. This amendment confirms the decision of the Supreme Court of 17 May 2004 in McK. v. D., where the court upheld two earlier decisions of the High Court to the effect that section 11(7) of the Statute of Limitations 1957 does not apply at any stage to proceedings under the 1996 Act. Section 11 amends section 9 of the 1996 Act to make it clear that an affidavit of property or income which the court may direct a respondent to file is not generally admissible in evidence in any criminal proceedings against the respondent or his or her spouse.Part 3 comprises 6 sections which amend the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. Section 12 reflects the earlier change to the definition of "criminal conduct" contained in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996 and provides for consistency between the definition in that Act and the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. The definition of "place" is included with particular reference to the search warrant provisions of the legislation to clarify that the scope of application of such warrants may include a dwelling in addition to any other place.Sections 13, 14 and 15 replace references to "criminal activity" with "criminal conduct" in those sections of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act, where they occur, and provide consistency with the corresponding new proposals for the Proceeds of Crime Act. Section 5(1) of the 1996 Act provides, as one of the functions of the Criminal Assets Bureau, "for co-operation with any police force, or any authority, being a tax authority or social security authority of a territory or state other than the State." However, civil forfeiture asset recovery agencies like the one recently established in the UK do not come within these categories and hence the need to include in the area of co-operation an authority with functions related to the recovery of proceeds of crime. Section 14(b) provides accordingly.Section 15 amends the section 14 search warrant provision of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 in many ways. It provides for the period of the search warrant to be for one week from the date of issuing of the warrant unless a judge orders otherwise, but in any event the period of the warrant shall be no longer than 14 days. This upper time limit on the warrant was included following concerns expressed in the Dáil by several Opposition Deputies. Section 15(b)(ii) makes it clear that the material that can be seized cannot include material subject to legal privilege. Section 15(e) provides that the authority to search also includes authority to make and retain a copy of documents or records and, if necessary, the seizure and retention of computers or other storage medium on which a record may be kept. Section 15(f) inserts a new subsection (6A) modelled on the provisions of section 48 of the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act 2001. It provides, in the context of a search warrant, for a bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána to take certain specified actions in the case of computer searches.Section 16 contains a provision to increase the maximum amount of fines on summary conviction for offences under the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 from €1,500 to €3,000. Section 17 creates three new sections, 14A, 14B and 14C, in the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996. The new section 14A provides for production orders to make material available for Proceeds of Crime Act purposes. This new provision is modelled on section 63 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. It allows a bureau officer who is a member of the Garda Síochána to apply to the court for an order to make material available for the purposes of an investigation into whether a person has benefited from, is in receipt of, or controls proceeds of crime. It outlines the conditions attaching to this order and deals with the operation of these orders and also includes provision for criminal sanctions for non-compliance with the order.The new section 14B provides for an offence of disclosure prejudicial to making available of material under the new section 14A, more commonly referred to as a "tipping off" offence. This new provision is modelled on the offence of prejudicing an investigation contained in section 58 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994.The new section 14C provides for application to the court for disclosure of the identity of persons for whom property is held in trust. This new provision will enable the chief bureau officer or an authorised officer of the Revenue Commissioners to apply to the High Court to establish the identity of trustees or persons for whom property is held in trust where there is an investigation into whether a person is in receipt of, or controls, or has benefited from, the proceeds of crime.Part 4 comprises 4 sections which amend the Criminal Justice Act 1994. Section 19 amends the seizure and detention of cash provision contained in section 38 of Criminal Justice Act 1994. The new subsection (1) of section 38 gives the Garda and officers of Customs and Excise a power of search where there are reasonable grounds to suspect that a person may be involved in importing or exporting an amount of cash not less than the prescribed amount of €6,500 and which either directly or indirectly represents the proceeds of crime or is intended for use in connection with criminal conduct.The new subsection 1(A) broadens the power of seizure in section 38 of such cash to officers of the Revenue Commissioners instead of officers of Customs and Excise, as at present, and allows for seizure of cash which is suspected directly or indirectly to represent proceeds of any criminal conduct, and not just drug trafficking, as at present. In addition, the amended seizure power will now apply to cash anywhere in the State and not just to money "being imported into or exported from the State." A new subsection (3A) inserted after subsection (3) of section 38 of the 1994 Act provides that where an application under section 39 of the 1994 Act has been made to the Circuit Court for forfeiture, then the provisions of section 38(3) relating to a three month time limit shall not apply.Its effect is to avoid the need for returning to the District Court every three months to renew a seizure order under section 38 in a situation where the Circuit Court has taken seisin of proceedings to deal with an application for forfeiture of cash seized under section 39. In other words, the cash can be retained without the need for orders to be made in the District Court at three monthly intervals pending a final determination of the application for forfeiture in the Circuit Court.Section 20 amends the provision contained in section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 relating to forfeiture of seized cash and is a consequential amendment to take account of the fact that section 38 has been amended to refer to cash which is suspected directly or indirectly to represent proceeds of any criminal conduct, and not, as previously, just drug trafficking.Section 21 amends section 43 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 by providing for new definitions of "cash", "criminal conduct" and "proceeds of crime". The new definition of "cash" widens the existing definition by including notes and coins in any currency, postal orders, cheques, bank drafts, bearer bonds and bearer shares. The definition of "criminal conduct" is the same as that proposed for the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, while the inclusion of the "proceeds of crime" definition ensures compatibility with the definition in the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996.Part 5 comprises just one section — section 22 — which inserts new sections 2A, 2B and 2C into the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001. The new section 2A provides for seizure of a gift or consideration which is suspected to be a gift or consideration within the meaning of section 1 of that Act. It is modelled on section 38 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and will mean that a suspected bribe, as an instrumentality of crime, will be automatically capable of seizure. The new section 2B provides for forfeiture by the court of the gift or consideration which has been seized and detained under the previous provision. The provision is modelled on the forfeiture of cash provision in section 39 of the Criminal Justice Act 1994. The court may make an order, regardless of whether proceedings have been brought against a person for an offence with which the gift or consideration is connected, and the standard of proof for proceedings for forfeiture is that applicable to civil proceedings.The new section 2C applies the provisions of section 40 regarding appeal, section 41 on interest, section 42 on procedure and section 45 on disposal, which change the seizure and forfeiture provisions of cash contained in Part VI of the Criminal Justice Act 1994 to the new seizure and forfeiture provisions in these amendments.There are two possible additional proposals for inclusion in this Bill on which work has been continuing. An outline was given by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on Committee Stage in the Dáil of a possible provision for an in personam action which would constitute a statutory tort of unjust enrichment. Its purpose would be to deal with the situation where someone, by means of some corrupt act, is able to benefit from the enhancement of value of property legally acquired, arising from the corrupt act. The example was given of a person who bribes a council official to allow him or her to build 60 rather than 50 houses on an estate. The mechanism that is being considered would provide for a procedure to go after the additional profit generated by the bribe.As outlined on Report Stage in the Dáil, a draft head of such a provision has been drawn up. It is currently being scrutinised by senior counsel from both a constitutional and technical point of view and those views are expected shortly by the Attorney General. Senators will appreciate that any such provision must be able to stand up to the most rigorous scrutiny. Subject to the advice of the Attorney General, it is intended to move an appropriate amendment on Committee Stage in this House.The other provision being considered for possible inclusion as an amendment on Committee Stage in this House relates to hearsay evidence following the decision of the Supreme Court in the Hunt case, CAB v. Hunt, 28 February 2003, 173 and 174 / 01. In that case, the court took the view that the reference at the end of section 8(5) of the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 to information, documents and other material obtained by CAB officers under the subsection being admissible in subsequent proceedings, did not bypass the rules of evidence but merely allowed such documents to be admitted in accordance with the usual rules of proof, notwithstanding their origin. The Criminal Assets Bureau has expressed concerns about the added administrative burden in providing large volumes of administrative records arising from that decision and a possible amendment is therefore being examined. If feasible, the intention would be for this to be done by way of an amendment to the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996, so that any proposal would be restricted to proceeds of crime cases under the remit of the Criminal Assets Bureau.This Bill is very complex and technical, but will considerably bolster the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in its continuing battle to go after the proceeds of all types of crime, including white collar crime and corruption. It also makes some important changes to the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 which will be of great benefit to the Garda Síochána and customs officials in pursuing all those who seek to profit from all crime.I would like to record my appreciation of all those who have been involved in the drafting — the detail, application and otherwise — of this particular Bill. The officials of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform have been very determined to assist in addressing the issue before us, namely, the proceeds of crime and corruption. I commend the Bill to the House.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	80	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. My party is fully supportive of the main thrust of this Bill. Whether that means increasing the powers of CAB, gardaí or customs officers, we are fully supportive of such measures. However, we believe that the proceeds of crime, especially drug trafficking, should be ploughed back into the communities that have been ravaged and destroyed by these criminals. The Bill before us has been lying around for four or five years. While I recognise that it fell with the last Dáil, it was put back on the Dáil Order Paper in July 2002 and it is only coming before this House now. At that time, some consideration was given to setting up a second corruption assets bureau along the lines of the present CAB, but it was not considered necessary. It was felt that the existing activities of the CAB in the fight against corruption could be best bolstered by the inclusion of additional amendments in this Bill.The Bill is complicated and technical, clearing up some of the definitions and making new provisions which will bring it in line with the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996, the Prevention of Corruption Act 2001, the Criminal Assets Bureau Act 1996 and the Criminal Justice Act 1994. Whatever is required in legislation to ensure that the proceeds of crime support areas afflicted by its effects should be expedited. The Government will have my party's support in that regard. As a result of the tardiness of the Government in proceeding with the legislation, my colleague in the other House, Deputy O'Dowd, was forced to introduce a Bill of his own last year. True to form, the Government voted that down. Deputy O'Dowd's thinking was that the funds seized should be ring-fenced and used for a specific purpose. In that context, the funds could have an influence in education and in discouraging the use of drugs. This should be the intent of this Bill and the Minister for Finance must be amenable to such a suggestion. The creation of another slush fund for electoral purposes is not envisaged in these circumstances. We need strong assurances from the Minister that this will not be the case and that the communities most in need will benefit as a result of these funds. These are the people who have been hit by crime and they should benefit out of the resources seized from criminals.I listened with interest recently to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, when he spoke of deplorable gang warfare in west Dublin. He stated that resources for the gardaí were not an issue yet community leaders decried the scarcity of community gardaí in Blanchardstown and other areas of Dublin. The problems in these areas must be tackled by an interagency approach, including social services, the gardaí and sporting and youth organisations working together and rebuilding communities. The vast majority of residents in estates in Ireland are good law-abiding citizens, who want to live in peace and harmony with their friends and neighbours. They are terrified by anti-social behaviour perpetrated by thugs, vandals and dangerous criminals. No law-abiding citizen should be afraid to live in his or her own house or estate in this country, yet this is the case. From what I can glean from the Estimates, the Minister must be expecting to get his hands on quite a large slice of funds seized by the Criminal Assets Bureau to honour some of the promises made. He continues to make promises on a recurring basis in press statements. The public wants action rather than fine words. The Minister talks a good show and I support him in many of his pronouncements which would be strong on law and order. However, people's patience is wearing thin at the moment because of the inaction in so many areas.We must get to the root of the problem. The ring-fencing of the funds from the proceeds of crime could go some way in addressing the problems of the areas in question. Section 4 of the 1996 Act provides that the proceeds of the assets cannot be distributed until seven years have passed, but surely a period of three or four years would make more sense. The Minister of State said that the consent disposal order will deal with the problem, which I welcome. The Criminal Assets Bureau, which was established by the rainbow Government, has been one of the most important weapons in combating criminals who felt they were untouchable. The bureau has had great success in retrieving and selling assets. The seven-year period I have mentioned is too long, however, and I am glad it has been dealt with.The victims of crime should be to the front of our minds at all times. They should be supported from the funds seized from criminals because they have suffered at the hands of such people. A far greater emphasis should be placed on the plight of victims. In that context, it is difficult not to think of the case of an elderly gentleman in County Donegal, which was reported in a newspaper today. When one sees the state he was left in after he was beaten up, one questions the development of our society.It is clear that the Bill's technical aspects are necessary to protect and increase the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau and all other State agencies. Fine Gael supports the Bill's technical elements, although it may propose some amendments on Committee Stage. It awaits with interest the Government amendments which were mentioned by the Minister of State, particularly those relating to the additional profit that people may have gained from the sale of sites and other matters referred to by the Minister of State, such as business with planning officers.I assure the Minister of State that my party will support the Government in expediting this Bill, which is necessary. I am sorry that the Bill was not brought before the Seanad sooner, although I realise that certain problems arose in the intervening period. We support the general thrust of the Bill.
#TonyKett	unknown-#TonyKett-party	unknown-#TonyKett-dob	unknown-#TonyKett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	81	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. He is a former colleague of mine from our days on Dublin City Council. It is good to have him here. I am grateful for the opportunity to say a few words on this amending legislation. As the Minister of State said, the Proceeds of Crime (Amendment) Bill 1999 was introduced to amend aspects of the Proceeds of Crime Act 1996. It will ensure that the 1996 Act can fight effectively, as it was intended, against criminals who are trying to retain assets they have obtained as a result of unlawful activity or illegal operations. I understand that certain aspects of the original Act, such as the question of who is responsible for the assets of criminals following a court order to seize them, are open to interpretation.The Bill should be welcomed by the Garda and others who work in this area because it will give them a major tool to use when tackling the nasty characters they encounter. Such workers will no longer be powerless when they try to challenge individuals whose lifestyles are far beyond what they can afford from legitimate means. Not only does the Bill provide that such criminals will be punished financially, but it also increases confidence in the system among the Garda and the public. It reassures the people that ill-gotten gains accumulated by criminals will eventually find their way back to the Exchequer. Criminals engage in their murky business so they can gain the trappings of wealth and enjoy the lifestyles they desire. Now that the CAB has proven itself, they are starting to wonder whether they can retain what they have gained illegally. That is an indication that we are starting to win the battle against them.An examination of the Criminal Assets Bureau's record — the number of interim orders and interlocutory orders in respect of property, the number of demands for the payment of tax and the interest on such payments — demonstrates that it has enjoyed considerable success in dealing with people suspected of being involved in criminal activity. The bureau is highly respected nationally and internationally. In 2003, it obtained interim orders worth over €3 million and interlocutory orders worth almost €900,000. It demanded tax and interest of over €7 million and collected approximately €10 million in that year. It collected social welfare savings of €110 million and recoveries of almost €200,000 in 2003. Such figures comprise a tremendous record for a given year.In the period between its statutory inception in October 1996 and the end of December 2003, the bureau obtained interim restraint orders to the value of approximately €51 million and final restraint orders worth approximately €22 million. It demanded taxes and interest of over €76 million in that period, of which €56 million was collected. There were social welfare payments of €1.5 million and recoveries of almost €500,000 between October 1996 and December 2003. Since its inception the bureau has achieved tremendous feats overall and in individual years.Many of the moneys about which we are talking have been seized from drug barons. The drugs problem no longer pertains to Dublin and the other cities only — it has long since found its way to various towns and villages. The national drugs strategy was established to tackle the drugs issue in the most comprehensive way that has been done in the history of the State. It assigned clear responsibilities and set targets for the various Departments and agencies involved. The drugs task forces, which were established in the areas most affected, help communities, agencies and all those involved to work together in a developed way to tackle the issues which exist in each area. The task forces have been particularly effective in places where drug taking was endemic. Having served on Dublin City Council and worked in the north inner city for almost 18 years, I saw at first hand the devastating effects of drug taking on local areas.We have made good progress in providing treatment to those who depend on drugs. The Eastern Regional Health Authority, which has expanded its services, has been involved in a significant degree of activity. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, who was chairman of the authority when it was known as the Eastern Health Board, has first-hand experience of the efforts which were made at that time. There has been a major expansion of the methadone treatment programme, from 1,400 participants in 1995 to almost 7,000 now. The number of treatment locations has increased dramatically, despite a great deal of opposition from communities which did not want such centres to be based in their localities. The authority could be faulted for the manner in which it pursued the matter in certain instances. It tended to go to places to develop centres before leaking details of developments to the public. One can imagine the opposition to such centres that resulted from the secretive way in which they were developed. I experienced such problems at first hand. The authority has succeeded in establishing a significant number of centres, which are doing terrific work.Prevention was one of the four pillars of the drugs strategy. While it is important to treat those in communities which have suffered from the scourge of drug taking, we should provide sufficient resources to those working in the area of prevention. The only way to prevent someone from developing a drug habit is to cut the supply. Gardaí and customs officers are to be congratulated on the significant seizures they have made in recent years. The amount seized is evidence in itself of the fact that we are still a major target for criminal gangs as a country to which they want to ship drugs. I have no doubt that, as gardaí and customs officers close down routes, the criminals will find other ones by which to ply their trade.The Garda Síochána has seen success, seizing approximately €20 million in drugs in 2000, €45 million in 2001, €49 million in 2002 and €100 million in 2003. That is a very significant advance. I have no doubt that those who trade in drugs look at those figures and see they really have a fight on their hands. That fight will step up a notch because of legislation such as this. The Garda National Bureau of Fraud Investigation received over 4,000 reports of suspicious transactions to the value of €271 million in 2002, and over 4,000 reports to the value of €450 million in 2003. Those are examples of the bureau's success rate.Organised crime is a relatively new phenomenon in this country, having its origins in the drug trade of the early 1980s. The Government's response has been hard-hitting, something demonstrated by the legislation passed by this House. In recent years, the Criminal Justice (Illicit Traffic by Sea) Act 2003, which is designed to tackle the movement of drugs across our waters, has become law. It is quite difficult to stop it, since we have a coastline of over 3,000 km. With the best will in the world, that is a difficult coastline to protect. There is no doubt that one cannot do it 100%.It is therefore paramount that we continue to nurture good relations with our neighbours in the European Union. The drugs obviously emanate from outside our waters. If we enjoy good relations and neighbourliness with other countries and develop relationships, that too will help. For that reason, the Criminal Justice (Joint Investigation Teams) Act 2004 was most welcome. The Act allows teams to be set up for a specific purpose and period of time to carry out criminal investigations with cross-border dimensions. That will be a very effective Act into the future.I have heard my colleague opposite encourage the Minister to ring-fence confiscated moneys. The notion has a certain amount of credit, but I also see the other side of the argument. The money coming in is not recurrent, and one never knows from one year to the next exactly what one will have in the coffers. If one is planning a system in a community where one might establish a structure, it is difficult to do so without knowing one will have the money to do so the following year. Judging by the success rate of the Criminal Assets Bureau and the National Bureau of Fraud Investigation, there is no doubt funds are available, but initially one will certainly have that problem. Perhaps once-off money might be used as a capital allocation to put a structure in place in a community that might need repair or demolition and replacement. A voluntary effort might go into running it. That is not the most desirable scenario. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has a problem with the idea, but I understand the commendable thinking behind it. Perhaps we should examine a way of putting something into specific areas subjected to the scourge of drugs. I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, well in steering the Bill through the House.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	82	I welcome the legislation which is designed to improve the 1996 Act. Provisions are being clarified in this legislation following feedback from the Criminal Assets Bureau, for example, on the operation of the original Act. Last night on the Internet I looked at transcripts of Report Stage in the Dáil on 13 October. I could not access the debate in the Select Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights during which amendments were tabled. However, I noticed that on both Stages the issue arose of how much money has accrued to the Exchequer.At the time I understood that the Minister was saying essentially that, although so many millions had been frozen, only €1 million had accrued to the Exchequer. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, might update us on that figure. I understand that the new provision in this Bill allowing for a consent disposal order is intended to benefit both parties, but it would also help accrue money to the Exchequer more quickly. Perhaps the Minister of State might clarify how the Department hopes that will operate. Does it expect more moneys to accrue in the near future or will it take a long time?Regarding the issue raised by Senator Kett about the ring-fencing of moneys obtained under the legislation, I know that the Labour Party had a Report Stage amendment in the Dáil along the lines mentioned, namely, that money realised on disposal orders under the principal Act, as amended by this legislation, should be used for community development purposes in disadvantaged areas. In this House and previously in the Dáil, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, said there were problems with that from the point of view of the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen. I wonder how the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, feels about it. It is obviously a good idea and we have ring-fenced moneys in other legislation.It would be very positive for traduced and disadvantaged areas and, in general, since all areas are disadvantaged to different degrees. For example, areas not traditionally thought of as disadvantaged are also experiencing issues related to crime and producing criminals. We must examine how we can put money into communities to help those detrimentally affected by crime and prevent crime in future. I feel strongly that money should be put into education. In my constituency there are many such projects. One area that has been neglected by the Government is primary schools in disadvantaged areas. Four schools in the RAPID area of my constituency have been crying out for money for such things as repairs without getting what they have sought over the past few years. It is all very well putting money into homework clubs and the like, but most important of all is that we properly fund our basic education system in primary and secondary schools.I do not know if the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, is aware of it, but in my constituency there is a project called the Carline Centre of Learning. It concentrates on people outside the mainstream education system who could become subject to criminal influence and get involved in that but for the type of work carried out by the centre. The project was originally set up by a local nun and her order. The original idea was that people who might get involved in joyriding were trained in mechanics. The centre also teaches English, mathematics, catering, child care and so on. Those involved have contacted local public representatives. While they receive funding from different Departments, they are never sure exactly what it will be or whether they will have the necessary funds from one year to the next. The Government needs to provide guaranteed annual funding for such initiatives so that these groups can plan their work in advance and carry it out without fear of having to cut back on training. At one stage, they were examining cutbacks in woodwork, mechanics and so on, which they had commenced.The legislation is welcome but, as Senator Ross pointed out recently, while the legislation provides for the imposition of fines on financial institutions where they carry out unlawful acts, such fines are only a drop in the ocean to them and it is worth their while to carry out these acts and then pay the fines. How is the legislation impacting on crime rates? Are criminals paying fines under these provisions but not curtailing their illegal activities? Are they leaving their lives of crime behind when they are caught?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	83	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and I also welcome the Bill. It has been delayed for five years because of legal challenges but this is an opportunity to close loopholes and to provide the broadest practical definitions and flexibility of operation.This is one of the most important and successful criminal law initiatives ever undertaken. The original legislation was introduced as a Private Members' Bill by the then Fianna Fáil spokesperson, the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, and was subsequently adopted by the former Minister for Justice, Nora Owen. It was perhaps a turning point in the fight against crime. It took place against the background of the murder of Veronica Guerin, who was a friend and close colleague of mine, having worked for a few months on the fifth floor of Leinster House, and the scandalous situation that existed at the time whereby extremely wealthy drugs barons flaunted their wealth with apparent immunity. Nobody was able to obtain the necessary proof to connect them to the criminal acts that sustained their wealth. The Act enabled us to get to grips with the problem and it has been widely copied and admired elsewhere. I personally heard Prime Minister Blair express his admiration for the Act but, given that the legal and constitutional issues have been clarified, this legislation will enable its important work to be carried out more efficiently.Given that a seven year freeze was provided under the Act, not much income has been transferred to the State, though the legislation provides for matters to be tied up by consent within the seven-year period and, therefore, more income may pass to the State. It is reasonable that dependants should be given enough to live on from the frozen assets. The Minister of State also suggested short-circuiting the rigmarole of going into the formalistic proof of the authenticity of documents when their authenticity is not seriously in question.Senator Tuffy raised the issue of tying the proceeds of crime to community development. As my party's finance spokesperson, and given my understanding of the Department of Finance's thinking on the subject, there are good reasons for the Department's reluctance to tie incomes from various sources to particular purposes. However well the legislation works, the proceeds would be insufficient to fund community development. This must be funded from general taxation and, perhaps, the national lottery. I am not sure there is merit in the proposal. While a good case can always be made in a specific instance, if one multiplies that across different Bills, there could be a plethora of ties, which would make the administration of the public finances very difficult.

The Minister is contemplating an amendment, which will also deal with corruption and bring that under the ambit of the Criminal Assets Bureau. Like Sherlock Holmes's dog that did not bark in the night, it is striking that in the eight years the Act has been in operation and, despite it short-circuiting some ordinary legal safeguards, I am not aware of any scandal, alleged glaring injustice or any alleged abuse of human rights arising from its operation. That is a great tribute to the spirit in which it has been operated.All legislation is only as good as the spirit in which it is implemented. All parties have had a part in this initiative and the legislation streamlines it, which is very much to be welcomed because this is one of the most successful and significant criminal law initiatives to have been undertaken in the State. It has enabled us to turn the tide.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House and wish him well with the Bill. The proceeds of crime legislation has been a major achievement. It was set up after the murder of journalist Veronica Guerin in 1996. That was a testing time for the State when criminal gangs felt they could run everything. Many of the gangs were involved in prostitution, drugs, armed robberies and the sale of guns. They felt immune from the law.However, the horrific murder of Veronica Guerin, a journalist who espoused freedom of information but whose reports did not please the so-called godfathers, was a turning point in how we dealt with organised crime. Nowadays if we can convince a court that people are enjoying a lifestyle they could not have earned legally, a judge can order the confiscation and sale of their possessions. Too often people driving flash cars and wearing jewellery that was probably worth more than my car seemed to be immune from investigation. Thankfully, we now have legislation that has dealt with the issue.Last year, Deputy O'Dowd published a Private Members' Bill to amend the Proceeds of Crime Act. The purpose of his Bill was to ensure that the sizeable funds seized by the CAB would be ring-fenced and used to rehabilitate drug users. There is merit in that because most of the assets seized by the CAB come from illegal gains from drugs. A United Kingdom report estimated that one kilogram of heroin distributed at street level generated 220 victims of burglary and £220,000 worth of property stolen by addicts to fuel their habits. We are not tackling the issue of drugs sufficiently. I agree with Deputy O'Dowd that the funds seized by the CAB should be ring-fenced to tackle the spiralling epidemic of drugs on our streets.The issue of the horrific assaults that took place over the weekend was raised on the Order of Business today. One man was shot in his bed in what appears to be a gangland killing. One non-national was stabbed to death and another stabbed in Tallaght. An elderly gentleman was also hurt in Donegal. Are we sure that drugs were not involved in some manner in these crimes? Drugs are an ever increasing problem and it is for that reason I would like the proceeds of crime to be ring-fenced. Those funds would give the drugs task forces more bite and provide them with better resources. More gardaí could be involved in the drugs forces and the Garda could also be provided with extra resources to tackle increasing crime. The problem is in our major cities but it will escalate and permeate into every town, village and rural area if not tackled.We have a raft of criminals who operate and run successful drugs operations in Amsterdam and Spain. They appear to be untouchable and I find this difficult to accept. We do not always believe the tabloids, but one must read them to see that these criminals are running their own show. Yesterday, the Taoiseach more or less said that the ill-gotten gains of this criminal underworld crime were perhaps being used to buy property in Spain. That is an unacceptable situation. I am pleased that many countries have followed our example in terms of enacting legislation to deal with the proceeds of crime. It has been successful in Northern Ireland in dealing with paramilitaries.In the United Kingdom where the authorities did not regulate bureaux de change or money transmission agents they have good evidence that much money was laundered for criminals through these. Is that the case here or have we legislation to cover the transmission of funds by such agencies? While the banks are regulated, I would like my anxieties allayed with regard to the bureaux de change.How much money is currently in the fund? The Garda cannot name the persons with whom the Criminal Assets Bureau has made settlements or provide information on the settlements. I understand there must be discretion and some secrecy on the issue. As public representatives our assets are in the public domain, yet if a question is asked in the Dáil on the issue of criminal assets it is considered inappropriate for the CAB to disclose the information sought. The overall sum of assets collected by the bureau from 1996 to 31 October amounts to €69,262,409. This is an amount I would like to see being spent in the right way.I welcome any amendments that will make the Bill watertight and ensure we tackle the godfathers of crime. Campaigners for civil liberties have said its powers are dangerous and destroy the presumption of innocence. We have nothing to fear in that regard. For too long these crime lords have felt untouchable. We can have no untouchables in the State. The only force we should have is the Garda Síochána. The Bill's primary aim is to reduce crime and we will do this by working closely with our law enforcement partners. The assets accumulated through unlawful means must be removed. The CAB and this legislation target the godfathers who have gained money through drugs and illegal businesses.I wish the Minister of State well with the legislation and hope the money seized will be ring-fenced to tackle drugs as the drugs task forces are not fully resourced. Anything that will help them to tackle the spiralling drug problem is welcome.

I am pleased to have the opportunity to speak on this excellent Bill. I pay tribute to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform officials for their efforts in streamlining the Bill and dealing with issues that were wide open to interpretation.The Bill copper-fastens the true intentions of the principal Act and is to be welcomed in that context.The Act originated when Deputy O'Donoghue initiated a Private Member's Bill in the other House, the Organised Crime (Restraint and Disposal of Illicit Assets) Bill. It is worth noting that Fianna Fáil's efforts in Government carried on from the example it showed during its time in Opposition. This was the single greatest legislative initiative shown by any Government in recent years. The European Union's multidisciplinary group on organised crime concluded that the Irish authorities had shown they were prepared to be innovative in their approach to national and international organised crime, especially in regard to the Criminal Assets Bureau. The Proceeds of Crime Bill falls into the same category.We have witnessed great benefits from this innovation in recent years in terms of clamping down on organised crime and the godfathers who are causing such havoc throughout the country. However, our innovation has been matched by further innovation on the part of criminals as they seek to find new ways of beating the system, which they are doing most successfully.We have heard a great deal of reference in the debate to organised crime, drugs and the larger issues of crime. However, we must also seek to use similar initiatives in tackling petty crime. Public order offences are a matter of significant importance, particularly those which occur late at night due to alcohol and drug abuse or other factors. Minors carry out many of these crimes and we must find innovative ways of dealing with this problem.There is a great onus on parents to take responsibility for their children's actions. Senator Scanlon suggested one approach to the problem last year, namely, that children's allowance, in effect, would be performance related. This would mean that if a child was out of school or was carrying out public order offences the responsibility would fall back on the parents and children's allowance would only be paid to those who took responsibility for their children and ensured they were in the right place at the right time.Drugs and other serious problems must be tackled but we also have a responsibility to try to prevent younger emerging criminals from going bad. Those who commit public order offences today may go on to commit more serious crimes down the line. We must face up to the matter and try to come up with innovative approaches. While curtailing children's allowance may appear radical we must explore every possible option.The best way to invest the proceeds of crime taken by the Criminal Assets Bureau would be to put it all into preventative strategies. The sports capital programme would be one worthy beneficiary. It would also be useful to work with various youth and sporting organisations on a national basis on strategies to prevent young people from becoming involved in crime. The young criminals of today will become the serious hardened and organised criminals of the future.This funding should be used in the manner I have outlined. The sports capital programme is one way but I am sure there are many ways in which we can use the money to benefit children and younger people and keep them on the straight and narrow. This would be much more beneficial to them in the long term and to the State.The Bill is highly technical. I especially welcome section 5, an amendment of section 6 of the principal Act, which would allow a dependant of a criminal who may not be involved in any criminal activity to be entitled to reasonable and necessary living expenses. That is a positive development.Another issue which was wide open to interpretation is that frozen assets, including cash, were in the notional possession of the garda who moved the order. I am pleased this matter has been ironed out and that the criminal will still be in possession of his or her assets but will not be in a position to use them.I welcome the Bill, as others have done. I congratulate the officials who drew up this legislation which took some time for a wide variety of reasons and join with others in commending it to the House.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	89	I thank all the Senators who contributed to the debate on this important Bill and welcome the constructive tone of the debate. It is appropriate that Deputy O'Donoghue, who initiated the legislation in Private Members' time in 1996 was acknowledged, in addition to the then Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, former Deputy Owen.Some interesting comments have been made but I am not sure I will be able to respond to every issue. I am happy to speak further to any Senator who does not believe I have adequately answered his or her query.A number of Senators, including Senators Cummins, Kett and Mansergh mentioned the delay in the Bill coming before the House. As I stated at the outset, this delay was outside the control of the Department and the Parliamentary Counsel because of other factors. While the delay is regrettable, it has allowed for a substantially more far-reaching Bill than the original. This will greatly enhance the role of the officials in the Criminal Assets Bureau, customs officials and the Garda Síochána in combating those who seek to profit from crime.A number of Senators inquired about funding being ring-fenced. If this issue were teased out I am not sure if Members would be so sure this would be the best way to proceed. It is not quite as easy as saying that because there is a regular pot of money, one can identify schemes which can be ring-fenced and is guaranteed a flow of funding.The issue of drug-related funds was referred to, in regard to which I am pleased to state that Ireland ranks very high in the EU chart on the amount of money the Government is spending on fighting the drug problem. It is spending just shy of €200 million per annum on prevention, treatment, supply reduction and education, all of which are areas in which we want to see money being invested. Senator Kett referred to the various programmes with which the health authorities have been involved over a prolonged period of time when there was no roll-in from CAB money. It should be noted that the proportion of drug-related funds of the total obtained by CAB is uncertain as CAB collects revenue from a number of sources.

We all subscribe to the need to continue to enhance the existing programmes. If there is more money in the central pot, I hope more money will go to the priority issues which we would all like to see being addressed. Senators also referred to the impact on criminality of the provisions of the CAB legislation. Senator Kett congratulated the Garda Síochána and customs officers who take significant risks in this area but are very determined and committed to their duties and are professional in doing so, with which I agree. I have great admiration and respect for Deputy Garda Commissioner Fachtna Murphy who established CAB when he was a superintendent or chief superintendent. He has done trojan and professional work with CAB, which has in turn done a great deal to address the impact on society of criminality. Senator Kett also referred to CAB's success in the context of its figures and its large impact on criminal proceeds.My colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, has set in motion a process to examine the issue of youth justice. We are at a preliminary stage in this regard but hope to have a report in mid-2005 on a cross-departmental basis. Garda resources are another important issue, in respect of which I am delighted to report to the House the additional Garda funding, announced by my ministerial colleague, Deputy McDowell, which is coming on stream.

The Garda Commissioner is very happy with the progress made and the commitments he has received from the Government. On the other side of that coin is the issue of victims, which was also referred to. In that regard, a victims' charter has been published by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform. The State supports the victim support organisations which are doing great work.I was asked about the amounts of money involved in final disposal orders. As the Act came into effect in 1996, final disposal orders can only be made now because of the seven year time lapse. I understand that to date, two final disposal orders have been made — one for €102,000 and another for €169,000. These should go to the Department of Finance in early December, although it is dependent on whether the respondents go to court in the meantime. As seven years have elapsed since the commencement of the Act, increasing numbers of orders will be made in the coming months on a continuing basis.The overall sum for tax collected by the Criminal Assets Bureau between 1996 and October 2004 is €69.26 million. In the period since its inception up to 31 October 2003, the bureau has obtained interim and final restraint orders to the value of more than €51 million and €22 million, respectively. Senators will find further details of the activities of the CAB since its establishment in 1996 in its annual reports, which are available in the Oireachtas Library.This is a complex and technical Bill which will considerably bolster the powers of the Criminal Assets Bureau in the continuing battle to go after the proceeds of all types of crime, including white collar crime and corruption. The amendments to the Criminal Justice Act 1994 and the Prevention of Corruption (Amendment) Act 2001 will be of great benefit to the Garda Síochána and customs officials in pursuing those who seek to profit from crime.The clear, sober and stark message from the Government is that it is tough on crime and is intent on continuing to win every battle against criminals on behalf of law abiding citizens and the judicial and legal system and we will win the war. For the State and its citizens, it will be a win, win, win situation.I thank Senators for their contributions to this debate and their co-operation. I commend the Bill to the House.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	97	I am delighted to have this opportunity to outline to Seanad Éireann the Government's public spending plans as set out in the 2005 Estimates. In my budget next week I will set out the full details of the Government's economic and fiscal strategy for 2005, including further spending measures and taxation.In framing the 2005 Estimates the Government was conscious that the funds being spent are provided through the taxes paid by workers and businesses. It is important that these taxpayers can see real value for their taxes and that Government priorities in spending reflect this as much as possible. Accordingly, the Estimates are about ensuring, for example, that ageing members of families are better cared for, that children have better facilities in which to learn and develop and that those who are disadvantaged progress through tangible improvements in their lives. The Estimates and the budget must also contribute to our general economic and social development.It is the objective of the Government, by making the correct decisions in the Estimates and budget, to promote sustainable economic growth so we have the resources to spend money on the social needs of our society that help enhance the dignity and quality of life of those who require our help and support. It is through the implementation of the correct economic policies and the creation of an efficient and enterprise friendly taxation system that we can best provide the funds that help advance these objectives. On an objective analysis, I strongly contend that the Government's management of the nation's finances has been excellent in both good and less favourable economic times.As a result of an international downturn that began in 2001 we have had to keep a relatively tight rein on public spending in recent years. Accordingly, we have reduced the gap between revenue and public spending growth and managed to consolidate our fiscal position. Managing public spending growth broadly in line with the growth in resources and in a manner sustainable in the medium term remains essential. The Government intends to continue with this general approach so as not to undermine the hard work of the past few years, which ensured that we are now better placed than most to take advantage of the current international economic upturn.While the world economic outlook is now improving and we are experiencing an economic upturn, our economy will not return to the high growth rates we saw in the period up to 2001. The consensus among most commentators is that economic growth in 2004 will be approximately 5%. This is a continuation of last year's positive trend. There are, however, a number of risks to our economic performance next year. These include oil prices, the dollar and a possible weakening of the US economy. A combination of these events could lead to a slowdown in domestic economic activity. Despite these risks, however, I believe the economic prospects for 2005 and beyond are quite positive.The Government's successful management of the public finances and the economy has resulted in a major reduction in the debt burden, with the general Government debt falling from a level close to 100% of GDP in the early 1990s to its current level of approximately 31% of GDP. Similarly, the cost of servicing debt has reduced significantly in terms of the resources available. The cost of servicing the national debt in 1990 took up 29% of tax revenue; it is expected to require approximately 7% of tax revenue this year. Reducing debt has turned debt interest payments into money which is available on an ongoing annual basis for funding real improvements in public service provision.Large surpluses enjoyed until 2000 are now replaced with a position much closer to balance. When the downturn came, the general Government surplus of €4.5 billion for 2000 turned into a deficit of €300 million in 2002, showing how important it is to be prudent in managing public services at the top of an economic cycle so that services are not totally disrupted and set back when the downturn sees tax revenues ebb away. Due to higher than expected economic growth and, consequently, higher tax revenue buoyancy, 2004 is turning out approximately €2 billion better than had been budgeted. However, a significant element, some €670 million, of this improvement is due to the Revenue Commissioners' special investigation receipts which are once off in nature.While making significant progress in managing the public finances, the Government has more than doubled total spending on public services to over €41 billion between 1997 and 2004 and has managed to do this without recourse to large-scale borrowing or increased taxes. Our aim is to continue to support economic growth and employment while generating resources for key social and economic public services and investment priorities. To achieve this objective, there must be a correlation between the growth in spending on public services and the growth in revenue, while seeking to address priority areas where Government responds to particular service pressures.I intend to maintain this balanced approach and this is reflected in the 2005 Estimates. An expenditure spree in buoyant economic circumstances would simply overheat our economy, lead to inflationary pressures and excessive wage demands and cause serious damage to our international competitiveness. Throwing money at problems exclusively will not resolve those problems either in the short term or on a sustainable basis. Targeted resources and reform in service delivery with everyone working for shared objectives and placing a quality service to our citizens at the centre of our concerns is the best guarantee of an improvement for all. We also have to strike a necessary balance between allocating additional resources to priority needs while continuing to promote sustainable economic growth and avoiding inflationary pressures.In the current year, public expenditure is expected to grow by 7.5%. This compares with a projected economic growth rate of 5% and an annual inflation rate of 2.2%. Overall, there is a forecast saving of €150 million on gross spending for 2004. Higher receipts of €100 million across a few Departments will result in a net total forecast saving of €250 million between current and capital. This equates to approximately 0.4% of the total gross provision in the 2004 Revised Estimates volume. Of the €150 million saving overall on gross spending, a saving of €70 million is forecast on current spending.The Exchequer provision for capital expenditure in 2004 was €5.6 billion. When account is taken of €248 million capital carryover from this year to next under the multi-annual capital envelopes announced in last year's budget, there is a small saving on capital of €80 million. Some €46 million of this will be used to fund current spending on justice and transport. I will return to the subject of capital carryover when I deal with investment for 2005.We are providing for an increase of €2.5 billion in gross spending on public services in 2005, bringing the total cost to €43.6 billion for the year. This represents a 6% increase on a pre-budget basis. The Government's approach to formulating the 2005 Estimates has been to allocate resources to priority needs, while being consistent with an overall public finance position that promotes sustainable economic and employment growth. We have allocated particular priority to spending on health and education in the pre-budget Estimates. Accordingly, we have provided almost €11 billion for health, an increase of €915 million, or 9%, and €7.1 billion for education, an increase of €530 million, or 8%.The increased provision of €915 million for health will fund improved access to primary care, high priority disability services such as day care facilities, respite services and dedicated units and other initiatives in acute hospital services. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on health during the period 1997 to 2005 will amount to 205%, representing an additional €7.4 billion. It is important to put on record that this massive level of increased provision has led to improved services. Staffing levels have increased by almost 50% from a base of 66,000 in 1997 to almost 98,000 this year. This major increase in staffing levels has included a significant increase in frontline service staff; an additional 6,500 nurses — representing 21% of the increase in staff numbers — with further additional staffing increases in the provision of therapists, dentistry and orthodontic services, medical professionals and social care professionals.There has been a concomitant increase in service delivery with an increase of 30% since 1997 in the number of patients treated in hospitals as inpatients and day care patients and a reduction in waiting lists, with 80% of patients now waiting less that one year — a development on which we will improve further. There has also been an increase in the elective surgery rate in public hospitals of 85% between 1995 and 2002. Furthermore, there is a marked improvement in the wide range of community services provided by the health services throughout the country.The gross education and science allocation will increase by €530 million, or 8%, to €7.1 billion in 2005. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on education during the period 1997 to 2005 will amount to €3.9 billion. This represents a rise of 218% over the period. Again, this has resulted in significant improvements in services. Since 1997, there has been a significant increase in the number of teachers employed in our primary and secondary schools. The provision of educational services for children with special educational needs has been transformed since the Government entered office. From a base of 400 in 1999, there are now over 4,000 resource and learning support teachers. In addition, there are almost 6,000 special needs assistants employed in our schools. The latter should be measured against a base of fewer than 300 such assistants in 1998.Capital investment in our schools has also been transformed with the introduction of focused schemes to redress the historic under-investment in our schools. Initiatives such as the summer works scheme and the programme for the development of small schools — known as the devolved scheme — have been introduced to ensure quicker delivery of improved schools.As regards third level, the Government has ensured that the programme for research and technology in third level institutions has been funded to provide a firm foundation for our future economic success. This programme complements the work of Science Foundation Ireland in the research and development area.The gross allocation for social and family affairs is €11.4 billion on a pre-budget basis. On budget day I will announce the provision for increases in social welfare payment rates next year. Evidence of the Government's commitment to the needy in society is that it has doubled spending on social welfare since entering office. In the same period, the unemployment rate has fallen from over 10% to less than 5%. This represents a significant improvement in real terms in the level of social welfare provision. The provision of child benefit expenditure, which has been identified as a key mechanism for reducing consistent poverty in Ireland, has been supported significantly by the Government. Expenditure on child benefit has increased from under €500 million in 1996 to a pre-budget allocation of €1.8 billion this year.A particular priority for the Government is services for people with disabilities. The 2005 Estimates provide over €2.8 billion for disability specific services. This represents an increase of €290 million, or 11%, on the 2004 provision, almost twice the general overall increase in expenditure, on a pre-budget basis, of 6%. During the period since we re-entered office in 1997, €230 million in additional funding has been provided for the maintenance and development of services to people with physical and sensory disabilities. Furthermore, an additional 1,700 residential places for people with intellectual disabilities and almost 3,000 new day places have been provided.When the Disability Bill was published, the Government committed itself to the introduction of a multi-annual investment programme for high priority disability support services which would involve both capital and current spending. In the budget I will announce details of the additional current expenditure which the Government will provide in the years 2006 to 2009 for high priority disability support services. I will also include an additional capital allocation for disability services as part of a revised multi-annual capital envelope for 2005 to 2009.Overseas development aid has also been accorded a very high priority by the Government since 1997. We are providing an additional €60 million, or a 15% increase, on the current year's allocation for ODA. That will bring our contribution to some €535 million next year. This represents an increase of 240% since 1997 and it is a remarkable achievement, particularly when one considers that the equivalent provision in 1997 was only €158 million.The gross provision for Exchequer funded public service pay and pensions is €15.3 billion, an increase of €1 billion, or 7%, on 2004. The increase makes full provision for the carryover of the first phase of Sustaining Progress, the payment of the final tranche of benchmarking and the increases due in 2005 under the mid-term review of Sustaining Progress.In budget 2003, in order to control public service numbers, the Government decided to cap numbers at the existing authorised level and to reduce numbers by 5,000 by the end of 2005. As part of our commitment to address priority areas of service, we have subsequently agreed some adjustments to the figures for health, education and the Garda in respect of frontline staff. Outside the health and education sectors, the numbers serving in 2004 indicate that this year's targets for a reduction in public service numbers will be met. I emphasise that the Government remains committed to the control of public service numbers, particularly in light of the size of the public service pay and pensions bill as a component of overall Government expenditure, and is determined that the full effect of the reduction in numbers will materialise in 2005 and 2006.In last year's budget, my predecessor, Deputy McCreevy, announced the introduction of five-year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the planning, management and implementation of capital programmes and projects. As part of this initiative, Departments were permitted to carry forward to the next year capital savings up to a maximum of 10% of voted capital. The facility will operate for the first time this year.The carryover facility means that Departments and implementing agencies do not have to surrender this money and it avoids the potential for wasteful end of year expenditure inherent in an annual allocation system. The total amount of capital carryover from 2004 to 2005 is estimated at close to €250 million, or 4.5% of this year's voted capital allocation.Turning to the capital provision for 2005, the 2005 pre-budget Exchequer capital allocation in the abridged Estimates volume is €5.7 billion. In addition, Departments will have the €250 million of carryover savings from 2004 available to spend in 2005. When taking this into account, Departments will have, on a pre-budget basis, some €730 million additional cash for capital spend or 14% higher than in 2004.The 2004 budget envelope provided for total capital investment in 2005 of €6.3 billion, comprised of €5.715 billion Exchequer and €0.585 billion PPP funded by annual Exchequer payments. The Exchequer figure included an unallocated reserve of €120 million. On budget day I will announce a revised multi-annual capital envelope for the period 2005-09 and in the process will allocate the €120 million reserve in 2005.It is now clear that there will be a major shortfall on the 2005 PPP component of the existing envelope. The new five-year envelope for 2005-09 which I will be announcing on budget day will take into account the cash already available to Departments in 2005, the PPP situation and the overall budgetary situation. It will also include a multi-annual provision for disability services.The 2005 Estimates provide for an extra €2.5 billion bringing total planned expenditure on services to over €43.5 billion. By any standards this represents a substantial commitment to spending on public services. I have emphasised to all ministerial colleagues that we must continue to seek better value for money in delivering public services. The taxpayer and citizen demand no less. Departments and offices must therefore intensify their efforts to prioritise spending and to continually re-evaluate spending on existing programmes, projects and services in order to ensure that available resources can be directed to the areas of greatest need. While continuing to allocate resources to priority social and economic needs as resources permit, the Government will seek to ensure that better value for money is achieved from the increased expenditure.In summary, the 2005 Estimates allocate significant provision for the key areas of health, education and infrastructure provision while retaining a prudent approach to overall expenditure policy. In conjunction with the resources I will be announcing on budget day, the Estimates focus on the areas of concern to the people and will promote economic and social development. I believe they deserve the support of the House.

Those who have examined these Estimates and those announced by his predecessor over the past six or seven years have remarked that they show a lack of any obvious effort at improving the standard of public service and any root and branch reform of the public service as delivered to the consumer. Both the Minister and his predecessor have failed to make any genuine effort at reforming the critical public services of health, education and justice. The Minister stated in his opening remarks that throwing money at problems will not resolve them. He is right and everybody in this House would agree with that comment. However, in his remarks he made a great play on the fact that in the time the current Government has been in office, it has more than doubled public spending. The Minister cannot have it both ways. However, it is nothing new for this Government to try to have its bread buttered on both sides.The Minister outlined the 32,000 extra positions that have been created in the health service. He found no difficulty in stating that only 6,500 of these were new nursing positions. Where are the other 75%? The vast majority consist of administrative staff in the health boards. Consumers of the service in 1997 and those who are still using it today would say the service has disimproved. Why has that happened during a period when there has been such significant increase in public funding for the health service? Why has it happened that the health service workforce has increased by 50% yet the service has disimproved? How is it when one walks into an accident and emergency department in this city or anywhere in the country, one would be lucky to get a seat in a waiting room let alone a trolley in a corridor? However, money is being lashed at the service. To make the remark that throwing money at problems does not resolve them is something with which we all agree but the Minister should put it into practice. His Department and other Ministers in the Government should also put it into practice. Deputy Cowen is a former Minister for Health and Children.The Minister spoke about the value and importance of child benefit. Over the past two budgets since the Government was re-elected it has reneged on the commitment to increase child benefit. It has not done what was promised in An Agreed Programme for Government and in the election manifestos. These Estimates are big on talk and low on delivery.In 2005 there will be a total of 92 extra gardaí on the streets despite all the waffle and hot air from the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform about the 2,000 extra gardaí he promised to deliver. The extra allocation of money to the general medical service will at best raise the number of persons under 70 with some access to primary care from 23% to 28%. This is far short of the position in 1997 when 31.5% of this group qualified for the full medical card. Primary care will still remain a costly luxury for the low paid. The capacity problems in our hospitals are not being confronted, with capital budgets down sharply for a second year in a row. The often-repeated commitment of the Taoiseach to deliver on our commitments in respect of overseas development aid has been abandoned and cast adrift. The Government's capacity to deliver in the infrastructural area is unravelling. For the second year in a row there will be a real cut in the amount of infrastructural investment. Last year the Government proved unable to spend almost €350 million of the budget assigned for critical infrastructure.Those who hoped that the era of stealth taxes was over will be disappointed by these Estimates. The imposition of a substantial real cut in the funds available to local authorities, will lead to substantial increases in commercial rates, possible increases in development charges and other charges by which local authorities will seek to gain revenue to make up the balance that has been lost in these Estimates. These Estimates do not mark a period of serious reform in the approach to public spending. The same problems that have made budget day such a charade, persist. All the focus is on small changes in individual budgets rather than root and branch reform.The Estimates will bring the increase in current spending by this Government to €21,000 million since 1997, as outlined by the Minister in his opening remarks. The only innovation in this year's budget will be the announcements in respect of capital spending projects. There is an even further move away from the notion of an integrated infrastructural plan centred on the spatial strategy, with projects selected on the grounds of sound appraisal. Instead these capital projects are now to be thrown around the Cabinet table in a horse trading exercise with Ministers jockeying to be the first to the local newspapers with the happy announcement. This happened last year in the Minister's own constituency in the case of Deputy Parlon, his ministerial colleague.I wish to refer to specific Departments. The increase in health spending in the Estimates is just over €7,045 million. As outlined by the Minister, much of this money will be spent on administration instead of on frontline delivery. The Government has failed to target resources to the people who are in real need. After seven years, the Government has finally acknowledged that its own spin has been a lie. The Opposition has been consistently told that the reason over 100,000 medical cards were withdrawn and the promised 200,000 medical cards were not delivered was because of the economic success of this country. The Government has finally acknowledged that it has participated in denying access to primary care to 230,000 people since it came into power. While economic progress has been achieved, inflation in the area of medical care has been much steeper than any economic progress in that same period of time. The Government seems to have finally come around to the Opposition's point of view on this subject. Increased funding for the acute hospital sector and the health boards will be largely spent on pay rises and benchmarking awards, resulting in few improvements in the level of public services provided in the acute hospital and community care sectors.Yet again the Government has resorted to increasing charges in the health area. The 25% increase in charges for private beds will ultimately be covered by higher health insurance premiums. Those without health insurance will face significantly increased costs for hospital stays and patients with a high medication need will face a drugs bill of more than €1,000 per annum.The Estimates show an increase in permitted total expenditure for local government of just 1%. This will not cover inflation, let alone the increased wage bill local authorities face as a result of the benchmarking award which would necessitate an increase of 3%. The net result will be higher charges to households, increased waste and development charges and higher levies.This so-called caring Government has shown its true colours in its treatment of the disabled and elderly. In 2003 the number of disabled person's grants approved was 6,153, at an average cost of slightly below €6,100. In July this year more than 11,000 persons had applied to local authorities for the grant. If 10,000 of these applications are approved at the same average cost as in the previous year, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Roche, will need to allocate €61 million, rather than the €52 million he has been allocated in the Estimates.The paltry increase of 3% in funding for the task force on special housing aid for the elderly is barely enough to cover inflation. The allocation of an extra €348,000 would only cover 116 grants for the installation of central heating. I could name 116 people in County Kilkenny who should receive this grant, yet this allocation is proposed to cover the whole country.Taxpayers, the disabled and the elderly are all victims of the new strategy of the Minister for Finance. The former Minister, Deputy McCreevy, may be a Commissioner but his thinking has not gone away.Earlier, the House divided on the issue of overseas development aid. Overseas aid is not an abstract concept or simply a column in the Estimates but the most practical way in which people, through their Government, can assist those who need help most. More than 1.3 billion people globally live in severe poverty, 800 million do not get enough food and 500 million are chronically malnourished. Of the 23 million people with HIV-AIDS, more than 93% live in the developing world. It is shocking that over the past decade 2 million children have died in armed conflict.Ireland's commitment to meet the target for overseas aid was made before the United Nations four years ago and has been restated many times since, notably during the UN Secretary General's recent visit to Dublin. This commitment has come to nothing, however, in light of the statement by the Minister for Finance that he has lowered his target for development aid to 0.5% of GDP, far below what was promised. He has not even indicated whether a new date has been set to achieve the target level of 0.7% of GDP or whether the commitment has been shelved indefinitely.The marine area will also suffer as a result of the Estimates. The Government has shown its indifference to the marine tourism sector by not allocating a cent in funding for the marine and natural resources tourism programme. While the Estimates indicate that €2 million has been allocated to the sector — a cut of 30% — this money will not be spent as it is ring-fenced for four infamous marina projects at Kenmare, Roundstone, Rosses Point and Cahirciveen, which were given the green light without EU approval by the former Minister for the Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Fahey. The allocation is unlikely to be spent because of the major difficulty created in Europe by the manner in which the former Minister announced the four marina projects in question. They did not form part of a €25 million EU approved programme to develop and transform coastal tourism in Ireland shelved two years ago because of the economic climate at the time. With public finances showing an improvement, surely the Estimates provided an opportunity to dust off the scheme. The new Minister of State at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Gallagher, who has responsibility for the marine, fell at the first hurdle due to his abject failure to secure funding for this vital sector.The Estimates show that the position with regard to the provision of adequate school buildings is deteriorating. Cuts are indicated in all divisions of the schools building programme because the Government has demonstrated in recent years that it cannot spend the moneys allocated for new buildings. In 2003 the underspend of the Department of Education and Science on school buildings amounted to more than €60 million, while the equivalent figure this year will be €50 million. Given that children continue to be taught in damp and dilapidated conditions, in some cases without adequate toilet or physical education facilities, it is a disgrace that the Government is not sufficiently committed to spend the money allocated to provide proper school accommodation.Where spending increases are indicated they are welcome, particularly in the provision of assistants for children with special educational needs. The Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Hanafin, will be measured by what she achieves in tackling ongoing educational problems, rather than by how much she spends.As matters stand, the number of children failing to make the transition from primary to secondary school is growing at an alarming rate, as is the drop-out rate at second level. No proper system is in place to quantify whether the schemes in place are meeting the needs of the disadvantaged. It is clear that the appalling rates of literacy difficulties in our schools are not being tackled. The Minister for Education and Science will have to set real targets to ensure that funding allocated in 2005 reaches those who need it most and delivers tangible results.Once again, the bad deal brokered by the Government with the religious orders is costing the taxpayer dearly. Following the increase of €115 million in funding for the Residential Institutions Redress Board this year, a further €50 million will be allocated under this subhead in 2005. Despite everything we have heard from the Minister in recent weeks about a major increase in funding for education, the latter figure accounts for one tenth of the overall increase in the Department's budget for 2005.The Fine Gael Party is disappointed the OECD review on third level education policy was ignored in the Estimates. The results of the sharp cuts in funding for third level institutions in 2003 and 2004 will not be reversed by the paltry increases signalled in the Estimates.A close examination of the Estimates reveals that the provision of an additional 2,000 gardaí, as repeatedly promised by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, is not even close to being delivered. The Minister reiterated this promise a couple of weeks ago but there is nothing in the Estimates to indicate any significant move to recruit 2,000 extra gardaí is likely. The meagre 5% increase in the allocation for Garda salaries is largely consumed by inflation and existing pay agreements. The Minister's claims of 2,000 gardaí are nothing more than a hollow promise.The provision for Garda equipment has increased by a paltry 2%. Taking inflation into account, this figure amounts to a decrease in real terms. Members will have heard stories of gardaí using their personal mobile telephones rather than the equipment provided by the Department. The 2% increase under this heading is clearly insufficient. The wages and overtime allocation for the Prison Service has increased by a staggering €37 million, despite the much-vaunted assault on costs in this sector launched by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform last year.I have significant problems with the Estimates, as presented. How rich do we have to become before we leave a lasting improvement in public services? I am not convinced the Estimates, as published, will provide a solution.

It will be interesting to note the extent to which such reforms will be agreed with other possible partners.I warmly welcome the Minister and the Book of Estimates. The Estimates form part of a four stage process, the next stages of which are the budget, followed by the Revised Book of Estimates and, finally, the Finance Bill. We cannot usefully discuss the important area of capital spending today as it is mainly based on the 2005 envelopes. In response to the previous contribution, I have never known a year in which so much infrastructure, including a further section of the M50, the Monasterevin and Cashel bypasses, the Luas and so forth, has come on stream. These developments are making a major difference in terms of improving our infrastructure. We are in a very strong economic position and the Estimates are designed, as no doubt will the budget, to consolidate so that we can move forward smoothly and steadily. The Minister's most significant comments were to the effect that the speed with which a surplus turned to a deficit in 2000 showed how important it is to be prudent and to manage public services at the top of an economic cycle so that services are not totally disrupted and set back when the downturn comes and these tax revenues ebb. This has been a constant theme since the Minister's first interview on being appointed to the finance portfolio. He has emphasised the importance of stability.As an approximate benchmark, growth plus inflation produces spending power which in this case is 6%, pre-budget. Our resources are increasing by double digit figures and what is provided in the Estimates could not possibly satisfy all needs. Trying to go faster than a certain pace creates inflationary pressures and less value for money. One must adopt a steady approach.There has been much debate recently about the ideological colouring of the Government and the Taoiseach. Any Government that achieves near full employment; the end of emigration; introduces a minimum wage; by and large has profitable State companies with one or two exceptions; has the lowest impact of tax on the lower paid anywhere in the European Union; is overseeing a steady improvement in services; and has coffers overflowing with capital and corporation taxes——

For example, since 1997, child benefit has increased from €500 million to €1.8 billion. The Minister also referred to the extra spending on health and disability. I will not comment on the disability issue because the budget will deal more fully with that. The increase was not simply an extra 6,500 nurses in frontline staff, the Minister also mentioned extra therapists, dentists, orthodontic services, medical and social workers and so on. It is too easy to say they have all gone into redundant administration.Another fallacy being put about is that there is a real cut in the health services because medical inflation is 10% and the increase is only 9%,  ergo there is a cut. Medical inflation is in the cost of drugs, which is quite a small element in health spending. It does not apply to nurses. One hears critical comments about benchmarking but how can we recruit the nurses we need unless they are at least as well paid as at present, and possibly somewhat better? I welcome the medical card initiative. It is a step and although it does not necessarily go the whole way it may reduce pressures in accident and emergency departments. At least it relieves people of the cost of consulting a doctor about their problems.The school building investment programme is very important and valuable. It has not all been spent. In response to the argument that we need value for money, that means money is not spent immediately because one must see that it is put right. The heads of the universities may be jumping the gun somewhat. Reading between the lines I understand that the matter of concern to them may be dealt with further in the budget.There is, very properly, a large jump in funding for science research and development. Arts and sports have done exceptionally well again, with a 17% increase in arts funding and a 19% increase in the amount available for the Arts Council.

My only criticism of that statement is that 1997 to 2004 is not ten years but local authority housing is up by 10%.I am strongly committed to overseas development aid funding, as no doubt is the Minister. That is to increase by €60 million and then by two further tranches of €65 million. It has been an ongoing problem to meet the target for overseas development aid funding, especially in periods of high growth. In his autobiography Garret FitzGerald refers to his introduction of the bilateral aid programme adding that in 1973 the Government decided to raise overseas development aid by 0.05% per year. He then explains that unfortunately because of various economic circumstances it was not possible to do that. I then looked at facts about Ireland in 1995 when Deputy Burton had responsibility for overseas development aid. The official book published by the Department of Foreign Affairs at the time stated that total expenditure in 1995 was expected to amount to IR£89 million, approximately €114 million. Next year it will reach €535 million, which is a four-fold increase in real terms. It is true that Ireland, along with 21 of the 24 OECD countries, has not yet fulfilled the 0.7% pledge. All Governments have been over-optimistic about how quickly this can be done. We are in a double bind because if the economy goes flat there is much pressure on resources and it is difficult to increase the aid, even though it would be easy to do so in terms of GNP. When the economy is growing by 5% to 10% there will be a substantial real increase in inflation in ODA spending, but it will be very difficult to achieve an increase in such spending as a percentage of GNP. Deputy Burton had this difficulty between 1995-97. The Government has not abandoned its pledge to commit 0.7% of GNP to overseas development aid. I hope that we will achieve this as soon as practicable. If it is at all possible in light of the budgetary figures, I appeal to the Minister to do a little bit more next year. I am glad we are back to a three-year allocation, as the development assistance committee of the OECD recommended.I look forward to the budget, the Finance Bill and the rest of the budgetary process, all of which will help strengthen our economy and push it forward.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	119	I welcome the Minister to the House. I envy him as well, as all former Ministers for Finance must given that he is €2 billion better off than last year. I take his point that €670 million of that is a one-off that should not otherwise be used. It is also fair to say that he is the envy of every finance Minister in Europe and our role today is to steer the use of these finances in the correct direction. It was interesting to read the supplement on Ireland published last month by The Economist which mentioned the luck of the Irish. I suggest that luck has nothing to do with it. The figures given show that GDP per person rose from 69% of the EU average in 1987 to 136% today. This shows that a great achievement has occurred. We have also done well in the case of GNP. It seems that we have succeeded by having a very steady hand on the tiller, in bad times and in good. This happens to be one of the good times, so let us make sure that the steady hand remains and that we use it to invest in the future rather than overcome immediate problems.There is something fundamentally unrealistic about this annual song and dance we go through about the Book of Estimates. The discussion tends to fall into two categories. One is to compare what a particular Vote got this year with what it got last year. Success in this area is judged by how big an increase a particular spending area managed to squeeze out of the Department of Finance. The other is to compare the different areas of spending and pit them against each other in a race to see which arm of Government gets to spend the most. That is the way it has always been, but I suggest that we must change. This issue gets the most attention and consumes the largest amount of newsprint and air time because it sets all the people with particular special interests in a great struggle against each other. This struggle keeps the mandarins in Merrion Street very happy, because as long as people are fighting each other for a share of resources they do not have time to address more fundamental questions.The kind of question that gets ignored in this annual struggle is the issue of value for money. The Minister mentions value for money twice in his 14 page speech and I am glad he did so. However, in deciding how much a particular Vote is to get, the system never asks if the public get value for this spending. Will we get a better return on our money if we spend it on this rather than on that? Instead of questions like that, we hop up and ask questions like the one I am about to ask. How can we be serious about making Ireland a leader in the knowledge society if we do not fund our universities properly?In the past two years, the Book of Estimates has seen cuts in the amounts made available for third-level education. There is provision for some increase this year, but not enough to repair the damage that has been done. It is certainly not enough to provide the quantum leap in third-level funding called for in the recent OECD report. That report very effectively called our bluff. It stated that if we want to be world class, we must put our money where our mouth is, which means much more money than is being made available now.I can do special pleading as well as anybody else, but I also want to focus on a basic challenge we face in running this country. Where is the money going to come from to pay for all that we want to do? In this vast sum of €38 billion provided in the Book of Estimates, we can see that the three big areas of Government day-to-day spending are in health, education and social welfare of one kind or another. Each of those areas gobbles up a sizeable fraction of that €38 billion. However, what those areas share, apart from the fact that they cost a lot, is that each of them is failing to do the job we expect and need it to do. No one can argue that our health services are satisfactory or that our health system provides for all our citizens in a fair and equitable manner. No one can argue that our education system is appropriate to our needs. Quite apart from the need to resource third-level education properly, there are major gaps in the provision at all levels of the system. Too many of our children suffer educational disadvantage and have their potential in life restricted as a result. Too many of our children go to rat-infested primary schools where the roofs are falling in. Too many children, at both primary and secondary level, do not receive the kind of individual attention that will bring out the best of their abilities. Nobody can argue that we have eliminated poverty in this affluent country. Not only have we failed to do that; we have actually widened the gap between the haves and the have-nots. Whenever the time comes to tighten the belt, it is always the have-nots who are squeezed the most.We are not doing a good enough job in these three big spending areas. The obvious response is to say that each needs more money, but before we do that, let us consider the reality that faces us. Over the past decade, we have moved to a low-tax society and have reaped the benefits of that approach. However much we might argue on a philosophical plane that we should raise more of our national income through taxation and spend it on better services, the political reality is that this is simply not on. Senator Mansergh has already stated that we have shown that a lower tax rate actually increases the amount of tax raised and the amount of money available to us. No political party that seriously wants to get into office would dare suggest we turn our backs on the low-tax society we have created in this country over the past decade. As we look into the future, this puts a serious constraint on the money we have available to spend.The returns from our economic growth will create more resources in the form of taxation. We should recognise, however, that there is a limit to that growth. There is no serious possibility of greatly increasing the amount of money available for expenditure because it is unlikely that any Government in the foreseeable future will be able to find a solution. Raising taxes does not appear to offer such a solution. Our dilemma is that we are not doing the job we want to do adequately — we have heard already today from some of the many people who are screaming for more resources — and the total amount of funding which is available is increasing only at a modest rate. What can we do? If we want to come to grips with the challenges that face us, we need to find ways of spending our money better. It is as simple as that — there is no alternative.I have previously spoken in the House about the crazy way we spend money in trying to run this country. We can talk about spending €38 billion a year without seriously considering the concept of value for money. The Minister referred to it twice in his speech, but when the fight for resources starts, the Department of Finance says "No" all the time. Those who wish to squeeze money out of the Department shout loudly and use as much political clout as they can. It happens in this House and in the Dáil. As a consequence, money is allocated not on the basis of where it will be of most benefit or provide the greatest return on taxpayers' investment, but on the basis of political considerations which do not relate to value for money. There is no follow-up after we have spent the money, which is even worse. If something fails, that is seen as a reason to throw more money at it.There is no systematic effort to measure the results of the money we spend. There is no system in the public service to ensure we get better and better value for each euro the taxpayer invests in running the country. I suggest that the money is forgotten about after it has been allocated. Businesses assess the cost of achieving certain goals and objectives and decide whether to pursue them on the basis of whether they represent good value for money. We have heard in recent days of instances in which money which was allocated was forgotten and not spent at all. If we continue to run the country in such a spendthrift way, we will not achieve the great things we want to do. If we stop the annual Book of Estimates charade and turn our attention to getting better value for what we spend, however, we will have taken a step in the right direction.I congratulate the Minister for Finance on the steps he has taken so far, but I would like him to devote his attention to a different way of doing things in the future. I ask him to concentrate on value for money, in particular. I thank the Minister for staying in the House to hear my contribution.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	120	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House and thank her for her attendance. We have faced a challenging set of economic circumstances since the 2002 general election. I am delighted that it has been predicted that economic growth will be approximately 5% in 2004. We are experiencing an economic upturn at present, but it would be unwise to think we will return in the short term to the high growth rates we enjoyed before 2001. The Government should be congratulated on steering the country through the downturn of recent years in a prudent and pragmatic manner.Many major international considerations have a direct effect on our economy. The American boom has slowed markedly, the German economy, which is the largest in the euro zone, is almost stagnant and there is hesitancy in international markets. The climate of uncertainty has been exacerbated by the conflict in Iraq. When one considers the increase in oil prices, the fall in the dollar and the uncertainty in the US economy, it is possible that there could be a slowdown in 2005. The impact of recent events on Ireland is clear — the pace of economic growth has moderated. In that context, the figures announced in the Estimates are welcome.The Government's prudent management of the public finances has ensured that the economy has continued to support economic growth, promote employment and generate the necessary tax revenues for key social and economic public services. The Progressive Democrats Party has played a key role in the formulation of economic policy since it returned to Government in 1997. I do not think anybody denies that its policies have worked. The policies have brought the country from mass unemployment to full employment, virtually eliminated long-term unemployment and ended the curse of emigration, which was a blight on this country for many years.I would like to reiterate what Ireland's economic priorities should be in the next four years. The first requirement — to secure and preserve prosperity — has been achieved. It took us a long time to get the monkey of unemployment off our backs and it would be a tragedy if we allowed it to return. It took a great deal of effort to put in place this country's pro-employment tax system. Our key objective must be to retain that system, in the face of the temptation to raise personal taxes. I welcome the Minister's declaration that a key part of the Government's successful management of the public finances and the economy has been to avoid large-scale borrowing and increases in taxes.I agree with the Minister that excessive public spending could add to the inflationary pressures on our buoyant economy. It could place upward pressure on wage demands and erode Ireland's competitiveness in global markets. The Minister is right to suggest that growth in public spending should be correlated with revenue growth if it is to remain at a sustainable level in the medium term and that any temptation to do otherwise must be resisted. Full employment was a prize worth fighting for and is a prize worth defending, but if we want to defend it we will have to keep taxes down. We know that the low-tax formula works so we should retain it.It is imperative that the Government should invest in the economy. For example, it needs to invest in key infrastructural projects which are essential if we want to keep the country moving and ensure that it stays competitive internationally. We have set about correcting our infrastructural deficit. Eight decades after independence, there is no proper road running between Dublin and Cork, our two major cities and economic centres. Our transport infrastructure is literally kilometres behind the rest of the European Union. We are making progress, however; record sums of money are being invested in the National Roads Authority, which is responding to the challenge.There will be a transformation of the national roads system over the next three years. The motorway link between Dublin and Dundalk has been completed and the motorway project between Kilcock and Kinnegad, which is a vital part of the link between Dublin and Galway, will be open in two years. There is a continuous stretch of motorway and dual carriageway between Dublin and Portlaoise, following the completion of the Kildare and Monasterevin bypasses. The Cashel bypass has been finished. Such impressive achievements will bring badly needed relief to road users throughout the country and improve significantly the quality of life of those living in the towns which are being bypassed. We need to maintain the pace of investment, for example by continuing to invest in the national roads programme, if we are to provide the kind of transport system this country needs.Public investment is also needed in other areas, such as hospitals, schools and railways. Investment costs money, which has to be prioritised, but long-term investment should not fall foul of short-term pressures. The Progressive Democrats Party has always favoured prudent borrowing to fund capital spending. It would be foolish to reduce investment now, only to find when economic buoyancy returns that our congestion and public facilities are even worse than before. Prudent borrowing for public investment makes eminent sense. It is what the Irish economy requires now because it smoothes the economic cycle and helps to avoid boom-bust economics.I welcome the publication of the Book of Estimates, which provides for public spending next year of over €43.5 billion, money that has resulted from the hard work of the Irish people. The Government's first job is to manage and invest public money wisely on behalf of all citizens, which involves delivering the public services they expect. It means getting value for public money and spending it within a sustainable social and economic strategy. With these Estimates, the Government has set priorities with limited and precious public resources. Public spending is being increased at a moderate rate that will not put a strain on jobs or the economy. Steady progress is being maintained within the limits for our economy. There is no exaggerated spending and no exaggerated curtailment in spending.To grow public spending in line with our economic ability to pay puts the focus on the policies to achieve our economic potential. The Government has shown in recent years that economic performance is the engine of social justice, public resources and sustainable public services. The Government will continue to give priority to policies and actions that maximise our economic growth potential, including investment, competition and low taxes.I note in the Estimates that the Government has prioritised investment in our social and economic future in the areas of health, education, persons with disability and infrastructure. I welcome the increase of €530 million, or 8%, in education, bringing total spending to €7.1 billion. When one looks at gross expenditure on education from 1997 to 2005, one sees an increase of €3.9 billion, or 218%, over the period. I also welcome the fact that the Government has ensured that the programme for research and technology in third level institutions, or PRTLI, has been funded. That investment is key to our future development as a knowledge-based economy by providing the necessary graduates and postgraduates to complement the many initiatives and programmes delivered by Science Foundation Ireland. That will deliver long-term rewards for the people of this country.Health spending will increase by €915 million, or 9%, to just under €11 billion. The cumulative increase in gross expenditure on health from 1997 to 2005 will amount to 205%, representing an extra €7.4 billion. No other European country has increased health spending at that rate. In France, for example, the Government stated that there were "particularly steep increases" in health spending in 2002 and 2003 of 4% at constant prices.The Government is making the investment. It has brought forward the reform package, and now is the time for action and results. I am confident the Government is absolutely determined to implement the health reforms that put patients first. It will be a step-by-step approach, beginning now and continuing over the coming years, backed by sustained political will. I welcome the Tánaiste's announcements in that regard, in which she has clearly set out a targeted and focused programme that will be the start of delivering these reforms.Those who express opposition to the proposals based on their own vested interest and short-term gain do not have the long-term interests of the people of this country at heart. Credible opposition to this point of view should be expressed with credible alternatives; to date I have seen none. I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, on the Book of Estimates and congratulate his predecessor on his management of the Irish economy over the past few years. I am confident that in these Estimates the Minister has shown his commitment to ensuring that the decisions now being made are in the overall interest of the Irish people in the short, medium and long term and must be viewed as such.
#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	121	I believe that Senator Mansergh mentioned in his contribution the renewed debate of recent weeks about the ideological colouring of the Government or, more specifically, the Taoiseach. He is right, since there is no doubt that there has been something of a change in the mood music surrounding the Government in the past three or four weeks. The Taoiseach has rediscovered his socialist roots, something he does periodically. Of course, we must look a little more carefully at the numbers before us today and what the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, has been saying, to see whether there is any reality in it. The truth is that there is not.These Estimates are particularly conservative. Senator Mansergh is right in his assessment of what we have to spend, which is roughly growth plus inflation, bringing us to about 7.5% or 8%. The Estimates, which are not the final numbers, provide for increases of 6% in spending, a fairly conservative figure by any standards. The Minister's contribution today has been reflected in everything that he said, including, I gather, in the course of his press conference where he introduced the Estimates. It has all been standard departmental fare and is fairly conservative, being all about prudent fiscal policy and the usual matters of which we hear from the Department. I do not blame the staff, since I would probably write the same thing if I worked there. My point is that there is no suggestion of a departure, a change, increased spending or changed priorities. It is a case of "Steady as you go, lads", with no significant change in policy, good bad or indifferent, since the days of the Minister's predecessor, Deputy McCreevy.One of the real problems has been that the Department always writes the same script. It talks about prudent fiscal management regardless of whether it is spending 20% or 3% more. One has to examine the numbers to divine what the reality underpinning them is. I will cut to the bottom line. Senator Minihan rightly said that those of us in the Opposition must say what the alternative is: I believe that we can spend more this year. I will put that into some sort of historical context. In the few years after the last general election we went on an extraordinary splurge that we should never repeat. The Government has probably cut back a little more than necessary in the past two years, though in broad outline I would not disagree too much with what has been done since the general election, notwithstanding the fact that it completely contradicted what the Government said it would do. I accept that it has done a reasonable job of managing our way out of the downturn.We must now examine the present position and what fiscal policy should be for the next two or three years. The bottom line is that these numbers are quite good. We are currently in a fairly healthy state. Growth of 5% at this point in the economic cycle is very good and affords opportunities. It is appropriate for those in the Opposition to say that we should consider spending a little more. It would be reasonable for us to aim for an 8%, 9% or perhaps even 10% increase in spending this year. That would increase the overall GNP share of spending by 1% or 2% — perhaps slightly less. It is not too ambitious, and I do not advocate the 20% splurges of 2001. It is a minor but nonetheless significant increase above that suggested by the current Government.The numbers are very difficult for anyone to comprehend; one looks at them and wonders what on earth they mean. The first recourse for someone such as me is to look at the departmental statements, which at least give one some sort of notion as to exactly what lies behind them. I spent this morning examining the websites of various Departments to see what they say we will get as a result of the spending increases in the Book of Estimates. The Department of Finance was a particularly interesting case. I was half hoping that the Leader would be here, since I have got a few nice quotes from her a few years ago. I examined the statement of the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, last week, when he detailed how the increase would be spent in his Department. The first detailed matter that he mentions is €9 million in 2005 to deliver integrated ticketing, an issue to which I will return presently. He goes on to talk about new roads, more rail carriages, increased capacity on the DART, park and ride, five new QBCs for Dublin, and a few other matters.I mention that in detail because anyone who has been reading such statements, whether for three years or nine, will think that it sounds fairly familiar — and it is. Virtually all those matters have been announced before, some several times before. Some that sounded fairly simple have been flogged to death in an almost embarrassing fashion. I researched integrated ticketing, the first matter of expenditure appearing on the list of things to do issued by the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen. I found on the Department's website a statement made by the former Minister responsible for transport, Senator O'Rourke, on 29 September 1998, when she announced the accelerated implementation of integrated ticketing in Dublin. A few months later she announced that she had detailed plans to do it using smart cards and expected to have it in place in 2001. Thereafter it seems that the Government set up a committee to examine in detail how it should be done and decided that it should happen in 2002. When that year came, it announced that it would probably be done by the end of 2004. The important point here is that some of the announcements were matched with money or announcements of money that would be set aside.Others announcements made on publication of the Book of Estimates are not matched by funding — integrated ticketing, for example, has not been introduced. While this is a minor issue, there are many others. The Minister announced accelerated development of QBCs to complete all 12 promised in the Dublin Transportation Office study in 1998. There are nine currently and another five are promised. There was supposed to have been 12 by the end of 1998 but it was announced last week that five more will be added to the nine in operation.One wonders what is happening. A total of 3,000 park and ride spaces were promised in 1998. I would be surprised if a tenth of that number has been provided but funding is still being announced for additional spaces, notwithstanding that the tax break provided in this regard has generated no additional spaces. The Government made a definitive announcement in 2000 that a metro would be built and this was followed by a procurement process that went nowhere. The former Minister for Transport, Senator O'Rourke, even announced four or five years ago that Aer Lingus would be floated but we know what happened to that decision.Are we being taken for a ride? Wonderful statements are made every year on the publication of the Book of Estimates, which contains grand plans, for example, in this case to improve public transport but if one reviews them shortly afterwards, most of the plans are not implemented. A few buses and DART carriages have been provided. I live on the DART line and use it occasionally. Platform extensions and resignalling projects for the DART have been announced annually since 1997 but trains are not running at weekends currently and the projects have not been completed, yet more money will be provided next year. People are entitled to be a little sceptical when they read departmental statements at this time of year announcing grand old plans.While the announcements indicate a lack of competence in delivery, they also reflect a failure in the political system in that we do not pick up on this. Ministers should be required when they seek money for a project in a given year to come to the House and outline what they did with the funding approved in the current year. Our system does not allow us to do so. Former Ministers, would-be Ministers, all Senators and most civil servants agree the system should be changed but that will never happen because it suits the incumbent. However, the system of planning and overseeing expenditure is rendered a complete nonsense as a result.I am interested in the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children's proposal regarding general practitioner cards. It represents progress but I am not sure where it is going and it depends on whether one is looking at half full bottles or half empty bottles. It is progress in so far as 200,000 people will have free access to primary care but they will not have access to the free drugs to which they are entitled under the medical card scheme. The Government is resiling from its commitment but this represents progress in some direction.However, the proposal creates a problem in that it will lead to a four-tier health system. Absurdly, it is easy to say that in the House because every Member has private health insurance but the 50% of the population that does not will be split into three distinct categories — those who have medical cards, those who have GP cards and those who have no cover. One will pay for GP services, drugs, overnight stays in hospitals or consultants' services depending on the category into which one falls. The system has become incoherent, largely because the Government does not know what system it wants.The Tánaiste, on her first outing in the House, stated the State should have a welfare role, picking up the tab for those who cannot afford to pay. That is a distinct ideological view, which I respect but with which I disagree. The State's role in the provision of health services, for example, primary care, should be to provide a good quality universal service, perhaps not entirely free, at the point of delivery.However, the health system is an extraordinary hybrid under which certain sections of the population have different entitlements. This causes problems at the margins in terms of entitlement with potential employment effects and it creates inequities. In addition, institutional pressures are being created between different people which is evidenced by the competition for public beds between private and public patients. The Government has provided in the Book of Estimates for an increase in the charge for the use of public beds by private patients.It is interesting to examine the philosophy underpinning that proposal. On the one hand, officials from the Department of Health and Children inform us, usually in private, that the introduction of a charge is intended to reclaim public beds from private patients but, on the other, they do not want to do so because what is referred to as a "health crisis" is not a crisis for people with insurance. The last thing they want to do is introduce a waiting list for those who are insured because there would be genuine problems within the service in the form of political pressure on the Government.A statement of where the Government wants to be is needed. Is it intended to extend the proposed GP card scheme to others? Is this a step towards awarding the 200,000 medical cards, as promised two years ago, or will it result in the permanent institutionalisation of a four-tier system?There is a consensus in both Houses on the overseas development aid commitment, which was not a normal commitment. The Taoiseach made a solemn commitment to the international community at an international forum four years ago, not only on behalf of the Government but also the people. The former Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs, Deputy O'Donnell, is correct that the ODA commitment is our foreign policy and represents our intervention in Africa. Ireland cannot do anything by force or through political pressure because it does not have the clout. Our statement of what we believe and how we want to operate our foreign policy is the ODA commitment. It is a disgrace that the Government has rowed back on it, not least because the extra mile involved would not have cost a significant amount. It is a great pity that, for the sake of an extra €150 million over three years, Ireland is resiling from an international commitment, of which most Members are proud. It is regrettable that we find ourselves in this position.We have choices to make and the social insurance fund must be examined in this context. The fund was in serious deficit for many decades but it has been in surplus for the past three or four years and it currently has a surplus of almost €2 billion. Given that approximately 1.8 million people are in employment, we have an opportunity to re-examine the operation of the fund. We should move to the notion of statutory entitlements and a more transparent system to operate the fund should be put in place. Trustees, drawn from the social partners, should be appointed to advise, though not control, the fund.Work also needs to be done on how pay-related social insurance is charged because the current system is an unmitigated mess involving exemptions, thresholds and ceilings with the result that few people know the rate. In addition, a health levy is also collected, which is totally inequitable because it is not related to income and is levied at a flat rate on all income above a certain threshold. There is a need and an opportunity to re-examine the fund in terms of how it is levied and managed and I hope the Minister will do so over the next while.I refer to capital spending. Senator Minihan stated the Progressive Democrats have never objected to the notion of borrowing for productive investment but the former Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, made it clear that he thought any such reference would mean a return to the bad old days of the 1970s and 1980s when, typically, the Labour Party and Fine Gael could be blamed for borrowing money and getting the State into major debt. I thought the Progressive Democrats agreed with that but we must consider whether money is being spent well and there is evidence to the contrary. It is surprising that we were not able to spend the full allocation this year and that there is a €250 million run-on to next year, notwithstanding the fact that some projects finished early. I am not sure how it balances out. I assume the moneys for Monasterevin, for example, would have been budgeted for next year rather than this year. Therefore, they have been paid out of the allocation early. This clear failure to spend money is a bit worrying notwithstanding that we have improved delivery of roads projects on five years ago.We must also consider whether the 5% allocation is sufficient. We are not making progress quickly enough on many capital projects, whether roads, broadband or the capital project needed to invest in the health service. We need to spend more if we can afford it. The 5% is a reasonable benchmark if we do not have more but we have more and should spend it. However, we should not spend it if we do not have the mechanisms and ways to spend it and cannot ensure we get what Senator Quinn referred to as value for money.I have not done enough study on PPPs to be sure and confident of the reality of the story. However, the failure to attract private money into large infrastructural projects is worrying. I know there are pressures and that it is easy for financial institutions buying through private investors to stand back and put pressure on Government by not coming across with funds. There is evidence they have been able to put pressure on Government by saying they are not getting a sufficient cut of the action. I do not suggest the Department or Government should rush to meet all the demands of financial institutions because their only interest is the profit they make in the long or short term. It is nonetheless worrying that we have not managed to come remotely close to meeting the targets.PPPs are not appropriate for everything. I have always had doubts that they are appropriate for educational projects and certainly doubt they are appropriate for health projects. However, I have no problems with them in terms of major infrastructural projects, in particular those where user charges can reasonably be imposed, for example, roads and public transport. The issue is worthy of debate. It is worrying that we have not succeeded in doing better in terms of attracting private money into the many decent projects around.There has been little enough economic opportunity since the last general election, but we are coming once again to a time of opportunity. It is appropriate that we use this opportunity in a managed and reasonable way. We do not need a splurge or a spree. However, we need a managed increase and improvement in the amount of money we spend on public services. I hope the Minister will take the opportunity to do that. Frankly, I see little evidence from the Estimates he has introduced that he wants to do it.
#BrendanKenneally	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-party	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-dob	unknown-#BrendanKenneally-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	122	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the debate on the Estimates. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. The Estimates have become far more important than in the past. I have been a Member of the Oireachtas since 1989. For a long period, even though we had the Estimates and the Finance Act, everybody watched out for the budget. Over the years the Estimates have become more important, as we can see from the attention paid to them over the past week, which is probably deserved.To a large extent the budget deals with personal matters, for example, social welfare increases and personal taxation. However, the Estimates are more a mark of the direction the economy is taking and how we are managing it. It is right that they get a greater priority than they did in the past.I compliment the Minister on keeping expenditure increases at 6%. I am not one of those who agree with the tax and spend philosophy. I neither believe in absurdly low taxation nor a high tax regime. We almost have it right. Taxation aimed at bringing in extra revenue in order to increase spending is always highly inflationary. This has caused us problems in the past and is not the right way to go. The Minister has got it just about right.I never worry about capital expenditure. I worry when we run away with ourselves on current expenditure but not so much with regard to capital expenditure because it has no long-term implications. Capital expenditure is an investment in our future and there is scope for further investment as the Minister has €120 million of an unallocated reserve, the spending of which he will announce in the budget. I hope he will announce it because I have no concern about spending in that area.I notice there is a capital carryover of €250 million from last year. This is a welcome innovation. Previously, any unspent moneys at the end of the year were returned to the Department of Finance. In many areas, because Departments knew this would happen they rushed and spent the money rather than return it. Sometimes it was not spent wisely. The carryover gives some breathing space and should be of benefit.I will make a few brief comments on the Estimates with reference to communications, the marine and natural resources, my area of responsibility. I am glad to see an increase of 22% in the Estimates for coastguard and maritime safety. I welcome this emphasis on safety. As an island nation we have had too many tragedies. Anything that can be done to heighten safety awareness, to provide grants for safety appliances on vessels or to beef up the emergency services can only be good.The capital funding for fisheries harbours is down slightly but this does not unduly worry me. It can happen that some big project finishes before another is ready to get going. There will always be peaks and troughs in this area. I hope the considerable sum of €19 million provided in the budget sees the start of the development of the almost completely new harbour in Dunmore East. I hope some of that money will be spent towards the end of 2005 on that project and that sufficient finance will be provided in 2006 to complete it.It is not unexpected that a buyout of salmon drift net and draft net licences is not mentioned in the Book of Estimates. This has not yet been agreed and the Minister cannot provide for it until it happens. It is inevitable it will happen. Approximately 70% of the drift net and draft net fishermen are interested in proceeding this way. They pay for licences each year but are getting no return on them. We are the last in Europe to allow this, so it is inevitable there will be a buyout. I hope the finances will be made available at the appropriate time.The spending for programmes on information and communications technology is up by 13% to €36.6 million. This increase is to speed up the roll out of broadband. Unfortunately, we have been playing catch up in this regard and are behind the take up in some of the other developed countries. This is surprising as we have been ahead in all other technological areas. We are catching up and I am glad the Minister is continuing to make finance available.The social welfare provisions show this is a caring Government, despite what others have said. Over a period unemployment has fallen from 300,000 to 150,000. Despite this fall in unemployment, spending in the social welfare area has continually increased. Since Fianna Fáil came into office the unemployment rate has fallen from 10% to 5%. However, spending on social welfare has doubled. The money has not been clawed back and returned to the general pool but has been left in the social welfare area and redistributed to help people who cannot help themselves, for example, the carer's allowance. I was a Member of the Dáil when the carer's allowance was first introduced. The budget for the first year was £8 million. That budget has increased substantially since, but there is scope to go further. The means test for the allowance should be removed but when we suggest that we are told the costs involved would be too high. However, there is still scope to go further. I would like to see the removal of any means testing. We are told that to do this would entail a cost, but that is a cost accruing to social welfare. This highlights one of the flaws in the system of accounting that we use in the public sector. I believe there would be a significant saving in the health area if social welfare was to absorb this cost but the system we use does not appear to be capable of taking that into account. On several occasions I have asked for this change but I do not think any study has been done on what could be saved in health expenditure if this money was given to social welfare. Interaction across Departments does not appear to take place but it should happen.Significant increases have been made to the old age pension. We fulfilled all the commitments we made in the past, such as the pledge to raise the old age pension to £100 per week. The Government has committed itself to raising it to €200 per week, which we will achieve and go beyond. That is only right. These people helped to build up the economy and I am pleased this caring Government is giving back far more than the minuscule increases they got under previous regimes when Opposition parties were in Government.Child benefit has quadrupled since the days when the Minister was a member of the Opposition. This is an important payment which generally goes to the woman of the house and, in most instances, is applied in a proper way.I do not know what the Minister will do in regard to personal allowances in the budget but the carer's allowance must be significantly increased. It was introduced at the time of individualisation, of which I was never a great fan and I said so at the time. The main reason it was introduced was to try and get stay-at-home spouses back to work, which it has succeeded in doing. However, at present single income households where one spouse is at home are finding it difficult. Two earners in a household take longer to get into the higher tax bracket than if there is one earner. This matter needs to be looked at and it could be tackled through the carer's allowance.To be consistent with what I said earlier, we should not tamper with the current income tax rates of 20% and 42%. The lower rate should certainly not be amended, although there may be a case for bringing the higher rate down from 42% to 40%. Significant progress will have to be made on income tax bands which have not been widened sufficiently in recent years. Many people are getting into the higher tax bracket far too early and I would like to see that addressed.The Minister spoke at the launch of the Book of Estimates about value for money. As always, we must examine if we are getting value for money in our health service. We have trebled the amount being spent on health in eight years to €11 billion. Even if we were to spend a further €4 billion that would still not solve the problems in the health service. The previous Minister, Deputy Martin, tried to address the fundamental difficulties that exist in that area and I am sure the Tánaiste will continue this process.Health appears to have an ability to soak up money. Part of the problem is that health inflation will always be higher than inflation in general because so much new technology has to be dispersed to various areas. A few years ago everybody in my area requiring dialysis had to travel to Dublin for three days of kidney dialysis per week but this service is now more widely available around the country, which costs money.I am very pleased with the announcement regarding medical cards. The 7.5% increase will lead to 30,000 new medical cards. I have heard it said that people would still have to pay for their medicines. At the moment they pay for medicines and GP visits so it is a significant improvement for them. It will also help take pressure off accident and emergency units.I spoke on cancer services during an Adjournment debate last week. When speaking about the Estimates for her Department, the Tánaiste and Minister for Health and Children referred to the expansion of cancer services. Radiotherapy is badly needed in the south east. It is a nonsense to have two of the three disciplines for cancer treatment, chemotherapy and surgery, but not to have radiotherapy. I hope this will be achieved under the planned expansion of services. There is also a need for a dedicated oncology ward and for the BreastCheck programme to be expanded.When speaking on the Estimates, most people have a shopping basket for their own area. I have referred to a couple of things already. The Minister for Finance was in Waterford recently at a chamber of commerce dinner. The deputy mayor spoke eloquently and let him know the requirements for the south east so I will not take up time in the House putting it on the record as the Minister is well aware of it.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to the House. It is good to have her here. In his opening statement, the Minister, Deputy Cowen, said that the Estimates and budget must "contribute to our general economic and social development." He also said: "It is the objective of the Government, by making the correct decisions in the Estimates and budget to promote sustainable economic growth so we have the resources to spend money on the social needs of our society that help enhance the dignity and quality of life of those who require our help and support." I concur with these sentiments. It is a very commendable statement with which nobody here would argue.However, the Government does not stand up to scrutiny in regard to it. We heard from the previous speaker, Senator Kenneally, what the Government really thinks about helping enhance the dignity and quality of life of those who require our help and support. He advocated that we must not tamper with the lower tax rate but we should tackle the upper rate. That says it all for the Government's attitude, that we should continue to widen the gap between rich and poor ——

This reflects poorly on the Government.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	127	I will try to elaborate on why I believe the gap has widened between the haves and the have-nots.I accept the Minister for Social and Family Affairs will make his announcement in regard to social welfare benefits on budget day so we cannot comment on that today. This is in stark contrast to what happened last year in regard to the Estimates when the Minister announced the introduction of reviewed and adjusted schemes which subsequently became known as the "savage 16" cuts. That is one of the more important aspects of the Estimates which has been overlooked. I hope the Minister will reverse those cuts on budget day but we have not been given any indication that this will be the case. I urge the Minister of State to make representations to him that those cuts should be reversed as they affected the most vulnerable in society. They did not affect the well-off but those who are less able to help themselves.The national anti-poverty strategy states that people are living in poverty if their income and resources — material, cultural and social — are so inadequate as to preclude them from having a standard of living that is regarded as acceptable by Irish society generally. Our society should be judged on how we look after our elderly, our children and people with disabilities. These people are not being adequately looked after in many respects. I acknowledge that old age pensions and child benefit have increased in recent years but at least 66,000 children still live in consistent poverty and 237,000 live in households with incomes below the poverty line. We also have households headed by people who are ill or disabled and which have a relatively high risk of consistent poverty. Where a household is headed by someone who is unemployed, the risk to that family is far greater than a family whose head has a job.The poverty risk for single adult households has also become an increasing trend in Ireland. This mainly comprises single adults living alone, a high proportion of whom are women. Another area in which the gap has widened is the increasing number of people on housing waiting lists in every local authority area. There are currently more than 50,000 households on waiting lists for social housing in a year in which only 315 social houses were built. When will we ever catch up and provide some hope for such people? The Government looks after the wealthy and is encouraged not to tamper with the tax code for people on the lower rate.A Combat Poverty Agency study in 2001 showed that there is a link between low income poverty and ill health. Two thirds of 30 families in the study had some health problems. People affected by ill health are more likely to live on a low income because they were unable to gain employment or because their employment experiences were likely to be sporadic due to ill health. Stress, isolation and depression were induced by lack of money. Inadequate income made a healthy diet difficult. To find people living in deprived communities, I need only look to west Dublin to see how deprivation and disadvantage has had an effect on a community. The Government is doing little to tackle such difficulties and the problems are increasing on a weekly basis.If these savage cuts are not reversed this year, it will be a dreadful indictment of the Government. The back to education allowance has more or less been abolished at third level, saving just €2.2 million. The conditions for the rent supplement scheme were severely curtailed and restricted. Many of us have read the report by CentreCare, the agency which deals with the homeless, which outlines the severe impact these cuts are having on homeless people. Restricting people from rent allowance by ensuring that they are resident in rented property for six months before they can receive it is outrageous. Families need rent supplement in the first place. How can they possibly afford to live in rented accommodation and pay full rent if they are in need of rent supplement? I ask that this cut be reversed.The crèche supplement for child care was another dreadful cut, particularly given that we are trying to encourage young parents, particularly young mothers, to get back into education. They know the only way out of poverty is through education and employment. Surely, our job is to encourage such people to go back to work and give them whatever assistance we can, but cutting their benefits is doing nothing to assist people in the lowest income group.The earnings threshold for disability and unemployment benefit was to increase from €88.88 to €150 per week and, as a consequence, increase the thresholds for the three bands used for the purposes of these graduated rates. This measure is, in effect, an adjustment of the threshold in line with inflation. The gross savings were estimated at €14.3 million, with 10,300 people affected. Other cuts included the dietary supplement, the half rate child dependant allowance and others of which the Minister of State is well aware.The money to be invested in the equality area as outlined in the Estimates is inadequate. Crime against women in the first half of 2004 has seen a percentage increase compared with the first half of 2003. The rape of females increased by 27%, rape under section 4 increased by 22% and aggravated sexual assault increased by 175%. This demonstrates a worrying trend in crime against women. However, very little funding is being given to the organisations involved in tackling crime against women and domestic violence.Senators will have heard that Women's Aid was unable to respond to a large percentage of its telephone calls because of lack of resources, leading to people in the office being unable to take calls. An increase of 1% is being given to the Equality Authority, 3% to the National Women's Council, 2% for equality proofing, 3% for gender mainstreaming and 3% for the National Consultative Committee on Racism and Interculturalism. If we are depending on the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, we will wait for a very long time before we see equality in our society. Not only does it not come second on the list of priorities, it does not even come third, fourth or fifth.

I congratulate the Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, for introducing a quality Book of Estimates. It is based on having money and deciding how to allocate the resources. I am pleased that there will be increases in the areas about which Senator Terry has expressed concern. I, too, would be concerned if the disadvantaged were not looked after, if adult education was not looked after and if the community employment schemes were not restored in areas in order that we can have a good quality of life in our communities. However, this will happen this time, which is what I like about these plans. They focus on areas of quality of life for children, the disadvantaged, the elderly and people who need help in their homes in the form of respite care and so on.I have read through the various programmes and am pleased that the Government will announce a quality of life budget next week.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	132	The statements are in the Book of Estimates. More than €460 million will be spent on disadvantage next year. That is a colossal amount by any standards. There is an 8% increase in spending on adult education. There will be an increase in the quality of adult guidance, adult literacy, the VTOS programme and child care facilities. This is mentioned in the Estimates. I worked in that sector and I am aware that there was a slowdown in the programmes. Thankfully, however, the money is available now and it will be focused on this area.The health sector is also a serious concern of mine. I am delighted with the increase in medical card services. People will be able to attend a general practitioner rather than accident and emergency departments. There is also an increase in the number of frontline staff, such as nurses, dentists, orthodontists and so forth. These are areas which required attention and I congratulate the Minister on the fact that they are detailed in the Book of Estimates and that they will receive attention.I wish to put down a marker regarding the radiotherapy unit in Waterford. I am a native of Waterford and I ask the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, to convey a message to the Minister for Health and Children. This unit is necessary for Waterford.

#AnnOrmonde	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-party	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-dob	unknown-#AnnOrmonde-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	134	I make no bones about that. I come from a medical background and I am aware of the consequences of not having a radiotherapy unit in Waterford and not being able to provide this necessary service. The Tánaiste is sensitive about this matter and is giving it detailed consideration.Another matter that deserves consideration is the interaction between the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. There is not enough co-operation in health and education areas, particularly in the primary education sector, which is the first step on the education ladder. This is where there might be problem children who require the services of both the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Education and Science. There is a lack of educational psychologists to detect the problems that arise in children coming from dysfunctional backgrounds. If they are not caught at that early stage, it can be detrimental for their future. I urge the Minister to ensure there is a complementary overlap between education and health. It is an area in which there is duplication yet the child in the centre can sometimes lose out.I could say a great deal more on this issue but my time is limited. I am pleased with this Book of Estimates. The quality of life issues are now taking root in our thinking. The money is available to implement a focused budget which will ensure that the disadvantaged will have a better quality of life.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I am grateful to Senator Ormonde for sharing time. It means I will have to cut down on the pleasantries but the Minister can take them as delivered.I speak not as a consumer of the services dealt with in the Estimates or with a constituency interest but to offer some general comments on two areas. I will focus on the research capacity of higher education but, with regard to health, I would be disinclined to put any more money into this sector until the systems are put in order. When one puts more money into a black hole, one simply confirms people in their behaviour. Money could be focused on getting and keeping people out of hospital.I welcome the extension of the medical card scheme. It is a pity the Minister could not go a little further and cover the cost of drugs which are very expensive. There should be more generous treatment of the chronically ill. For some time, a number of Members have been making representations to the Department of Health and Children on behalf of the small and declining number of people who are survivors of the polio epidemic in the 1950s. The Department seems to be entirely incapable of comprehending the possibility that they might be registered as chronically ill users of drugs.The economy and future development of this country requires that we have at least one research university, whether it is a single free-standing facility or a combination of what we have. We need a research university that is in the world's top rank. Otherwise, our young people will leave to go to the good laboratories. They will go to the facilities with the good teachers and the people who write the books. Our good teachers will follow them and most will not return.In future, industrial jobs will go to low-wage economies and service jobs will follow them. If Ireland is going to build on the wonderful advance that has been made, it will be in the knowledge-based industries, in research and development and in similar areas. A list was published recently — and one might query the criteria that were used — ranking universities internationally. In the first 200, Trinity College, Dublin, was 89th and Queen's University, Belfast, was 147th. The rest of our universities were absent. It is not an issue of scale or population because there were three Australian universities in the first 20. Unless Ireland can develop that type of capacity, where our institutions are in that first division or, at least, in the first 50, our industrial and economic future is in peril.I hope there will be a further debate on this issue, as has been sought by a number of Members. This is the one item missing from the Estimates. I hope it will be possible to seriously examine the university sector, particularly with regard to research which is very important.Apart from that, the Minister's speech was extremely encouraging. Undoubtedly, he will bring to this portfolio the same quality and pertinacity which he brought to his last position. However, there must be further consideration of the needs of higher level education.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	138	I welcome the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I would be pleased if he would stay for the Private Members' debate but that environmental issue appears to have been grabbed by the Department of Transport. I believe the M3 should be the concern of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government rather than of the Minister for Transport but that is a matter for another debate.The Estimates cover so much it is hard to deal with them in detail so I have selected a few issues which I wish to discuss and examine carefully. The Estimates are only a forerunner of the budget. Whatever happens in the budget is the real game. That is where the Estimates stop being a drama and become real. I believe that the first move on taxation should apply to the lower paid. People on the minimum wage should be outside the tax net. I make no apologies for saying that this is where our priorities should lie. The Minister hinted that his thinking lies in that direction.Doing what I suggest, in conjunction with the indexation or widening of the tax bands, is the way to ensure that there will not be a huge number of people at the higher rate. I re-emphasise, however, that the most important factor is that people on the minimum wage should be removed from the tax net. I give full credit to the Government for the number of people who, during the past ten years or so, have been removed from the tax net. That is important and we should recognise and acknowledge what has been done. We should continue to remove those on lower incomes from the tax net because it will give them the motivation and incentive to work.We need to be understanding in terms of our perception of the growth rate. At times during the 1990s, there was a growth rate of 10%. For a large part of that decade, growth rates reached between 6% and 9%. Ireland cannot cope with such high rates of growth because they lead to the creation of congestion and levels of demand we cannot meet. They also make the population extremely unhappy. I have stated on many occasions during the past ten years that — this is an instinctive or intuitive response because I cannot prove it — in terms of my experience of negotiating and the consideration of economic factors and underlying economics, a growth rate of approximately 4.5% is the highest with which we can cope and sustain. The rate is likely to be over 5% this year and, in my opinion, this will lead to our encountering difficulties again.The Minister commented on a number of occasions recently about the importance of the development of road infrastructure. On the radio this morning, he stated that he is of the opinion that our road infrastructure will come right in the next few years. He also intimated where investment is being made. That is another matter with which we will deal during Private Members' time. We are happy about some but not all of this investment. I would like to see a greater investment in rail infrastructure. A telling comment was made on the Order of Business last week by Senator Kitt who referred to morning reports about the level of traffic entering Galway and stated that a first class rail service from Tuam to Galway city could be operational within six months, whereas it would take six years to put in place a road of motorway quality on the same route. We should bear that in mind when considering the position of Navan.In the past two years, there has been a great deal of criticism about the Government's commitment to benchmarking. I wish to place on the record the fact that the period in question has witnessed the least ever disruption in the civil and public service. When we set about instigating benchmarking, it was our goal to achieve the great prize, namely, industrial peace and stability within the public sector. The latter has been achieved at good value to the State.There has been much discussion about overseas development aid since the relevant Minister of State, Deputy Conor Lenihan, was appointed. ODA is extremely important but there is another issue of similar importance which relates to matters outside of this jurisdiction, namely, our commitment to everyone on this island. We should consider, within the debate on the Estimates, making a significant investment in the peace process in terms of bridge-building and cross-community operations on both sides of the Border in order to ensure that the said peace process finds roots among members of ordinary communities. The DUP has stated that £1 billion should be invested in the North. In my view, some of that money should be invested in the peace process by means of supporting groups such as Co-operation Ireland and others which are doing extraordinary work in that area.As regards education, the Minister for Education and Science has given a clear indication that she will be giving specific consideration to primary education. I would like her to give a commitment to get rid of all untrained personnel from primary schools. That should be one of her first priorities. She should also give a commitment to deal with children with special educational needs by making an investment in that sector. Class sizes must also be reduced, which would mean the provision of additional teachers. There will, therefore, be a need for a concentrated building programme to keep these matters moving in parallel.We need to appoint an additional 500 teachers in order to eliminate the use of untrained personnel. In terms of class sizes, we will need to appoint a couple of thousand teachers over a number of years. There has been a major row about whether the Minister can meet the promise of the Government to achieve this within its term of office. Rather than getting hung up on how long it will take to achieve, I would prefer if a structured process to implement all that is contained in the programme for Government and to meet the other needs relating to primary education was put in place. If it took a year longer to achieve the relevant goal, people might argue about it but they would be happy once they see progress being made.The progress to which I refer will be measured by the employment of additional teachers and by ensuring that the colleges of education take on as many students as possible, that the postgraduate qualification is put in place and that a conversion course — which was approved by the then Minister, Deputy Martin, many years ago but which was subsequently blocked at some point — for post-primary teachers who want to continue their careers by becoming fully-qualified primary teachers is instituted. The latter could be achieved very easily by the provision of a series of short-term modular courses. Such a course would eliminate many problems and provide greater flexibility between the primary and post-primary sectors. People may not be aware that a significant number of qualified and trained post-primary teachers are working in the primary sector. Unfortunately, these individuals are considered unqualified in the primary sector and they would welcome the opportunity to become fully qualified. These small matters to which I refer could be dealt with in the context of the Estimates.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	139	I thank Senator O'Toole for being so generous in sharing time. I wish to address the issue of overseas aid. As Deputy O'Donnell so eloquently put it in today's newspapers, our commitment to providing such aid is how we are known abroad. This issue is extremely important for the countries to which we have been providing assistance. I refer, in particular, to the priority countries in Africa, three of which, Ethiopia, Uganda and Zambia, I have visited on several occasions. I am aware of the high regard in which people in these states hold Ireland. Not only does Ireland give generously in terms of providing aid but that aid is not tied. That latter point is important because some countries provide aid but this is tied to the purchase of food and services from such countries which is then given to recipient countries. Ireland buys food and services on the spot, which is extraordinarily important.I hope we have enough money to continue to provide bilateral aid. I am disappointed that we will not be in a position to meet our target of 0.7% of GDP for overseas development aid by 2007. The Taoiseach promised the United Nations that we would meet this target by that date. Developing countries took it as a promise which was sincerely made and which would be kept. Everyone thought it would be kept. It will not be kept because we have discovered that we are so rich and that, as a result, the amount involved will be much higher than originally envisaged.I ask that the Minister give particular consideration to the area of multi-lateral aid. When it comes to how they intend to spend their budgets, governments are frequently much more influenced by multinational organisations such as the United Nations, the World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, etc., than they are by small countries such as Ireland. I implore the Minister to ensure that the level of money given to UNFPA will not only be maintained but that it will be increased. As he will be aware, the United States has withdrawn funding to that organisation. Our increase last year was extremely important. I applaud the former Ministers of State with responsibility in this area, Deputies Tom Kitt, O'Donnell and Burton, for what they tried to do. Their actions made a difference to the countries to which I refer.Unfortunately, the maternal mortality figures for sub-Saharan Africa, in particular, and the remainder of the continent in general are not improving much. The UNFPA's report for last year shows that the improvement was marginal in most African countries. The position in respect of HIV-AIDS is getting progressively worse, despite the enormous amount of money that is being spent. I include here the well-spent money from the global fund, to which Ireland contributes.Irish people have a great respect for mothers. We were always very proud of our obstetrical and gynaecological care. I would like to see Ireland helping to reinforce this care in other countries, particularly in those developing countries which are recipients of Irish aid. I hope there will be no question of any cutbacks.I warmly welcome the wise words of Senator Maurice Hayes. I chaired the association and trust in Trinity College which is one of the fund-raising organisations for the college. I seemed to spend more time imploring and beseeching people to give money to the university than doing anything to encourage academic research or teaching, which is not as it should be.
#DickRoche	unknown-#DickRoche-party	unknown-#DickRoche-dob	unknown-#DickRoche-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	140	In framing the 2005 Estimates and the budget, the Government's primary aim is to continue support for economic growth and employment as a way of making further progress. As a result of the Government's successful management of the public finances and economy, we should remind ourselves of what we have collectively achieved because it is not just a case of Government achievement but rather of what we the people have achieved.The general Government deficit has been lowered from close to 100% of GDP in the early 1990s to the current level of 31%, which is an extraordinary achievement. The country has enjoyed improvements in economic growth and the Government has certainly improved the revenue position. However, the Government is not just running an economy but also a State. These improvements are aimed at assisting the people. The Exchequer outturn for 2004 is now projected at approximately €2 billion better than the deficit of €2.8 billion for 2004 which was forecast in last year's budget. There is practically full employment with the unemployment rate less than 5%, which is a remarkable achievement given the situation in the not too distant past. The inflation rate at the end of 2004 will be of the order of 2.25%. It is worthwhile reminding ourselves of these matters and of what we have achieved as a nation.Public sector expenditure is now double what it was in 1997 and has risen to €41 billion. The Government is prioritising spending in areas such as health, education, social welfare and investment in infrastructure. The Government will increase its spending on health in 2005 to €1.4 billion on a pre-budget basis. In the past four years, the Government has invested an average of approximately 5% of GDP in addressing the infrastructural deficit. This is a very important point. Senator O'Toole spoke about quality of life and this is how it is improved. I have been concentrating on the inputs and that is only one part of the story. The economy is now more viable and more progressive than one could have imagined or hoped for less than ten years ago.The spend on the key economic and social infrastructure under the NDP is at record levels. By June 2004, the Exchequer will have provided €1.8 billion more than planned. The resources are being provided and the outputs are coming.I ask the House to consider some of the Government's achievements in the past few years. Some 47 major roads projects were completed between 2000 and 2004. Approximately 291 km in total will be completed under the national development programme by mid-2004. Motorway standard roads to a total of 76.7 km will be completed; dual carriageway completed will be 51.8 km and single carriageway, 155.4 km.I am aware this cannot be done without causing controversy. Some of the controversies have been extraordinarily hyped. It has been suggested that instead of looking to push the emotional button, people should adopt a logical approach. The M1 motorway to Dundalk is the longest stretch of motorway in the country and includes the very impressive Boyne cable bridge. This shows infrastructure can be fitted into sensitive environments in an attractive manner of which one can be proud. The Dublin light rail system is now operational. The Dublin Port tunnel will be incredibly important in terms of the quality of life in the city and will be completed by the fourth quarter of next year. A Dublin Bay water treatment plant costing €300 million has been installed which gives the capital a world-class water treatment facility. I ask Members to remember the situation less than ten years ago when there was an open cesspit on the outskirts of the city. Senator O'Toole referred to the rail network in which there has been a major increase in investment. In 1997 the Government of the day invested €7 million; last year the Government invested €329 million. This is probably not enough investment but it is a lot more than €7 million.I wish to deal with some of the issues raised by Senators during the debate. Reference was made to the low level of increase in the local government fund. This is neither a fair nor an accurate observation. The 2005 Exchequer allocation for the fund is €488 million, compared with the previous year's figure of €453 million, an increase of €35 million or 8%. I am as interested in this fund as any Member of this House. I believe more efficiency can be squeezed out of the public services at local government level. By putting €488 million of taxpayers' funds into these services I will expect a better delivery of services and I am not prepared to accept the old arguments and the old shibboleths that we did not get enough. We have enough now and it is up to us to do the job in local government, both at central and national level.During the period 1996-2004, the Exchequer contribution to the local government fund has actually increased by 150%. I am not prepared to listen to people saying we are not doing enough when not too long ago the same people, when in Government, did an awful lot less. In the area of local government, social housing is of particular interest to me. The figure this year will be €1,206 million. I remind Members and, through them, members of local authorities, that I am carrying out an analysis of performance in local government housing. It would be quite shocking and not a little embarrassing for people to look at the returns in their own local authority areas. It will come as a shock to most Members to learn that very few local authorities have met the targets set for them over the past ten years. It would be unfair of me to draw attention to one or two years but over the past ten years, if one examines the total number of allocations, the total amount of money given to local authorities to produce local authority houses, very few local authorities have come up to 100% over a ten-year period. The divergence between the targets and the reality is even worse in the short term. Adequate funding is being provided. I will be driving this particular area because I believe the Senators who made the point of the importance of this sector are correct. The Government is putting in a significant sum of money; €1.2 billion is not peanuts in anybody's language. I will expect public representatives at local government level and those on the ground to drive this issue and make sure we have delivery. I cannot go next year to the door of the Minister for Finance and look for money if I am returning €300 million or €400 million on any account.The issue of education was raised by a number of Senators. The total increase is €544 million. We could spend the rest of the day discussing this subject on which we all have views. I share the concern expressed by Senator Maurice Hayes about research carried out in universities. I am not sure that the entire answer is to push more resources from taxpayers into the sector. Senator Henry also touched on the subject in her contribution. In my view, industry has a role to play because it should see that university research is the seed stock for future development. I agree absolutely with the point made by both the Minister for Education and Science and Senator O'Toole that primary level should receive resources. The Minister has stated she wants to promote the inclusion, participation and achievement of people from socio-economically disadvantaged areas and that is as we would all wish.I am a little surprised at some of the comments made in this House and elsewhere on the issue of tax. On the issue of disparity, the reality is that no Government should apologise for allowing people to spend their own money. PAYE workers were crucified in this country in the past. Those PAYE workers on the average wage are now paying significantly less tax than they paid prior to 1997. In the period since 1997, the average industrial wage has increased by approximately €10,000. A person earning the average industrial wage currently pays almost €270 income tax per annum less than a person earning the average industrial wage seven years ago when it was €10,000 lower than now. These are real achievements. The best thing a State can do is keep its hands out of people's pockets, so to speak, although this is necessary to some degree to pay for vital services.Let us take a couple of examples to highlight our recent economic performance. The average rate of income taxation for a family with one income of €50,000 fell from 33.5% in 1997 to just under 21% in 2004. This is progress because it allows people to make their own decisions and choices. In the case of a family with two incomes the figure is more dramatic, with average income taxation falling from 33.5% to 14%. As a result of the Estimates, the pre-budget gross expenditure on public services will be €43.5 billion. I could cite statistic after statistic but time is short.The Government has prioritised the areas of importance to Senators and others who believe in education, health and welfare services. We will continue to allocate resources on the basis of priorities in the social area.I thank Senators from all sides for their contributions. We will never be completely satisfied as to reach that point would indicate we had lost our grip. I am satisfied that this Government and its immediate predecessor have achieved a vast amount. The economy is in a good state.

He also made a point earlier which rings true with me. Public servants have delivered and part of the reason we are in our current position is due to the politically courageous decisions we took and our excellent public service. I have little time for begrudgers who suggest benchmarking or the public service pay awards were not a good deal. Our public servants are among the finest in the world and we should be prepared to pay them what they are worth.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I move:That Seanad Eireann,—while fully accepting the importance of developing an adequate roads infrastructure and ever mindful of the need to have a practical approach to planning matters, is appalled by the prospect of a motorway being constructed through archaeologically important sites near the Hill of Tara;—recognises that the current proposals are likely to destroy at least 25 known sites;—believes it would be an affront to our people that this specific area, a place of kings, saints and scholars, steeped as it is in our history, culture, mythology and legendry and, immeasurably important as it is to our identity, be ravaged and despoiled;—sees this proposed route as irresponsible and unnecessary and therefore calls on the Government to intervene, as a matter of urgency, on behalf of the people to oppose the current plans and to ensure the selection of a more sensible and suitable route for this important motorway project.I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Killeen, who has been a sparring partner and compadre of mine for many years. It is grossly unfair that the Government should send him to the House to debate this unpopular issue as he would not touch the Government’s proposal with a 40-foot barge pole. He has been sent to the House to defend an amendment which has nothing to do with our decent, positive and progressive motion. I never question the Cathaoirleach’s decisions in these matters but I suspect the amendment is barely in order.It is unnecessary to despoil the cultural landscape of the Tara area to accommodate the new M3 motorway. Instead, on this occasion, we can have our cake and eat it by building the motorway while protecting our heritage. It is a matter of being sensitive and practical.The Minister of State and I stood side by side when we supported the development of an interpretative centre in the Burren, an area in his constituency. I could make the same point with regard to the Blasket Islands interpretative centre and many others. I do not approach this issue from a position of opposition to development. This is the first time in many years that I have tabled a motion on planning and development taking this line.Opponents of the proposed M3 motorway should not be regarded as just another group of objectors. Having spoken to them, they take a sensible approach because their background is one of interest in the area.There is no reason to oppose the construction of a motorway. Among other reasons, it is necessary because the N3 is overloaded and the Government has been unwilling to build a railway to Navan. For this reason, I hope the Minister of State's speech does not set out reasons for building the motorway.I hope a practical approach will be taken to finding an acceptable middle course between, on the one hand, what is proposed by the National Roads Authority and others who wish to drive ahead with the proposed route and, on the other, the lobby groups which wish to protect important parts of our heritage by proposing a reasonable alternative. I ask the Minister of State to throw away his script and, as a sensible elected public representative, consider their proposal. He should then indicate what is wrong with it or give one reason the changes requested cannot be made.Over the years, I have regularly disassociated myself in the House from the green welly-wearing, tweed-jacketed urban types who go for a walk in the countryside and suddenly describe themselves as "conservationists". Having liked what they saw, they want the countryside to be kept as it is and, irrespective of the quality of life of the people living in it, oppose building houses in the country because it might affect their view. The Minister of State is aware of my consistent position in this regard.I thought long and hard before getting involved in this issue because I have encountered many unreasonable objections to developments, some of which have brought the democratic process of objecting into disrepute. Regularly, organisations such as An Taisce do not cover themselves in glory, although it is not always wrong and has an important job to do. However, on many occasions, I have not shared its view on issues such as rural housing.In protecting the citizen's democratic right to object, we have created a type of hydra which appears to grow another head every time we cut off one avenue of objection. I am known for making comments such as these in the House and regularly express understanding for the Government's frustration with regard to matters of this nature. For example, I supported recent legislation giving it additional powers in this area.The Government may be tempted to write off the Tara-Skryne group as a nuisance. This would be a grave mistake and an error of judgment. Each issue must be considered separately. It is our duty to be practical, sensible and positive and to ask the Government to be reasonable and sensitive in its approach. It is uncontested that the new motorway needed to replace the inadequate N3 should be routed through County Meath. The people of the County Meath, however, have had to accept more motorway intrusion than any other county. The roads there already include the M1 going through east Meath, the M2 being built through Ashbourne and that direction, and the M4 through Enfield and the west of the county. These proposals have been generally accepted, and are to be welcomed because they add greatly to the improvement of the national roads infrastructure. We must now accept that the people in that county also have to deal with the new M3. I plead with the Minister of State to agree this should not be built according to the present conception and set of proposals. That would be wrong and a grave error.The location of the M1, M2 and M4 — although the M2 is the N2 being upgraded to motorway characteristics — present no real problem. I discussed this in some detail with a former Member of the House, the eminent Professor George Eogan, who made his name and reputation in this area. He said the construction of these motorways has unearthed incredibly important archaeological evidence which is to our collective benefit. It has been stored and collected and is preserved. One of the great concerns for people is to have access to all that great information put together properly, academically and responsibly in the building of those roads. This should be recognised, valued and celebrated and as an annexe to this debate, I ask that it be published in a full scientific publication to the highest international standards. If we make this available we will show that we are serious about our archaeological background.That was good news but the next project is bad news because, unfortunately, the part of the M3 route that goes through the Tara-Skryne valley is fundamentally wrong. All the evidence offered to the environmental impact statement recognises the importance of this cultural landscape and urges that the area be avoided when the motorway route is being determined. Whoever in the National Roads Authority defined the Hill of Tara as simply the hilltop — which appears to be what the authority has done — is completely uninformed and dangerously ignorant of the reality of the area. It is best described as a wide cultural landscape of major importance in the areas of archaeology, history and Celtic studies. It is different from Carrickmines which many would argue could be dealt with through excavation and recording. Some people argue the converse but there is at least an argument against that. The Government must intervene to change this route.There is no reason the motorway cannot be routed away from Tara. It is a detour of a few miles. It would be costly but given the centrality of this location to our national identity, our history, sense of what we are and where we came from, it would be cheap at the price. In researching this I was appalled to discover that when the different route options were being considered the so-called P route, the pink route on the map, came out with the highest marks. The archaeologists who studied this recommended the P route as being the one that caused the least problem. It would least affect the built heritage, was the preferred option of those who assessed the impact on flora and fauna, would have the least effect on the landscape and visual aspect, create the least air pollution and offer the best option on noise levels.These are facts. I do not know why the Government is putting itself behind the 8-ball on this. Why is it defending this indefensible position? It could acknowledge this is mad, be sensible, listen to experts and local people, and build the road where it should be built without interfering with an area that is central to what we are, our identity and heritage. I look forward to the Minister of State's response and to the debate on this over the next two hours. I thank my colleague, Senator Ross, for agreeing to second the motion.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I was delighted to agree to second this motion when Senator O'Toole asked me to do so because of all the problems in motorway routes and archaeological objections, splinter groups and ginger groups coming forward, but this is the one that really matters. I echo some of Senator O'Toole's points. There are merits and environmental dangers in various motorway routes put before us. This is the one that sticks out most. I expressed grave concerns about Carrickmines but we are in danger of becoming a nation where any archaeological find infringed by a motorway becomes a reason for delaying a motorway for a long and unacceptable time. I accept that and that wherever one goes in Ireland one will probably find an archaeological treasure of some sort. This, however, is not just any archaeological treasure. This is Tara which is very special to Irish history and heritage and should not be infringed at any cost.One of the problems when we look at motorways is that cost is the only factor that seems to matter to those in charge. One cannot measure archaeological finds, heritage, fauna, flora and environmental damage in terms of costs. The Government has tried to widen this motion to talk about the wonderful job it is doing on the motorways because the attempt to vandalise Tara is so embarrassing. Another example where cost seems to be paramount is the Westlink bridge on the M50. Anybody who gets stuck every day in the traffic on the Westlink bridge realises that this is a nonsense. It is justified on the basis that it would be more expensive to buy out people neighbouring the route than to let people queue up there all day.The cost cannot be measured against immediate toll road revenues. It can be measured only against long-term, almost infinite delays and problems in the future. Equally, one cannot compare the cost of a motorway with heritage. They are totally different things. One is priceless, the other can be measured in euro and cent and the cost to the Exchequer in the immediate future. Senator O'Toole has made the case extraordinarily well that this is the wrong route. Nobody is even claiming for one moment that there should not be a motorway or an extremely acceptable alternative to carry the traffic going through Meath. Maybe it should be a railway. Meath is the only area contingent to Dublin through which no railway runs. Maybe there should be a different route but this is the worst of all worlds.The National Roads Authority set up an inquiry to examine the sensitive issues involved in route selection. Senator O'Toole covered this but it is worth reiterating that the National Roads Authority set up its own consultants to produce a report identifying the best and the worst routes in respect of archaeology, built heritage, flora, fauna and habitats, water quality, landscape and visual effects, air quality and noise levels. In the case of archaeology it recommended the P route but we are going on the B route. The P route has the least effect on the built heritage, and was the preferred option for reasons of flora, fauna and habitats. It made no recommendation on water quality; the P route would least affect landscape and visual quality, have the lowest air pollution levels and was the best option for noise levels. What is the point of the NRA commissioning a report on these particularly sensitive areas, making definitive recommendations and then ignoring them? In other words, these criteria do not matter at all. The oldest trick in the world is to employ an independent consultant who will normally find out what needs to be done and to follow his or her instructions. In this case, the report did not comply with the wishes of those who commissioned it, so it was simply ignored.I have also spoken to Professor George Eogan who is the world's leading expert on this area. He told me that despite what is stated by the Government and by those who support the particular route, this area is part of the Tara complex. I do not think that anyone will try to deny this anymore. It is part of the traditional Tara complex and it will affect our history and our heritage, yet it is only a three mile stretch. It would be more expensive to bypass that particular stretch and if that is the reason, then the Government should tell us. It should tell us in straightforward terms that we cannot afford to preserve the heritage which we have at Tara. If that is how members of the Government think, then they are Philistines. If they are not Philistines, then they should give other reasons, but they cannot give any environmental reasons because their own report, given by the NRA, finds in favour of another route.I appeal to the Minister not to take a decision which will destroy a vital part of Irish heritage and which will make a mockery of us in the eyes of those who are committed to environmental heritage throughout the world. I appeal to him to reverse this decision.

It is the first opportunity that I have got to congratulate him on his recent appointment and I wish him well. It is clear that the Government, through the NDP, has and will continue to deliver on the strategic roll-out of the road network to drive economic growth in this country. This is something that has been part of the NDP and the national spatial strategy for some time. By the end of 2003, the Government had spent €5 billion on that particular programme. Through PPP and Government funding, €8 billion will be spent between now and 2008. That is all for a very good reason. Motorways are an integral part in linking the provinces with the capital city, as well as linking provincial, local and regional roads.A safe and efficient network of roads will provide the infrastructure for the future growth and development of this island. That is a critical component for the future of this country. This road network is vital to sustain balanced regional development, which is a key plank of Government policy. The Minister and I are acutely aware of the importance of balanced regional development. We need to ensure that a road network is in place, together with other infrastructure such as aviation and rail, as a counter-balance to the phenomenal growth that takes place on the east coast. It is something which the western seaboard and the BMW region have suffered for a long time. The concentration of growth, investment and population has not worked on the east coast. It has not worked because people spend hours on the way to work in the morning as part of a relatively short commute. The regions have not been developed or have not been assisted in that development. In ensuring a shift in population out of the city and in improving the lives of those who live there and those who do not, a key factor is a quality road network. It has to form part of the development of infrastructure, whether it be rail or aviation. The people in the regions are entitled to that development.The M3 is critical to the delivery of this agenda. It is consistent with the NDP and with the national spatial strategy. The same thing occurred in the mid-west region, with the development of the Ennis bypass. It occurs when we lobby for further funding to be put in place to link cities like Limerick and Galway. This is done to ensure that there is growth and development so that people can live their lives outside of the city to the same standards as those who live on the east coast. The M3 is vital in contributing to the on-going success of the local and regional economy, bringing better balanced regional development, improved safety, and access to and from Dublin, its ports and its airports. In addition, this project will transform the quality of life for those living in Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells.There has been much talk about the fauna and flora and the archaeological issues. I accept that and I appreciate the difficulties and issues that arise. However, neither Senator Ross nor Senator O'Toole made any mention of the people's lives that it affects on a daily basis and their concerns. The same issue will arise in regard to re-routing. There are farmers and people who go about their lives in a very small local area. We have to look at the impact that the development of any road network has on those people. While the Senators seem to suggest that the P route was the ultimate solution to all problems, at no point did I hear reference to the daily lives of those who will be affected by the development of a road.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	155	The capacity of the existing two lane road is 13,800 vehicles per day. That is not capable of delivering the current needs. This project will result in reductions of between 75% and 90% in through traffic in the towns of Dunshauglin, Navan and Kells. That will have a tremendous impact on the lives of those who live in those towns. While it is very important to protect archaeological elements in our country, it is also important that we protect the lives of those who are living in this era and whose lives will contribute to the archaeology of future generations. We should be mindful of the fact that future generations will look upon whatever road is developed as the archaeology of the future.The new motorway will also benefit everyone living along the existing N3 by removing the majority of the traffic and associated congestion, which currently affects their lives on a daily basis. The present road is not coping with current traffic volumes. The chosen route lies 1.5 km to the east of the designated area of recorded monuments and east of the existing N3. As it passes through the Tara-Skryne valley, the motorway will be a greater distance from the Hill of Tara than the existing N3. The scheme has been designed to minimise physical and visual impact on the archaeological landscape around Tara.A considerable amount of archaeological work was carried out. A test trench was excavated along the central line, with cross trenches dug every 20 m. The net result has been that archaeological sites have been found which would never have been discovered otherwise. From an archaeological point of view, it will provide an overall understanding of life in the past.We often concentrate too much on what is considered to be the destruction of sites during road projects, but it should be considered that the excavation of sites associated with roads has provided a great deal of information about life in a bygone era. It would be wrong to suggest there is a need to retain such sites. They should be investigated and excavated, the information found during the archaeological dig should be recorded and matters should then proceed.It is important, for obvious reasons, to ensure that those who are living on this island in the current era can go about their daily lives. The construction of the roads needed to facilitate that does not have to involve the destruction of historic monuments. There is a need to seek common ground during the consultation phase, for example, during the planning stages when archaeologists and representatives of An Bord Pleanála are involved. After the road has been designed, however, we should move on and allow people to get on with their daily lives.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House. I support in principle the motion moved by Senator O'Toole. I believe agreement can be found and I hope the Government will allow that to happen by accepting a way forward.The daily capacity of the N3 as originally envisaged was approximately 11,600 cars, but approximately 21,700 cars are travelling on it each day and that will increase to almost 40,000 cars by 2024. If the road cannot cope with the present number of cars, it will not be able to cope with the increased numbers over the next ten years. Most people acknowledge that something has to be done to improve the road. I estimate that 90% of people favour the construction of a new road in some shape or form. Most of those who are protesting against the planned route are in favour of the construction of a new motorway. Previous speakers have referred to the inconvenience that has been caused to the people of County Meath and those who pass through that county. Many problems are encountered each day in towns like Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells as a result of traffic jams. The many cars which travel through such towns when going to and from Dublin each day eventually end up in a mass backlog.Senator Ross and others have rightly asked whether the development of the railway line between Navan and Dublin has been considered. If it has been considered, should the State not acquire the necessary land at the same time as it is acquiring the land for the motorway? The National Roads Authority is often praised at various meetings for the tremendous work it does throughout the country to provide a national primary and secondary roads network. Secondary routes do not receive the same level of funding as primary routes, in most cases. Is there a need for three motorways within a 30-mile radius of each other? I refer to the existing M1, N2 to Derry and N3 routes. Is it possible to develop the N2 and the N3 as a single motorway? Has that been considered? What is the position? If it has been examined, has the possibility of providing a rail link between Navan and Dublin been considered as part of that process? Over 30,000 people live in Navan, but it has been suggested that its population will increase to approximately 60,000 in the next few years. It is obvious, therefore, that a railway line to the capital city will be required. Such a line would work wonders for the present roads network.Great emphasis has been placed on the cost of building new roads. Many people are objecting to the proposed M3 route on the basis of its cost. The last paragraph of the Government's amendment to the motion calls on the Seanad to emphasise "the importance of public private partnerships in harnessing the necessary skills and finance to support the earlier completion of the Government's ambitious national road infrastructure targets." The proposed M3 will be a public private partnership. We all know that PPPs involve private investment and toll roads. If a PPP contract is signed in this case, the private investors who will be recouped by means of tolls will not deviate from the route that has been agreed. If the NRA, which I assume will be the procurement agency in this case, agrees a specific route with the private investors, does the Minister of State agree that there will be no further movement in that regard?If the route cannot be changed after the public private partnership process has been set in motion, we will have to crash everybody's heads together to agree on a route that is satisfactory to most people. As I said earlier, 90% of people agree that a better route, which bypasses most of the towns in County Meath which are on the N3, is needed. Businesses in Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells, which are jammed with backlogs of traffic each morning and evening, have been badly affected by the failure to complete the new route. I am sure the chambers of commerce and local authorities in such towns would welcome being bypassed by a new route to Dublin.Has the National Roads Authority examined the possibility of combining the N2 and the N3 as a single route? The Kilcock bypass on the western route, which is being developed under a public private partnership, will serve the N4, N5 and N6, which pass through counties such as Galway, Mayo, Roscommon, Leitrim, Longford and Westmeath. Three or four national primary routes come together to approach Dublin as a single motorway. Has such a system been considered in this case? It seems to me that there will be three major motorways — the M1, the planned M2 and the planned M3 — within 30 miles of each other in County Meath. What will happen when the roads eventually enter Dublin? Where will the traffic go? Traffic will approach Dublin at great speed from three roads that come from the same direction, but what will happen then?I have already asked whether a rail route has been considered. If it is a possibility, has it been discussed by the National Roads Authority and Iarnród Éireann? Has the Government reflected on the possibility of providing a rail route as well as upgrading the motorway? The issues are important in so far as they relate to the infrastructure of the country as a whole. As I have said, I do not have a problem supporting the principle of the motion. At least 90% of people are in favour of the development of a motorway in the County Meath region. We can find a solution to this problem, but the Government needs to bring everybody together to find it.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I second the amendment moved by Senator Dooley. I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, to the House for this important debate and I await his comments.Senator Paddy Burke spoke about the possibility of developing a railway line between Navan and Dublin. There was some good news for the County Meath area when the Book of Estimates was published last week. The provision of €60 million over the next three years for the construction of a railway station in the docklands of Dublin will facilitate the development of a railway line part of the way to Navan, from the existing line at Clonsilla to Clonee and Dunboyne. Iarnród Éireann plans to develop a major park and ride facility at Pace, on the road to Navan just inside County Meath near the border with Dublin. The facility will take a great deal of traffic off the road.It is clear to those of us who attended the committee meeting last week at which the NRA representatives spoke on the M50 upgrade that we are building a great many roads. With the recently opened bypasses at Monasterevin and Cashel, one can almost traverse the country on dual carriageway or motorway. Essentially that simply gets the traffic into Dublin faster. When one enters the city now, one must pass a modern version of a medieval gate called the M50, with interchanges. I have described it as such because it is essentially a ring around Dublin through which cars must pass and where there is congestion every day, if not every hour. It is patently obvious that we are not increasing road space within the M50. We must seriously consider why we are getting traffic into Dublin faster and over the M50 by means of a major upgrade if that traffic has nowhere to go.That brings me to rail. I beseech the Minister to bring to his colleagues my concern that further massive investment must be put into the railways as a way of achieving a modal shift from cars. We have spoken of it now for close to a decade, since the Dublin transportation initiative, or DTI, was initially established, setting out its parameters for how traffic would be taken from the roads and people would choose public transport. The only way that it can happen is if we have a seismic shift in our attempts to address the issue. When one looks at the amounts being spent on roads, one sees they are vast and they will continue to be so over the next five years. That will lead to what Senator Dooley calls balanced regional development and assist the regions.Those concerns must be addressed and I hope that will happen. I have made known the concerns of those who have been writing to me regarding the Hill of Tara. Regrettably, one must accept the present position. When one examines the proposed scheme of 49 km from Clonee to Kells, one sees that one must also ask what is the realistic alternative. Some Senators opposite have suggested removing 3 km to 5 km around the Hill of Tara. Obviously, no matter where one goes in that entire area, there will be archaeological remains, and I hope those remains will be studied, researched and recorded. Ultimately, we cannot keep on conducting reviews. The scheme has been on the cards for five or six years and has been in all the studies regarding what was going through. There has been extensive public consultation. One might say that, if one were starting again, one would not start from here, but the consultation process is over, and the submissions have been made. The preferred route has been altered. If we were to set about choosing an alternative route at this stage, the precedent that it would set, the delays that might mount up and the great associated costs would have to be taken into account.The road is obviously being built to deal with the substantial volumes of traffic on that entry corridor. I live in the Dublin West constituency, which is the gateway to that entire area. Navan, Dunshaughlin and all the towns further out have been developed at a phenomenal rate over the past five years. The congestion that it has caused in those villages and towns must be addressed, and that is what the M3 motorway seeks to do. As I say, I have no doubt that the Minister will address the comments made by Senators this evening and if for no reason other than this, I welcome this debate.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I should not be here tonight, and we should not be debating this motion. We should have learned from the past 40 years that public concern is a remarkably effective way of finding out what one might be well advised to avoid. I was a young person still at school when the ESB decided to knock down a large part of Fitzwilliam Street's Georgian heritage. I was an obstreperous student in college when attempts were made to destroy a large part of Hume Street's Georgian heritage; since then I have changed only my occupation, not the adjective that describes me. Attempts were made to do other things, many of which succeeded, and on every occasion, history and dispassionate analysis have shown that the objectors were right. It was a desecration of Dublin to destroy a large element of its Georgian heritage.We have now reached the next stage. A road is desperately needed. The problem has been that for 30 years in this country the philosophy of the Department of Finance regarding infrastructure has always been that it should follow markets rather than create them. It is a fundamental philosophical difference between people such as me and those in the Department of Finance that I feel that we should use infrastructure to cause and channel development rather than wait for the development and then build infrastructure. We should have done this five, ten or 20 years ago. I have followed most of this debate either in the House or in my office. Let us not get involved in a spurious argument that somehow there is some objection over here to the construction of an efficient road network in this country. On this side of the House we have the same concerns as public opinion, namely, that the desperate rush to catch up with the mess made of our infrastructure will result in an act of archaeological vandalism.The arguments on the choice of routes have been well rehearsed, having been made by several speakers in this House. It is undoubtedly true that no one has produced a convincing reason for this route to have been chosen ahead of an alternative route that on every environmental and heritage indicator was better. We have all had the opportunity to read the indicators, all of which suggested a different route for the sake of visual amenity and archaeological heritage. The argument has moved on. The first ignorant — I use the word in the sense of being without knowledge — response from the National Roads Authority was that the new road was further from the Hill of Tara than the existing one. Such was the level of intellectual debate with which the NRA began. Even were that argument sufficient to justify a second act of vandalism, if the area were one of precious heritage, it would have been obscene to make it simply because we did something wrong 100 years ago. Road construction at that time was less intrusive and destructive and the roads were much smaller.This project involves a major motorway with floodlit intersections and so on. The issue underlying the debate means that somebody like me, who lives approximately 170 miles away, feels obliged to intervene. The issue does not relate to roads and it is a pity the amendment has been tabled because it ducks the issues. One could always conclude the reason for ducking the issue is because the Government is uncomfortable about it and, therefore, wants to discuss something else.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	160	All of us support the construction of motorways. A number of people in the Dublin-based element of the Green Party may not want a good road network but many Members and I have discussed this issue formally and informally. The country desperately needs a good transport infrastructure but desperate need does not justify short-term and destructive decisions. The NRA's response that the new road was further away from Tara than the old road suggested an indifference to what it was doing that bordered on negligence.Many Members have received correspondence but, at the risk of mortally embarrassing him, I refer to a letter I received from a former Member of the House, who is the most eminent archaeologist in the State. He stated:I would like to say that the proposed route of the motorway is not on the line of the present public road but going through virgin territory. There is archaeological and historical evidence to show that the area is part of the Tara complex, that is, more than a portion of the summit of the hill. Apart from actual monuments, there is also the problem of the integrity of the landscape and of the Tara environment. To put a huge motorway through this sensitive and culturally rich area would be totally wrong.The archaeologists employed by the NRA were probably trained by the author of the letter, Professor George Eogan, and they learned what they know from him, yet they have suddenly come to a different conclusion because their employers have so dictated.This is about common sense not hyper-sensitive environmentalists. Common sense was ignored when the Kildare bypass was proposed. An appeal was made to the European Commission at enormous cost in terms of time and expenditure because it found that the State had not followed proper procedures. Given that the consensus among domestic and international archaeologists is that the proposed road through Tara is an affront to our heritage, the State is inviting submissions to the Commission, which will inevitably result in delays and, ultimately, a significant cost to the Exchequer.The central issue is about whether the project will be delayed and, ultimately, changed following external intervention or whether we will cop on to ourselves and change the three or four miles involved and avoid doing something which will make us look petty and extraordinarily limited in the eyes of the world. We must be extremely careful. There is no inherent conflict between development and heritage. It is possible to engage in both provided the will is there to address both. However, when somebody in a senior position of influence decides a short cut is the quick and cheap cut, we end up in the current position.A series of questions must be asked about why that is the case. What motivated the NRA to switch from the preferred route environmentally, archaeologically and heritage wise? What motivated the authority to display a level of ignorance about what it was doing that suggests it never thought about it? The authority began by referring to how far the road would be from the hill, which suggested the officials had no idea of where they were. This is sacred territory, as it contains thousands of years of this country's heritage. Some people in Fianna Fáil might be influenced because a road was built by previous colonisers but that should have nothing to do with this debate. We have the knowledge, resources and awareness to realise that building a road there is an affront to our heritage. We have the time to change the proposal and if we do not decide to do so, our minds will be changed for us by people outside the State. That would be the ultimate and unpleasant irony whereby we would be coerced to defend our heritage by the European Commission.

I will first deal with the transport issues. The N3 is congested and a road to Navan, built to at least motorway standard, is needed, although a legitimate question has been raised, which can also be raised about all motorways, which is what happens when one reaches the M50. We all know that one spends at least three quarters of an hour getting to one's destination.Senator Paddy Burke is not accurate about the N1, N2 and N3. If one is travelling across the Border, one is supposed to travel along the M1 before taking the Ardee turn off. One uses the M1 between Drogheda and Dundalk so that one does not travel on the N2.I fully agree with the comments about rail but there is a rail line between Drogheda and Navan, which is used by Tara mines. It would cost between €15 million and €20 million to relay the line and provide a station. The strategic rail review recommended a line to serve Navan but that will take the best part of a generation the way things proceed and a line to Clonee will only bring one so far. I am always frustrated by transport debates in that where we have infrastructure, we do not propose to use it and, instead, we prefer to speculate about vast engineering schemes, which might, if we are lucky, be completed in 15 or 20 years instead of doing simple, relatively inexpensive jobs, which help to solve the problem.

They decided that with an investment of a few hundred thousand pounds, the line could be re-opened. Let us make maximum use of the existing infrastructure. However, I am realistic enough to know rail will not solve the problem.I refer to the archaeological issues. We have an awful tendency to examine everything in Manichean terms, black or white. We have had a number of these debates, which have been of varying merit. The fuss about the Glen of the Downs did not have much merit. The glen looks beautiful where the road passes through it. Trees are an eminently renewable resource and a great deal of fuss was created by people who were, in the main, ideologically opposed to roads. The Carrickmines issue also did not have great merit and even The Irish Times at the end published an editorial saying enough is enough.I differ from Senator Ryan regarding the Kildare bypass. How do these rare snails stand now that the motorway has been built? It is impossible to eradicate snails no matter how hard one tries. Despite the involvement of the European Commission, I am sceptical about the merit of that argument.To come to the issue of Tara and the N3-M3, while this is something on which the Minister must make a decision it is an issue about which we must be careful. We have a paradox in that the National Roads Authority — and Members may think this unsuitable — is practically the largest environmental patron in the country. It is the second biggest planter of trees after Coillte. It must also employ far more archaeologists than all the universities in the State put together.Development leads to archaeological knowledge. For example, we are told that Woodstown in County Waterford is the most important Viking site, apart from Wood Quay. If the road had not been planned there, would it ever have been discovered? Let us say for the sake of argument that there are 27 sites along the M3 route. If they were investigated at the ordinary pace of archaeological investigations where there is no development involved, the process would take 1,000 years. Perhaps there is an argument that these sites should be left for future generations. However, the alternative is that development provides us with the opportunity to investigate something that is probably not absolutely central.The problem for Government and the NRA arises if they find something that is of unusual significance or something of which we do not already have several examples. We cannot know this until the route is investigated. If something of that nature is found, it creates a serious dilemma for the Government and the NRA. They need to consider the matter carefully. I do not have the expert knowledge to make such decisions, but they do or should have. They can also get advice from the Heritage Council and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The question is what are the comparative risks of varying the route, accepting that this may involve some extra costs and investigations, as against proceeding regardless and facing the risk of coming across something of major importance which cannot simply be investigated and then tarred over. There is also the possibility, as Senator Ryan mentioned, that people outside the country will become interested in the matter.This is a difficult decision that can only be made with full knowledge and consideration of the facts. A cavalier decision on either side should not be taken. This is one of the most important decisions the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will have to take. I urge him to take extreme care and caution in making it.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy Callely, to the House and compliment him on his approach to his new portfolio. Senators appreciate that he has informed us of the areas for which he holds responsibility. I do not intend to put Senator Mansergh on stilts and provide him with an overview of the countryside from Ardee to Dundalk, Navan and Cavan. He covered those areas rather than the Hill of Tara.I support this important motion. While recognising the importance of the proposed motorway, nowhere could our archaeological heritage be more at risk than at the Hill of Tara which is threatened by the demands of progress. The people recognise the necessity of developing an adequate road infrastructure despite the undisputed heritage value of the area. If this project goes ahead, the conflict between the past and the future will result in the certain destruction of at least 25 known sites in the place of kings, saints and scholars. Tara is a place of magic steeped in history. It is a well recognised centre of Celtic identity of which we are proud. Leaders from all over the world have been brought to view artefacts from the site. We are proud to show off our heritage in legend and culture in the area."Tara is, because of its associations, probably the most consecrated spot in Ireland, and its destruction will leave many bitter memories behind it." Thus spoke Douglas Hyde, George Moore and William Butler Yeats as reported in The Times in 1902. Nobody has a greater understanding of our magical heritage than W.B. Yeats whose writings give voice to our cultural heritage in all its facets. Now, 102 years later the fate of Tara again hangs in the balance. The threat then was of British Jews digging up the hill in search of the Ark of the Covenant, but this has been replaced by the far more destructive threat of the National Roads Authority.The NRA has been accused of reducing the seriousness of the issue in its claims that Tara is confined to a cluster of monuments on top of the hill. Nothing could be further from the truth. Nothing, in particular a road, should be allowed anywhere near Tara. This should not, however, take from the commitment of the NRA to develop roads while spending money on archaeology. The people, in particular those who live in County Meath, want and need the proposed motorway, but not at the expense of the destruction of Tara. We all recognise this. Senator O'Toole and I spoke to people in the area, to the farming community and the people of County Meath on this issue. They all favour development, but not the destruction of Tara.It is hoped the ongoing discussions between the Department of Transport and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will produce an acceptable solution to this impasse. It is important they do and that this meeting takes place urgently. All bodies should be brought in on the discussions in a consultative role. We should have a select committee in place to deal with the issues of archaeological sites and developments that we can expect to come on stream. We need something in place to deal with this area.Last July during the debate on the rushed National Monuments (Amendment) Bill 2004 I said that the clash between the present and past had never been greater. I pointed out that the drive to create and expand our horizons was aided and abetted by our increasing knowledge and technical advances. I indicated that the destruction of the primary source of our history was inexcusable in our headlong rush towards so-called progress. I pointed out that the Bill gave the guardianship of our past exclusively to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. It placed a heavy responsibility on both the Minister and the Government.Tonight's motion asks the Minister for Transport to intervene in co-operation with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to find the most suitable route for this important motorway. Experts have advised the Department that the P route would be the best in this case. The Labour Party has argued that the site at Tara is littered with archaeological monuments. There is no disputing the fact that we cannot damage the culture and history of this 5,000 year old site which is of significant importance in terms of tourism.The Fine Gael Party believes that development and archaeology can go hand in hand. The nub of the argument is whether we should preserve the monuments in situ or record them. The latter will be at the core of Fine Gael’s policy. The road is essential and must be built. Archaeological sites must be preserved in situ wherever possible and where that is not the case artefacts should be brought to museums and preserved.The route chosen should have the least possible impact on surrounding archaeological sites. However, we should not be in any doubt that urgent road works need to commence in some areas. The original road capacity envisaged for the M3 was approximately 11,600 cars per day but the number of cars today is in the region of 21,700 and this is set to rise next year to 36,600. If the road cannot cope with the current volume of traffic it will not be able to do so in ten years. Fine Gael believes work must commence on this new road as a matter of urgency.On several previous occasions I highlighted the development of the N55, the main route from Belfast through Armagh, Monaghan, Clones, Cavan, Granard, Ballymahon, Edgeworthstown and on to Athlone. This is an important route which, if developed, would draw a significant amount of congestion away from the east coast. This option should be examined even at this late stage. I would appreciate if the Minister would consider upgrading the road from national secondary status to national primary status. We need a main artery through the midlands. I have been promoting this matter for some time and I would appreciate if the Minister of State would take this matter on board. I do not dispute the fact that we need an M3 but we do not need it on the Hill of Tara.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	167	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, to the House and congratulate him on his appointment and the fine work he is doing. He is most committed to transport issues.We are all agreed on the need for an adequate roads infrastructure. I agree with what Senator Mansergh said regarding taking a balanced approach. He advised that we should not take a cavalier approach to road development. I have had many arguments with the NRA through the years but I accept it is very concerned about the environment and the preservation of archaeological sites and features. Our amendment acknowledges this in stating this is evident in the discovery of so many previously unrecorded areas of historical and archaeological importance.I support rail transport and agree with Senator Mansergh that we should preserve existing infrastructure. Contact with the NRA and the Minister is most important at a time when many new roads are being developed throughout the country. Oireachtas Members from County Galway meet the NRA at least once a year to discuss road development in the county. What is happening in County Galway is a very good example of what should be happening in other parts of the country where several options are given in regard to proposed road developments. For example, there were at least three or four options for the Loughrea bypass, which has now commenced, and the same is true of the Tuam bypass. Three options were also available for the proposed new road from Tuam to Galway city.I referred to this road on the Order of Business and Senator O'Toole mentioned it in regard to the Estimates. I said it would take six months to develop a rail link but it might take six years to get a new road. I stand by that comment. That is the view of the lobby group, West on Track, and the inter-county committee composed of the five Connacht counties that strongly support a rail link. I look forward to an opportunity to discuss the development of rail, which would have the strong support of the Seanad. Senator Henry referred to this matter also in regard to road development.The National Roads Authority is most stringent when it comes to the environment and archaeological remains. Some speakers referred to snails during the debate. The sea water baths in Ardrahan on the Gort to Oranmore road were to be protected and I hope this will be the case. There are a number of options for the development of this road and I hope there will not be any threat to the preservation of these baths.When the former Deputy, Padraig Flynn, was Minister for the Environment he promoted the bypassing of towns such as Lucan and Kilcock and people in the west queried the value of spending so much money on the east coast. He made the point that it would also benefit people in the west to have such towns bypassed. I welcome the bypassing of towns and the development of roads in the western region that is now taking place.In putting forward the transport package in the Estimates, the Minister stated it would benefit jobs in the regions, commuters and business, which is an important issue. He went on to say the Government is building roads because they protect and grow job opportunities and community life throughout the country. Over €1.3 billion will be invested in roads in 2005 alone. It is clear that the development of roads in conjunction with the NRA is important to the Government. I hope it will continue this policy in a careful way, not in a cavalier manner.In speaking of the new road from Galway to Dublin, it was said that the shortest way from Galway to Athlone was through a great deal of bog, which is true. It would take up to half an hour off the journey time spent going through Loughrea and Ballinasloe. It could have been of benefit to people in north Galway but the belief is that one should build roads so that they would pass near major towns, in this case Athenry, Loughrea and Ballinasloe. We would not like to see short cuts being developed. One has to take the development of these towns into consideration because of the job opportunities that go with that, as the Minister stated in the context of the Book of Estimates.Despite criticism I have made of the NRA, I believe it is taking into consideration issues of archaeology and the historical importance of sites and I hope this will continue to be the case. I also hope we can meet regularly with the NRA. The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has had regular meetings with the NRA which I welcome. I listened to some of the debate at today's meeting of the committee. The Chairman referred to visiting the area under discussion. This would be an important mission for the committee as its members are not all familiar with the details of the area. It was proposed in the Estimates that money would be spent on this road next year. There is an opportunity for the committee to examine the situation and ensure it proceeds in a careful manner.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	168	There is a lovely little village in County Cork called Glanworth. I have visited my brother's house there but have never had time to walk around the village until recently. It is located on the River Funcheon, across which there is a beautiful 11 arch bridge, which is one of Europe's oldest and longest. The bridge has been treated in an extraordinary manner for many years. It was used by very heavy traffic, as with the bridge at Slane, until one day two 40 tonne trucks faced one another in the centre of the bridge and neither would back down. The locals decided to take the law into their own hands and decided that no more would these vehicles cross their bridge. They put traffic lights and height barriers in place so that this could not happen again. The local people had a sense of value of their heritage.The village is delightful. There is a castle on a rock above the bridge, a mill with a functioning water wheel and an ancient abbey built by the Dominicans in 1475 — not a very good time to build abbeys — which was supported by the Norman Roche family from the area. There is also an ancient graveyard and a castle which was built by the Condrons before even the arrival of the Normans. There is a great deal of history and even romance; an heiress called Amy Fleming was about to be abducted with her fortune from the castle by some rogues but, fortunately, another gang called the Nagles rescued her, telling her they would mind her and her fortune.Members probably think all this information was gleaned from splendid notices all over the village. However, there is not a word stating anything about the place except the usual "fógra" which informs one that the Office of Public Works is in charge and that if anything happens to one, one cannot sue the OPW or the Minister. It is thanks to the restaurant in Glanworth Mill that I gathered all the information that day. I sometimes feel many things happen in this country because we do not understand what we have around us until it is under threat.When widening roads was all the rage, there was talk about doing something about the bridge in Glanworth so that it would be more convenient for the 40 tonne trucks to travel across. Someone tried to blow up the bridge during the Civil War but it mercifully withstood the blast as well as hundreds of years of traffic before and since. The Fermoy bypass was built but, because there will be a toll on it, the town will still attract traffic — perhaps over my little bridge.Too many people knew about Tara for what is proposed there to be taken on the nod. I am delighted that Senator O'Toole tabled this motion tonight because, when one examines what has already been destroyed in various parts of Ireland, it is unthinkable to allow this area to be destroyed too. I was in a town called Bolgheri on the west coast of Italy when a motorway was being built linking Rome with Geneva. There is a line of fairly slow-growing cypress trees outside the town that are the subject of a poem by Giosuè Carducci, which is learned by every school child in Italy. Therefore, there was no question of the trees being touched, which meant the motorway had to loop around the avenue of cypresses.In Tara we have, as Senator O'Toole has rightly described it, a place of kings, saints and scholars — steeped as it is in our history, culture, mythology and legend — being attacked by a road which can be built elsewhere without a great deal of difficulty. Sometimes the simplest of solutions seems to be dismissed as quite impossible. When we discussed Carrickmines Castle, I suggested that a flyover be built. It could have gone over the site quite easily as only two roads needed to be connected on either side of the castle area. However, this was considered impossible because it is all the go nowadays to build roundabouts.I suggest that when we come to areas of such importance as Tara, our imagination must come before what is practical. In that context, we need only consider what happened at Wood Quay. When I visited York to see the Viking settlement, I thought I would see something incredible when all I saw was two sorts of basements, on which one could not walk but rather travel around on a little train. At that time, I remembered what we had where the civic offices are now — fine as they are. I was in Cologne when workers building an enormous development found ancient mosaics right beside the cathedral. However, there was no question of their being disturbed. A splendid development has been built but one can still look down onto the mosaics through the glass in the museum which has been built.I was in Verona when the Porta dei Leoni was rediscovered. Once again, it was imaginatively dealt with so that one could see the mosaics underneath and alternative arrangements were made to avoid the important site. We have such knowledge about our own heritage areas. I am quite sure that Senator Mansergh did not mean to suggest that if we just found such sites by good luck rather than by ancient knowledge, we should do nothing about them. Rather, if we find such sites by good luck, as was the case in Cologne when war reparations were still being made in the 1960s and in Verona, when sewerage works were being undertaken, one must treasure what is found. Whatever good fortune we have had to find artefacts in excavations south of Tara, we should consider the alternative routes which have been suggested.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	169	I welcome the Minister of State to the House as well as the opportunity to debate this issue. We have had numerous presentations and discussions on this issue before the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government. I agree with Senator O'Toole that this is as much an issue for the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government as it is for the Department of Transport.It is worth examining what we are doing here. For many years we did not have the resources to develop our road infrastructure. We were caught in a catch-22, whereby there was no development and therefore no progress. We felt that the only way we could attract major indigenous companies and those from abroad was to provide a top class road network throughout the country and link the main cities. The benefit of this was not just to the cities but for every town and village adjacent to these routes and the results are there for us all to see. The improvement in our main access routes — north, south, east and west — has provided opportunities to develop major high-yield, value-added industries throughout the country. The proposed spatial strategy enhances the progress made to date.My own experience of road developments is the M1 motorway to the North. No one can state that development has not improved conditions for everyone, not just for motorists but for business people too. There has been a massive increase in the number of cars, trucks and vans coming from north of the Border. It has improved conditions for people living along the route too and has made a huge difference to the lives of people living in Drogheda. We all remember the controversy surrounding the M1- there were swans in the estuary and ferns to be conserved. However, these issues were handled sensitively in an environmentally sustainable manner and I am glad to report to the House that the swan population on the estuary has doubled since the motorway opened. That is just one of the benefits. It was a PPP project and, in fairness to all concerned, every measure was taken to minimise interference with the environment.I congratulate the developers on the spectacular bridge across the Boyne just past Drogheda, which has now become an attraction. Again, significant controversy surrounded the project at the time. It was handled properly. There was extensive consultation with all concerned parties and the result was a state of the art major road network running from the North to the South. It has improved life for all concerned.There have been other examples over the years of developments not taking account of the environment. It is not so long ago that archaeology was not even considered when developments were proposed. I shudder to think of the amount of archaeological information and substance which has gone missing over the years purely because the structures did not exist to protect them. It is only relatively recently that legislation and regulations have been introduced in this area. Thankfully, significant strides have been made in the precautions and measures which are taken now to investigate and preserve any items or sites which are of archaeological or historical importance.The Carrickmines development was mentioned. It is relevant to this debate because that situation shows that when something goes wrong, it goes badly wrong. It was a proposed two year project but it took seven years. A total of 130 archaeologists were required, the cost of archaeological investigations was more than €6 million and, in the end, 90% of the site was preserved.We must be realistic, particularly about Tara-Skryne. The Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government has heard a number of interesting presentations but the decisions surrounding this route have not been taken overnight. There have been three years of discussion, consultations and environmental impact statements. The An Bord Pleanála oral hearings, which took 28 days, were the longest ever for a development such as this. Every factor has been taken into account.The new Chairman of the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government has suggested that the committee members visit the site and speak to the concerned parties. I welcome that proposal. It will give us an opportunity to see what is happening there and to talk to all involved.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	172	This week an inquiry is taking place into the construction of a new toll road between Ballinasloe and Galway city. Practically all the proposed new routes and those which have been constructed have involved some interference with an archaeological site. I support the motion. In this instance, I cannot understand why the NRA, through its consultants, does not carry out its ground work before proposing a new route.The selection procedure followed by the NRA is extremely dubious. In most instances, it proposes to consult with the landowners and all other interested bodies as to which is the most appropriate route to be chosen. Invariably, however, the process results in the selection of the route initially proposed by the NRA as the preferred route. I believe that behind all this the interests of the developers of these roads are a priority and everything else fits into place in choosing the route.In the case of this route, I cannot understand why the NRA and the consultants who designed the road, knowing what they know now, cannot move it slightly. I happened to see the records regarding the selection of a route in Galway. There were four options for the road. I attended public meetings in various places in support of or against a particular route. I saw a Minister of State claim to support the cause of those who wanted the route moved northwards. On the following night, however, he attended another meeting of bodies interested in having the route moved southwards. He indicated to all and sundry on one night that he had made representations to have it moved northwards and, on the next night, to have it moved southwards.However, according to the file of the NRA he had issued a directive that the road take a particular route, which was neither of the two routes I mentioned. If that is what is happening, when the NRA is supposedly not responsible to anybody in the Houses except directly to the Minister, what or whose interests are the developers usually following? Something needs to be done about the finalisation of the process. Somebody must take this in hand and stop the rot we see at present.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	178	We will compromise on that. This is a site of world importance. When Senator Kitt spoke about the shortest way from Galway to Dublin, I thought of James Joyce saying the shortest way to Tara is via Holyhead. It soon will be — we will have to go to England to look at photographs of it. It is extraordinary. It is as if the Egyptian Government decided to put a tramline through the Valley of the Kings.It was interesting to listen to Members' contributions. Senator Mansergh made a balanced contribution and indicated disquiet on the Government side. Senator Maurice Hayes, who was nominated to the House by the Government, wrote a superb article in one of the Sunday newspapers outlining the difficulties. Professor Eogan, who is perhaps the most distinguished archaeologist and certainly the greatest authority in this country on this area, has indicated his concern.We do not oppose motorways. That is a myth. We also do not oppose infrastructure. In fact, virtually all the road can be built with the exception of a three mile stretch from Ross Cross to Carlow Cross. Why not first build the two ends of the road, which will give time to investigate and produce an alternative route? That can be done.What is involved is not just a couple of pinpoints on top of a hill or a burial mound but the entire archaeological complex. This has been recognised under legislation dating from the 1980s which deals with the nomination of archaeological sites. Under the discovery programme, the idea that Tara does not begin and end with monuments on the hill in State ownership is recognised by the fact that throughout the 1980s and 1990s the zone of archaeological protection marked in the SMR maps described a slightly greater area than that on the top of the hill. In 1997, Dúchas redefined the archaeological zone as an ellipse some 6 km in diameter around the hill of Tara. The area is already defined as an area of major archaeological importance.There is no doubt that the crown of the hill is a burial ground. There is an impressive concentration of monuments there that are clearly visible. There is, however, also an entire complex, only some of which has been located. The remainder lies waiting to be discovered.I wish to deal now with the identification of the route. The NRA considered various routes and there is no question that it decided upon what is called route P as the most favoured on a number of grounds including archaeology, built heritage, flora, fauna and habitats, water quality, landscape and visual effects, air quality and noise levels. In no category whatever does it recommend the route the NRA has chosen. That is astonishing. Some of this information was diluted in the environmental impact survey and led to a letter being written to  The Irish Times by a distinguished archaeologist which states An Bord Pleanála bears some responsibility in for this fiasco because “Its weak-kneed, unquestioning acceptance of whatever road plans are put before it shows that it is simply the Government’s rubber-stamping department.”This is a serious matter. The place in question has been celebrated by poets from Yeats back to the court bard of Maoilseachlainn in the tenth century. One side of my family has old Gaelic roots and I am astonished that a Fianna Fáil Government would consider desecrating what is surely the most sacred site in Irish history.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I hope it will not damage the Minister of State's metronome irreparably to discover that I support the motion and oppose the amendment. I had hoped that the motion would be taken on its merits but the amendment invites us to consider and either endorse or condemn a range of motorway issues.I have enormous regard for the work done by the NRA. It has done wonderful work — including the putting in place of a beautiful bridge — on the road to Belfast and I wish its counterpart on the other side of the Border was half as good. I pay tribute to it for that. However, that does not mean that we should canonise it for everything it does. Previous speakers referred to the need to move people through County Meath and to help them to commute. In that context, I hope the option of putting in place some form of rail transport will be considered. The one thing one learns about road construction is that regardless of one's plans, the road one is building will be almost overloaded by the time it is completed. This leads people to seek alternative routes. Roads produce traffic which leads to further roads and traffic and alternatives must be found.Senator Morrissey inquired about what would happen when the various roads reached their destinations in Dublin. It takes me longer to travel from Dublin Airport to the Houses than it does for me to drive from home to the airport.Another difficulty I have with the amendment is that it removes the focus from Tara and the more general matter about which we are concerned. One of the problems is that, as regards the route chosen, there appears to be an assumption that if Tara and Skryne can be saved then we can drive a road between them. This ignores the integrity of the existing archaeological environment.A second problem relates to trial digs. If it was not such a bad metaphor, I would say to the Minister of State that if he is in a hole he should stop digging. Trial digs are fine to an extent but they rarely work well under pressure. Nobody has indicated what will happen if there is a major find. What would be the position if the type of mosaics to which Senator Henry referred or another Newgrange were discovered? Is it not the case that, in such circumstances, those involved would be really up against it? In my view, it is better to face these challenges early on rather than be obliged to deal with them later.There appears to be an attraction in terms of having everything dealt with in this area in the form of a single PPP. I am not opposed to PPPs, which are a great utility in ways. In this instance, however, we must consider what would be the cost of delays. Let us consider whether, for example, a different equation might emerge if the cost and agony of undergoing appeals, protests, etc, was weighed against constructing an additional mile or two of motorway.The crucial point relates to the integrity of the landscape around Tara. When people of the eminence of Professor Eogan and all the country's major archaeologists and scholars of this era are opposed to a particular line of policy, it is worthwhile stopping to review the situation, reconsider the options and test the information one has been given. Perhaps the Minister of State might consider what Thomas Davis said in 1845 about people running a road towards Tara.
#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I listened with interest to the contributions of Members and I thank them for their comments. It is evident that people feel passionately about this matter. I ask Members to listen to what I have to say because I believe I can respond, adequately and positively, in respect of the issues of concern.The motion provides a welcome opportunity to debate an important issue, namely, the upgrading of the national roads network and its impact on our archaeological heritage. I wish to state clearly the Government's commitment to the objectives of upgrading our transport infrastructure and protecting our environmental and archaeological heritage. The identification and minimisation of impacts on our environmental and archaeological heritage is at the centre of the NRA's guidelines on project management. More particularly, the approach to archaeological issues is set out in the code of practice on archaeology for the national roads programme agreed in 2000 by the NRA and the then Department of Arts, Heritage, Gaeltacht and the Islands. This code of practice sets out a comprehensive and transparent approach for the treatment of archaeology on national road projects. It has provided a framework for dealing with archaeological sites and features in accordance with best practice.Before dealing with the Clonee-Kells project, it would be useful to set it in the context of the national roads programme generally. Investment in our roads network is critical for the ongoing development of the economy, the facilitation of regional development, the provision of safer roads and shorter and more reliable travel times and the enhancement of our quality of life. For these reasons, the Government prioritised investment in national roads as part of the national development plan. Investment during the period 2000-04 will amount to approximately €5 billion.The results of this investment are clearly evident, with bottlenecks throughout the country being removed. Major projects completed include the M1, Dublin to Dundalk; bypasses of Kildare, Monasterevin and Cashel; the N7, Limerick southern ring road — phase 1; the N22, Ballincollig bypass; and the N11, Ashford-Rathnew road, to name but a few. Work continues on many other projects including the Fermoy, Ennis, Loughrea, Mullingar, Cavan, Ballyshannon-Bundoran and Kinnegad-Enfield bypasses; the Sligo inner relief road; the Dublin Port tunnel; and the south-eastern motorway, which will complete the M50 from the M1 to the M11. Planning is under way on projects such as the widening of the M50 and provision of freeflow interchanges, the Waterford city bypass, the Kinnegad-Athlone road and so on. Since the start of the NDP in 2000, 46 projects have been completed, 20 are currently under construction, nine are at tender stage and a further 12 are either through the statutory process or before An Bord Pleanála. A major transformation of our national road network is under way and it is about time.The upgrade of the N3 is an important part of the national roads upgrade programme. The Clonee — north of Kells — motorway is a much needed project, consistent with both the national development plan and the national spatial strategy. It is a vital item of infrastructure which will contribute to the ongoing success of the local and regional economy, bring about better balanced regional development, improve safety and improve access to and from Dublin, the ports and the airport. In addition, this project will transform the quality of life for those people living in Dunboyne, Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells. It will result in reductions of through traffic of 75% in Dunshaughlin, 78% in Navan and 90% in Kells. It will also benefit everyone living along the existing N3 by removing most of the through traffic and associated congestion which currently affects their lives on a daily basis. The existing road is not coping with the traffic volumes using the route and the situation will only become worse given the planned development in County Meath and further afield.I am fully aware of the rich archaeological landscape in County Meath, the importance of the Hill of Tara and its significance to our national heritage. Both Meath County Council and the National Roads Authority are also aware of the special place that the Hill of Tara holds in the national consciousness and of their responsibilities to protect it and the cultural heritage of County Meath. Listening to some of the contributors to the debate, one might form the impression that no proper consideration has been given to this M3 proposal but nothing could be further from the truth. I welcome the opportunity to clarify the position which may assist people in making up their own minds about it.A great deal of time, expertise and expense has been expended in developing the M3 motorway scheme through the planning process. Every effort has been made to mitigate the impact of the proposed road through the landscape surrounding the Hill of Tara. On the question of the proximity of the motorway to the Hill of Tara, I wish to emphasise that the proposed road passes between the Hill of Skryne to the east and the Hill of Tara to the west. The route was carefully chosen so as to avoid the important core zone around Tara, which has national monument status. The chosen route lies 1.5 km to the east of the limit of the record of monuments designated area and east of the existing N3 road. The motorway as it passes through the Tara-Skryne valley will be a greater distance from the Hill of Tara than the existing N3 Dublin-Navan Road. The scheme has been designed to minimise physical and visual impacts on the archaeological landscape around Tara.Great care was taken by Meath County Council and the NRA to avoid any previously recorded or upstanding monuments when planning the route of the M3 project. Statements that the selected route was "the only route that was considered by the NRA" are incorrect. A total of ten route options in four broad corridors were examined as part of the route selection study for the Dunshaughlin-Navan section of the scheme which involves the Tara area. Project planning and assessment of route options were carried out over a period of more than three years. The impact on archaeology, as well as implications for other aspects of the environment, effects on people and their homes, the extent to which farms would be severed, together with traffic, engineering and cost considerations were taken into account in evaluating the ten route options in the Tara area. The archaeological consultants engaged by Meath County Council to advise on route selection concluded that the preferred route which emerged from this process was a viable route in terms of archaeology. The preferred route was assessed as best or joint best under 14 of the 13 assessment criteria used as part of the environmental impact evaluation process and accordingly scored higher on environmental grounds than any alternative route.The public consultation process saw 4,000 people attend public meetings. The preferred route was subsequently submitted to An Bord Pleanála for consideration. Following a 28-day oral hearing during which extensive attention was given to archaeology and potential impacts on Tara, the board approved the M3 Clonee-north of Kells road project proposal. In this regard it should be noted that the decision to approve the proposal was, inter alia, based on the board’s conclusion that the motorway scheme“ is necessary to provide adequately for the existing and projected traffic growth and would be in accordance with the proper planning and sustainable development of the area”. The board also concluded that the scheme, “would not have significant adverse effects on the environment.”It may be helpful to Members if I set out in more detail the extent of the archaeological work carried out on the proposed route. I understand from the NRA that in the case of the M3 a test trench was excavated along the centreline of the 59 km length of the route with cross-trenches being dug every 20 metres. This work, as would be expected, has identified a number of previously unknown archaeological sites and features. Reports on the sites concerned have been submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to assist the Minister in determining the most appropriate manner in which to deal with the sites concerned. The reports concerned relate to a total of 38 sites on the 15 km section of the route between Dunshaughlin and Navan.The extent to which new sites have been discovered, approximately 2.5 sites per kilometre, would be similar to the experience on many other schemes throughout the country and in some cases the incidence of sites on the M3 is substantially less than finds on certain other national road schemes. On the M1 route a total of 211 previously unknown archaeological sites were found over a distance of 601 km, an average of 3.5 sites per kilometre. In addition, in the case of the Cashel bypass, which was opened to traffic last month, 100 new sites were located on the 7 km of the bypass, or 14 sites per kilometre. The reports on the new discoveries on the M3 were submitted to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. They identify "burnt spreads" or "ancient cooking places" as the most common site type. Other sites include former burial locations and possible foundations of houses, including five of relatively recent origin. Overall the new discoveries appear to be along expected lines and do not appear to be of unique archaeological value in their own right.The test trenching on the route of the M3 project was carried out by archaeologists who were familiar with the results of the previous surveys undertaken along the route. The purpose of these archaeological investigations is to identify new sites along the route. Those discovered are reported to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and will be dealt with in accordance with the requirements of the Minister. Rather than losing sites, this work is adding to the archaeological record long-forgotten sites that have no visible presence in the landscape.The upgrade of the N3 between Clonee and Kells is an important project for the national roads programme overall. It is important for the towns of Dunshaughlin, Navan and Kells; for access to and within the Border and north midlands regions and for access to and from the north west. It has been planned, designed and approved in accordance with statutory requirements. I understand that every effort has been made to minimise and mitigate the impact of the project on local communities, on the natural heritage and on the archaeological heritage.The Government is firmly committed to ensuring that investment in the national roads programme is planned and implemented in a manner which ensures the protection of our national heritage and archaeological sites and features. The Minister for Transport is committed to ensuring that the NRA works proactively with the national monuments division of the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in ensuring that archaeological issues arising on national roads projects are resolved in accordance with best practice. In recent years the archaeological work carried out under the national roads programme has made a significant contribution to our store of knowledge about our past. The Government wishes to ensure that the national roads investment programme is implemented in a manner which minimises any adverse impact on the environment and, as far as possible, protects our national heritage. I hope this reply has been helpful to the debate.

It is very important that this debate took place. I am deeply dissatisfied and it is not satisfactory that the Government tabled a 31-line amendment to the motion which makes no mention of Tara or its heritage. I am deeply unhappy with the contributions from the Government side of the House because they do not address the issue. What occurred tonight was an attempt to have a debate on the roads infrastructure. As I have stated, I do not have difficulty in giving the Government due credit for what it has done with regard to roads. I am not a member of the Opposition but an Independent and I will offer my views on issues on which I agree and disagree. Similarly, with regard to the rail network, I support Senator Dooley on the need to improve the Galway line and Senator Mansergh on the need to improve the Limerick to Rosslare line, as I supported him in ensuring the railway bridge in Cahir was reconstructed. I assure Senator Dooley that I consulted people in Meath on the issue before us. It may be news to him that I live one field from the Meath border.

While I agree with 90% of what was said by Government Members, the issues they raised were irrelevant and lacked focus. As regards Senator Morrissey's question, as the Minister of State will confirm, I answered it two weeks ago in the House when I pointed out the problems encountered at the point at which the M1, N2 and N3 reach the city limits. The Senator knows as well as I that the proposed solution, namely, to establish park and ride facilities on every motorway or proposed motorway has been ignored by the Government. Its failure to implement the proposal will mean we will continue to have problems. The issue is that simple.

We will know the Government has acted when we see these facilities.I share the concerns expressed regarding the Natterjack toad, the Kerry slug, bats in Ardrahan and so forth and I often visit the Broadmeadow Estuary to watch the swans, which are flourishing. Those are not, however, the issue before us, which is the Hill of Tara and I am concerned that Senators have been afraid to address the matter.The Minister of State informed the House as to what the archaeological reports by Meath County Council lead him to believe while carefully ignoring the proposals made by the route reporting group of the National Roads Authority. These proposals, which I have before me, arrived at a different conclusion. The Minister of State also carefully ignored Ireland's leading expert in this field, Professor George Eogan. I ask the Government to consider these issues.As regards our position on issues, I agree with Senator Mansergh. I had no time for many of the objections which have been raised. I also agree with Senator Dooley's comments in this regard. I stood with the people of County Clare when they wanted an interpretative centre built on the Burren because they were right and their proposal displayed care, sensitivity and precision. Similarly, I support the construction of the Ennis bypass, which was so important to the Senator in his election. I guarantee, however, that if some philistine were to swerve the route of the proposed bypass further east to go through some of the crannógs in his back yard, I would stand with him to stop it proceeding. The people of Meath are asking Senators to take such a stance this evening.I welcome the proposal that the Joint Committee on the Environment and Local Government visit the area and accept Senator Mansergh's suggestion that we examine the matter from both perspectives. When this proposal develops into another Carrickmines and becomes clogged in the courts, as it inevitably will, let us all remember that the reason was because we ignored the issues raised in the House tonight. When, as Senator Maurice Hayes stated, important discoveries are made underground and we are suddenly faced with a dilemma as to what to do with them, the building of this important road, which I support, will be delayed. When that transpires, let us remember that we had the solutions before us tonight but ignored them.The solution is to opt for the alternative proposal produced in the route selection report of the NRA. It caused least problems in terms of archaeology, built heritage, flora and fauna, landscape and visual impact, air quality and noise levels. This option was available but we refused to take it. We are walking away from it because it calls for bravery.

Clause K of the mining lease, as it applies to Mogul of Ireland, is the only legal instrument available to the Department and to the State to require the company to rehabilitate those sites in the Silvermines area for which it is responsible.The sites in question are the cause of major pollution. That is not my opinion; it has been found to be the case by an inter-agency group headed by the Department of Agriculture and Food. It has also been found to be the case by SRK Consultants which reported in 2002. Since then, the Department has engaged in close consultation and negotiation with Mogul of Ireland to come up with a satisfactory plan for the community which would ensure that the sites would be rehabilitated in a sustainable fashion. This plan would have to ensure that dust would no longer blow from 147 acres of tailings pond in the Silvermines area, containing toxic materials including heavy metals. Monitors around the tailings pond show dust with elevated lead levels and other dangerous heavy metals blowing around the Silvermines area.Other sites are causing difficulty such as the old drums on the side of the hill, which were abandoned by the company when mining ceased in the 1980s. The areas known as the Garryard stockpile and the Garryard lagoon have both been identified as highly toxic. None of these have been managed in a satisfactory manner.The Statute of Limitations on clause K runs out next Tuesday, 30 November 2004 and we have a very serious situation on our hands. The latest plan submitted by the company is far from satisfactory. The EPA, the county council, the technical advisers of the Gortmore environmental action group and the SRK consultants have all stated this to be the case. I am concerned that there might be a possibility that the Department will discuss this plan with the company and that the plan might proceed.I call on the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to end this charade with Mogul of Ireland. He must accept that this company will never carry out this rehabilitation in a satisfactory manner or in a manner that has the confidence of the community. I call on him to initiate proceedings against the company for what is clearly a failure to rehabilitate these sites. The company has failed to live up to its responsibility to the local community and has caused a situation where there are a number of polluted sites. It has continued to accept a situation where there are 147 acres in an eroded state causing major pollution in the Silvermines area and causing toxic dust to be blown around the area.I call on the Department to initiate proceedings against Mogul of Ireland and to ensure that this job of rehabilitation is given to some agency that is ready to implement a plan as soon as possible. We know that waste permits and waste licences will be needed and that the whole framework of environmental legislation will have to kick into place before this can happen. There is a major concern about what will happen in the community now that clause K is running out and no satisfactory plan has been developed. Who will ensure that this community can live in a safe and clean environment after so many years of living with pollution?
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	201	I thank the Senator for raising this important issue. The then Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, standing in for my predecessor, covered the subject of the proposed rehabilitation works required at Silvermines in some detail in a previous Adjournment debate on 7 July 2004. Since that date, Mogul of Ireland lodged its revised proposals for rehabilitation of the clause K sites with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. In accordance with an agreed open and consultative approach, these proposals were circulated to all interested parties for comment. Following these consultations, areas of deficiency were identified and these were communicated to Mogul's consultants at a meeting on 23 September. This was followed up more formally with a letter to Mogul dated 27 September setting out the areas for which further clarification was required. Mogul was asked to respond by 29 October. It was impressed strongly on Mogul that it had to respond on time and to comprehensively address the requests in the Department's letter. In the event, the company's response was received by the Department on 3 November.While the latest proposals submitted by Mogul of Ireland are a substantial improvement on those previously submitted they continue to suffer from lack of specification and detail. These deficiencies were pointed out to Mogul at a meeting held in the Department on 19 November and Mogul has to address these issues and revert to the Department with the additional information required within a very short timeframe. As well as continuing concern about the lack of detail in the proposals, there remains a high level of uncertainty that the company has the technical and financial capacity to rehabilitate all of the clause K sites for which they are responsible.The Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is aware that Gortmore action group is not satisfied with the proposals for Gortmore. The Department previously met the group and heard its concerns in Nenagh on 18 October 2004. The Department has offered to meet the group at an early date to ensure that its concerns will be fully reflected in a comprehensive report on a way forward. This report will set out clearly the Department's view on the prospects of the current dialogue with Mogul of Ireland delivering the rehabilitation work to the satisfaction of all concerned. It will contain the Department's judgment on whether the company has access to the considerable resources needed to carry out all of the rehabilitation work required under clause K. The Minister has serious difficulties with any à la carte approach to rehabilitation, whereby sites possibly requiring large financial resources may not be rehabilitated while others are rehabilitated as commercial opportunities may exist.The legal issues raised by the Statute of Limitations have been the subject of discussions between the Department, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and the Office of the Attorney General for some time. Following full consideration of all the issues, including legal advice, documentation which will ensure compliance with the Statute of Limitations, among other matters, will be served this week. The Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, intends to continue the current dialogue with the company, at least until the comprehensive report to which I have referred is given to the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	202	The Minister of State said that "documentation which will ensure compliance with the Statute of Limitations, among other matters, will be served". I understand what he means when he says it "will be served", but how can the continuation of dialogue be said to be a consequence of that? I understand that the serving of documentation creates a kind of cut-off point.
#PatTheCope	unknown-#PatTheCope-party	unknown-#PatTheCope-dob	unknown-#PatTheCope-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	203	That may well be the case. The Department has been advised that it cannot continue to engage in dialogue after the papers have been served. It could be sub judice at that point. It will continue its dialogue until the comprehensive report has been delivered if that is helpful, but it will be guided by its legal advisers when deciding whether to continue. If it can continue I think it should do so because progress can be made when people are speaking to each other. Very little progress can be made if we are not speaking to each other. I will keep the Senator advised in that regard.

#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I thank the Cathaoirleach for allowing me to raise this matter and the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming to the House. I have raised the need for an ambulance base and a primary care unit in Tuam on a number of occasions with the Department of Health and Children and the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. On 31 May last, the former Minister told me in a letter that he understood that the Western Health Board was:. . .developing proposals for the establishment of a number of additional [ambulance] stations in its functional area including the establishment of a station at Tuam. These capital proposals will be considered by my Department in conjunction with the Western Health Board and in the context of capital priorities to be progressed in line with overall funding resources available in 2004 and beyond.The provision of ambulance bases at Tuam, Achill and north Roscommon have been the Western Health Board's main priorities for some time. The full package which was put together by the health board in October 2002 included an ambulance base, a primary care unit, a community hospital to replace the Bon Secours Hospital and child care, respite care and day care units.It is right that the board considered the ambulance service as a priority, but no such service is available in Tuam at present. There are two ambulances in Galway, there is one ambulance in Loughrea and one ambulance is on call from Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe. The lack of an ambulance based in Tuam is an important issue in north Galway, south Mayo and west Roscommon. There is a fine health campus in the town, on a seven acre site that the health board bought from the Bon Secours order. I give credit to the former Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, who allocated funds for the health campus. Two years on, however, I would like to see some development on the campus.I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, for coming to speak on this matter. He knows the relevant area of north Galway and west Roscommon well because his late father represented it in the Dáil. I assure him that this issue is of major concern. The people of the Tuam area want some part of the health campus to be developed. I hope the Minister of State can give me some information about developments in that regard.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	206	I am glad Senator Kitt has raised this matter on the Adjournment. I am aware of his constant interest in the improvement of ambulance and medical services in Tuam and the surrounding area.The Western Health Board's emergency and patient transport ambulance service provides a service to over 353,000 people. The emergency ambulance service is provided from ten stations throughout the board's catchment area. There has been a significant expansion of the service in the past four or five years. Ten additional crews have been put in place, the number of 24-hour bases has increased from three to five and the service's hours of operation have increased significantly across all bases. The board purchased six new high specification ambulances this year to ensure first class facilities for pre-hospital emergency care patients. Two new rapid response vehicles have been introduced as back-up to the new fleet. The board has improved facilities at ambulance stations in Ballina, Boyle, Clifden and Roscommon.Improvements in service delivery have been facilitated by the use of development funds provided for that purpose to the board, which is continuing its development programme for the service. I understand that the board is developing proposals for the establishment of a number of additional ambulance stations in its functional area, including one at Tuam. The capital proposals will be considered by the Department of Health and Children and the Western Health Board in the context of capital priorities to be progressed in line with overall available funding resources.I assure the House that the Government is fully committed to the development of the emergency ambulance service. A great deal has been achieved in that regard, but I recognise that much remains to be done. We need to maintain the progress that has been made and to continue the process of service development, so that effective pre-hospital emergency care is accessible to those who need it most, when and where it is required.The primary care strategy document, Primary Care: A New Direction, outlines the Government's vision for the development of integrated multidisciplinary primary care teams and networks which will enable clients to access a broad range of services in their local communities. The strategy provides for the early establishment of initial primary care teams on the basis of the model described in it. The future widespread implementation of the model will draw on experience gained through the development and operation of the teams.The Department of Health and Children sought proposals from the health boards in 2002 for the establishment of primary care teams, with a view to funding a number of projects. The Western Health Board made two such proposals. Following discussions between the Department and the board, approval was granted for the development of a primary care team at Erris in County Mayo. The board had proposed that a primary care team and network would cover the Tuam urban and rural areas. It had envisaged that the Tuam team would be based in a purpose-built facility at the proposed Tuam health campus on the site of the former Bon Secours Hospital. It was not possible to approve such a development, however, having regard to the scale and costs associated with the proposed Tuam primary care team.The primary care strategy states that the development of primary care teams must involve the reorientation of existing staff and resources. The Department has asked the health boards to examine how existing primary and community care resources can best be reorganised to give effect to the application of the teamworking concept on a wider basis and to map out the locations to be served by primary care teams. When the Health Service Executive is operational, it will be responsible for building on the health board initiatives to mainstream the development of primary care teams as the core unit of service delivery. The strategy acknowledges that the provision of modern, well-equipped and accessible premises is central to the effective functioning of primary care teams. One of the Government's key objectives is to facilitate and encourage the development, where appropriate, of facilities in which the broad range of primary care services can be delivered. While the State may contribute towards such developments, it is intended to explore a range of different approaches to the financing and provision of such facilities because of the scale of what will be required.The Western Health Board has indicated that the development of a new primary care centre in Tuam would constitute a regional priority. The board was unable to proceed with the development this year, however, in light of the resources available for capital development. The position will be reviewed again in 2005 under the capital investment framework, in the context of priorities for development under the care programme and overall capital funding availability.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I would like to know if additional funding is available for the 34 important and successful rural transport initiatives throughout the country. It is estimated that it has cost approximately €9 million to administer the scheme since it was established in 2002. The scheme, which has improved the health and well-being of its users, has provided considerable social benefits which far outweigh its costs. The rural transport initiative was established by the Department of Transport on a pilot basis to provide transport to people in rural areas who were being excluded because more conventional transport methods and services were not available, accessible or afforded to them locally. By the end of 2003, over 300,000 people had used an estimated 300 routes in the 34 pilot areas throughout the country. The numbers availing of the service have continued to increase.In most cases, passengers are picked up at their doors and taken to the nearest town for the purpose of collecting their pensions, shopping, medical appointments or social visits. They are returned to their doors several hours later. There has been unprecedented demand for the service. However, that has led to funding shortfalls and providers are now being forced to cut back on several such very valuable services.The need for the rural transport initiative and the importance of the scheme are highlighted by research carried out by the Department of Transport before the scheme began that showed that 40% of people living in rural Ireland do not have access to even a basic bus or rail service. That is especially true of the western countries from where I hail. Some 20% have never had access to a car for shopping or health checks, and the most affected are the elderly, young people — for getting to and from work — those with illnesses and disabilities and those on low incomes.An evaluation report published over the summer on the rural transport initiative stated that in most parts of the country it has been very encouraging. In my own area, we have a few projects that have been extremely successful. From May until the end of December 2003 in the Aughrim-Kilmore rural transport area, there were 8,084 passengers. The figure for 2004 so far exceeds 10,000, making it a major success.The rural transport initiative has been described as the greatest single benefit for rural Ireland since the rural electrification programme of the 1940s. The issue is that the Department of Transport has not opted to mainstream the project, despite the fact that the scheme has been evaluated by outside consultants, who found it very worthwhile. Instead the Government has opted to leave it as a pilot project until 2006.The scheme was first announced in 2001 and three years on one asks why the Government will not commit to it. The budget allocated to the scheme has not increased from €3 million annually since 2001, which is a cutback given the increased costs. The lack of funding has prevented the scheme from expanding the number and frequency of services required, despite the great demand, especially in rural areas. If it were in an urban area, a subsidy would be provided and it would be unacceptable for there to be cutbacks. It is unacceptable that such cutbacks are occurring and I ask the Minister to redress the problems and provide funding for a very valuable service.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-11-24 00:00:00	Prelude	208	The rural transport initiative, or RTI, has been under way since 2002 and is funded by the Department of Transport. Under the scheme, funding is provided for 34 rural community organisations around the country to address the transport needs of their areas through the provision of local transport services. Area Development Management Limited, or ADM, manages the RTI on behalf of the Department of Transport. ADM has been fully responsible for the administration of the initiative, from the initial selection of the groups to be funded to the decisions regarding the specific annual allocations to individual projects.Expenditure under the RTI was some €6 million in the two-year period ending in December 2003. At that point the pilot initiative was due to end, but further funding of €3 million was allocated to it for 2004 to facilitate a full appraisal of the initiative. On foot of the principal recommendation of the appraisal, the Minister for Transport, Deputy Cullen, recently extended the initiative for a further two years. The Estimates provision for the RTI for 2005 is €3.1 million, an increase of 3%. That funding allocation of some €12 million over the life of the RTI to the end of 2005 compares very favourably to the total of €4.4 million earmarked for the RTI when it was originally mooted in the National Development Plan 2000-2006.It is understood that the RTI projects also benefit each year from funding provided by the Department of Social and Family Affairs arising from the application of the free travel scheme to the RTI. In addition, ADM has informed the Department of Transport that some RTI projects are generating additional funds from the provision of transport services to health boards and from other sources. From the outset, RTI projects have been encouraged to explore innovative ways in which their services can be partly financed from the local economy. The degree to which prospective RTI groups put forward proposals for co-financing and additional resources to be secured from non-Exchequer sources was among the operational criteria used to assess the original applications for funding.The RTI is now operational in virtually all counties, with some 2,500 transport services being provided on approximately 380 new rural routes established under the initiative. Some 20,000 people are currently using the RTI transport services every month. In deciding on the extension of the RTI to the end of 2006, the Minister for Transport was conscious that many of the pilot projects became fully operational only in 2003. He was also conscious of the fact that continuing the RTI to the end of 2006 will ensure that the lifespan of the initiative will dovetail with the scope of the National Development Plan 2000-2006.The extension will facilitate a more comprehensive appraisal of the effectiveness of the pilot initiative in addressing the transport needs of rural areas. It will enable the 34 projects further to explore models of transport provision and strategically develop approaches to designing, planning, co-ordinating, integrating, procuring and providing transport in areas where it was traditionally considered difficult to do so. In providing additional time for the RTI projects to mature fully, the Minister is facilitating the emergence of models of best practice in the provision of rural transport services in operational and organisational management.
