They are very welcome to the meeting. Béimíd ag caint faoin an torthaí a bhaint amach ón Conference on the Future of Europe, the comhdháil on the future of Europe. We will discuss the outcome of that agus na torthaí of the latest polling by European Movement Ireland, EMI. Before we begin, I will read the note on privilege. All witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not criticise or make any charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her or it identifiable, or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. Therefore, if the witnesses' statements are potentially defamatory in relation to an identifiable person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks. It is imperative that they comply with any such direction.  Members all know the constitutional requirements that members must be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I am leaving out bits and bobs there because I think everybody is okay with that.  We are looking forward to our discussion today and to digging into the poll results. We are assuming that there is good, positive news in there and positive news stories. I will hand it over to Ms O’Connell to make her opening statement.

I thank the Chair and the distinguished members of the committee. My colleague, Mr. O’Shea, and myself are delighted to have this opportunity to engage and address the committee here today on behalf of EMI. It is lovely to be back in person, given that the most recent couple of presentations were done virtually. It is a privilege to be here and, as the Chair, outlined we will discuss EMI’s annual Ireland and EU poll and the Conference on the Future of Europe. Both these topics and the insights presented by them have particular significance this year, because not only have we marked the 50th anniversary on 10 May 2022 of the vote by the Irish people to join the then EEC, we will mark our formal accession on 1 January 2023. Next year also marks the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement. While I will not go into that too much in my opening remarks, we will be happy to discuss it further during our exchanges later. As members well know, since 2013, when Ireland held the rotating Presidency of the Council of the EU, we in EMI have carried out annual, independent polling on how people throughout the country view Ireland’s relationship with the European Union. This year, as a special marking of Ireland EU 50, we carried out our research in two parts. We presented the first set of findings on 9 May, coinciding with Europe Day and with 50 years since the referendum. We presented and published our second set of findings on 21 September, which was last week. Going back to May, and to the stalwart question that we pose each year, we found that support for Ireland remaining a member of the EU increased by 4% since last year’s finding to 88%. The May 2022 poll also found that 76% of respondents agreed that they have a good understanding of how the EU works.However, our September poll found that 56% of people in Ireland believe that the EU is moving in the right direction. While a slight increase of 3% from past year, it does nonetheless show a gap between the 88% who support Ireland's EU membership and those who believe the EU is going in the right direction. It is perhaps a useful cautionary reminder. We found that young people, those in the 18- to 34-year-old demographic, and the older cohort of people aged between 55 and 65 plus, had the strongest level of belief that the EU is moving in the right direction, up to 69% in some instances. While those in the middle cohort of the 35- to 54-year-olds being the most pessimistic. Interestingly, that mirrors a similar trend that we found across a number of questions. Turning topically and understandably to the issues of climate change and the energy crisis, 58% agree that member states should be allowed to delay meeting EU environmental targets to deal with the current energy crisis. An overwhelming majority of people – some 86% – are concerned that the cost-of-living crisis is harming the EU economy. When we asked if the euro has been positive for Ireland, support remained high at 72% but, interestingly, represents a 14% decline on 2019 when we last posed this question when 86% of people then believed that the euro was positive for Ireland. As the Russian invasion of Ukraine now enters its seventh month, 65% of people are in favour of Ukraine joining the EU, while 62% of people, when we turn to the topic of enlargement, agree that the EU should continue to allow more countries to join. The poll also shows that half of people believe the security situation in Europe means that Ireland should increase its defence spending. In our poll when we asked if Ireland should be part of increased EU defence and security co-operation, 59% agreed, which was up 5% from the previous year. Turning to Northern Ireland, some 57% supported the protocol on Ireland and Northern Ireland while 35% did not know and 8% disagreed. This is the highest level of do not knows and may indicate that there is a knowledge deficit in this area. Interestingly as well, we saw the greatest levels of divergences across the different age ranges in replies to this question. Up to 50% of those in the younger 18 to 34 year-old demographic stating that they did not know if they supported the protocol. However, we saw increased support and fewer do not knows for the protocol in older age ranges, in particular those over 55 where support levels reached 75%. Meanwhile almost one third of people, some 31%,, believe there will be a united Ireland in the EU in the next ten years, while 43% disagree and 26% do not know. Of any question that we have asked in our polling data, the responses we have received on this issue have remained constant for three years, which is noteworthy in itself going, up or down one or two percentage points within the margin of error every year. The Conference on the Future of Europe polling, and our annual Ireland in the EU poll, provide but a snapshot of sentiment at a point in time but our community engagement work builds on this to understand the views and ideas of people across the country. This approach was most recently applied to our work on the Conference on the Future of Europe, which concluded the first phase of its work during the summer. Many members of the committee will be familiar with the work of the Conference. I want to mention those Oireachtas Members who were also members of the conference plenary, Deputy Ó Murchú, Senator Higgins, Deputy Richmond, Deputy Niamh Smyth and, separately, Ms Deirdre Clune, Ireland South MEP. I also thank the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Thomas Byrne, for his strong and consistent support and engagement with the Conference on the Future of Europe process. Many others also engaged with it in the House or through some of the many regional events, and indeed local county councillors as well. This engagement and support of public representatives was vital to contributing to the success of the conference process in Ireland. We in EMI work closely in collaboration with the Minister of State with responsibility for European Affairs and the Department of Foreign Affairs to co-ordinate and organise broad, open, and inclusive events where people shared their ideas and inputted their views around the many key themes of the conference. Due to the pandemic, these events took place virtually and we were delighted when health guidelines permitted these events to take place in person. More than 70 events organised by many different organisations throughout Ireland, which included more than 4,500 people representing people from island communities, minority groups, young people, community activists, our diaspora, the newly arrived Irish people across the island and also our community overseas. For us in European Movement Ireland we made a particular effort to speak to and engage with people outside of the so-called bubble and it was fantastic to see their input and their buy-in. As part of the conference, the multilingual digital platform was launched which received almost 19,000 ideas from more than 53,000 participants across the EU. The strong level of Irish engagement from citizens was with the with the topic of European democracy. Other areas with high levels of engagement included a stronger economy, social justice and jobs, digital transformation, climate change and the environment, education, culture, youth, sport and health. Interestingly, in our discussions in Ireland, two key themes emerged and were the most dominant. Simply, people wanted better communication about the EU, issues and policies. They want information that is delivered in a simple accessible and digestible way. That came across regardless of which of the panels or the engagements that took place, regionally, geographically or demographically. Second, what we thought was encouraging as well, was that people in Ireland felt that there is untapped potential to share best practice across member states and the EU institutions in policy areas. People want more opportunity to learn how to do things better from our EU neighbours and vice versa. People want information to understand how the EU relates to their lives and how it can make people's lives better.  Complementing the work of EMI on the conference, I was also honoured to serve as Ireland’s national citizens’ representative to the conference plenary. Following an open and independent competition, I, as the national citizens’ representative, and Ms Emmy Coffey Nguyen as the alternate national citizens’ representative had the honour to represent Ireland and present our national recommendations over many days in the European Parliament in Strasbourg last winter and up to the end of May this year. I was appointed to the digital transformation working group and there was a huge level of engagement and input that we were able to feed back into the process throughout Ireland as part of this work.  As members will be aware, the plenary culminated in a report centred on 49 proposals that include more than 320 measures for the EU institutions to follow up on under nine topics. We now need to ensure that these recommendations are followed by tangible, implementable proposals that will deliver on the issues raised. They cannot be allowed to gather dust in some report on a shelf. We want to see action and implementation. Interestingly, the European Parliament responded to the conference by calling for a convention for the revision of the treaties on 9 June, proposing among other things, a reform of voting procedures, more competences in the area of health, the right of initiative for the European Parliament and strengthening rule of law procedures. Earlier this month, the European Commission rowed in behind the call for a convention, with President von der Leyen expressing support during her state of the Union speech. While many of the proposals do not require treaty change, some may do so and it is certainly evident from these calls for a convention that reform of the treaties is back as a talking point after being somewhat of a taboo subject for some years. Understandably, there is reluctance in terms of potential treaty change. However, a democratic process such as the Conference on the Future of Europe is a very much a two-sided bargain. If people are asked to engage then we cannot ignore the results of that engagement. We believe a lack of follow through on recommendations from the conference will only erode public trust in the EU and any future public engagement.The conference process was a bold democratic experiment; in fact, it was the world's largest experiment in participatory democracy. Of course, it was not perfect. Perfection is hard and difficult to achieve over one year, but the system of democracy is one we must cherish and hold dear. It is based on evolution - one rooted in change. It rests on the principle of continually striving to be better, more inclusive and more representative. This was something that the citizens and all participants in the conference strongly called for. It is part of that process. Those of us invested must advocate that this wish becomes part of the political infrastructure of the EU. We know from the conference, our engagement and my own participation as the national citizen representative that people in this country want to be engaged in what the EU is doing, have their voices heard and contribute their opinions. From our perspective in the EMI, we are very clear that we want this process and dialogue to continue, up to and including treaty change, if that proves necessary. It does not have to be the starting-off point, but nor should it be excluded. We welcome the sentiments in this regard expressed by the Taoiseach and Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs. If we waste the opportunity presented by the conference, there will be consequences. Equally, if we grasp the opportunity afforded by it, we will be a little further along on the journey towards a more inclusive, more democratic and better-functioning Europe, which is something we can all aspire to. I thank the members of the committee. I look forward to their questions.

It is somewhat disconcerting that on some of them, especially the question on the future of Europe, 45% of the responses were from Connaught-Ulster. That area is the most peripheral within Europe, but we will come to that. Before Senator Chambers comes in, I would like to ask about the cost. How much was the work commissioned from RED C?

These were strong statements from Ms O'Connell and EMI, particularly the statement that it would erode trust in the EU if we do not act on these recommendations from the Conference on the Future of Europe. Ms O'Connell said she has been busy recently, but she may be busier if she is advocating for treaty change. We know how that goes in this country. It is a big job of work. Ms O'Connell is correct; we should not be afraid of it, if it is needed. Things move on and the Union has evolved since the most recent treaty change. We should not be afraid to update the treaties. Ms O'Connell said, I think, 56% of respondents believe that the EU is moving in the right direction, which means 44% do not or do not know. How was the question phrased? Was it, "Do you think the EU is moving in the right direction?" That is very subjective. What does that even mean? How was the question asked?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	15	On the referendum, I believe it was one of the Senator's esteemed, distinguished colleagues who said that a referendum is a means of getting an answer to a question that was not asked. With that health warning, in terms of treaty change, what we feel very strong is, as the process evolves and people buy into it, it is really important that the process is not allowed to wither on the vine and is not just filed away. There is that desire to keep the momentum and that dialogue and engagement going. We should not be afraid of treaty change if that is what is required, but we do not believe it should be the starting-off point. There is a lot that can be done under the existing treaties and clauses. There are opportunities via the passerelle clause. We are calling for a stronger and more robust Union that is more agile and able to be more proactive in reacting to the views and inputs of its citizens. It is something we feel strongly about. It is also something that came across throughout the dialogues we engaged with as part of this process. I am sure Deputy Ó Murchú will agree, through being involved in the conference plenaries, it is something that came across from all of the European citizens and the stakeholders, Members of the European Parliament and national parliamentarians. There is broad buy-in and ambition. If we have seen anything, it has been the value of that collective or shared EU. With the departure of a member state on the west and an invasion on the east, we cannot afford to take lightly or for granted our membership of the Union. That was a great question about the polling methodology. We commissioned RED C to carry out the poll and the questions are delivered as statements. To aid people's ability to respond and engage with the question, they are put as statements, for example, "Ireland should remain a member of the EU". They are then asked, "Do you agree strongly, slightly, disagree strongly, disagree slightly or do not know?" We see a big role for ourselves in working with the "do not know" cohort. In many of the questions, we saw quite high levels of "do not knows", indicating perhaps an understanding deficit or information deficit. In our role of communicating on all aspects of Ireland's relationship with the EU, that communications work is something that we want to continue to ramp up.

Are there any plans on the part of EMI to delve further into that space given it is quite controversial? What does greater co-operation in defence mean? What does it look like? We saw quite an adverse reaction to Ireland joining the Permanent Structured Cooperation, PESCO, which involves co-operating on training exercises and sharing of knowledge, not troops on the ground anywhere. Ms O'Connell mentioned that citizens want to see us learn from each other in respect of best practice and that is what PESCO is about. Are there plans to delve a bit further into what that might look like and what people are comfortable with? On the Conference on the Future of Europe, what level of participation or engagement was there from Irish citizens? I mean ordinary citizens, not those working in the sector, like us, for example. How was participation measured and what was the level?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	17	On the defence question, it is something we would have observed during our previous work around the country on the future of Europe process and now as part of the Conference on the Future of Europe. The dial has slowly shifted with people being more open to talking and engaging about it, pretty much across the board in terms of demographics, geography and gender. We cannot deny the impact the Russian invasion of Ukraine had on this. In the May poll, the fieldwork took place in and around the same time as the HSE cyberattack. That outlined how fragile we are. We are not an island in the cyber-digital world. It is something that we believe quite strongly we should look at. I will ask my colleague, Mr. O'Shea, to come in on that particular point.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	18	I will comment on our engagement with the issue and our potential plans on it.One of the things we try to do as an organisation, outside of the polling work, is to explain priorities and developments at an EU level to an Irish audience in a simple and accessible way. As defence has become more of a priority at EU level over the past six or seven months, but also prior to that, we have noticed more engagement from our members on the issue. For example, we published an explainer policy document on the publication of the strategic compass by the institutions last spring. The general point is that as defence shoots up the European agenda, it will naturally become a feature of our work to explain what is happening at an EU level to an Irish audience.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	19	To follow on from that, I will speak about the Irish engagement with the conference. As we mentioned in our opening remarks, 74 events took place with more than 4,500 people taking part, whether in our events, virtually or in events organised by the Department of Foreign Affairs events. Civil society and business groups also organised events and Members of this House organised events and debates as part of the conference process. The level of Irish engagement per head of population was quite high and this is something we can be very proud of. It reflects well on our strong tradition of participatory democratic engagement and the citizens' assembly model was frequently held up among our European colleagues as a best-in-class or best-practice model. A number of randomly selected Irish citizens were chosen to take part and represent Ireland as part of the European citizens' panels. They were active and engaged. It was great to have a European citizens' panel event take place in Dublin Castle. The date had to be rearranged due to the C-word - the Covid pandemic - but it was fantastic and, as the saying goes, we punched above our weight in our active engagement. If I may pay tribute, Members of the Oireachtas, including Deputy Ó Múrchú, attended in Strasbourg and we made interventions at the plenary. That active engagement and input are important, particularly on the working group side.
#RuairiOmurchu	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-party	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-dob	unknown-#RuairiOmurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	20	I will start with the Conference on the Future of Europe, the idea of the convention and everything that was done imperfectly from the point of view of the conference, especially at the beginning. The idea that greater and more consistent interaction with citizens is needed and that Europe is well removed from a considerable number of people was a big thing. Anyone who goes out into the street here would know that. We must follow up on the work that has been done and maintain a forum in which we can do it. Everyone bought into that idea. As important as all the interventions were, I was never quite clear why certain interventions made at plenary session or working group level were recorded on the books. We could probably say that about a lot of the work the European Movement Ireland did too. As I stated in Europe, interactions and civic engagements on Ireland took place. I am referring specifically to Ireland's Future and we know it will hold a big event in the 3 Arena on Saturday. None of that plugged in, however, and even if it had, it would not have mattered. Only certain State interactions ended up in the overall report and it must have been on the basis of how the selections were made. That was a flaw at the organisers' end. I do not blame the European Movement Ireland, the committee or anyone else. I understand that this all happened during the period of Covid initially. This was followed by the Russian invasion of Ukraine and we were also coming out of the Brexit situation, if we are ever to come out of it, and dealing with the relationship with Britain. The solidarity shown across Europe then and the vital pieces of work done at a European level, in particular the block-buying of vaccines, shows the European Union has an ability to operate even in areas where it does not have a competence. That could be missed to some degree when people are looking at reshaping the European Union. Major work needs to be done and follow-through is definitely needed. I am a bit disappointed with how some of the process went and that definitely needs to be dealt with at a later stage of interaction. As regards the question of defence, it is probably not that surprising that people see defence in a slightly different form now. We see it from a point of view of the Russian invasion and asymmetrical warfare and hybrid operations, to use those great terms. We also see the absolute necessity of cyber. People realise what neutrality means and to some degree defence spending needs to be increased to enable neutrality and a non-aligned position and to do our fair share in that regard. As Senator Chambers said, we probably need to do a lot of diving down into many of these questions. Some of the answers to the issues related to the Irish protocol are frightening. I assume, perhaps wrongly, that there is a misunderstanding as regards some of the answers that have come back. Everybody deals with the issue in front of them, be it health or whatever else, in a silo and sometimes it gets simplified, as if we had five people in a room and we need to get a majority decision. People begin to think this does not make sense. At European level, everyone is thinking about Hungary and people are arguing that we need to move from unanimity to qualified majority voting, while missing the big wins for the European Union in recent times such as the fact that we could do deals. It was difficult for people to come up with agreements but they did and the European Union as a collection of democracies was able to operate on a level that controlled states or economies were not able to do. The arguments relating to the European Union and democracy within it have held up in recent times. My main questions relate to drilling down on the questions that were asked, the issues surrounding the Conference on the Future of Europe and any proposals the witnesses have on how that could be improved as regards engagement. There was a failure on some level to provide the citizens with some of the information from the institutions in relation to what is being done and what can be done. Sometimes they are looking for answers that are not needed in the sense that, as a collective, we have shown an ability to come up with agreements. Treaty change or whatever will not necessarily be needed, although I do not rule it out.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	23	Not at all. We were alphabetically seated next to one another for many of the plenaries. As regards Deputy Ó Múrchú's comments on the methodology of the conference, we certainly do not claim it was perfect in every way.Did everything that Deputy Ó Murchú or I or others put forward as recommendations and views from the Irish perspective end up in the final report? No, but we were able to input and shape it and as in all things European Union-related it reflects a compromise with something that is as multifaceted and as challenging as trying to piece it all together notwithstanding the structural challenges of the conference in terms of the sometimes opposing interests between and within the EU institutions; and the various challenges of being overshadowed by external events. What came across very strongly, and something that we are calling for, is the recommendations prepared by the citizens' panels and by the outcome of the conference. It really demonstrates, and especially to elected representatives and to all of us, the expectations that citizens across Europe have and that they place on the European Union. The fact is that people believe, - and this is borne out by our polls - that the EU should assume more responsibility, perhaps exhibit greater external unity and use its strengths, regulatory powers and economic policies to advance those great transformation projects such as the Green Deal or the digital agenda, which is something that I saw very strongly in the digital transformation working group.  In terms of implementing the conference proposals, exclusively predicating them on the questions of treaty change is not really what a lot of the citizens were talking about. They just want the EU to work better for everyone collectively. It then becomes more transparent and it picks up on Deputy Ó Murchú's point as well on how it communicates better outside of that conference process; we really believe that this ongoing task should continue. It should be a model of representative citizens' panels. It is certainly one that can be taken away. The good work and the example that we in Ireland have done on that is certainly credible. It creates a genuine European input and a momentum. If there is some way that the EU and the institutions could institutionalise and harness this engagement, it would be really welcome.  I might ask Mr. O'Shea to come in on the methodology and to do the drilling down for some of the questions in the poll. Deputy Ó Murchú is absolutely right. I know that we have a follow-on event on 2 December that we will attend in Brussels. If we could keep that momentum going and keep that conversation alive, that is really important. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	24	I thank Deputy Ó Murchú. Obviously there is always more we would like to learn from the polling. To a certain degree, like any opinion polling, we are restricted in a certain sense. For us it is really valuable because each year we look at priorities that are topical. It is a really valuable test of sentiment for us in terms of guiding our own work, and guiding our citizen engagement that arises from it. We do try to drill down in that way. For example, on energy and the cost of living we are running four events around the country on energy with the European Commission over the winter. The sentiment and the findings in the polling will guide our engagement through those events. Likewise, to give another example on the euro question, what we can try to do as well is to match it up with other research. Since we last asked that question support for the euro has fallen by about 14%. If one matches that there is some research from Lund University that postulates that support for the common currency is linked to employment and inflation. That insight will guide our work on those issues over the period ahead. It is very difficult to drill down into why certain figures in Connacht-Ulster might be lower or why we see across a lot of questions the middle age brackets being less supportive than other age groups. Anecdotally we know that is pretty consistent with a lot of opinion polling. If we look back at some of the research that has been done on the Brexit referendum, yes there was an element of a left behind marginalised group, but there was also an issue in that squeezed middle or whatever one wants to call that group. Scepticism was a factor in Brexit and I think that you see it in political polling as well. It is not a perfect science, as politicians know well, but it is very useful in terms of guiding our own work, evaluating that the issues that we are focusing on are those which are relevant to public sentiment at a point in time. I hope that is helpful.

It is a very small point. In fairness it was an interesting question that European Movement Ireland asked on whether EU countries should be allowed to delay meeting EU environmental targets in order to deal with the current energy crisis. That will mean something different to every person.

I suppose to sell the necessary moves in climate change, whether it is in Ireland or across Europe, the idea that we are going to have to sell is that some of these moves, if it is into wind energy or renewables and all the rest, will provide us with solutions which will improve the situation on either a geopolitical level and also from a point of view of saving the planet. Again, one would probably need to drill down into three or four questions. 
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	28	Yes.

One thing that struck me is in relation to the Ireland and the Northern Ireland protocol. That 34% do not know whether they support it. That is a surprise given the amount of publicity the protocol is getting. There obviously is a job of work to do for the Government, the Oireachtas and dare I say it, by European Movement Ireland as well to try to explain the importance of that. Generally speaking, support for the EU is strong in Ireland, give or take slight variations here and there on some of the questions and that is a good thing. Could witnesses clarify a point on the age cohorts? I know they made some reference to the older demographic and the younger demographic. Perhaps I picked it up wrong or is there a sense that younger people are less supportive of the EU, or aspects of the EU, because that would be a surprise to me on the basis of the Brexit referendum whereby the young people by and large supported remaining and it was the older people who wanted to leave? I would be interested to know whether there is a sharp divergence between young people and old people's attitudes to the EU.  On the conference, I would like to thank European Movement Ireland for the work that it did, and Deputy Ó Murchú and others. They did the State some service I would say by their participation in that and we do all appreciate it. It is great to see Ireland strongly represented. I want to zone in on two issues. I worry a little about the proposal for a European political community put forward by President Macron and supported by the European Commission President. Is that seen as a substitute for full membership of the European Union or how do the witnesses see that working in practice? Is the proposal by President Macron something they would support? One would wonder if this is getting into a two-tier Europe in terms of membership and I would be interested in witnesses' views on that.  The second question relates to treaty change and the proposal for a convention on treaty change, supported by the European Parliament and the European Commission. A number of issues arise there: switching from unanimity to qualified majority voting; strengthening EU competence in health and energy; incorporating the pillar of social rights into the treaty and providing the European Parliament with a right to legislative initiative.They are some of the issues that could be embraced by treaty change. Like Senator Chambers, I worry about it in an Irish context although I am probably not too afraid of it, I suppose. Which issues does EMI think are important in respect of treaty change? What are the most important things we could do? I feel that treaty change should be limited and very clear-cut. It should not be wide-ranging because we are talking about a referendum. Finally, the opening statement mentioned plans for the commemoration of the 50th anniversary of our joining the EU next year. Are plans being formulated at this stage?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	30	I advise the committee to watch this space for our plans to mark the anniversary on 1 January 2023. We have lots in store. As I know Deputy Haughey is aware, it is very much a 24-month process, if we can do it that way. We see it as part of the ongoing work we are doing. We would appreciate the ongoing support and engagement of the members for the Ireland EU50 competition for primary, post-primary and third levels. It is an initiative of the Government and the Department of Foreign Affairs and is supported by the Department of Education. It involves encouraging all young people across the country to enter a competition on what Ireland EU50 means to them. That is a big part of the work that we will be doing. We will be commemorating it digitally as well. We are doing a digital anthology on Ireland's EU relationship. We are also publishing a series of papers called 50 steps to 50 years of membership. We see it as a way of getting people to engage, looking forward to the type of EU that people in Ireland want to be part of, and examining how we shape and influence that for the next 50 years. It is a really ambitious range of projects and programmes across our different streams. Also on engagement, we were delighted to have the Taoiseach do an "in conversation" podcast moderated by Professor Brigid Laffan in which he shared his reflections. We hope to continue the EU 50 podcast in the coming months and in the year ahead. We will keep the committee members engaged as ever. I thank the Deputy for his support on that. The Deputy made a really good point on the European political community, EPC. EMI supports anything that can encourage debate and engagement on the EU and all matters European but we believe the EPC must be complementary and must not be a substitute for enlargement and for that process. As we have seen in our Ireland and the EU poll, 62% of people are very much aligned with the Government's priorities of supporting enlargement and accession countries. There is a high level of support for enlargement. We do not want to see the EPC being a substitute. We are living in an increasingly geopolitically challenged and more diverse continent. With Brexit, which none of us wanted or welcomed, how we navigate and engage with countries that are not part of the EU, the multilateral world order and the rule of law system is something that the EU saw as part of the conference process. People want the EU to be more robust and to be a beacon for the values on which it was founded. I absolutely understand the point about treaty change and referendums and hear where the Deputy is coming from. What we hear across our counterparts and networks is that the possibility of this happening imminently has probably waned and is somewhat on the back burner. There is certainly reluctance among member states, notwithstanding the views of the Parliament and the Commission. This can only happen with political will. We must see where it aligns. We are not calling for treaty change for the sake of it. We have always been very clear that we want a better, more reflective and more efficiently functioning EU that responds in an agile and proactive manner to the needs, wants and wishes of all its citizens, notwithstanding the challenges. The geostrategic transformation of Europe which is going on at the moment is something we need to keep an eye on. On some of the changes and how we look at things like qualified majority voting in the foreign policy arena, we think there is a way to look at this via the Passerelle clause and others, as I mentioned. We saw with the fiscal compact treaty how workaround solutions can come about. That is something where there is precedent. The next generation of EU funding is also an example of the EU nimbly working to come up with solutions at short notice. Mr. O'Shea might like to come in on the younger demographic.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	31	I can clarify that for the Deputy. By and large, the younger demographic and the older demographic are the most supportive. We tend to see a sort of U curve across many questions. It is among those in the 35 to 54 age range that support falls off. On the EU energy targets question, we found that young people were most likely to disagree with the notion that energy targets should be cast aside because of the current pressures we face. Young people tend to be quite enthusiastic and quite idealistic in their responses. I have some more interesting nuggets. We find "don't knows" higher among females than males quite a lot. At the beginning of the meeting, the Chair mentioned that levels of support are less than the national average in Connacht-Ulster in particular. On the EPC, personally I thought the state of the Union address was interesting in respect of the President's commitment to grant Ukraine access to certain aspects of the Single Market and to provide mobile roaming rights to Ukraine. It is interesting in terms of the debate about the EPC. It could be an interesting structure around which to build co-operation whereby you grant aspiring member states some of the privileges and rights of membership before membership actually takes place. That is a way to keep them engaged and to reward progress or whatever you want to call it. Perhaps there is potential for a structure which would provide some of the benefits of membership while being on the road to membership because as we know the accession process is long and tortuous. We see that in the western Balkans where people tend to find it difficult to keep communities and populations engaged. That is just a personal view on that aspect of the matter. 
#NealeRichmond	unknown-#NealeRichmond-party	unknown-#NealeRichmond-dob	unknown-#NealeRichmond-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	32	I thank both Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea for the very good presentation and for the ongoing work of EMI. If it is okay, I want to go back and ask about polling. It was stated that a large number say they do not understand the protocol, which Ms O'Connell indicated is of concern. However, is that a surprise, considering that the vast majority of people who negotiated the protocol in the UK do not seem to understand it either, based on how it is being implemented and their approach? My second question relates to the direction of the EU. To be honest, this question is probably a bit more serious. While I welcome the finding on the percentage of people who are happy with the direction, is this the space that the Conference on the Future of Europe - at which the witnesses represented the citizens of Ireland so well - needs to fill? I do not believe many of the 50-odd recommendations from the conference will address that, but I will highlight a number of them, for example, the recommendation that more aspects of health be made a European competence and the recommendation that a greater focus be placed on where co-operation can deliver tangible results for European citizens. Mr. O'Shea mentioned enthusiastic and idealistic young people. In a roundabout way, in order to get hold of the direction of the European Union, does the conference lead to a convention that will lead, in due course, to treaty change and a referendum in this jurisdiction?
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-09-28 00:00:00	Conference on the Future of Europe and Other Matters: European Movement Ireland	33	We could not possibly comment on the implementation of the protocol, but we are members of the EU's Trade and Cooperation Agreement domestic advisory group. That is a very useful and important forum in which we make an input and work to try to mitigate the challenges and difficulties posed by Brexit. This is something we take very seriously. It has come across in all of our engagements with this committee that there is a body of work to be done on the communication and explanation of the information to aid and increase greater understanding of the protocol both North and South and, in particular, east and west as well. It is something that we will continue to do in our engagement work. Deputy Richmond is correct about the direction of the EU and the Conference on the Future of Europe, and how we could perhaps increase the percentage of people in this country who believe the EU is moving in the right direction. There are certainly some areas of the conference outcome and recommendations on which we feel more could be done. The Deputy mentioned health competencies in particular. A very interesting suggestion that came across not only in my own digital transformation working group work but also in the health working group was that the Covid vaccine pass and other such information could be uploaded very simply onto the European health insurance card. That is a very practical measure that I hope can be examined. There are many very good initiatives in terms of digital literacy and ensuring that no one is left behind, including having broadband access across the EU, financial literacy skills and how we combat misinformation and disinformation. These are all very practical initiatives that came across from the conference that I hope will provide ideas for committee members, as elected representatives, to look to lead on initiatives and champion them. We have seen that the desire and input are there. It is very encouraging that people want to shape and influence what direction the European Union takes. Treaty change and referendums are issues that we touched upon in our engagement this morning. We do not believe treaty change should be a starting off point but, as Senator Chambers and Deputy Haughey stated, we have to be mindful of it. We should not fear it, if it makes the European Union function more effectively. However, there are mechanisms in place that can be used to make the EU more efficient and effective and do not necessarily necessitate treaty change. We do not want to see an institutional tug-of-war take place over the EU's strategic direction. There are areas I mentioned such as the Passerelle clause. We should not just look for treaty change for the sake of it. As we saw, there are always ways around some of the challenges. We saw that with the approach taken during the Covid vaccine crisis, the health crisis and the fiscal compact. There is precedent. There is flexibility within the current treaties to accommodate individual positions, as we know only too well in Ireland. We think some of the outcomes from the Conference on the Future of Europe process can be implemented and driven forward without too great a difficulty. That is something that we are very strongly calling on all parties to the conference process to drive forward. As we mentioned, we cannot afford to have an erosion of trust and confidence in the European Union and in the participatory parliamentary democracy process. That would not benefit anyone. What we have seen is that, politically, we have a more united European Union, one that represents the values on which it was founded. We want to make sure that is maintained.

I agree with all that has been said and the need for a continuation and possibly an upscaling of citizen engagement. This is a single transferable speech in the sense that there are those at the periphery who are removed from politics on every level. I would have thought that was another failing. It was probably members of the European middle class who met at the Conference on the Future of Europe. There probably needs to be an element of work done at a domestic and European level to engage with the cohort on the periphery. I accept we will never engage with those who are outside the periphery, but there is a piece of work to be done. I found it strange that certain issues did not come up that would pertain to communities I deal with daily. I refer to the wider issue of where the antisocial meets drug gang criminality, but there was no mention of it. I cannot believe that is not an issue right across the entirety of modern Europe. I think certain voices were missed. I am sure the witnesses, no more than me, do not necessarily have a whole suite of solutions to provide to the committee, but it is something we must put on the agenda.

I also thank Ms O'Connell and Mr. O'Shea. The engagement has been very helpful and informative. We will take the witnesses up on the suggestion to look at areas where we can work together. Our focus as a committee is to continue to look at the eastern front of Europe. We want to continue with our engagement with the Balkan countries. We had a representative of North Macedonia before us last week. We have learned a lot from our trip to Moldova and Romania. Peripherality is an issue. Many countries on the eastern side of Europe believe the region is getting attention now because of the war, which gives rise to the question of why the attention was not on it in the first place. We could look at the inverse of that on the north-west coast of Ireland and the various percentages. In terms of peripherality, it is not just about having meetings in peripheral areas, although that is a big part of it. The witnesses held one of the four national meetings in Donegal town, which was a big deal. Core versus periphery is more than just a logical analysis; it is a feeling.We will be happy to engage with EMI in our work, as we continue to work with the Balkans and with eastern Europe. If there is anything we can do in that space, especially to commemorate a significant landmark like the 50-year anniversary, as well as the 25th anniversary of the Good Friday Agreement, we will be happy to do it.
