#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator McHugh that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, he proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Education and Science to indicate when the refurbishment project for Ballyraine national school, Letterkenny, County Donegal, will progress to advanced architectural planning and when it will go to tender.I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to clarify the position regarding a radiotherapy unit at the Regional Hospital Limerick taking account of the support from the Mid-Western Hospital Trust and the Mid-Western Health Board.I have also received notice from Senator Ulick Burke of the following matter:The need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the preliminary report of Galway County Council on the provision of funding for a sewage treatment system at Kinvara, County Galway.I regard the matters raised by the Senators as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I thank the Cathaoirleach for his guidance in respect of this matter and for deciding that because the occasion is so important for the Seanad and for the person concerned, and even though it is not allowed in the normal course of events, we will offer our congratulations before the Order of Business.I have great pleasure, as Leader of the House and on behalf of my party, to pass on an enthusiastic vote of congratulations to Senator Maurice Hayes who has been named European of the Year by a panel of distinguished and independent adjudicators. He was given his award early on Monday afternoon before a large crowd of 300 people. The Senator received a high accolade, not just from those present but also from the President of Ireland, the representatives of European movements in many member states and accession countries and other distinguished invitees. It would be difficult to match what the President said about Senator Maurice Hayes because she knows him well. President McAleese and the Senator have worked together and observed each other and it is clear they have extreme fondness for each other. The President has a high regard for the work Senator Maurice Hayes has done.After the first Nice referendum, Senator Maurice Hayes undertook an odyssey — there is no other way to describe it — of Ireland. He visited cities, towns and villages across the country to communicate the message of Europe. He did not merely inform people about what Europe has given us — in practical terms that formed part of his message — but he also delineated the rich heritage and culture of Europe, of which we were part before many of those who might be regarded as being of mainstream Europe. Senator Maurice Hayes expressed it so well when he said that we were Europeans before the term was ever devised.I recall attending one of the early gatherings the Senator convened in Athlone to impart his message. He communicated that message on an all-party basis and had people from the different political parties with him to provide assistance in that regard. A large, enthusiastic but sometimes bellicose crowd in Athlone IT witnessed his skills of dissertation and his use of realistic, homely and matter of fact language. I recall speaking afterwards to some of those who had engaged in robust debate during the gathering and they informed me that at least they could understand the Senator and knew what he was talking about.Senator Maurice Hayes has displayed dedication to the culture and traditions of Europe, which have lasted many centuries, and the poets, wanderers, minstrels and, in their day, legislators. He has given such rich expression to his beliefs in this regard.There are many facets to the Senator's life and he has always brought dignity and distinction to the roles — ombudsman, town clerk or chairman of the Forum on Europe — he has played. Whatever job he undertakes, he brings to it his own particular force of personality.We are honoured that Senator Maurice Hayes, an appointee of the Taoiseach, is a Member of this House. When he speaks in this Chamber there is a sagacity to his words which always strikes me as a mark of the wisdom brought on by experience. The Senator brings the latter to bear on whatever he says or does. There is a song called "The Star of the County Down" which is about a woman but in this instance we have our own star of County Down in this Chamber and I pay great tribute to him.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	3	I second the motion proposed by the Leader to mark the great occasion of the nomination of Senator Maurice Hayes as European of the Year. Senator Hayes is a modest man and I suspect he is trying to find his feet at this point. I assure the Senator that no one on this side of the House will ask him to run for the park after this accolade although I suspect there are many who would like him to do so. This is a great occasion for the Senator and the House. Those of us who have come to know Senator Maurice Hayes in recent years are aware that he is a person of absolute integrity. He brings to this House a great body of experience as a former official who served for a long period in very public roles particularly in Northern Ireland, but also in this State. He conducts himself in this House with great independence and we are very lucky to have him here.It is absolutely appropriate that the Senator should receive this accolade at this time. I have spoken to many colleagues on all sides of this House and the Dáil and they are very appreciative of his work during the first referendum on the Nice treaty. Senator Maurice Hayes chaired with great gusto and skill the Forum on Europe. He has travelled to every corner of the country to get across the message that Europe is not only important for Ireland, but that we have a huge contribution to make to the project.It is significant that Senator Hayes has received this award. I second the vote of congratulations on behalf of the Fine Gael group. The Senator should keep up his good work on Europe. We have so much to learn from his experience. His standing has greatly contributed to the standing of the entire House throughout the country. I congratulate him on behalf of my group.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	4	The Leader says it is great to see one of us being given a distinction. The Independent Members consider Senator Maurice Hayes one of us and we have always kept a seat for him on this side of the House. Regarding the star of the County Down, I remember years ago reading his autobiography and being delighted to see that he might be more likely to be called the rose of Tralee as all his roots are in north Kerry where he is well loved and regarded.Senator Maurice Hayes has served as chairman of the Forum on Europe. He has brought added value and new definition to the concept of public service in two jurisdictions. He has brought a new understanding of Europe to every corner of this country and he has done it in English, i nGaeilge and, for all I know, in Scots Gaelic also. It was wonderful to see the Senator in so many corners of Ireland where people listened to his words of wisdom on Europe. I spent one evening with him in Dún Chaoin. Bhí muid ag argóint agus ag cur na díospóireacta atá coitianta sa Teach seo ach nach raibh ag tarlú i measc an ghnáthphobal os comhair na ndaoine. Sin an jab atá déanta aige níos mó ná aon rud eile — tá sé in ann, i mBéarla agus i nGaeilge, an tionscnamh Eorpach a chur faoi bhráid na ndaoine. He said that had to be done articulately, clearly and in a way that reaches and touches people. As Senator Maurice Hayes said during the week, we are very close to a point at which nearly half the population was born since we joined Europe. We must keep that fact in our minds when we talk about Europe as being something distant from us and out there. It is much closer to us now.Senator Maurice Hayes has been a servant of democracy. He has shown himself to be fair. He has served with distinction and no one deserves more the accolade which has been granted to him this week. I congratulate him.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It is difficult to add to what everybody else has said. The Labour Party group agrees with all the sentiments expressed. As perhaps one of the few Members of the Oireachtas with a foot in the camp that was most hostile to the European project over many years, I must say that none of those I know who approached the forum with scepticism left it with other than a feeling that they were treated fairly, given a hearing and drawn in to a dialogue from which perhaps many had felt excluded in the past.Seán Ó Faoláin famously described an Irish conversation as being like two men playing handball against two sides of the same wall, appearing to be in contact yet totally oblivious to each other. Senator Maurice Hayes has drawn the country into a serious dialogue on Europe which was long overdue, and has done it so quietly that one could easily believe there was no skill involved. The opposite is the case. The extraordinary skill lay in doing it quietly and firmly, in a way which drew everybody in. Thug sé, mar a dúirt an Seanadór Ó Tuathail, cluas le gach sruth sa díospóireacht faoi thodhchaí na hEorpa agus todhchaí na tíre seo san Eorap, ina measc an Ghaeilge agus na mionteangacha uilig atá scaipthe timpeall na hEorpa.To put it mildly, this is a well deserved honour. Those who chose Senator Maurice Hayes as European of the Year chose very well, and I am delighted to be associated with the congratulations.
#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I am delighted the House is recognising this achievement by Senator Maurice Hayes in being given the European of the Year award. I and all those who have been associated with the forum are well aware of the amount of work and effort Senator Hayes put into it. Moreover, he always ensured that there would be a balance of opinion and that all voices were represented. The central achievement of what he has done at the forum is to bring Europe to a wider audience and demystify some of the jargon that surrounds it. Many more people in this country have an understanding of Europe as a result of his work.There is an unfortunate tendency on these occasions to make tributes sound like obituaries, and I know that is not what Senator Hayes would want. It is appropriate that we recognise his work at the forum, in this House, with the Gaelic Athletic Association and in his previous incarnation as a public servant. His experience with the Patten Commission may have served him well when it came to dealing with some of the rowdier elements at the Forum on Europe, and this country and Europe owe him a significant debt. It is appropriate that we recognise that.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I too wish to be associated with the tributes being paid to Senator Maurice Hayes. The first time I heard of him was nearly 54 years ago, when Down won its first All-Ireland football title. He was secretary of the Down county board at the time and I am sure he played a significant part in achieving that great success over Kerry, where, as Senator O'Toole said, Senator Hayes has ancestral connections.It is a great honour, not only for Senator Maurice Hayes but for the Seanad, because this is the first time a Senator has been awarded this high honour. In this sense, he has created history, and I join in the congratulations.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I am sorry for having messed up the Order of Business, but I am overwhelmed by the affection of the House, which has really touched me. As I said at the time, I accepted the award in the same way as a captain of a team does, as a tribute to the forum and to everyone connected with it. Senator Brian Hayes said I was a modest man, and he is quite right. I would only have added that I have much to be modest about. I have benefited enormously from membership of the Seanad, the collegiality I find here and the nature of the debates. It has enriched my life. I have also benefited from your kindness on all occasions, a Chathaoirligh, and I sincerely thank the Members for their kind expressions. As I said, I am glad it is the forum that is being recognised. It was an important development because it has done important work. I was very glad to be associated with it and to be able to lead it.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Last week the House was told by a Minister that no legislation was required to bring about electronic voting for the elections in June. We were told there was no need for an independent panel or commission to monitor and advise on the operation of electronic voting, that there was a mechanism in place to allow people spoil their vote if that was their choice and that the Government had confidence in the consultants who were responsible for the advertising campaign on electronic voting, yet the introduction of that had been shown to be entirely partial against my party when it first came about two weeks ago. Will the Leader agree that the handling of this issue by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in particular has been a fiasco from start to finish? Will she agree also that now is the time to work with the Opposition to bring about a consensus on the issue of electronic voting? This country is one of the oldest democracies in western Europe and the bedrock of that democracy has been the public support for our voting system from the foundation of the State. We should not tamper lightly with it. Will the Leader agree that the entire operation needs to be stopped in its tracks until such time as there is consensus among all the parties, which currently is not the case? Will she agree it is time to stop the operation until that consensus is achieved?In a superb series of articles by Carl O'Brien in The Irish Times over the past number of weeks he has been relaying to the country at large the shambles that exists in terms of helping children who get into difficulty with the law through the Children's Court. It is a superb piece of journalism and I congratulate him on it. Will the Leader consider providing time for a debate on the issue of disturbed children who have found no place in terms of rehabilitation and whose parents cannot deal with them because they are a danger to themselves and to their parents? We should debate this issue because if the series of articles by Mr. O'Brien in The Irish Times has shown us anything it is that there is very little provision for children under the age of 18 who get into this kind of difficulty on a regular basis. I congratulate him on an excellent piece of journalism.

#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	13	On that basis I will park the issue for another day. On the question of electronic voting and this morning's newspaper reports on it, whereas I do not agree with Senator Brian Hayes that we are one of the oldest democracies in Europe, though we are around for a while, a sufficient number of questions have now been asked about this issue to warrant it being addressed. The only way to do that is across the board. No one party has a greater political investment in this issue than another. This is all about giving popular legitimacy to the whole operation of balloting. There are too many questions. It is not a matter of the rights or the wrongs of it, but how people perceive it. If ever there was a situation where the perception is reality, this is it. The Government will have to readjust its position. This should not be made a party political issue. Questions have been raised and we all have a responsibility to address that issue in a fair and open way that gives people confidence in what we are doing. That is an issue we should examine. It is welcome that the Government is looking anew at it and it is now a question of how we move it on.I am sure the House will agree that the decision taken by the Minister for Finance in regard to the shares of Eircom workers could not be seen in any way other than pro-worker and pro-employer and recognising their contribution. It is incorrect to see it as pro or anti a particular company or anti the shareholders of the company. It did what has always been the case and what we have always asked of successive Ministers for Finance of whatever party. This issue was dealt with by Labour Party, Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Ministers at various times, all of whom have taken particular decisions. I welcome the decision and regard it as the correct one. I ask that the Leader also——

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	18	It is a great pity that it takes such enormous effort to get a Government to realise we are not all Luddites because we are wary of the method of electronic voting that is being introduced. The constituents I serve in the NUI are an undemanding group by and large — some say that is why they vote for me. Many a Fianna Fáil member has tried the same route and failed gloriously so I would not make too much of it. However, they rarely are too agitated about matters but this issue has resulted in me being approached by a number of people who not only are not Luddites, but are more expert than I on this issue and they are extraordinarily wary of what the Government proposes to do. I will say no more than that. This is not about hostility to electronic voting but about understanding the limits of what computers can do.Over the weekend the Government took to itself decisions on how the dormant accounts funds would be disbursed. We had a long debate and an independent body was set up. The Taoiseach said in the Dáil yesterday it was only a small sum of money and that he thought it was a storm in a teacup. To most of us €180 million is a large sum of money. This issue should be debated properly in both Houses of the Oireachtas because until the Oireachtas knows what is going on, it has all the appearances of an election slush fund grabbed by Fianna Fáil, with the collusion of the Progressive Democrats, to buy votes in the local elections.

I have a document produced by Relate telling me how it will be done. The Government suddenly decided it would not do that, but would do it a different way. This is a Government which has given us lectures about decentralisation and taking power out of the centre, but it grabs back to itself €180 million to spend as it wishes over the next six months.

I fully accept that the noble aspiration behind it is to reduce speeding and, ultimately, to save lives, but the human condition does not always subscribe to theory. Those of us who travel the roads of Ireland will testify that as the road structure improves and speed increases, the safest roads are motorways. However, there are motorists who, for some strange reason or because of some peculiar approach to driving, believe they own the road and that nobody can pass them by, even if they are doing 40 miles per hour. Will such people make telephone calls and clog up the telephone lines with nuisance calls, begrudgery or envy? I raise the matter because I was the subject of such a call two years ago when in a city in the south east, although it was not a driver who complained but a passenger.

My concern is that whenever the public is relied upon to phone in because they do not like something they see on the roads, the situation is open to abuse. I have had no assurances from any quarter that this service will be monitored to ensure that those driving safely and with a high degree of propriety, as most do, will not be subjected to complaints from those who, for reasons best known to themselves, decide to make a telephone call. There should be assurances in this regard from the Minister.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	30	I support Senator Brian Hayes on electronic voting. I am in favour of electronic voting but am extremely concerned about the reservations that have been expressed, in particular regarding security. The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, adopts an almost gung ho attitude to the issue. It is worth bearing in mind that further concerns have arisen in regard to the Minister's actions because he is the national director of elections for Fianna Fáil in the upcoming local elections. I urge caution on the Minister. I am glad he has rolled back on certain aspects of this and hope he will roll back on other aspects also.Members will be aware there has been extreme concern in recent days regarding the Ardoyne area of Belfast where 13 young people have committed suicide within a few weeks. This has been linked and associated with the gangsterism and tactics adopted by the INLA in that area. While I am not a member of the British-Irish Commission, it is an issue the commission should discuss and which the Taoiseach should take up with the relevant authorities in Northern Ireland. If this gangsterism is allowed to prevail, the good done in the context of the Agreement will break down. Anybody following the debate over the past few days would be extremely concerned by what is happening in Belfast. The issue requires a response from this jurisdiction and should be tackled in Belfast.

He seems to have made a discovery which will make the return of test results much more efficient, rapid and accurate. More important — this is a matter I have raised previously in regard to other disciplines — the most striking point is that he refused to patent the discovery because it would be of use to people around the world. If one contrasts that with the actions of the American doctor who patented the genetic code of one of his patients, the example of Professor O'Leary is something of which Ireland can be proud.We might consider the situation regarding the Red Bull drink which is banned in France. I am aware we are looking at the matter here, but there does not appear to be a desire to ban it, which I do not understand. It should not be put into Vodka and so on because of its effect. This combination is responsible for much of the misbehaviour in cities like Dublin. I do not know why it cannot be banned. If the French can ban it, and if it can be shown to be socially destructive, why not ban it?

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	50	I have a question.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	51	Then put the question.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	52	I want to know why Ireland has lost its competitive edge. Why are so many international companies pulling out of the country? Is it because we have lost competitiveness? I call on the golden girl of "golden Thursday" to come to this House and debate the issue.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	54	That is not appropriate.
#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I would like to be associated with the remarks about suicides in the Ardoyne, which is a hugely complex issue. We must all ask ourselves about the breakdown in social structures that leaves young people without hope. It is an unanswerable argument for involving policing. Vigilantes are terrorising people. As well as talking to the British Government, the Taoiseach might encourage all parties to the Good Friday Agreement to play their part in building up proper policing structures in Northern Ireland.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I support my colleague, Senator Ryan, on the dormant accounts fund. The actions of the Minister, Deputy McCreevy, in this regard are nothing short of scandalous and disgraceful. It is a cynical attempt to build up a slush fund to buy votes for the forthcoming local and European elections. It is every bit as bad as the performance of the Government prior to the last general election.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	57	Has the Senator a question for the Leader?
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	58	Will the Leader confirm whether this was a sinister attempt on the part of the Minister for Finance to buy votes in the forthcoming local and European elections? I have no doubt, nor has the public at large, that this is the case.The second issue relates to the announcement this week that the 1,100 jobs due to materialise in Longford following the establishment of an American health care company will not now happen. This is very disappointing for the particular area and the region in general. The 1,100 jobs are directly linked to the "golden Thursday" announcements. I ask the Leader to arrange for the Tánaiste to visit this House and debate every jobs announcement she made that day. The list of jobs that have not materialised is endless. In each area that was included in an announcement, the Progressive Democrats marginally won the last seat.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	59	In the same vein, we need a debate on job policy in the north west. Senator Bannon alluded to competition and there is an ongoing debate about Eircom and what went wrong with the take-over bid. It was a mistake to privatise Eircom because there is a monopoly on telecom provision in Donegal and companies will not go there because it is too expensive and there is no competition. That is only one aspect of the infrastructural deficit we face in terms of creating jobs. This is a serious issue. There are no announcements of major job losses in Donegal because there are no jobs.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	60	Is the Senator seeking a debate?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	61	Yes. Competition is the key and we must have a debate. Senator Bannon and Senator McCarthy raised a serious issue and the Tánaiste should come to the House as soon as possible.
#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	62	In recent weeks we have discussed the transmission of pornography via mobile telephones. Another worrying case has arisen in the past week that reflects a gap in the law. The Posts and Telegraphs Act 1951 does not apply to mobile telephones but only to telecommunications under the auspices of Bord Telecom. I ask the Leader to take up this matter with the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources because it is one thing for us to talk about the issue in this House but the onus is on us to amend the law if a gap is found as has happened in this case. An amendment to the Act would enable the authorities to apply the law properly.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	63	Once again the newspapers have featured the number of road deaths that have occurred in the past two weeks. I was approached yesterday by someone who is very concerned that when his son failed his driving test, he was told he would have to wait 50 weeks to retake it. I checked this and a person who lives in Tallaght must wait 55 weeks and a person in Raheny 54 weeks to retake the test. Those who come from outside the State cannot believe that people who fail a driving test continue to drive while they wait up to 55 weeks before they can retake the test. This is in the hands of the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government. I raised the issue two years ago and was told action was being taken on it. It clearly was not and I ask the Leader to draw the attention of the Minister to the serious nature of these delays.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	64	I ask the Leader to organise a debate as soon as possible on the Government's jobs policy.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	66	While it is unfortunate that certain jobs have not materialised because of world economic conditions, it is important that the contribution of the Government to job creation in the last seven years is put on the record. In the period before the election many jobs did materialise and it is important that we make that clear.

I am not concerned with the tax free status in that regard because it has served this country and that industry well. However, the people at the upper end of the scale seem to have vast amounts of power and money and I want the Minister to come to the House and give us a clear picture of the implications of tax measures he intends to introduce for this industry because they do not appear to be equitable or fair.

Will the Leader of the House ask the Minister for Health and Children to come to the House and address this issue because each year 50 to 60 Irish women die from cervical cancer and it is recognised that if a proper screening programme was in place, such deaths would be preventable?

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	103	We spent considerable time in this House last year debating the intoxicating liquor Bill and I am extremely concerned that a number of its provisions are not being implemented. The Minister should come to the House to review that legislation and explain why certain pubs still have happy hours when this practice is outlawed by the Bill. The promotion of alcohol in pubs by giving free drinks to customers is also outlawed, but from speaking to young people I am aware that type of promotion is still taking place.Another issue we should discuss is the drawing back on the late closing time of pubs on Thursday nights. This provision has only been applied in pubs in rural areas; one can still drink as much as one wants and as late as one wants in this city. Therefore, the Bill has been a sham. Why introduce legislation if we are not going to enforce it? The Minister needs to outline why he introduces these types of laws but will not enforce them.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	104	There are two Senators indicating that they wish to contribute and the time is almost up.

I ask that he explain why he has taken it upon himself, as is his pattern over the years, to have a slush fund at any cost and why he has failed to implement a scheme introduced in the last budget. He has even failed to provide an application form and other relevant details to the individuals who would benefit therefrom. He cannot say other than that he wants a slush fund.

I am glad the issue was raised because it is very serious. The rules governing the board that was set up were established last year and it now appears the Government wants to set these rules aside and use the funds in any manner it sees fit. This is highly inappropriate and unacceptable.I join with my colleague, Senator Bannon, in requesting that the Tánaiste come to the House to discuss the job proposals she announced on the so-called "golden Thursday" before the last general election. It is all well and good for Government speakers to stand up and try to defend her, but the fact of the matter is that 2,700 jobs were promised on that day and none of them has been delivered to date.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	120	The first speaker was Senator Brian Hayes, the Leader of the Opposition. He raised the matter of electronic voting. I would be the first to say that, combined with the work of the committee and its members from this House, the Government has shown a consensus-like approach to the issue. This was evidenced in the Dáil last night, in the proposal to set up the independent board and in other matters. However, I appreciate this House, in a general way, led the way and that it was Senator Brian Hayes who raised the issue as one of major importance last week. The issue was then raised in the Dáil, where it is the subject of this week's Private Members' motion. It shows that in a democracy both a Government and Opposition are necessary. The matter is now proceeding in a consensus-like way and we should all be glad, in the cause of democracy, that this is happening.Senator Brian Hayes also spoke about the wonderful articles being written by the journalist Carl O'Brien. We are trying to organise a debate on what appears to be the lack of places for disturbed children of a particular age who come before the courts. I hope we will have this debate the week after next, if not next week.On Senator O'Toole's point, the Seanad Office and I spoke last week to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, and to his private secretary because I said I would make a statement on the matter today. The Minister expects to announce the terms of reference and the names of the chairman and members of the review group on auctioneering very shortly — I believe it will be within the next few days. The terms of reference are being finalised and the members of the group who were chosen are being contacted. We will await developments.

I am glad the changes have come about as I had reservations. I said this here in the House, as did others. We live our lives by voting and it is important that residues of fear and uncertainty are wiped away. We are on the way towards achieving that. The Senator also spoke about the pro-worker and pro-employer legislation introduced by the Minister for Finance in regard to Eircom workers.In reply to Senator Ryan, we are not Luddites, but we were in danger of being portrayed as such, like King Canute trying to push back the tide as it rolled in. Electronic voting will now be on a far firmer footing. On the dormant accounts, as I recall that legislation provided for the establishment of an independent board to disburse those moneys. I will find out the up-to-date position.Senator Mooney talked about lo-call informer telephone numbers nationwide and wondered if these would be abused. I have personal reservations about using an informer number. However, some of the drivers who come up behind one on the road expect one to move over for them in a 60 mph zone, even when one is driving at the speed limit. I do not see why one should if one is adhering to correct driving standards.Senator Finucane spoke about the suicide incidence in Belfast and what appears to be a campaign by the INLA, with all those young people taking their own lives needlessly. Terrorism has developed in a dangerous manner and this is a terrible reflection of that development. Senator Brady spoke about the review of the drugs strategy. We will have a debate on that. It is necessary to take stock of the current situation to see what is happening.Senator Norris is in the arms of a princess in The Irish Times this morning. She is not a real princess.

This way services will become more readily available. Well done to him.On the Red Bull drink, I cannot say what is happening. We will have to await developments. Senator Mansergh robustly rebuts the allegation about slush funds. Senator Bannon spoke about the hopes and aspirations of people in Longford.

Senator McCarthy referred to the dormant funds and "golden Thursday". There is something slightly old-fashioned about announcing jobs all the time. When the full complement of jobs is not delivered, one has to pull back from the original announcement. However, the Tánaiste has done a great job on the employment front. Unemployment is currently running at under5%, which is remarkable in a period of downturn.Senator McHugh, on jobs policy in the north west, referred to a lack of competitiveness. Senator Minihan believes the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, Deputy Dermot Ahern, should be asked about an amendment to the Post Office (Amendment) Act 1951. There is much more to that issue; the safety side must also be considered.Senator Quinn talked about the delay in the driving test, which is now up to a year. This is wrong if the emphasis is to be kept on road safety. There is a strategy for ensuring tests are held at a faster pace, but this is not happening. The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, is in charge of that particular segment of transport activity, so we will invite him to address the House on the issue. Senator Dooley would like to see a debate on the Government's jobs policy. That could well be of benefit. Senator Feighan is seeking a debate on the beneficial tax implications for those in the higher echelons of the racing industry. Senator Henry is seeking a debate on the national screening strategy for women as regards cervical cancer. Senator Morrissey is also seeking a debate on jobs and has asked that the Tanáiste be invited to the House to discuss the matter. Senator Terry referred to the non-implementation of aspects of the intoxicating liquor Bill, in particular the demise of the happy hour provision which leads to unfettered drinking. I was not aware that provision was still in place. Perhaps there is a phasing out time involved.Senator Ulick Burke asked that the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, be invited to the House to discuss the disbursement of funds by the independent board under the Dormant Funds Act. I will ask the Minister to come to the House to discuss that matter. Senator John Paul Phelan also referred to dormant accounts, the Tanáiste and the jobs situation. The Tanáiste has proved very willing to come to this House. A debate on jobs, leaving aside the issue raised today, would be useful.The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, introduced legislation to deal with accounts that had been dormant for 15 years or more and from which nobody was benefiting.

The first amendment realigns lines 26 to 28 to restore their application to both paragraphs (a) and (b) of the definition of “contract of employment”.The second amendment re-inserts the wording necessary to bring discrimination prohibited by the Equal Status Act within the remit of the Equality Authority. The additional wording to this definition as provided for in section 3 of the Equality Bill will be retained.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	137	My amendment follows on from an issue I raised on Second Stage. The words I wish to be removed from the definition of employee are ", but does not include a person employed in another person's home for the provision of personal services for persons residing in that home where the services affect the private or family life of those persons;". The effect of this provision is to exclude from the protection of equality legislation, under the nine grounds of discrimination, all people employed in a person's home. I was less than overwhelmed with the Minister's explanation for this extraordinary provision when I raised the matter during the Second Stage debate. The Minister claimed this provision is a step forward rather than a step backwards because it replaces an existing exclusion which was broader in scope. He was not, however, able to dredge up an argument for inserting that exclusion in the first instance. Exclusions of that type do not make sense. Perhaps there is a logical explanation for it, but we did not hear it. The Minister's unease in this regard was demonstrated by his promise, by which I was heartened, to reconsider the section again. I believe I am pushing an open door with amendment No. 3. This is an important matter.A considerable number of people are employed in people's homes, most notably as nannies and au pairs. They are the very people likely to be discriminated against. Given that they come here from abroad, they are ripe to be exploited and, the truth is, they often are. Most of the complaints of discrimination of which I am aware relate to such people more than anyone else. It is vital we do not draw a veil over this matter on some spurious ground of preserving family life or privacy. Employment is employment regardless of where it takes place. I mentioned on Second Stage that my colleague, Senator Norris, would be upset to discover a butler or valet working in a private home was discriminated against because he was gay. This legislation would not apply to such a person because he is employed in a private home. Employees are entitled to the protection of this legislation irrespective of where they work. The notion that employment law should stop at the front door of a private house is ridiculous. I do not understand it. If that was the case, a similar argument could be made for exempting domestic employment from income tax or PRSI. We do not do that and are right not to do so. There is nothing magic about the family home or individual privacy that keeps the taxman away from such employment. Why should equality legislation be different?I would like to know from where the idea to exclude employment in the home arose. Who lobbied for this exclusion and on what grounds? On the face of it, it appears to me to be daft. It excludes from the provisions of this important legislation some of the most vulnerable members of society. I do not understand why we are doing so. I commend my amendment to the Minister and to the House. I know he explained on Second Stage that this provision came about by way of European legislation and that it weakened rather than strengthened the legislation. Perhaps the Minister has an explanation as to why this provision is being included.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	138	If Senator Quinn reads amendment No. 4, he will find that much of what he said is now irrelevant. I signalled on Second Stage my intention to bring forward this amendment to section 3(a) to ensure that the limited exclusion from what is defined as an employee for the purposes of the Employment Equality Act is further confirmed. The definition of employee in section 2 of the 1998 Act is being amended in section 3(a) of this Bill to include members and former members of regulatory bodies and to exclude people employed in another person's home to provide personal services to persons living in that home where they affect private or family life. This exclusion, which replaces more broadly based exclusions in the Employment Equality Act, is intended to strike a balance between the equal right of a person to private and family life and to equal treatment. For this reason, I propose to further qualify the exclusion to clarify that it applies only in so far as access to employment is concerned. Once in employment, this provision will not apply and any such person concerned, whether he be a gay butler or whatever, will be fully protected by the provisions of the Act.Senator Quinn's amendment proposes the deletion, from the definition of employee for the purposes of the Act of 1998, of the exclusion in respect of persons employed in another person's home to provide personal services to persons living in that home where they affect private or family life. In my amendment to this proviso, which further qualifies the exclusion to clarify that it applies only in so far as access to employment is concerned, I have outlined the reasons that this provision is appropriate. The directives recognise and provide for the need to permit differences of treatment based on a characteristic related to any of the discriminatory grounds where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned or of the context in which they are carried on, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement, provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate. General application of this principle is reflected in the new provisions proposed in respect of sections 25 and 37 of the Employment Equality Act, provided under sections 16 and 25 of the Equality Bill.The Employment Equality Act also provides for exclusions in respect of services of a personal nature or employment for a private household. Under section 26(2) of the Act, discrimination in employment on the gender ground is permitted where it "consists of the performance of services of a personal nature, such as the care of an elderly or incapacitated person in that person's home, where the sex of the employee constitutes a determining factor". Section 37(5) provides a more general exclusion in the case of discriminatory grounds other than gender where the employment is "for the purpose of a private household", which is very wide. The new provision in section 3 will replace these exclusions with a much more limited mechanism which will now be further qualified by the amendment I have tabled.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	141	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 9, to delete lines 3 to 8 and substitute the following:"(c) it shall not be lawful for an employer to require an employee compulsorily to retire from his or her employment on reaching a particular age if on reaching that age the employee is able and willing to continue in employment.”I referred to this matter on Second Stage. The purpose of the amendment is to do away with compulsory retirement ages and to stipulate that it would be discriminatory to set down such ages in employment contracts in the future.This is a matter in respect of which action is needed. I read an interesting article in a supplement of The Sunday Times which outlined the problems the UK will encounter in the future in terms of demographic changes. The article in question referred to Ireland which in terms of population replacement, namely birth rate, is not producing enough people to replace those who die. This is the general trend in Europe. The younger population of Ireland will decrease and people will live longer because they pursue healthier lifestyles. Outside of that, there is a need to take action to retain older people in the workforce.The article to which I refer mentioned that we are wasting a resource by making people retire at particular ages before they need or want to. Early retirement is available in Ireland. We have been getting rid of people with great experience, and who have made a great contribution to the economy, from the public service. We need to reverse that type of approach, both in terms of our demographic needs and also because of the positive contribution those people make to the workforce and the economy.There may be moves along these lines at European level but Ireland must show the lead in respect of this matter, which is the reason I tabled an amendment. The amendment states that employees should be able and willing to continue in employment. On Second Stage, I stated that it would be important, in terms of bringing about this change, to allow for more flexible work practices and to encourage people to change careers. We do not want people to be forced to remain in jobs in which they are not happy. It is not just to older people that more flexible work practices should apply; they should apply to people with families and those in other circumstances. I accept that the change would have to be made in that context.The amendment is based on US anti-ageism law. I do not know if the Minister of State will take it on board at this point but, for many reasons, we must begin to take action in respect of this issue in the near future. If we do not take such action, we will only compound the problems that will arise in the future. We will waste a great opportunity in terms of keeping people involved in the workplace if we do not do something.I have given further consideration to the amendment to the existing legislation which the Bill will make. I refer here to section 4(c), which the Labour Party's amendment would remove. I am not sure that paragraph (c) represents a positive amendment and I would like the Minister of State to indicate how it improves the situation as regards people over 65. I thought initially that it was a positive amendment but now I am not so sure. I would like the Minister of State to consider the Labour Party's amendment as an alternative. Senator Quinn's amendment No. 6 is somewhat similar to ours and I welcome it.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	142	I support Senator Tuffy's amendment. Ireland is behind other countries in terms of recognising the contribution older people can make to society. As people are healthier, live longer and are fitter than ever, many are capable of working beyond the retirement age. I recognise that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform has made moves in this regard in respect of gardaí, the retirement age relating to whom he is going to extend. We need to take this matter on board and deal with it when opportunities present themselves. This is certainly one such opportunity to make provision in this area.There has been a great deal of discussion about the pension time bomb This amendment represents one way of dealing with it, particularly for those people who wish to and are capable of working longer. We should not place obstacles in their way or prohibit them from doing so. Having visited the United States on a number of occasions in recent years, I was struck by the number of older people who work in many of shops, department stores and DIY outlets. That trend, which is welcome, is also beginning to become apparent here. We should embrace it and allow people to work for as long as they wish or are capable.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I support the comments of Senators Tuffy and Terry in respect of this amendment and that in my name. As with amendment No. 3, amendment No. 6 arises on foot of a concern I raised on Second Stage. I hope the Minister of State will make a little history by accepting it. I read an article some years ago which asserted that the Americans had found that if one wished to detect future trends, reading local newspapers was very effective. It was very interesting. The article said that local newspapers are very much stuck for space and have to find things to exclude. If one looks up the word "discrimination" in the newspapers of the 1950s, it will refer to discrimination based on colour. In the 1960s, the word was used to refer to discrimination based on racial grounds. In the 1990s, however, the word discrimination occurred most often in local newspapers in the context of discrimination on the basis of age. Right around the United States of America in the early 1990s laws and rules were introduced at local level to prevent discrimination on the basis of age. We have not taken that first step yet, although Senator Tuffy's amendment is an attempt to do so.I spoke about the Minister of State making history. Provisions will be made in this area and it is a question now of whether the Minister of State decides to take the first step. As I said on Second Stage, while our population is getting steadily older, we show very few signs of having come to terms with the fact. One symptom of this failure is that there is no provision in this Bill or the entire corpus of equality legislation which sets out to attack the concept of compulsory retirement. My amendment seeks to correct this position.I must make my position clear on this matter. I do not wish to raise the age of retirement as does the Society of Actuaries. While the Government is poised to introduce a measure to raise the retirement age in the public service, that is a separate matter from the one I am raising. I have no wish to force anybody to work beyond the accepted retirement age and my amendment makes that quite clear in paragraph (c). It states: “Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as interfering with the right of an employee to retire at a particular age, when such a right exists by way of contract, regulation or custom.” I am not talking about forcing anybody to work up to or beyond a certain age. I am talking about circumstances in which a person is willing and able to continue to work, but is prevented from doing so by a compulsory retirement age.People vary greatly in their wishes in this area which is precisely why I am against compulsion to regulate it. Some people cannot wait to move on to a life of retirement while others are greatly distressed at the thought of stopping work and argue that they are fully capable of continuing. Others would like to work part-time or in a reduced capacity. Senator Terry has spoken of the United States of America where it is so interesting to see the number of people who have retired from one job and are happy to work part-time in various others.Those who wish to work in a reduced capacity find that taxation and pension arrangements make that more difficult to achieve than it should be. Amendment No. 6 arises from my belief that the time has come to outlaw the concept of compulsory retirement at an arbitrary age. The key word is "arbitrary" as that is where the discrimination arises. No one would argue that older people are as physically capable as younger people. No one would argue that some extremely old people do not begin to lose some of their mental faculties. For such people, an honourable retirement is an appropriate way in which to spend their last days. No one would dispute that and my amendment provides specifically for such circumstances in paragraph (d). It states:Nothing in this subsection shall be construed as requiring any person to retain an individual in a position if the individual—(i) will not continue to undertake the duties attached to that position or will not continue to accept the conditions under which those duties are, or may be, required to be performed, or(ii) is no longer fully competent and available to undertake, and fully capable of undertaking, the duties attached to that position, having regard to the conditions under which those duties are, or may be required to be, performed.I am sorry to have gone through it in such detail, but I have taken some pains to make sure those areas are covered. To argue that at a particular age, usually 65, all people without exception become incapable of further employment is simply wrong. More to the point, it is flagrant discrimination. As such, it should feature in equality legislation which purports to remove all discrimination on any of the nine grounds. I am not arguing that abolishing the concept of compulsory retirement would achieve what is necessary to restructure our society to cope with the significant challenge of an ageing population. While making compulsory retirement illegal would be a small dot on a very large canvas, it would be a start. Its importance would be in signalling our alertness to the issue and our concern for the interests of the older members of our population.Making compulsory retirement illegal would have considerable benefits and almost no cost. At a personal level, nobody would be forced to work beyond whatever was the normal retirement age in his or her particular occupation. At a business level, no one would be forced to continue to employ a person who was incapable of performing the essential functions of a particular job. The EU directive is quite clear on this point and the wording of my amendment underlines it. To those who prefer to continue to work, this change would be a great boon. In most cases, there would be a clear benefit to the companies for which they work. To the wider economy, the benefits of having someone continue to be economically active are too obvious to require spelling out.There may be some exceptional employments in which compulsory retirement is appropriate such as those in the Defence Forces and the Garda. Senator Terry has mentioned that there has been some movement in that direction. This is why the final paragraph of my amendment specifically identifies both the Defence Forces and the Garda and excludes them from the scope of my proposals. In making these exclusions, I am trying to side-step some obvious objections to my amendment. As I said on Second Stage as well as at the outset of my remarks on these amendments, the Minister of State has an opportunity to make a little history by accepting my proposals. I hope he takes it.
#PatMoylan	unknown-#PatMoylan-party	unknown-#PatMoylan-dob	unknown-#PatMoylan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	144	The acceptance of the amendments would mean that on reaching the age of retirement, the decision would be for the individual to make on whether he or she is willing and able to continue in employment. It would be very difficult for employers if the decision was enshrined in legislation as one for the person in employment to deem himself or herself willing and able to continue. Can the Minister of State explain the position?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I am sympathetically disposed to this amendment. The case has been very compellingly put by Senator Tuffy who was ably supported by Senator Terry and Senator Quinn. Unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment today for reasons I will explain. I would love to avail of Senator Quinn's invitation to make a little history. I read in The Sunday Times the article to which Senator Tuffy referred and found it excellent. I remember several years ago writing an article on the same subject for an even better Sunday newspaper.The position is that section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 provides that "without prejudice to subsection (3), it shall not constitute discrimination on age grounds to fix different ages for the retirement whether voluntarily or compulsorily of employees of any class or description of employees". While the framework employment directive does not require it, the question of removing this provision was raised during consultations with the social partners and relevant Departments. It was also raised in this House on Second Stage of this Bill. In the consultations, there was widespread recognition that the labour force was becoming older and that the participation of older workers should be facilitated. Nevertheless, a consensus emerged that the issue went beyond employment equality policy and had broad socio-economic and industrial relations implications.Compulsory retirement ages are a feature of many types of employment in the public and private sectors. They have been established over time and, in many cases, after negotiation and collective bargaining. In the case of private sector employment, the removal of existing agreements or arrangements on compulsory retirement ages is a matter firstly for discussion among the social partners. We have agreed to enter discussions with the social partners on that very subject. In his recent Budget Statement, the Minister for Finance announced that he would bring forward legislation to remove the compulsory retirement age for new entrants to the public service. I expect that legislation to be published on Friday.I agree with Senator Tuffy's point that paragraph (c) might be a little confusing. I have read it a second or third time. Up to now, if an employer had different categories of employee, and offered those working in a machine shop, for example, a contract taking them beyond the age of 66, at which age all the other employees would retire, people working in other parts of the enterprise could then have brought a case based on the equality legislation to say they should be offered a similar facility. The net effect of this paragraph is to prevent employees taking such action. It is to enable the employer to offer contracts beyond the age of 66 to the employees believed, for example, to be the most useful to the employer.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I understand what the Minister of State says. Obviously this would need to be thought through properly, and there are implications for industrial relations, and so on. I am concerned that if one waits for all that to happen, it might be too late to do something about it. There should be some kind of timescale, and deadlines. I understand that the EU is considering a compulsory retirement age of 70, or perhaps changing it to 70. It was mentioned in an article but I do not know the details. There should be no age limit. If change is to be made, the age limit should go. I am concerned that we may let this slide. There are other matters to be considered. The one thing that is still politically correct in this country is age discrimination. The step under consideration would be a major one in getting rid of it, and would not involve costs. It would be more likely to be of benefit than of hindrance to the economy and to employers. The Minister of State spoke of discussions, but the Government should give a deadline, and put matters in train now, allowing the various negotiations in the meantime.We worry about such matters as what might happen if people from the EU accession countries come to Ireland. The article in The Sunday Times of which I spoke noted that those countries have problems too, for example decreasing population. We will face a problem in this area quite soon. If we do not act, we could face an economic crisis. I do not wish to sound as if I am thinking only of the economic aspects, as I am greatly opposed to age discrimination.There is also the matter regarding "willing and able". That relates to people working at any stage of their lives. We still retain the notion that "ability" might be slightly different when people are older. We do not do so in this House, and we need to get rid of that notion. People can have ability up to any age, or can lose it at an early age. There are many different circumstances. An older person can be just as capable of doing a job as a younger person. If one considers judges, people are wiser and have more experience when they get older. That is a very valuable asset in a workforce.

I did not ask to him to make history, as I know it is unlikely that such a big step as this would take place today. In his explanation, the Minister of State has drawn the attention of the House to the difficulties in the private and public sectors. I was impressed when he said that legislation will be introduced next Friday to the effect that new entrants in the public service will not face an age limit. I ask him to explain that so I can understand exactly what will happen this week, and what legislation if any is involved.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	148	I thank the Senators for their constructive approach, and will convey the views of Senator Tuffy to the Government. I realise the urgency of this matter, and that during the recent period of very rapid economic growth, bottlenecks developed in certain sectors of the labour market, as Senators are aware. These could have been alleviated in certain areas known to me, but for the compulsory retirement age. We saw an example in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, where we lost some of the best detectives in Limerick at a time when we could ill afford to do so, because they were obliged to retire at a certain age. The Minister is now taking action in this area.I realise the urgency, but in view of the potential industrial relations implications and the seismic change contemplated in the matter under discussion, which is engaging governments throughout Europe, it would be unwise to draw up deadlines. The Government is aware of the urgency of the situation, and I will convey the views expressed by Senators today.Regarding what Senator Quinn said, I do not want to make an announcement today on what will be contained in the legislation from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, which will be published next Friday. The Minister referred in his Budget Statement to the notion of allowing new entrants to the public service a contractual right to work beyond the traditional retirement age. The legislation will reflect that promise and will deal with ancillary matters. It will also give us a good indication where we are going in regard to the private sector. I will say nothing further about that today. I have not seen the legislation, which will be published by Friday at the latest.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	149	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 9, before section 5, to insert the following new section:5.—The Act of 1998 is amended by inserting the following section after section 7:‘Equal Pay for Equal Work7A. The Minister is committed to ensuring the adherence to, the application and enforcement of the principle of equal pay for equal work in all circumstances.' ".This is meant to strengthen the section. As the Minister of State knows, there is an established principle of equal pay for equal work across the EU. There are no provisos involved. It is a very simple principle.I spoke on Second Stage about secretarial staff members in Leinster House who sit beside one another and do not get equal pay for equal work. The Minister of State said then he would respond to me. I do not know if he has had an opportunity to look into this. The situation occurs in Leinster House and the Minister of Finance is responsible for it. We should not have pay inequality in any place where the same work is being done. I would like to see the Minister of State endorsing his commitment to equality. That is why I have tabled the amendment. I am concerned about a number of sections in the Bill which I feel will allow for discrimination, particularly section 24, to which I will return.The amendment is meant to endorse the Government's commitment to equality. I accept the Minister of State may refer me to Government amendment No. 2 which allows for the insertion of "and, in Parts V and VI, includes prohibited conduct within the meaning of the Equal Status Act 2000". I wonder if the Minister of State will say that this covers the nine grounds of discrimination. We should endorse and confirm equality in all spheres of life with every opportunity we get.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I cannot disagree with the logic of anything Senator Terry says. I agree with all her sentiments. However, I have been advised that because the proposed amendment is aspirational in character, it would not be appropriate to include it in primary legislation. The Act of 1998 is by definition an Equality Act. The provisions of the earlier gender equality legislation were enhanced and extended by the Act to eight additional discriminatory grounds with the specific provision to enshrine the entitlement to equal remuneration across these grounds, and put in place strong enforcement measures. The Act recognises that by itself, non-discrimination may not provide a sufficient safeguard to protect, for example, the right to equality of people with disabilities. For this reason, specific requirements were imposed on employers under section 16 of the Act to accommodate the needs of people with disabilities in the workplace.All good law seeks to address real issues in a way which is practicable and effective and without causing unnecessary difficulties. Section 35 of the 1998 Act recognises that there may be some cases in which a disabled employee would be excluded from a particular work arrangement if inflexible provisions are put in place. In such situations, which would arise where an accommodation of the person's special needs would not in itself be sufficient, different rates of pay may be permitted providing they match the output of the person employed. That is just in respect of that particular section. I agree with what the Senator said but it would not be appropriate to include such a provision in what is primary legislation.

This amendment seeks to make a commitment. I do not want it to be aspirational. The amendment states that the Minister is "committed to ensuring . . .". That is giving a commitment. It is not in any way aspirational. I ask the Minister to consider this matter again before the Bill goes to the Dáil, where I hope he will accept it because it will be tabled again at that time.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	153	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 12, line 12, after "on" to insert "reasonable accommodation hereafter referred to as".We want to insert the term "reasonable accommodation" in section 9 because that is the term used in the explanatory memorandum but it is also used in US law. We do not understand the reason it cannot be used in the Bill. I would like to hear the Minister's comments on it.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	154	The Senator has raised a fair point and I thank her for bringing it to our attention. She has highlighted an omission and between now and the taking of the Bill in the Dáil I propose to either accept her amendment as it is or consult with the Parliamentary Counsel to see if we can put it somewhat more elegantly. I accept the principle of the amendment.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	155	Amendments Nos. 9 and 10 are related and may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	156	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 12, lines 21 and 22, to delete "impose a disproportionate burden" and substitute "be grossly unreasonable".On Second Stage I expressed concern about the language used in the Bill, which refers to burden, disruption and detriment. Those words should be eliminated from our vocabulary when we speak about people with disabilities. An employer should not be allowed to evade his or her responsibilities to facilitate people with disabilities merely because it is an inconvenience. The hurdle should be set higher than that and obligations of this nature should only be avoidable in cases where to impose them would be grossly unreasonable on the employer. I ask the Minister to consider accepting this amendment because otherwise we are leaving it open for employers to avoid their responsibilities.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	157	I have some sympathy with Senator Terry's fears about the use of terminology like "unreasonable burden" in the context of disability but, unfortunately, I cannot accept the amendment for legal reasons. Before the European directive was transposed into law, the Supreme Court decided that extra costs cannot be imposed on employers in respect of people with disabilities other than nominal costs. Employers cannot be forced to accommodate people because of their disability if it imposes a burden on them other than nominal cost. That was the decision of the Supreme Court under Article 43 of the Constitution.The framework employment directive overrode that decision and allowed a different test, known as a disproportionate burden, which gives some more leeway to employers and improves the position of people with disabilities. In addition to using this terminology, and we are taking it directly from the framework directive, the EU Commission went on to explain what it means and set out the parameters of it, which we repeat in the legislation.We have got cover, as it were, to override the limitation put by the Supreme Court because of the EU framework employment directive. That being the case, we have to use the terminology in the EU framework employment directive, which usefully sets out what it means, and we have put that into the legislation as well.While I sympathise with what the Senator said about the terminology, and perhaps the people in Brussels did not consider that in the context of people with disabilities and the inappropriateness of the terminology, that is the terminology which overrides the constitutional restraint put on us and because of that, I could not drop it now and insert completely new terminology. It would not be sustainable.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	158	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 13, before section 10, to insert the following new section:10.—Section 16 of the Act of 1998 is amended by inserting the following subsection:‘(7) Nothing in this section shall operate to discharge an employer from his or her obligations to provide full and equal access of employment to persons with disability.'".This amendment inserts a new sub-section in section 16 of the Employment Equality Act 1998. Section 9 of this Bill goes quite a distance in relieving employers from their duty to adapt their premises for disabled people but the section goes too far in doing so. My amendment seeks to ensure that section 16 of the 1998 Act cannot be used to justify inaction on the part of the employer. It is essential that employers' premises and other public premises should be adapted to facilitate people with disabilities. That is what we would expect these days and our legislation should reflect that point.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I dislike refusing all the Senator's amendments but the difficulty with this amendment is essentially the same as the difficulty with the previous one. Section 16 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 is a complex and specific provision which recognises that additional provision is necessary to protect the rights of people with disabilities. Section 16, as amended in this Bill, will require employers to take appropriate measures in respect of access to and advancement in employment, as well as in respect of training. Unfortunately, that obligation, even under the amended legislation today which flows from the EU framework employment directive, is not open-ended. There is a limit to it. It no longer becomes an obligation at the point at which it becomes an unreasonable burden on them. The advice I have is that inserting this sub-section, however desirable it might appear, would pose the same problem as caused me not to accept the previous amendment.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	160	The Labour Party opposes this section because it is a step backwards in terms of the legislation and is a huge inroad in terms of the current ban on sex discrimination in the workplace.In section 25 of the 1998 Act, gender is a legitimate requirement only in certain limited areas — physiology, entertainment, duties outside the State, personal services, separate sleeping facilities etc. Under the Bill any ground could justify discrimination on gender grounds if it has an occupational requirement. It is just too broad. On the issue of entertainment, it is obvious why one would discriminate on grounds of gender in the area of acting. A person might choose a female taxi driver. I can understand the reasons but on the broader issue of an occupational requirement, I cannot think of any occupation where it would be a requirement to be one sex or the other. I am sure somebody will give me an example. This is opening up an excuse to people to discriminate on grounds of gender in various jobs and it will make the legislation much more difficult to implement.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Certainly on this issue, the Bill does not flow easily. I can see the sense behind what the Minister is trying to achieve, except for the phrase, "A difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to the gender ground," which the Minister might explain. In my understanding of equality legislation, no one could argue if an employer took a decision on the basis of:(a) the characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement for the post, and(b) the objective is legitimate and the requirement proportionate.If that happens to exclude a woman, no one could argue that was discrimination on gender grounds. Like Senator Tuffy, I do not understand why it has to be written in this form as a gender issue. If someone took a case and said that because of a particular gender he or she believed he or she had been discriminated against and if the employer's response was on the basis of paragraphs (a) and (b) I think the case would not stand, and rightly so. Like Senator Tuffy I am not sure exactly what is being got at here.If there was a strong lifting or reaching requirement and somebody did not physically measure up, whether a man or a woman, that could not be seen as constituting gender discrimination. If I am missing something I suspect it is around "A difference of treatment which is based on a characteristic related to the gender ground". The part I cannot understand is, "related to the gender ground". If we were to say something physical that referred to strength, would that automatically mean gender because men tend to be stronger than women? In all fairness, I do not have an objection to the issue. It is just that writing it down in this way seems be a backward move. It is not what the Minister is trying to achieve. It opens up an issue which it was unnecessary to touch. It does not add anything to the section.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	162	This section replaces section 25 of the 1998 Act. Section 25(1) refers to discrimination against A in respect of employment in a particular post if the discrimination results from preferring B on the ground, that by reference to one or more of subsections (2) to (4) the sex of B amounts to an occupational qualification for the post in question. Subsection (2) states:For the purposes of this section, the sex of B shall be taken to be an occupational qualification for a post where, on grounds of physiology (excluding physical strength or stamina) or on grounds of authenticity for the purpose of entertainment, the nature of the post requires(a) a person of the same sex as B, and(b) would be materially different if filled by a person of the same sex as A.As I understand it, the new section is trying to narrow that exclusion and allow the matter to be determined on a case by case basis. The legislation is not saying a person can discriminate against taking on a person on the grounds that they are of a particular sex but if an employer says to a person who applies for a job what they want done and that it does not particularly suit a person of his or her sex, the person can take a case against the employer. The employer will be able to plead these grounds by way of defence. Whether the defence will stand up depends on the facts of each individual case.Section 16 of the Bill replaces in its entirety section 25 of the Employment Equality Act. In accordance with article 2.6 of the Gender Equal Treatment in Employment Directive, member states may provide that in relation to access to employment or to training leading to employment, a difference in treatment based on a characteristic related to sex shall not constitute discrimination where, by reason of the nature of the particular occupational activities concerned, or of the context in which they are carried out, such a characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement provided that the objective is legitimate and the requirement is proportionate. There are many hurdles to overcome there.The gender provisions of the Employment Equality Act do not contain an exclusion of this nature restricted to legitimate occupational activities, necessitating the employment of a person of a particular sex. Section 16 of the Bill remedies this by replicating article 26 of the directive. The blanket type exemptions provided in section 25 of the 1998 Act are not permitted by the directive. The wording of the new section 25 which is being inserted here follows exactly the wording of the directive. As suggested by Senator O'Toole, we will have another look at the wording to see whether it can be done more elegantly to avoid any possible misinterpretation that suggests we are going backwards. We are certainly moving forward. We are severely narrowing that exclusion in the 1998 Act by following exactly the words of the EU directive which obliges us to do so. If we can meet the requirements of the EU directive by using more acceptable language I am prepared to have a look at it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	163	I would be pleased if the Minister would look at it again to see whether any improvement can be made, as suggested by Senator O'Toole. I still do not see that it is narrower than the original section; I would have thought it was broader. I just think it might protect people to discriminate on grounds of gender. Research has been carried out that shows men think differently from women in particular areas and that their brains operate in different ways. Somebody might use that as their characteristic and that would be a totally unjustified approach. There are different types of research. It provides a very broad area for people to defend themselves. People may use that section as an excuse and say they are covered by the way it is worded. That is an issue that needs to be looked at by the Minister.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	164	I do not think it will be an alibi for employers to open up an avenue of discrimination on gender grounds. If the employer refuses a person a job, which he advertises and is available, because of their gender and the person takes him to the equality tribunal the onus will be on the employer, provided a prima facie case is made — because of another section in the Bill — to prove that the gender characteristic constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement of the post which he is seeking to fill. He must also establish that his objective in filling that post with a person of a certain sex is legitimate and that the requirement is proportionate. There is a number of hurdles there. The message should go out from here today to anybody who thinks this gives them an alibi or an excuse to refuse people right, left and centre because he does not like people of a particular gender, whether male or female, that is not the intention and that is not what is provided for in the section. As I said to Senator O'Toole, perhaps the wording is somewhat inelegant and gives out the wrong impression; we are prepared to consider that. If some way can be found to put the matter more gently while still meeting the requirements imposed on us by the EU, we would be happy to do that. However, I want to make clear that this is not carte blanche for employers to do what they like and to re-open another avenue of gender discrimination. That will not happen. Given the manner in which the equality tribunal deals with the cases brought before it under the 1998 and 2000 Acts, I am certain it will not happen.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	165	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 17, line 26, to delete "unlawful" and substitute "lawful".This is one of the most important sections of the Bill and the one with which I am most unhappy, in particular in regard to the word "unlawful" being put into this part of the Bill, a point I highlighted on Second Stage and earlier in the debate this morning. This openly permits the payment of different rates of pay to disabled persons, which is completely contrary to the principle of equal pay for equal work and is a regressive step. I am amazed the Minister of State is going along with it and ask him to reconsider. The section lends statutory legitimacy to discrimination and represents a real avenue for the exploitation of vulnerable people who, for fear of losing their jobs, will be reluctant to complain.If we are serious about bringing people with disabilities into the workplace, we must bring them in with open arms. They are members of the workforce as able-bodied people are and, therefore, must get equal pay. One may say that in a day's work they may not be able to achieve as much work as the able-bodied, in certain circumstances. However, while we say "able-bodied", no two people can deliver the same amount of work in a day. While a more capable person might be working beside a less capable person, they would both be considered able-bodied and are not called persons with disabilities. To make a certain category for people with disabilities and to allow employers to pay them less than the able-bodied is a regressive step and one we should avoid.This is the most important section of the Bill. If we get it wrong, we will throw away an opportunity to deal properly with equality. There is no point paying lip service to equality if we are to deal with the Bill in such fashion.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	166	I have similar concerns to Senator Terry in regard to this section. In the context of the amendment, the Minister of State might clarify how employees will fare in terms of the minimum wage.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	167	While the amendment is well motivated and the manner in which Senator Terry has phrased it is understandable, I have considered this section deeply and have difficulty in supporting the amendment. The issues involved go far beyond what is contained in the amendment. One of the objectives of successive Governments has been to bring the percentage of people with disabilities in the workplace up to3%. The only areas where that has been achieved are in parts of the public service, which is a harsh reality that reflects the way the world is. In my previous life, wearing my ICTU hat, I pushed and tried through various national agreements to make the employment of people with disabilities easier. I met with great resistance from employers, not in the sense of employers being anti-people with disabilities but in terms of how they would operate in the workplace.I ask Senator Terry to give consideration to this point. While the section reflects the principle of equal pay for equal work, the amendment turns that on its head. The harsh reality of life means that in a situation where two workers were being paid the same amount and one was only doing three quarters of the work the other person was, notwithstanding that the person doing the three quarters work was a person with disability, the other person could put in a claim for equal pay. In other words, the worker doing more work could seek an additional 33% pay and would have a perfectly stateable case in that situation. Therefore, much as I dislike the thinking behind the fact that employers could make such a rule, if we accept this amendment, we would effectively slam the door on employers appointing people with disability.This is the reality I have experienced in negotiations. While employers have said they have nothing against people with disabilities and that they would try to work them into their systems, and some have, that has always been on the basis of equal pay for equal work, or some such arrangement. Despite my criticisms of employers over the years, on this issue they tend to give the balance towards people with disabilities and to make adjustments for them in that sense.I completely understand Senator Terry's point. I feel equally uncomfortable that the Bill states that it is lawful to do this. However, I support the Bill in this regard because there is a better chance of more people with disabilities being brought into the workforce under this system than if it were not in place. That is the reality I have faced all along, although I cannot disagree with any of the points in the argument made by Senator Terry, or the clear motivation that drives her to put down the amendment, with which I have sympathy and fully identify.Nonetheless, in practical terms, it is impossible to have the concept of equal pay for equal work and then to have factors in work situations which go against that, even if this favours some employees. The concept of equal pay for equal work means exactly that: if there is equal pay for equal work, the balance lies with all employees but, if there is not, once one side or another is favoured, any number of cases for demands for equal pay for other people will be opened up, and nobody will make concessions on grounds of disability. It is a complex and complicated situation and one with which we must be careful.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	168	While Senator O'Toole makes a good argument, I will support Senator Terry's amendment because I have not found that disabled people are not employed because they do less work but because of residual resistance to employing people with disabilities. There is huge resistance to employing such people, and Senator O'Toole is right in that regard. I do not know that it would improve the situation by making it possible to employ those with disabilities at a lower rate of pay. Senator Terry gave the example of two able-bodied employees doing the same sort of work, with one getting through 50% more work than the other in the time allowed. I support the Senator's amendment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	169	On Senator Tuffy's question on the minimum pay legislation, an amendment to that effect will be discussed next. We will discuss the issue then. I do not know why the amendments are not being taken together.I have listened carefully to what has been said and I agree with Senator O'Toole, who is speaking from a lot of experience, although I am not saying that other Senators are not doing so. We do not want to give the impression that the section is being included to disadvantage people with disabilities or to allow them to be treated less favourably. The  section seeks to assist people with disabilities to be given employment and to encourage employers to take them on. The effect of Senator Terry's proposal would be to remove what is intended as an enabling provision from the Act of 1998 and replace it with an inflexible and dogmatic approach. Disability is a discriminatory ground. In addition, employers must accommodate the needs of people with disabilities in the workplace. Furthermore, where an employee would still be unable to undertake employment, the provision allows an arrangement which takes account of these circumstances.The amendment to section 35(1) of the Act of 1998, which I brought forward in the Bill, further clarifies that a different rate of remuneration may be paid only where it is determined on the grounds of a lesser output of work in a particular period. I take Senator Terry's point that some people are better workers than others. I imagine that when the Equality Authority considers such cases, it will find there are many occupations where one could determine the output of the workforce as a whole but it would be virtually impossible to determine the output of particular employees, and obviously it will not apply in such cases. In the case of certain occupations it is perfectly easy to determine how much or how little each person does.As Senator O'Toole said, and as I said on the previous occasion, this legislation seeks to encourage employers to take on people with disabilities. I want that message to go out loud and clear. We are not getting at people with disabilities. We are not bringing in provisions which allow employers to treat them as second or third class citizens. We are including an enabling provision which will in some cases encourage particular categories of employers to take on people with disabilities. This is precisely why the provision is being included and why I cannot accept Senator Terry's amendment, which will leave us with perfectly just law theoretically but, in practical terms, will stop people with disabilities getting employment where they might otherwise get it. I know this from my personal negotiations with some employers specifically on this issue and the wider disabilities legislation which is being introduced shortly.

It is up to managers to ensure their workers produce as much as they can. To make this distinction is totally unacceptable. Organisations dealing with people with disabilities totally oppose this measure. While I understand what the Minister is saying, I totally object to it. It will not help people with disabilities. If the Minister of State is saying that employers will take on more people with disabilities because they have to pay them less as they produce less, it is not the type of equality people with disabilities want.Senator Quinn is a very good employer of people with disabilities. I doubt very much if he pays them less than other members of his staff. If the legislation is passed, I doubt very much he will avail of the opportunity to pay people with disabilities less, which is what the Minister of State is providing for. As it is completely unacceptable, I ask him to take time to review the issue and reconsider his position.

The proposal is off the wall. We do not live in a perfect world. The Senator is saying this is the equality we want. We will never have perfect equality, but I would prefer to have a type of equality which encourages employers to bring in more people with disabilities rather than give them the equality of getting social welfare benefits rather than gainful employment. It is absolutely wrong to say the disability organisations as a whole oppose this measure. They do not. I am in constant consultation with the disability organisations. We are preparing disability legislation and were speaking with such organisations as recently as yesterday. The majority of the disability organisations to which I have spoken see the sense in the amendment, which they agree will help, as I do. This is why I propose to leave the section as it is.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 17, before section 25, to insert the following new section:25.—Section 35 of the Act of 1998 is amended by inserting the following new subsection:‘(7) A different rate of remuneration paid pursuant to subsection (1) shall not be below the level of the National Minimum Wage in force at that time.'".Perhaps I was anticipating the Minister of State's answer and expecting he would not accept my previous amendment. That is why I tabled this amendment and believe the two amendments should not be discussed together. I am giving him another chance to recognise that people with disabilities deserve a fair rate of pay. I ask him to accept the amendment, which would ensure that people with disabilities will get nothing less than the minimum wage. This is the bottom line in regard to what is acceptable to them and which we have a duty to provide. I hope the Minister of State will accept the amendment.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I support Senator Terry's amendment because she is 100% correct. It would be disgraceful if the previous section were abused. It could be abused, as Senator Terry has pointed out, unless her current amendment is accepted. The previous section and her current amendment will provide protection. No one could accept from an employer anywhere a situation whereby people with disabilities were paid less than the minimum wage. In light of all that has been said about the minimum wage in all sorts of arguments and discussions, I appeal to the Minister of State to accept the amendment. It is an area in which Ireland has led the way in Europe. This would leave a gap which might be used or abused by unscrupulous people. However, if the Minister of State accepts Senator Terry's amendment, he will get the best of both worlds. He will get the adjustment allowed under the previous section and he will get a protection which will be provided by the minimum wage. It is a worthwhile and useful amendment which gives added value to the legislation in terms of the protection of people with disabilities. I appeal to the Minister to accept Senator Terry's amendment.

It was not intended that the provision would be used by employers to pay anyone less than the minimum wage.I thank Senator Terry for bringing this matter to our attention and I will consider the amendment sympathetically between now and Report Stage. We may come back with something the same or a slight variation but I accept the principle behind the amendment.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	181	I move amendment No. 14:
In page 17, line 35, after "by" to insert "inserting in subsection (1)(b) after ‘it takes action’ the words ‘on the religion ground’ and”.Section 37 was the most divisive section of the Employment Equality Act 1998. It was appalling that it allowed discrimination in certain instances, after a high profile discussion in which the Church of Ireland took a leading role, egged on by the Catholic Church. The Bill was introduced by the rainbow Government and passed by the coalition Government following the election in 1997. Despite the objections we raised, section 37 of the original Bill was passed because it was felt that a person running a Catholic school was entitled to ensure that its Catholic ethos would be protected. The Equal Status Bill was being debated at the same time and there was much discussion of this in both cases.I lost the argument because of support for the ethos of religious institutions. I did not oppose that but thought it could be done better in a different way. I am now trying to ensure that if legal discrimination takes place in religious institutions that would be illegal anywhere else, it must be done solely on the religious ground. My instinct is to get rid of section 37 of the previous Act but there is no chance of that so this amendment tries to confine discrimination to the religious ground. Last night "Prime Time" dealt with religion in education and this issue arose. This amendment would ensure action would only occur on the religious ground. It still protects the religious values and ethos and does not allow anyone to undermine it.The amendment rules out, however, any attempt to describe spurious activity as discrimination in favour of the ethos of the institution. It tightens up the Bill. I would prefer to get rid of the section but we have decided that such discrimination should be allowed and I am trying to keep it within the spirit of the Bill and the previous Act by confining it to the religious ground.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	182	I support Senator O'Toole on this, as I did when the Employment Equality Bill was going through the Houses. We both argued it would be unconstitutional and when it was brought before the courts, it was found to be so, which pleased us, but not on the grounds we thought. That is what happens as a result of the separation of the Judiciary from the Executive. This is important because the issue applies to schools but it also could be applied to some hospitals and we should make this as clear as possible. That is what the Minister of State would want.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	183	Section 37(1) was inserted to permit discrimination by religious bodies in certain circumstances. These provisions are not affected by the provisions of the equality directives, the transposition of which is the purpose of this legislation. Article 4(1) of the framework employment directive narrows the provisions in section 37(1).I understand what Senator O'Toole is saying but such discrimination is behaviour-related and not ground-related. If we look back to the Employment Equality Act 1998, section 37(1)(b) states that a religious education or medical institution is protected if it discriminates by taking action which is reasonably necessary to prevent an employee or a prospective employee from  undermining the religious ethos of the institution. Senator O'Toole wants to restrict action taken on religious grounds only. I will have a look at his amendment but I do not see how it adds anything to the Bill. If a person gets rid of an employee or refuses someone a job because he proposes to use alcohol or cook pork when he is seeking employment in a Muslim establishment, the decision is taken to protect the religious ethos of the establishment and it is based on his conduct. If, as  Senator O'Toole suggests, this is included in the section as discrimination on the religious grounds, I do not see how it adds to the Bill. If he can explain that, I will consider his amendment.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I understand the Minister of State's point and I agree with much of what he said. I disagree fundamentally with this section but I must accept the democratic decision of the people. If a teacher in a school of particular religion tries to inculcate the students with a different set of religious values, that is utterly unacceptable and should be a sackable offence, a view I have always held because it is on the religious ground.I will use the Minister of State's example. If a teacher in a school with an anti-alcohol ethos was discovered to have had a glass of wine at Christmas in the comfort of his own home, without trying to undermine any ethos, and some fundamentalist felt he should not have done that and sacked him, it would be completely wrong. Extrapolating from that, there could be other reasons. If section 37 is used, it should be only on grounds of religion. At present, the Bill does not prevent a person from sacking an employee for other, non-religious grounds if they are protecting the ethos of the school.The Minister of State mentioned behaviour. I accept it can be vague and people can interpret it differently, but it is also the case that in this legislation, the Equal Status Act and the Education Act there is no definition of "ethos". I made the case at the time that if there were 4,000 Catholic educational institutions in this State, effectively, we could have some 4,000 of the equivalent of the plural of ethos — my Greek is weak. This would be defined simply by the boards of management of the schools. I always felt that was wrong but that was another argument I lost here. I have to accept that but I am simply referring to it. If behaviour and ethos are vaguely defined, we need to tighten up the Bill to some extent. I accept the religion argument, to which I never objected. Parents have an entitlement to decide what type of school their children attend, whether it is denominational, non-denominational, multi-denominational or inter-denominational or whatever. That has to be respected by employees and it would be unacceptable for any employee, be he or she a teacher or any other employee, to undermine it.This proposal does not take from what the Minister of State is trying to achieve. I will be pleased if he will examine it if he is unsure about it. I do not want to insert any provision in the Bill about which he is unsure. I know what it is like to be on the other side of the interpretation of legislation when defending people or boards. We should get the Bill right. The inclusion of this amendment will mean that if employers act under the terms of section 37 of the 1998 Act, it should be on the religion ground. That does not stop them from acting on other grounds for various other reasons. There is a raft of legislation dealing with industrial relations, employer and employee relations and dismissals of all sorts. Such legislation exists and this proposal would not impact in any way on it. Some people will pick the easiest way to do something and that is wrong; they should be confined to acting in what is the correct way under the law.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	187	I do not believe it would. The authority concerned would not be justified in sacking a teacher in those circumstances because section 37(1)(b) specifically states that the action which is protected must be reasonably necessary to prevent an employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution. As the saying goes, “saying it don't make it so”.I understand what the Senator is getting at. He is trying to provide for a situation where people can only use such a defence in circumstances where the conduct legitimately undermines the religious ethos of the institution. In other words, he does not want people to be able to say that whatever about the religious ethos of the institution, we are Muslims, this guy is known to be a raving drunkard in his own private life and that is a good reason for getting rid of him. I understand what the Senator is trying to do; he is trying to tighten up the legislation.With due respect to the wording of the amendment he put forward, if I insert in subsection (1)(b) what is proposed, namely, it takes action on the religion ground which is necessary to prevent an employee from undermining the religious ethos of the institution, I do not believe that wording would improve it. However, I take the point the Senator is making. We do not want the legislation drafted in such a way that would allow people to come up with facile excuses. I do not believe the legislation is so drafted. It has stood the test of time since 1998 — we are talking about legislation that has been in operation for six years. I will give some thought to what the Senator said. I will discuss it with my officials and if we are of the view that the section needs to be tightened up, we will be willing to consider doing so.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	188	I cannot ask for any more from the Minister of State. I wish to draw out the example a little further because I believe the Minister of State is correct. We used the example of a person drinking in his or her private time and the example could also be a teacher having a child outside marriage. What the Minister of State said in response is the key to my motivation for tabling this amendment. He said it could be considered on the religion ground, on which I agree with him. However, there is a problem in that because if we do not insert on the religion ground, we are left with the possibility of the taking of an action which is considered reasonably necessary.I could mount a telling and impactful argument about the evils of drink or sex outside marriage and line up all the elders of a fundamental religion I am pursuing and say that the thoughts of having anybody who did this or that anywhere near our institution would completely undermine its ethos. Those elders could mount a strong argument and it would not be based on the religion ground, if the Minister of State knows what I mean. It would be a case of trying to use the burden of proof of reasonably necessary. Those concerned could well argue that such action was reasonably necessary if emphasis is not put on the religion ground. I accept that the Minister of State and his officials have given this fair thought and that is all I ask. I am not trying to create a problem or to pull a fast one — either it works or it does not. We should simply insert that provision. The Minister of State might reconsider it on Report Stage and I will go along with whatever he decides at that point.

In page 17, line 39, to delete "ground" and substitute "marital status, family status, disability, sexual orientation, age or membership of the traveller community grounds".This amendment seeks to make doubly sure that we do not simply use the gender ground in regard to such circumstances. I will deal with amendment No. 16 first. It is a belt and braces type amendment. It proposes inserting the words "legitimate" and "justified" to provide that the characteristic referred to constitutes a genuine, legitimate, justified and determining occupational requirement. It seeks to raise the burden of proof to make doubly sure in regard to the provision.In terms of the characteristic related to the discriminatory grounds, that should extend to all the grounds, not only the gender ground. There is no major case to provide that it should be simply restricted to the gender ground. I ask the Minister of State to consider that point.The other amendment simply provides for inserting additional words to give extra comfort on the issue. I do not believe it should cause the Minister of State too much difficulty. He might argue that it is tautologous and repetitive but the additional words proposed mean something different — they are quite simple words. The first of the two amendments is the fundamental one, which the Minister of State might have more difficulty accepting. I would like to hear his views on them.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	191	In regard to amendment No. 16, we are transposing the terminology directly from the directive. Therefore, I do not consider there is any reason to accept that amendment. We have been asked to transpose the directive, and we can go further, but, in reality, I do not believe it is going any further.This section amends section 37 of the 1998 Act to take account of the framework directive in respect of permitted differences of treatment by reference to a characteristic which constitutes a genuine and determining occupational requirement and where the objective is legitimate and the requirement proportionate. Amendment No. 15 would depart from the provisions of the directive by excluding the grounds listed by the Senator from the scope of the provision. The Senator may note that the gender ground is already excluded under section 16. If we are to exclude all these other grounds, what would the section mean? We have already taken out the gender ground and if we were to take out all the other grounds, the section would be rendered meaningless.

I listened to what the Minister of State said and I will go back and read it. I thought my amendments more fully and comprehensively reflected what is in the directive. I accept what he said regarding the additional two qualifying words in the second amendment, that because they are not in the directive they may not be necessary. That is an argument for and against that; it depends on how we do this. These amendments may not deal with what is the most important issue in the world, but I believe my amendment dealing with the grounds excluded is necessary to reflect what is in the directive. Is the Minister of State saying that the directive is fully reflected in the current wording of the section? That is what I would like to hear.

In recent years, social-type boards such as the authority have been brought within the sphere of such payments, and I propose to include the Equality Authority in this category.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	197	This amendment inserts additional provisions in section 67 of the Act of 1998 to further clarify matters relating to the Equality Authority's role in providing assistance to persons in taking proceedings under the Act. The principal new provision is contained in the new subsection (5). This makes explicit that the relationship between a solicitor employed by the authority or a barrister retained by such a solicitor and a person requesting assistance under this section is the normal solicitor-client or barrister-client relationship. This is a necessary safeguard and will remove any doubt about issues of confidentiality etc.The provision is balanced in subsection (6) with the clarification that the normal rights and responsibilities integral to the relationship between the authority and the solicitors employed by it is not prejudiced. Subsection (7) makes a further clarification to the section to remove any doubt as to how certain provisions of the Solicitors Act 1954 are to be applied in respect of solicitors employed by the authority and providing assistance to persons under this section. Section 59 of the Solicitors Act prohibits a solicitor acting as an agent for an unqualified person, while section 64 makes a similar prohibition in the case of bodies corporate. Subsection (8) defines key terms used in these provisions. In a nutshell, there is provision whereby the authority can get a solicitor or barrister to represent somebody in a case in those circumstances. The relationship between the client being helped and the barrister or solicitor employed by the authority will be the normal solicitor-client relationship. All the rules that apply to the average solicitor-client relationship will apply to that relationship.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	198	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 18, before section 26, to insert the following new section:26.—Section 69 of the Act of 1998 is amended by the addition of the following subsection after subsection (6)—‘(6A) Where an employer fails to have an equality action plan (irrespective of whether he or she had been required pursuant to this section to have such a plan) it shall be presumed until the contrary is shown in any proceedings under this Act that the employer has failed to take such steps as are reasonable to protect the employees of such an employer from discrimination."'.This amendment requires the employer to take positive action to ensure there is no discrimination against an employee on particular grounds. On Second Stage, I mentioned that we need to consider protecting employees against  racism in the workplace, particularly because we are employing more non-nationals under different schemes and by way of work permits, for example. These employees need to be protected, possibly in the same way in which we have tried to protect employees or potential employees with disabilities. The amendment obviously applies to grounds other than racism.I am interested in hearing the Minister of State's response. I am tabling this amendment as a suggestion and I am not really sure it would be the correct way to go forward. I realise it might cause problems or put a lot of pressure on the employer. However, if as a solicitor, I were representing any side of a case involving somebody who was the victim of racism in the workplace, I would always inquire into the code of practice in the place of work and into what steps were taken to avoid racism therein. This arises in some cases, such as the one involving CIE, and therefore there is a need to ensure racism and other kinds of discrimination do not occur. Everybody should know where he stands and there should be no grey area into which people could slip. This is the thinking behind my amendment.I mentioned on Second Stage that the Equality Authority stated complaints of racism are the fourth most frequent type of complaint it receives. Maybe more proactive provision needs to be included in the legislation, similar to that dealing with disability. This might be one way of doing it or maybe there are other ways — I do not know. I would like to hear the Minster of State's response to this. Has he any plans in this regard?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	199	The purpose of Part VI of the Employment Equality Act 1998 is to provide guidance to employers, particularly large enterprises, in taking a proactive approach to implementing equality legislation in the workplace. Section 69 gives the Equality Authority particular powers, at its discretion, to invite a particular business or business group or sector to carry out an equality review or to prepare and implement an equality action plan.The Equality Authority may, if it thinks it appropriate, carry out an equality review and prepare an equality action plan regarding large employers — defined as those who employ more than 50 employees — a particular business or sector. The authority has specific enforcement powers with respect to such equality reviews and action plans. The directives do not require the imposition of a duty on employers to prepare equality action plans. There is no intention in section 69 to coerce all employers to prepare equality action plans. This amendment would appear to have such an effect, unfortunately. It would undercut any legitimate defence an employer might have in answering employment discrimination charges before the Equality Tribunal.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	202	This is a minor technical amendment to the new provision in section 27(d) of the Bill, inserting a new section 75(3). The intention in this provision is to enable the director of the Equality Tribunal to issue appropriate guidelines or guidance notes to ensure that redress in equality cases taken before it is met with an efficient and fair response. It is considered that the provision, as drafted, is overly broad and more akin to the role of the Equality Authority, and it should be more clearly focused to apply to the areas of responsibility dealt with by equality officers and equality mediation officers.
#PaddyBurke	unknown-#PaddyBurke-party	unknown-#PaddyBurke-dob	unknown-#PaddyBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The director is given certain responsibilities regarding the recruitment of some members of staff and promotions. In view of the fact that the Government is setting up the new public service appointments commission, the Bill is giving considerable power to the director. County managers set up interview boards themselves as part of the drive for better local government and this caused deep divisions within local authorities. Therefore, the powers concerning the promotion and recruitment of staff should be given, in this case, to the public service appointments commission. The Minister of State should consider this in the Bill, especially because of what happened in the local authorities.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	204	It was thought, when the legislation was being drafted and this office was being created, that it was better to give the director the power to recruit the staff in view of the fact that he or she would be best qualified to decide the calibre of employee required. It is a highly specific area. However, whatever staff are normally recruited by the director will be subject to the consent of the Minister for Finance. I understand what the Senator is saying, however, and I propose to discuss that with the Minster for Finance. I cannot say if there will be any change at this stage, but I will convey the Senator's concerns to the Minister and to my colleague in the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.

In page 20, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new paragraph:"(a) by the definition of subsection (2),”.In this amendment we are deleting the provision that a discriminatory dismissal goes to the Labour Court and not the Equality Tribunal. There is a groundswell of opinion that the tribunal should have jurisdiction. I would like to hear the Minister of State's comments on that.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	207	As Senator Tuffy has said, the amendment in her name removes jurisdiction from discriminatory dismissal cases from the Labour Court. I deduce that she wants it to remain with the Equality Tribunal. The redress provided for in section 77 of the Employment Equality Act 1998 places such jurisdiction with the Labour Court for the good reason that this body has extensive statutory powers and long experience in dealing with unfair dismissal cases. In terms of equality legislation, this jurisdiction dates back to the Anti-Discrimination (Pay) Act 1974 and the Employment Equality Act 1977. It is accepted by both sides of the social partnership that the Labour Court remains the proper forum for resolutions of cases of alleged unfair dismissal, on whatever ground.

In page 20, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following new paragraph:"(b) by the insertion in subsection (3) after ‘Equal Treatment Directive’ of ‘or any other Directive referred to in the Title to the Equality Act 2004,’”.The background to this Labour Party amendment is that EU law provides that where there is a breach of a directive, there must be a right to sue in the courts. That refers to the European Court of Justice ruling in the Marshall v. Southampton and South West Hampshire Area Health Authority “No. 2” case. Under the 1998 Act, this right was confined to gender cases as those alone were covered by the directive. As EU law has extended, the 1998 Act should be amended accordingly. If it were not, the Bill could be struck down as being contrary to EU law.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I do not think so. Under section 77(3) of the Employment Equality Act 1998 the option for a claimant in a general discrimination case to refer it to the Circuit Court is available, in order to allow access to an unlimited award of compensation. This is a requirement of the gender equal treatment directive, following the 1993 judgment of the European Court of Justice in the Marshall case. There is no requirement on non-gender grounds in either the framework employment directive or the race directive for access to unlimited awards. This amendment would allow access to the Circuit Court for all employment discrimination cases. In the event that the EU Council of Ministers had intended to make available equal levels of redress between gender and non-gender grounds, it was open to the Council to make such provisions in the directives. However, we are certain the Council did not provide for this. The directives provide that sanctions must be effective, proportionate and dissuasive. I am satisfied that the existing levels of award open to the Equality Tribunal and the Labour Court in gender and non-gender cases are sufficiently high to deter unscrupulous employers and to fully compensate employees who suffer the effects of discrimination in the workplace.I understand what Senator Tuffy is saying. It looks somewhat lopsided that there is one rule for gender cases and a different one for non-gender cases. It may well be that a directive in the future may force us to make similar provisions for both. If that happens we will but, as we currently understand European law, there is no such requirement.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I move amendment No. 23:
In page 28, before section 43, to insert the following new section:"43—The Act of 2000 is amended by inserting the following section after section 2:‘Irish Language.2A. The Minister shall do all that is reasonable possible to ensure that during the Irish Presidency of the European Union, the Irish Language is recognised as an official language of the European Union.' "This amendment arises from concern for the equality of the Irish language. I am critical of the failure of the Taoiseach and the Minister for Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Deputy Ó Cuív, to have Irish recognised as an official language within the EU. It will be a long time before we can expect such an opportunity to present itself again.As I said on Second Stage, our MEPs in Europe are currently not in a position to stand up and speak in Irish if they so wish. This denies those MEPs who wish to and are capable of speaking in Irish a great opportunity to do so. It is an equality issue for many people in Ireland who see and use Irish as their first language. For those of us who would aspire to have it officially recognised, it is an equality issue. With the entry of the accession states to the EU there will be a further eight or nine languages. It is a shame that Irish is not formally recognised as an official EU language. I am asking the Minister of State to accept this amendment, if he can, and to do everything possible during the EU Presidency to ensure that Irish is recognised as an official language within the EU.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	211	The two official languages of the State are set down in Article 8 of the Constitution as Irish and English. The Constitutional Review Group, which reported in 1996 did not advocate the addition of any further languages. Irish has the status of a treaty language in the European Union. This derives from the fact that the treaties are in Irish. In the treaties, Irish is listed as one of the languages in which the text is authentic. This means that each successive treaty is published in Irish as well as in the 11 other languages — with the text in Irish being equally authentic and having equal status to those in all the other official languages.It has been the Government's consistent approach to take any appropriate opportunity to enhance the standing of Irish in the EU. It has done so in several respects, including the following: The Treaty of Amsterdam 1996 confirmed the right of citizens of the Union to correspond with any of the institutions in any of the treaty languages; and a declaration adopted in conjunction with the Treaty of Nice 2001 calls for a response to any such correspondence to be made within a reasonable period.The Irish representatives at the European Convention which negotiated a draft constitutional treaty ensured that these rights will be maintained. Additionally, at our request, an Irish language version of the draft constitutional treaty agreed at the European Convention was also prepared. Lingua, the Union's programme for the promotion of language teaching and learning, recognises the Irish language for its projects. Most recently the Government has taken steps to enhance the standing of the Irish language in the context of the reform of the staff regulations for EU officials. The Government remains committed to its policy of monitoring developments with a view to availing itself of any appropriate opportunity that may arise to enhance the status of Irish as regards the EU. Discussions between the Departments of Foreign Affairs and Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs to analyse the options available to us are ongoing. A working group has been established to analyse what can be achieved on this issue and the possibilities that exist to make progress.I understand the first meeting of the working group has already taken place. I hope these discussions will identify additional opportunities to enhance the status of the Irish language in the EU within a reasonable and practicable timeframe. With the working group already in place, it would not be appropriate to accept the amendment. My advice is that the proposed amendment is not appropriate to this Bill nor is the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform the relevant Minister in this regard. For those reasons, and not because I disagree with any of the sentiments expressed, I am unable to accept the amendment.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	212	I thank the Minister of State for his response. Why should Ireland be the only sovereign State in the EU not to have its first language recognised? That is the basis of my argument. The Minister of State said this is not the appropriate legislation in which to include this provision. I think it is as this is an equality issue. Many people who believe strongly in their first language feel it should be given the recognition it deserves. I accept the Minister's response at this stage and will withdraw the amendment although I expect it will arise again in the other House.

In page 29, lines 10 and 11, to delete "(other than a separate and self-contained part)".This amendment seeks the deletion of the words "other than a separate and self-contained part". I wonder if that provision has been thought through. What does it mean? Does it, for example, relate to a granny flat or to a granny flat with a separate entrance? An extension to one's home becomes part of the home. I do not understand the reason for this provision. Perhaps, it is political correctness gone mad. The Minister is being too particular in this regard. This provision could lead to all sorts of problems.If accommodation affects the person in his or her home, it does not matter whether it is self-contained. What is a self-contained part of the House? Is it a granny flat, an extension or one's shed? What is the purpose of this provision?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The purpose of the provision is to ensure the exclusion is as narrow as possible. Acceptance of the amendment would exclude from the provisions of the Equal Status Act 2000 the letting of separate or self-contained accommodation in the owner's home such as bed and breakfast accommodation or a self-contained apartment in a house.As Members may be aware, the Equal Status Act 2000 includes an exemption for small premises occupied by a provider or a relative. The race directive does not provide for such an exemption. However, it provides, in Recital IV, that it is important, in the context of the access to and provision of goods and services, to respect the protection of private and family life and transactions carried out in that context. The protection of private and family life is a fundamental right covered by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights. It is important that the right to non-discrimination be applied with due respect to the protection of private and family life.The Government proposal is, therefore, to provide a very narrow exemption excluding the provision of accommodation by a person in a part other than a separate and self-contained part of the person's home where the provision of the accommodation affects the person's private life or that of any other person residing in the home. The aim of the provision is to protect the privacy of persons in accommodation sharing arrangements. It is not the intention to exclude from the Equal Status Act the letting of self-contained accommodation or bed and breakfast accommodation. To do so, would be contrary to the race directive.The addition of the words "or in circumstances" appears to indicate that the section refers to the provision of any accommodation as long as it affects the person's private or family life and is not restricted to the home and not to the sharing of premises. As outlined above, the aim of the exemption is to protect the privacy of persons in accommodation sharing arrangements. It is not the intention to exclude from the Equal Status Act the letting of accommodation which is not part of the owner's home.This amendment is not consistent with the race directive and, for that reason, I am unable to accept it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	215	I am not happy with the Minister of State's response. He gave the example of bed and breakfast accommodation. Such a service could be provided in a house that is not self-contained. I am aware of situations where bed and breakfast is provided in a room of a house with the person sharing the bathroom with others. Such accommodation would not be covered by this provision. Does this provision mean that an au pair living in a granny flat could not be discriminated against even though her accommodation affects the family life of the person residing in the home? This legislation makes life difficult for those providing accommodation in extra space in their homes. This section is problematic. Perhaps the Minister of State could rethink it.Accommodation does not necessarily have to be provided in a separate and self-contained part of the House. A family with a granny flat or extension with a separate entrance, as opposed to a family whose home has no alterations, would be excluded from the protection provided in this legislation.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	216	The advice is that omission of this provision could result in our being found in contravention of the race directive which would cause grave difficulties. The legal section of the EU has made clear that there is very little room for discretion in this matter. I accept Senator Tuffy's point about the difficulty in interpreting what is meant by "a separate and self-contained part" within a family home or any type of house. There are several examples of this in revenue and social welfare law. An example is the person residing in a room or granny flat adjacent to the home of his or her son or daughter's house who applies for free electricity upon reaching the age of 66 years. The Department of Social and Family Affairs does not encounter any great difficulty in determining whether such person is occupying a separate dwelling. A separate ESB supply is not in itself conclusive.While I recognise the provision could give rise to some difficulties of interpretation, acceptance of the amendment would result in our being in contravention of the race directive and, therefore, I must ensure it remains in the Bill. There are many examples of that terminology in revenue and social welfare law which make quite clear what is intended and which give sufficient guidelines to determine whether accommodation is self-contained or separate.

In page 29, line 11, after "home," to insert "or in the circumstances".The Minister responded to this amendment earlier. I am not sure its intention is as the Minister perceives it. Acceptance of the amendment would result in a better phrasing of the sentence. It is not our intention that the provision would apply outside the home. Our amendment tries to protect the private or family life of the owner. The Minister of State indicated that, according to the EU, this is to be protected. That is the purpose of the amendment.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	219	If what the Senator is proposing was accepted, the new section 6 would read:(b) in subsection (2), by substituting the following paragraph for paragraph (d):"(d) the provision of accommodation by a person in a part of the person's home or in circumstances where the provision of the accommodation affects the person's private or family life or that of any other person residing in the home, or”.Instead of creating the dual requirement, the amendment, as drafted, would create an either-or requirement. That would not be acceptable.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I move amendment No. 26:
In page 29, lines 25 to 31, to delete all words from and including "she—" in line 25 down to and including "grants" in line 31 and substitute the following:"she requires persons who are not EU nationals or refugees to fulfil reasonable requirements in respect of length of residency in the State".This amendment means that the practice of continuing to have non-nationals discriminated against regarding third level grants will remain in place. No one wants to try to arrive at a situation where people from all over the world flood the country and apply for grants to attend third level institutions. However, we could take into account the residency of non-nationals in this country. That is what the amendment suggests.I am grateful to FLAC for drawing my attention to a ruling by the equality tribunal on 28 May 2003. A case was brought by FLAC on behalf of two complainants, both of whom were permanently resident in Ireland together with their families and had been here for a considerable number of years. The equality officer's decision stated:Clause 4.4 of the Maintenance Grant scheme for Students states that candidates must hold EU nationality or have official refugee status in order to qualify for a grant which, in my opinion, is clearly contrary to the Equal Status Act's prohibition of discrimination based on nationality . . . I consider that a continuing discriminatory rule still exists and accordingly in the interests of preventing future unlawful discrimination, I would suggest that clause 4.4 be annulled completely rather than simply being disapplied as the need arises. I would also recommend that the Department, in designing grant schemes in future should take full account of the provisions of the Equal Status Act 2000.It is disappointing that no account has been taken of the equality officer's recommendation that the grant schemes be amended to make them non-discriminatory. The Government has instead chosen to approach the matter by amending the Equal Status Act to allow the discrimination to continue. While I understand that there could be legitimate concerns about a potential strain on the grant schemes caused by people coming to this country for the specific purpose of availing of education, the imposition of a blanket nationality clause is both disproportionate and discriminatory. As I have suggested, alternative restrictions such as residency requirements could adequately deal with any potential abuse.I ask the Minister of State to consider this matter carefully because the provision will not apply to a huge number of people. As the equality officer stated, it would be better not to have this discrimination at all rather than applying it on a once-off case basis whenever such cases arise.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	221	Section 45 provides that the Minister for Education and Science does not discriminate where he or she restricts the making of higher education grants to EU nationals or provides for the payment of grants at different rates as between nationals and others. There is no reason that the State, in a situation of finite resources, should subsidise by way of grants attendance at third level courses by non-EU nationals to the same extent as it subsidises Irish and other EU citizens. The Equal Status Act 2000 already provides for different treatments in terms of charging fees for third level education between EU nationals and others. As such, the same requirements should also apply to the provision of grants. No other member state has such a wide system of student support and it was considered that paying grants to all-comers could place intolerable strains on the student support system and might act as an incentive for non-EU nationals to come to the State.A refugee is a person who has been granted refugee status here. Such a person is entitled to the same rights of education, health and housing services as Irish citizens, including third level grants. It is open to persons who are not EU nationals and who have been resident in the State for some time — I will explain the rules in this regard if the Senator desires — to apply for naturalisation and, if granted, who would meet the nationality criteria for grants. Under Irish citizenship law, there is no exclusion from Irish citizenship for persons who hold citizenship of another state. Thus, for example, those who apply for naturalisation are not required to renounce any other citizenship they may hold.The effect of Senator Henry's amendment would be to prohibit the Minister for Education and Science from restricting grants to EU nationals or from paying grants at different rates as between EU nationals and others. As matters stand, the Government is not disposed to accept the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I am disappointed because I would have hoped the residency requirements could have taken account of that. After all, a person's family may be paying plenty in taxes to the State. I accept that naturalisation is a possibility for people. However, those I know who are involved in pursuing this avenue will be mature students by the time they apply for grants because the naturalisation process takes so long to complete. In view of the fact that I suggest that residency should be an important factor, will the Minister of State reconsider the position before Report Stage?
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	223	I will do so.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	224	I support Senator Henry in terms of what she is asking the Minister of State to do. I understand his explanation that we must differentiate and we already do so because we charge much higher fees to overseas students. It goes without saying that the process could not be open-ended. However, Senator Henry is correct. My county council allows people with certain residency requirements to go on the housing list. These people are still discriminated against but they are at least allowed to apply and, in due course, they will have the opportunity of getting a local authority house. There is a need for something similar in respect of third level grants. If we allow people to stay here who do not necessarily apply for Irish citizenship, we should permit them to take up education and training. We should encourage them to do so because it would allow them to participate in our economy to the best of their ability. The Government should consider this matter and Senator Henry has given an indication of the way forward in that regard.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I would be grateful if the Minister of State would consider the position. These cases tend to crop up from time to time in awkward circumstances. For example, I dealt with one such case where the mother was an Irish national living here while the father was a non-national living abroad. He was sending money from abroad to pay the fees of four children. The fees charged to non-nationals are huge. A disruption occurred in the country where the father of these children was working and there was no possibility of sending any money at all out of it. The institution involved looked kindly on the plight of the last two children who were still in college in view of the fact that such a huge amount of money had to be paid.Residency could be looked at as an important factor and I am grateful for the Minister of State's commitment to consider the position. I do not believe that there would be vast numbers of people involved. The people to whom I refer are paying tax and high fees in this country and the position could be the same with many others.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	226	I understand that there are hardship cases. My understanding is that there is general unhappiness among third level students about the level of grants. The Government recognises that to some extent and wishes to concentrate resources on increasing the rate of the grants for those who are already entitled to them, namely Irish and EU nationals. However, I understand Senator Henry's point of view and I recognise that some of the people to whom she refers may have parents or relatives who are resident here and paying tax. I will examine the matter although I cannot promise anything.

In page 30, paragraph (a), lines 19 and 20, to delete “, or made otherwise by a public authority,”.This is another area in which a small number of people seem to be excluded from the protection of the Equal Status Act. They are asylum seekers. They are lawfully in the State but they lack legal status within it. They are very vulnerable in dealing with public authorities as defined under the Bill which is very wide. I would be grateful if the Minister of State could see his way to taking into account the residency of people within the State given the great degree to which the legislation is open to interpretation. The term "public authority" is open to wide interpretation and community welfare officers and NGOs have consistently expressed concern about differential treatment of asylum seekers in the social welfare system. An example is the payment of reduced supplementary allowances.The provisions of section 47 will create another area in which asylum seekers will be differentiated on the grounds of nationality and denied the full protection of the Equal Status Act 2000. It will open the system to significant discrimination by health boards and other agencies if this section is included in the Bill as suggested.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	229	As I understand it, this section seeks to allow for direct provision, which is the system we operate, of accommodation and assistance to persons who have applied for asylum status and are awaiting decisions. The section does not permit discrimination in the provision of goods and services to anyone in the State on the basis of race or nationality. However, section 47 clarifies that any decision taken in the context of asylum and immigration applications is not open to challenge under the Equal Status Act 2000. This is implicit in the existing Act because permitting entry to and residence in the State is not a service within the meaning of the Act. Moreover, treating persons differently on the basis of their legal status — that is, distinguishing between those lawfully and unlawfully resident in the State and those seeking asylum and those granted it — does not constitute discrimination on the grounds of race or nationality.I draw the attention of Senators to article 3 of the race directive which states that the directive does not cover differences of treatment based on nationality and is without prejudice to provisions and conditions relating to the entry into and residence of third country nationals and stateless persons on the territory of member states and to any treatment which arises from the legal status of the third country nationals and stateless persons concerned. In the Equal Status Act, discrimination on grounds of nationality is outlawed which goes beyond the requirements of the race directive.Senator Henry proposes the deletion of the phrase "or made otherwise by a public authority". I cannot accept the amendment as to do so would cast doubt on the exemption for non-statutory schemes governing non-nationals, including schemes of direct provision for asylum seekers. I do not accept Senator Henry's second proposal to remove from the definition of "public authority" paragraphs (i) and (j) referencing companies. To ensure the exclusion is all encompassing and as the definition of “public authority” used in the Bill is similar to the definition used in the Waste Management Act 1996 and the National Cultural Institutions Act 1997, I do not propose to accept the amendment.

In page 7, between lines 28 and 29, to insert the following subsection:"(3) As soon as may be after the passing of this Act, the Minister shall prepare and lay before both Houses of the Oireachtas, a statement as to the implications of introducing a system of registration of guardianship orders and agreements".I welcome the Minister to the House. The purpose of the amendment is to stimulate discussion on this matter. We have all been lobbied at some length by associations representing natural fathers and I broadly support their pleas. I would like to know the Minister's thoughts on this amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	246	Amendments Nos. 3 and 28 are in my name and that of Senator Cummins. They relate to a fundamental issue on which many Senators have received representations from a wide number of groups representing unmarried fathers and mothers.Amendment No. 3 seeks to include after the word "adoption" the word "guardianship". Senator Cummins and I propose that change in order to bring a new definition to the Bill and to bring into being a new registration for guardianship orders, which have been granted for the past ten years or so. In amendment No. 28 we go further, proposing a new section urging the registration of guardianship. I have read the Minister's remarks on this matter in the other House, where she will no doubt agree that a very interesting debate took place. I commend the Minister on many of the initiatives she is taking in the Bill, but there is nevertheless a good deal of public concern about the fact that while we are putting in place a registration procedure, we are excluding the issue of guardianship, which to many people is "a life event" and very significant in their lives as a result of orders obtained.Before the legislation brought to the House by former Deputy and Minister for Equality and Law Reform, Mervyn Taylor, it was the case that in order for guardianship to be recognised by the State, a father and mother had to go to court to have it determined. The decision would be set out by the court in a very prescriptive form. As I understand it, since the 1997 legislation, it now falls within the responsibility of the father and mother to determine the issue themselves, entirely outside the courts. That is a very good development because, as the Minister knows, there is no legal fuss or cost involved and perhaps through a peace commissioner people can have a guardianship order recognised and signed.In my constituency clinic last Saturday I met a group of men who are concerned that if guardianship orders are not recognised in the context of this Bill, a whole range of difficulties and concerns that we may not have considered may open up. There is a necessity to do something about that.Let us consider the following scenario. An unmarried mother and an unmarried father have a child. Some years later they agree on guardianship. They both have that document but let us assume he loses the document and there is a further deterioration in the relationship between the two parties. If that unmarried father does not have access to the document originally obtained under what I believe is the 1997 legislation, he has no proof that such an order was granted.There are some practical outcomes if this measure cannot be brought forward. For instance, if the father wants to take the child out of the jurisdiction, as I understand it, under guardianship the father and the mother must agree to that. However, if the unmarried father does not have a document stating that, for one reason or another, and the woman refuses to acknowledge guardianship, there is no standing for the unmarried father in the eyes of the law.To take another example, a mother could put her child up for adoption. If the unmarried father has guardianship I would have thought his views on the matter are fundamental as to the future of the child, yet if he does not have access to this document for one reason or another he will find it difficult to prove that. The same is true for health information. I have come across a number of cases in my constituency whereby the father wants access to the reports of a child in State examinations or in-house examinations in schools. Has he the right to obtain those if he does not have the document so described? It is good for a whole range of reasons to put this into the legislation as a first principle.The Minister stated in the other House that guardianship is not a life event; I believe that is the term she used, but I remind her that when the Bill was published the explanatory memorandum stated that apart from providing a record of vital events in relation to persons living in the State, these records also satisfy the need for evidence which has a bearing on rights, entitlements, liability, status and nationality. The Minister has conceded in the explanatory memorandum that rights flow from many of the agreements we make.It is good practice to stitch these guardianship orders, which the law wisely has facilitated, into the legislation and, from now on, register those with the registration procedures in the State because it is not sufficient simply to have the name of the father on the birth certificate. If the father has guardianship it implies not just rights for him, and we will come to that in another section, but it implies obligations on him by ensuring the State has a system of tabulating these guardianship orders. From a public policy perspective we need to know that information. I am not sure how many of these guardianship orders have been granted since the legislation was introduced. No one knows because no one keeps a record of it but we now have a chance to modernise our national records and with these guardianship orders, that should be the case.I apologise for going on about this matter but I have strong opinions on it. I want to read a statement from Treoir, which is the national federation of agencies which provide services to unmarried parents and operates a national information centre for unmarried parents and those who work with them and, through this service, the regular communications with member organisations. I am sure the Minister will welcome this statement. It states:Treoir welcomes the legislation to modernise the civil registration system but there is a number of issues which are of concern to the organisation . . .Joint Guardianship by Agreement — register:There has been a missed opportunity in the Bill in that it does not allow for the setting up of a system of registering Joint Guardianship Agreements... [that was following the 1997 legislation to which I referred]. These are statutory agreements which unmarried couples can sign in the presence of a peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths agreeing to joint guardianship of their child as unmarried mothers have sole rights and fathers have no automatic rights. There is no obligation on the peace commissioner or commissioner for oaths to record such agreements. There is no central register for such agreements and we believe that a facility for registering such agreements should be included in the Civil Registration Bill.Over one third of children are born outside of marriage and many of the fathers of these children rely on such agreements to acquire and prove guardianship rights of their children. In case of dispute between parents the only record is a copy of the document and if this is mislaid there is no way of establishing that such an agreement was made.This is not just an issue that many men's organisations have brought to colleagues' attention. It is an issue which those who work with unmarried parents have identified through the Treoir organisation.We have a responsibility to move with the times on this issue. The Minister said she is consulting with her colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, on the matter. We now have an opportunity to insert this provision in the legislation from day one. Many people would be very grateful for that because in the natural course of events relationships break down and become acrimonious, with one side saying this and the other side saying that. It is difficult to work out who is telling the truth in the whole saga and I would have thought it sensible that we would have a national register for these guardianship agreements which the courts could then refer to because the Minister states, in the explanatory memorandum, that the records satisfy a whole range of other rights. We have to keep that in mind. I apologise for being so long-winded.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	247	I, too, support the call for a central register of joint guardianships. As Senator Brian Hayes said, one third of children are born in this State outside marriage and therefore we are talking about a considerable number of cases. It is important to remember that this provision could be vital for the father, the mother, the child and their extended families. I hope the Minister can accept one of the amendments.I spoke on Second Stage about another group of children I am concerned about but I did not hear the Minister's reply. It concerns the position regarding children who were born to surrogate mothers abroad and brought back to this country. As the Minister is aware, there is quite a number of such children who have either been born in the United Kingdom or the United States; I do not have any knowledge of children born in any other country. I would have thought we have a serious problem regarding the register these children are on because they have not been born and registered here. There is a problem regarding adoption because, with surrogacy, money has changed hands and as the Minister is aware, under the Adoption Acts money cannot change hands. Perhaps the best option is to have the parents made joint guardians of these children and have them on this register.I know of a number of cases where the biological father, whose sperm was used in pregnancies which took place — one in the United Kingdom and one in the United States — had a court order that he is the guardian of the child but that leaves the mother here, who is bringing up that child, with no legal rights over the child. Perhaps we could do something about that here and have them in a position of joint guardianship by agreement. I am not talking about half a dozen cases. I am talking about quite a number of children by now. I do not know how they are managing because with the joy of the child arriving, and it must be remembered that this has only been happening for five or six years, little thought is given to what will happen in the future about inheritance and so forth. If the parents are killed in a car crash, will the child be viewed as a stranger and have to pay an enormous amount of inheritance tax? There are many difficulties here which are not being considered. Senator Brian Hayes and Senator Cummins raised the more common situations. One of the reasons I was keen to try to get the register of guardianships set up was that this matter needs to be addressed now. I have met some of these children. Unless the adoption laws are made fairly elastic, I do not know how they are to be dealt with except under joint guardianship. I would be glad to hear the Department's views.

It will be a missed opportunity if we do not act now. The Bill is an opportunity to set up a register of guardianship. I firmly believe it should be done now and I hope the Minister will accede to our request.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	250	The Minister is looking at them.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	251	I appreciate there is some written opinion by some journalist who has a particular issue with this legislation personally and, as a consequence, it has got a good deal of airing. Senator Brian Hayes said the explanatory memorandum reflected the issue of bestowing rights as a consequence of life events. That is true, but it only reflects the life events referred to in the legislation. It would be the considered view that guardianship is not a life event. It may be something that happens during one's lifetime but it is not necessarily a life event. Much discussion has taken place on it. The Guardianship Act 1964 provides for the declaration by the mother and father in relation to the guardianship of a child through a notary public, commissioner for oaths or a PC. It is stated in big writing on that piece of paper that it is a legal document and should be looked after and cared for. I assume that anyone who has guardianship of a child would, by right, lodge that document with their solicitor to keep it safe because on many occasions there are acrimonious situations at a later stage.Guardianship can also be determined by the courts. The Ard–Chláraitheoir never had any function in the registration of guardianship orders granted by the courts or in any of the other statutory declarations. The registration of life events, for example, births, deaths, marriages, is a compulsory act. There is a penalty for failing to do so.I appreciate where Senators are coming from on the basis of the changes in society, life changes, life event changes, relationship difficulties and the responsibility of guardianship. On that basis I wrote to my colleague, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, given that he, through the Courts Service, provides registration for divorce and would have records of guardianship orders, arising from the courts, asking if he would consider making the declarations available in the same way as court orders are available. On the issue of surrogate mothers——

Given that we recognise British birth certificates, the involvement of the Ard Chláraitheoir is something we would query because the child has actually been registered and has a birth certificate. The Senator is talking about a child who has been adopted as a consequence or who has, perhaps, circumvented the legal——
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	254	The child cannot be adopted because money has changed hands. The adoption legislation provides that money cannot change hands. The woman here — and perhaps the man — is not in a position to adopt. This happens particularly if the man's sperm is used and the biological mother of the child is in England, but the woman who is bringing up the child is back here in Ireland and has no rights to that child. Could a joint guardianship arrangement be made in that case?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	255	We are getting ourselves into an area well outside the parameters of this legislation. Our only focus would be on the basis that the child would have a birth certificate. What the Senator is speaking about is a legal quagmire.

By right, if anyone accepts money for a child — we all have our views on that issue — that child probably would be in a legal limbo because if the biological father's name was on the birth certificate, then that child would have a father.

One cannot quench the fact that one has ever been a mother in this world. It leaves that child in a legal limbo. I am speaking off the top of my head and I am not a legal person. If one is talking about the real father of the child and the wife of the father, I assume they would get legal advice on the basis of guardianship. I am not sure whether that stands up. Equally, there could be a issue in five or ten years as the birth mother may come back and look for that child.

What we are looking at is an issue which is well beyond the realms of this legislation, although there is obviously an issue there. All we can do is draw to the attention of the Ard Chláraitheoir that there is an issue, especially on the basis that the child has a birth certificate and the legalities of where that child stands, and more particularly where the woman stands with regard to her guardianship of that child and whether she can legally take up the guardianship order. That is an issue on which I am not competent to advise. I am sure that is an avenue available to people to take out guardianship but I am not legally qualified to give an opinion on that issue.On the basis of the legislation, the child has a birth certificate. It is a legal birth certificate and whatever information is on that birth certificate would be legally held and acceptable to the Ard Chláraitheoir. The issues raised would need more than five minutes reflection on the floor of the House. Certainly it is an issue we may have to look at in the future. On the basis of this legislation, as it stands, it is more like the Guardianship Act or succession legislation which is outside the parameters of this legislation and is, perhaps, an issue for the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	268	I was the spokesperson on social welfare in the last Dáil. The dilemma sometimes is that in Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Acts these matters are stitched on at the end.The argument of this House is that there is an opportunity in the context of this Bill — it has been many years coming and to the Minister's credit she has produced it — to get this right now rather than stitching it on in years to come. The Minister stated in regard to my amendments Nos. 3 and 28 that she is considering the issue in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. She also stated that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform may deal with this in the Courts Service Bill. However, that only affects guardianship orders which come before the courts. The majority of new guardianship orders — I do not know how many because nobody has evidence on total numbers — which we encourage unmarried mothers and fathers to make with each other, are made outside the courts. Even if the Minister amends the Bill she refers to in conjunction with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, it will only deal with matters before the courts. It will not deal with the new regulations of guardianship which have come about since the introduction of Children Act 1997.We have an obligation to get this right now. The definition of "events" for the purposes of the Bill includes adoption, foreign adoption, marriage, death and decree of divorce. However, the Minister cannot create a value judgment that guardianship is less important to a person or has some sort of second class status in the context of life events. To a man not married to a woman but who has a child with her, it is just as important as adoption or the issue of stillbirth.We should get away from the notion that we are creating different divisions of life events. The objective of this legislation is to modernise civil registration and to take account of the new life events provided for in previous legislation. I do not accept the argument that in some way guardianship is outside the remit of a life event, as the Minister has described. I reiterate that it is fine for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to change the Courts Service Act 1997, as we would then know of all the guardianship orders going through the courts. However, we will not know of all the guardianship agreements between unmarried mothers and fathers and, consequently, it will undermine the State's claim that men have an obligation to their children.We should encourage people to take full and active part in and responsibility for the rearing of children, in particular men, some of whom do not take any such responsibility. While I suspect we will have a debate on section 22 later as it concerns a related point, the State has an obligation in regard to all aspects of legislation to state that it is encouraging people to seek guardianship and, if that happens, that the State will register this in the national civil register, which has been in existence since the foundation of the State and before, and that the State will recognise this as a life event. That is not difficult to accept.I appreciate the Minister's dilemma in that she is in discussion with the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform on this issue. However, it is a serious matter, in particular for men who want to stay close to their children but for all kinds of reasons, such as the breakdown of a relationship or otherwise, cannot. We must be mindful of this as we try to modernise this legislation.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I can understand the Minister saying she is not competent to discuss this matter as it is difficult to find anyone who says they are. However, it is a real problem. Can the Minister and her officials reconsider the issue of the guardianship register? The orders made in court are already written down somewhere.

I hope the Minister can revisit this issue, in particular as it involves so many children and parents and not a small isolated group.To return to the matter of the other small isolated group to which I referred earlier, they will not be isolated for much longer as they will be a much bigger group. I would be grateful if the Government would address this important matter because issues may arise where parents split up and a person finds he or she has no rights to a child, or where there is a tragic accident in which the parents are killed and the child is left in a legal limbo. From a general point of view, I hope the Minister can accept one of the amendments regarding a guardianship register.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	272	I know the orders dealt with in court are registered and available. I have spoken to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform regarding the statutory declarations being made available on a register similar to that for court orders. The issue of compulsion is a problem for us in the context of this legislation because any agreement is a voluntary act between two people. However, as I have said, I have spoken to the Minister on the basis that he would facilitate the statutory declarations being made available in a similar manner to the court orders. While we cannot compel people to do that as it is a voluntary agreement between two people, the Minister and I are discussing its facilitation. I brought the views of the lower House to the Minister and can do the same in regard to the discussions in this House.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	273	That would facilitate duplicates of the original form being made available.

In page 15, subsection (1)(b), line 38, after “State” to insert “or to which section 26 or 27 applies”.I understand the register of births covers children born in the State and additional cases where children are born outside the State, for example, where children are born to Irish citizens resident outside the State such as members of the Defence Forces or Garda Síochána serving abroad, or otherwise, or where children are born on aircraft travelling between airports or on vessels between ports. Provision is made for registering such births in sections 26 and 27.I understand the Minister accepted an amendment in the Lower House in regard to provision for foreign stillbirths. Perhaps the Minister will explain why she accepted the amendment. There is a difference between the wording in 13(1)(b) and 13(1)(a) regarding the reference “or to which section 26 or 27 applies”.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	281	The Senator will be aware that a number of issues arose. Perhaps he is not aware that the registration of a birth on an aircraft and ship was an issue for parents who are not Irish born. One of the reasons for bringing the legislation to the House quickly is that an issue has arisen and the Supreme Court is awaiting our decision.The problem was that births and stillbirths abroad, apart from births to members of the Garda and the Defence Forces, could not be registered except in a situation whereby similar registration to that which applies here was not available outside the State. At the time we omitted stillbirths. We all appreciate that stillbirth is a terrible trauma for a family. It had not been included in a similar way to all births, therefore, we accepted the amendment to ensure that births and stillbirths get equal recognition throughout the legislation. The registration of a stillbirth on a boat or aircraft was not previously included, but we have now decided to include it for the sake of equity. This creates exactly the same legislative framework for births and stillbirths, which the Lower House asked me to accept.

It is just a matter of the difference between the wording in 13(1)(a) and 13(1)(b). Obviously it is a very sad issue and we owe it to these people to emulate in this House what happened in the Lower House.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	287	Section 27(6) addresses the Senator's concerns. It reads as follows:Subsections (1) to (5) apply to the stillbirth of a child as they apply to the birth of a child and, accordingly, references in those subsections to birth or births shall be construed as including references to stillbirth or stillbirths, respectively.What the Senator is seeking in section 13 is included in section 27.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	292	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 20, before section 18, but in Part 3 of the Bill, to insert the following new section:18.---(1) the Minister shall establish an advisory body, to be known as the Civil Registration Advisory Body (and referred to in this Act as 'the Advisory body'), to advise an tArd-Chláraitheoir and an tArd-Chláraitheoir Cúnta in their exercise of the powers and duties under this Act:(i) on all matters affecting civil registration, and(ii) about the provision of service by an tArd-Chláraitheoir, and the use of such by the general public, and(iii) about the care and preservation of any and all records held in the care of an tArd-Chláraitheoir.(2) The Advisory Body shall consist of a chairperson and not more than eleven other members (who shall not be entitled to draw any expenses or other financial remuneration from the public purse), appointed by the Minister on such terms and conditions as shall be determined by him or her.(3) (a) The members of the Advisory Body shall include at least one member from each of the following bodies, organisations or interest groups:(i) Adopted Peoples Association;(ii) Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland;(iii) Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations;(iv) Genealogical Society of Ireland;(v) Irish Family History Society;(vi) Law Society of Ireland;(vii) National Archives of Ireland;(viii) National Library of Ireland;(ix) Public interest nominee.(b) An tArd-Chláraitheoir shall be entitled to attend meetings of the Advisory Body.(4) The Minister may at any time terminate the appointment of the chairman or any other member of the Advisory Body.".This amendment seeks to establish a civil registration advisory body. Advisory bodies are very common. For example, the National Archives of Ireland has one, the National Library has one, while the general registration office, which will have the largest and most complete set of data relating to people in Ireland, does not have an advisory body. Given that it is a most important institution from the point of view of the general public, I thought it would be useful if there were a body to which citizens could appeal if they felt there were inadequacies in the way they were being treated.The Minister said in the select committee that she would set up two non-statutory central panels, one to cater for general registration and the other focusing on family research. While these would be very worthy bodies, it would be better if there were a statutory civil registration advisory body, which would have a bit more power. It is not as though I am seeking something expensive. They are barely able to get a cup of tea and they can just meet approximately a couple of times a year. It would be useful to have such a body which could comprise a wide number of other bodies, including the Adopted Peoples Association; Association of Professional Genealogists in Ireland; Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations; Genealogical Society of Ireland; Irish Family History Society; Law Society of Ireland; National Archives of Ireland; National Library of Ireland and a public interest nominee.I would have thought that such a body could be very useful. I hope the Minister will consider favourably my amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	293	I support Senator Henry's amendment. We will not get a chance for another 15 or 20 years to get the general statutory provision for civil registration right. As I said earlier, rather than having civil registration added at regular intervals by way of social welfare Bills that come before these Houses, it would be sensible to provide for it on a statutory basis. I concur with Senator Henry's remarks.The Minister referred to the fact that she will establish two panels. When does she expect the panels to be established and to be up and running? What precisely will they do? The members of the advisory body set out by Senator Henry encompass all the interested parties in this matter. This would not register with many people but those who are interested are experts and perform a public service, whether they are involved in the GRO or in these organisations, and we should recognise their work in a statutory format. I can point to countless examples in other legislation where Ministers have put such bodies on a statutory footing and they are totally independent of Government.This amendment has merit. The Minister might not accept it on Committee Stage but she could table her own amendment on Report Stage. Given the work these bodies do and the service they provide, they should be recognised in legislation. There is no reason why we should not take this route.

As Senator Henry explained, there are two dimensions to the legislation, the strict original purpose and the social dimension of family history and research. There is merit, however, in the Minister's approach of keeping the system on an informal basis. There is no dispute about the principle but once a statutory advisory body is set up——
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	295	It can be awkward.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	297	I support this amendment. The body should be established on a statutory basis because advisory bodies can be ignored and statutory authorities lead to greater accountability. People may feel an advisory body exists for consultation alone and that there is no obligation to take the advice it offers. The Minister should consider establishing a statutory body to deal with the matter.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	298	The Senators sell themselves short as advisers to the Government and as public representatives. It is obvious from the comments today that the lobby bodies have done their bit to influence Members to put forward their views.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	300	As many Senators know, there are advisory bodies in the Department that come together on an ad hoc basis. We have always been of the view that quality customer service is vital. One of the difficulties with Committee Stage is that there has been a pre-emptive strike on what I wish to do.Within the General Registers Office we are now monitoring the levels of service delivery against defined, published targets and obtaining feedback from customers on service delivered and future service requirements. That is an integral part of the commitment on the delivery of quality customer service. It is also proposed to establish a customer consultation framework and from that we would facilitate and encourage customer feedback on the levels and quality of the customer service being provided. It will enable customers to raise any issues or areas of concern, to suggest ways in which the service can be further improved and provide input into the future developments of the service, including the most appropriate use of technology.The consultative panels are important and we will consult the organisations mentioned by Senator Henry that are in touch with the Department on an ongoing basis when it comes to the future of our service delivery. We will establish a customer service side and a professional side to look at the family genealogy side of service delivery as well as the normal service delivery.The panels established in the Department in recent years have been excellent. People are chosen randomly and invited to participate in a forum. They are asked about the service that is being provided and to give their views on its service. There is good interaction between the staff of the Department and the customer and most people have enjoyed the opportunity to give their views. The Department recognises that there is a specialised group with a particular interest in the running of the General Registers Office that we would want to give it an opportunity to interact on a regular basis with the Department.I do not like establishing statutory advisory bodies, however, because they often go beyond their remit and lose sight of the genuine concerns that would be raised in the Houses. I prefer a more targeted approach through the service delivery models. That is why it took so long to get this legislation ready — the consultation that took place was time consuming and widespread. There is good interaction between the organisations and the General Registers Office. The ethos of the amendment is being addressed in the proposals I have made in the Department.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Before I was elected to the Seanad, as a doctor I was tortured by people asking questions about social welfare. When I entered the House it was worse. Then, seven years ago, the queries stopped. I thought they had realised I had no power or influence but then I discovered that the Department of Social and Family Affairs had been touched by an angel of some sort and there had been training in customer service because people were getting answers to their queries. There is now a totally different attitude in the Department of Social and Family Affairs from that of some years ago. People get answers and that saves people like me a great deal of time and trouble.I am sure the two bodies the Minister will establish will be excellent but the lobby groups are enthusiastic about a statutory advisory group and this is the one opportunity they will have to get it. The Minister, however, has her face set against it.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	302	I have but, unlike some of my colleagues, I am not afraid to amend my legislation if circumstances change. I must tell Deputy Michael Woods that the Senator thinks he is an angel because it was he who introduced quality service.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	303	I think Senator Henry was referring to Deputy Dermot Ahern.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The ethos of the Department has changed considerably due to the training and customer service initiatives in place, which have developed. Staff have also met members of the community and such interaction has led to good action being taken on the ground. As that methodology has stood its stead well within the Department, I would like it to continue. However, if glaring problems arise in regard to certain issues, we will have to re-evaluate the methodology. I would prefer to continue with the two initiatives in place, to monitor how they work and evaluate them. I have never had a problem with evaluating and reforming existing practices. Once a measure becomes a statutory obligation and a statutory animal, it is difficult to reform. Often we may have to change the direction in which we want to go. I am sure the Senators will also continue to act as an advisory body on these issues, as they have eloquently done in recent weeks.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	305	I will be in contact with the Minister because the Council of Irish Genealogical Organisations will be in contact with me. If the system does not work there will be this chain reaction. We will have to see how it works.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	306	From time to time presumably there will be a level of disagreement, creative tension, call it what we may, between the GRO and some of these organisations. One does not need to be Einstein to note from reading the letters page of The Irish Times for the past ten years that there has been a significant degree of complaints about the length of time it takes for certification due to searches and so on. Let us be honest and admit that difficulties and tensions arise sometimes which are only natural and acceptable in any institution. However, I would have thought it more sensible if those experts — a small band of people throughout the country — who are dealing with this area on a constant basis were part and parcel of this whole process. I take it the panels to which the Minister referred are the existing ones and that she is not referring to new panels she intends to establish.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	307	I am referring to two new panels.

Prior to their establishment, presumably the Minister will be in discussions with all the organisations mentioned in Senator Henry's amendment to get some measure of agreement on how they will operate going forward. What will the panels be able to do? I presume they will be advisory.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	309	Yes.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	311	They will be established simultaneously on the enactment of the legislation and will have an advisory role. Often issues will arise where those people will have to be brought together and asked what direction they consider should be taken. I will not, nor I am sure will the Senator, negate my role as a legislator. Arising from the difficulties that have been brought to our attention, this action is on foot of the concerns expressed about the methodology and modus operandi of the General Registrars Office. That requires that we listen, although it may take some time to deal with the issues. I accept that 1845 is a long time ago, but we have been able to address many of the concerns spoken and written about.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	312	The Minister must be complimented on moving significantly on an amendment in regard to death certificates that she accepted in the other House. That happened because the legislation was being discussed on the floor of the other House and groups had to submit their views on it. That is not necessarily the best way to do business in this technical area.To return to the proposal to which Senator Henry alluded, if we had this type of an advisory body working on a 12 month basis, we would not be dealing at this stage with dilemmas that arise such as the one to which I referred to in regard to death certificates, on which the Minister moved as a result of some media publicity and other lobbying. We should not view issues of tension and difficulty between the GRO and many of these organisations as a bureaucratical nightmare about to happen every time they enter into discussions; they are only there presumably to help and advise the Government and the GRO in its important work because they are the people who use it on a constant basis.

The GRO has a fundamental importance in that it provides documentation which gives all of us various rights during our lives such as access to birth and marriage certificates. It also has a subsidiary role, the genealogical one. I would be concerned if that role were formalised in the way suggested as that would result in the priorities being lopsided. The genealogical side would almost assume primacy. It is an important economic and cultural activity and I would not in any way underrate it but, nonetheless, it is not the primary function of the GRO. Therefore, I support the Minister's position out of conviction rather than any other reason.

In page 20, line 22, after "registrar" to insert "if required to do so".The purpose of this amendment is to make the Bill more user friendly. The Bill retains a Victorian precept in that it is a requirement that both persons registering a birth must attend a registrar's office in person. The Minister spoke about customer service at some length. The Minister has enthusiastically taken the opportunity presented by the Bill to modernise the legislation, and this section presents another opportunity to do so.The amendment proposes inserting the words "if required to do so". It would relieve the exacting requirement in this regard. There are many work and family demands on people and it may not always be suitable for both people to make an appearance in a registrar's office. I am not sure that requirement is as essential now as it may have been at one stage. I appeal to the Minister to positively consider this amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	317	It is a duty of any parent to do what is the most important action on behalf of a child, namely to register it. Given that we have allowed the registration of a birth in any registrar's office, it is an important and imperative duty on parents that they appear before the registrar to authenticate the identity of their child. It is important that the information is absolutely accurate. As Members will be aware, any inaccuracy in a person's birth certificate could create great difficulties for him or her in future life. To make the obligation optional would undermine the importance of the registration of the birth of a child.Under section 19, we have facilitated a situation whereby a qualified informant can also participate in the registration of a birth where the parents are dead or incapable through ill health of complying with this subsection, unless he or she reasonably believes another qualified informant has complied with it in regard to the birth. Those are the only exceptions made with regard to the registration of a child.In the main, most people are quite excited and anxious to register their children fairly quickly. Given the importance of a birth certificate, there is a duty on parents to go before the registrar to register a child. By facilitating and modernising the methodology by which that can be done, this facilitates the registration. For example, a couple can register a child's birth at any registrar's office. In the past, if a couple's child was born in Dublin and the couple came from Offaly, they had to register the child in Dublin. That has been done away with. One will now have three months to register a child whereas it used to be 42 days. We have certainly addressed the concerns that existed, while appreciating the pressures people are under. It is a fundamental duty of a parent to register a child and to be present for the registration.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I appreciate what the Minister is saying but not everybody shares the view she articulated that registration of a child is a fundamental duty. Unfortunately, some may not even consider a wide range of fundamental issues although they may be as serious as the Minister stated.Good customer service would involve a recognition that people may not be in a position to be present at registration. I accept that being present at the registration is a very important duty of any parent but there are cases in which it might be impossible, or almost impossible. In recognition of good customer service and the many ways in which information can now be relayed, and given the prompt service and resources available, the Minister should consider this matter in the context of customer service in her Department, to which she referred, and perhaps in other contexts in the future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	319	In modernising the facility we have also extended the opening hours, thus appreciating that some may not be able to register their children during work hours. Linked to this is the fact that, in the larger maternity hospitals, we can now facilitate the registration of a birth before the mother goes home through the Department of Health and Children. This is also very important. Every effort is being made to ensure we provide a service to the customer but we all agree that registration of a child is one of the most fundamental things a parent should do. The failure to register a child would have serious consequences because one's registration details are used for absolutely everything. I am sure some Members still deal with cases in which births were never registered, thus resulting in considerable hassle over inheritance, land, etc. Therefore, registration is the most important duty of parents, apart from caring for the child. I believe we have facilitated many of the concerns of modern life.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	320	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 20, after line 45, to insert the following subsection:"(4) Where a child is born in a vehicle or vessel in transit from one place to another and the precise place of birth cannot be identified, the place of birth to be recorded shall be that of the townland or civil parish concerned, or other identifiable geographical area concerned, or if that cannot be ascertained, either the place of departure of the vehicle or vessel or the place of arrival, as may be specified by the informant,".This amendment is the result of a recent case in which the registrar produced a birth certificate for a child born in an ambulance that specified the place of birth as a road between two named destinations. This is wholly unsatisfactory for very obvious reasons. My amendment proposes a number of alternatives to registering a child in this manner, which is not acceptable by today's standards. In the case in question, a reference to a townland may have been appropriate, as opposed to a road between two destinations. If the Minister accepts my amendment, it will at least provide that an identifiable location be included in the birth certificate as the place of birth. I appeal to her to consider it.

In the main, the townland would be included as the place of birth in such cases. In the particular case to which Senator McCarthy referred, the townland was not known. If the townland becomes known, the birth certificate can be amended accordingly. I appreciate that the absence of a named place of birth on a birth certificate can cause difficulties in terms of qualifying to play for a football team, be it Ulster, Connacht, Cork or Kerry.

#JohnMinihan	unknown-#JohnMinihan-party	unknown-#JohnMinihan-dob	unknown-#JohnMinihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	330	Before we proceed, I would like to say something about section 19 in general, in light of what previous speakers have said. Section 19 imposes the primary obligation to register on the parents, but in many instances involving assisted reproduction or surrogacy there is a problem defining who are the parents of the legal entity. The Bill, in various sections, refers to "the mother". What mother are we talking about? Are we talking about the genetic mother who donated the egg, the gestational mother who actually gave birth or the intended social mother? I presume we are taking "the mother" to mean the birth mother, but a difficulty arises in cases of surrogacy, for example, where the birth mother cannot present herself to the registrar because she may have relinquished the right to the child, thus implying that the social mother must present herself to the registrar. I am concerned about this. I know it is a complex area but, unfortunately, if this legislation is throwing up complex matters, we must face up to them and not brush them under the carpet.I know the Minister referred to the "qualified informant", which is fine, and the Bill is quite specific that the qualified informant must attend before any registrar if the parents are dead or incapable through ill health of complying with what is required of them. This would apply where the biological father of the child makes an application for guardianship, but he has no right to register the child under this section.This matter will recur as we consider other sections of the Bill. If the section uses terminology such as "father" and "mother", we must be very careful regarding our intended purpose. I know we are getting into a complex area, but I believe we should consider it very carefully. As we consider other sections, it will become far more complicated.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	331	Given that Senator Mansergh quoted Oscar Wilde, why should I not quote Homer? He stated, "It is a wise child that knows his own father" but it is now a case of its being a wise child that knows his own mother. These issues are very important in the Bill.To add to the Minister's complications and in order that she will have something to talk about over lunch after Cabinet meetings——

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	333	——the daughter of a woman in her 40s had to have a hysterectomy and it was proposed that her mother would have a baby using her daughter's ova and sperm from the partner of the daughter. The mother was still married to the girl's father. If the child was born, the gestational mother, the genetic mother's sister, would be the parent and the grandfather of the child would be the father. Talk about guardianship: the biological father, the genetic father of the child, would have no rights to it at all. These are the sort of issues we have to address. They are complex, as Senator Minihan said. I do not know how they will be sorted out, but they need to be examined.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	334	I will have a law degree by the time I get out of here. The Bill states that an tArd Chláraitheoir may conduct or cause to be conducted "such enquiries as he or she considers necessary" to ascertain whether a birth, stillbirth, death or marriage required to be registered under this Act, or if the repealed enactments, as may be appropriate, has been so registered. If it has been, it must be ascertained "whether the particulars in relation to it in the entries of the register concerned are correct and complete".An tArd–Chláraitheoir may have an inquiry to determine registration in a particular case. That is where the role of an tArd–Chláraitheoir comes in. In that inquiry an tArd–Chláraitheoir may determine, following that event, whether the particulars concerned in the register are incorrect or incomplete. When we get to other sections in this legislation, the assumption is that the mother is the biological mother.

The mother is the person who delivered the child. A father is not a father; he is a person until paternity has been determined. Save in exceptional circumstances, the assumption is that the man is the father if he is married to the mother unless that man relinquishes that right. He has to be married to the woman ten months prior to that and this is the big issue. It will come up in section 22. There is no assumption in law that the man is the father, save that he is married to the mother unless he relinquishes that right.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	337	There is no such thing as a married father. It has to be proven.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	338	There is no such thing. There is DNA and paternity issues, but that is the pre-determinant problem within law currently. If that were to be changed in itself, it would create assumptions which could be incorrect because initially paternity would have to be proven. Senator Henry is right on the basis that it is an assumption that the mother who is carrying the baby was married to a husband who was not the father unless he relinquished the right and was the child's grandfather and also his or her uncle.

On that basis one would have to ask an tArd–Chláraitheoir to make a determination. Under the Status of Children Act 1987, a declaration may be obtained in court to determine parentage. That, I would assume, would be part of the inquiry of an tArd Chláraitheoir. It would turn out to be a legal determination on parentage. The judge can make that determination on the instructions of an tArd Chláraitheoir. Traditional life was much easier.

Many inquiries and investigations will be set up to establish who is who. Would it not be simpler if in the registration documentation it was covered by starting with the genetic mother and moving on to the gestational or intended social mother? If that was signed off from the start, there would be no issue because the clear record would be there. They would be giving their consent. The history is there on the documentation and it would resolve all the inquiries.

The best interests of the child are paramount when one examines adoptions and all those other issues that have not come to any finality. The precise information the Senator is talking about would go to the court and then a determination would be made on parentage. The court would have to make that decision. When this legislation was initiated, a plethora of other issues arose which will give rise to problems of pre-determination. We will reach these at a later stage. The power of an tArd–Chláraitheoir is there to make the required investigation, linking in to other legislation in determining parentage. I was not aware of that but the cláraitheoir cúnta here is keeping me right on the legal aspects of it. It is complicated, the permutations are there and it will end up as a legal determination by the courts.

In page 21, before section 20, to insert the following new section:20.—Parents may opt to have the birth details of their child recorded in the Irish language and may opt to have a birth certificate issued in the Irish language.".This would be a simple request, that parents should have the option to have details of their child registered in the Irish language. They may opt for an Irish language version of a birth certificate. It is a matter which should be close to the Minister's heart. Tá blas aici mar gheall ar an Ghaeilge.We spent hours debating an all-party motion in this House, recently asking that Irish be one of the official languages within the EU. This amendment is a simple request for parents to be able to register their child in the Irish language and get a birth certificate accordingly. It is self-explanatory. I am hopeful it can be acceded to. I do not see why it cannot be, given the consensus within the House on the need for Irish to be an official language within the EU. If we are doing that and this cannot be allowed, then it is hypocritical.

She should not cite technical problems as a reason for not accepting the amendment which does not require her to do anything exceptional. This problem can be overcome by technology.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	350	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 22, subsection (1), line 16, to delete "The father of a child" and substitute "A person".The Minister rightly stated earlier that this section is one of the most controversial of the Bill. The new section 22 will replace section 49 of the Status of Children Act 1987 which redefines who we mean to be an unmarried father and his rights and obligations therein in terms of registering his name on a birth certificate.It is absolutely essential that the rights of the child are paramount in this debate. We had a brief discussion on this earlier. Every child born in this country has a right to know his or her father and mother. There will always be extenuating circumstances where one of those parties may not play any role in the child's life. Section 22 as currently drafted gives unmarried fathers a cavalier role and provides them with an opt-out and says to them "We have no difficulty if you decide not to have your name on the birth certificate." This attitude must be tackled.Section 22(1) states:The father of a child who was not married to the mother of the child at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of 10 months before such birth shall not be required to give information under this Act about the birth.The provision allows unmarried fathers who want nothing to do with their children a carte blanche to do as they wish. It gives legal recognition to an opt-out that is not in the interests of the child or society. I would like to know from where this idea came. The formulation of section 49 of the Status of Children Act is much better. It states, in the case of a child whose parents were not married to each other at the date of his or her birth or at any time during the period of ten months before the birth, that no person shall as father of the child be required to give information concerning the birth. The words “a person” have been dropped in the new section. I would like the Minister to put on the record of this House her rationale in that regard.It is important that we, as legislators, say to parents, married or unmarried, that they have a fundamental responsibility to be inextricably linked with the development and welfare of their child. Too often, fathers take the easy option. There are many examples of young women wanting nothing to do with the man concerned. While I understand that, it is too easy for us to accept this situation in legislation.Section 49 of the Status of Children Act is probably better than the new section we are debating here today. We have a major responsibility, when establishing registers, to ensure that fathers and mothers whether married or unmarried take their responsibilities seriously and ensure, at the very least, that a child knows his or her parents. There are too many examples of people opting out in this regard. We have a responsibility to get this right.The debate on this legislation in the other House was rushed. The Dáil had no time to discuss this section. The great advantage of the Seanad is that everyone can speak on Committee Stage and we have a great deal of time to discuss these issues.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	351	I support Senator Hayes' comments. It is extraordinarily important for the child that everything possible is done to ensure the father's name is registered at birth. A distinction exists between the registration of marital births and non-marital births and so a difficulty arises from the moment of registration.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	352	I support the case so eloquently made by Senator Hayes. We owe it to children to include this provision. Access to this type of information is essential. Too often we forget the current moral entitlements of the child. It is not good enough that we allow some people off the hook because no legislative framework is in place to ensure they honour their responsibilities. It is difficult to believe such people do not want to be available to their children but that is the sad reality. I urge the Minister to look favourably on this amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	353	We will go into the particulars of matters raised on this amendment when we come to deal with others. Amendment No. 10 seeks to substitute the words "The father of a child" with "A person". Acceptance of the amendment would not substantiate or support the Senator's intention. One would first have to determine what constitutes "a person". The Senator is seeking that "A person who is not married to the mother at the date of his or her entry....". One cannot use the words "a person" in that regard. I am advised by the Attorney General that the section as currently drafted complies with best practice. The inclusion of the words "A person" would not achieve the Senator's intention. The overarching issues could, perhaps, be addressed in the next amendment.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	354	Section 22(1) refers to the father of the child. What is the distinction between this and section 49 of the Status of Children Act which states that "In the case of a child whose parents were not married to each other at the date of his birth or at any time during the period of ten months before his birth, no person shall as father of the child be required to give information concerning the birth."? Is there a difference in the Department's mindset in respect of section 49 of the Status of Children Act and section 22(1) of the Bill? Why are they not the same?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	355	Section 22(1) is written in plain English and refers to the father of a child. There is a determination there.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	356	I accept that.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	358	I move amendment No. 11:
In page 22, subsection (2), line 21, after "name" to insert "and required particulars".Senator Cummins and I tabled these amendments with a view to including the term "and required particulars" after the word "name" in subsection (2). In other words, we are seeking more information and not just the name. As I understand it that is the practice, namely, that people are encouraged to give as much information as possible to go on the certificate. Why have we not provided for that in the legislation? If it is the practice — it is one which we would all welcome — why did the Minister not include an explicit reference in the relevant sections? I would have thought that it would make sense, in the event of there ever being a challenge on this, that the Minister could point to the legislation and state that she has not just stipulated that the name of an individual be provided but also that they provide required particulars, as set out in the Schedule. Both amendments attempt to achieve the same objective.My comments in respect of amendment No. 10 equally apply to amendment No. 11. I am interested that we should move to a discussion of the section as soon as possible because we only have approximately 45 minutes before the end of Committee Stage.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	359	Our deliberations can be resumed later.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The First Schedule requires the provision of a considerable number of particulars. I am concerned that the personal public service number of the father must be provided. I hope this will not deter people or lead them to believe that they will be pursued for maintenance money. While the warm feelings remain after someone is told he is the father of a child, it might be advisable not to seek people's insurance numbers. I do not know if I sound very callous or venal but it might be as well to omit that requirement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	361	The Senator sounds extremely practical.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	362	With the exception of that requirement, the Schedule seems fine.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	363	Senator Henry has addressed this matter in her comments on the particulars which must be provided under the First Schedule. Quite a number of such particulars are required. If a person does not have his or her PPS number, it does not deter the registration of the child's birth.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	364	The child can still be registered.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	365	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	366	So there is a legal basis for it by virtue of the fact that it is included in the First Schedule but not the relevant sections.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	367	Yes.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	368	Is the Minister satisfied with that?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	369	Yes. It stands on the Schedule.As a consequence of this legislation, other issues are being raised which fall outside its parameters. I am delighted that Senator Brian Hayes has agreed that every effort is being made to ensure that two parents register. Senator Henry referred to warm feelings after someone is informed he is the father of a child. These people will be facilitated in the maternity hospital or at their local registrar's office and an extension of time is provided. If, therefore, something does not work out in the early period, there are up to three months in which a determination may be made in terms of both parents having their names on the birth certificate.Many people have referred to children's right to know the identity of their father or — this concerns a minority of instances — their mother. There is a great deal of logic to that. It is for this reason we have had a considerable amount of debate with regard to adoptions and access to that type of information. As Members are aware, we have not reached agreement on that matter but there have been considerable discussions. The Minister of State, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is anxious to bring before the House a new adoption Bill which, in my view, will have major consequences for the legislation before us. When that Bill emerges, it is highly likely that the legislation on civil registration will have to be amended as the existing restrictions will remain in place under its provisions because a determination to change the position has not been made.Statistics show that at Erne maternity hospital, the father's name was registered in 91% of births, while in Limerick, 93% registered their names. This shows that what is understood as a public perception does not actually exist. It is obvious that the change has come about of its own making because of the fact that we do facilitate registration. Quite a high percentage of fathers register their names on birth certificates.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	370	Unfortunately it is the other 7% or 9% about which we must be concerned.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	371	I accept there are other issues. There is no presumption in law other than that the husband of a married woman is the father of the child. There can, however, be complex and complicated relationships where, for example, the mother of the child may not be married to the father but is married to someone else and the person who is the father of the child could be married to another woman.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	372	It has happened.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	373	It is the reality. There are sensitive and difficult situations with which we must deal. There are other situations where the father would be genuinely unknown. That is another fact of life.The high percentage of registration by both parents on birth certificates is good and important and we are facilitating it. Whether it is reflected in other responsibilities is another matter. Members will agree that in the main, save in exceptional circumstances, the inclusion of two parents is the best and most beneficial way of rearing a child. However, we know in our hearts and souls that people, be they men or women, abdicate their responsibilities. This is another societal issue about which it would be good to converse but it falls outside the parameters of this legislation. Just because a man's name is registered on a birth certificate does not mean that he is actively involved in the parenting of the child. Having his name registered does not bestow on him any rights if he is not going to be actively involved in the rearing of the child.There are other consequences which arise out of registration. However, I am happy to see such a high percentage of involvement among men and women. I appreciate that there are difficulties in relationships, particularly where a woman may not want to have anything to do with the father. There may, perhaps, be reasons for that. It often happens, sometimes later in life, that people ask, as they are entitled to do, a registrar to amend the registration. A couple of thousand re-registrations take place every year. This indicates that, perhaps through reconciliation or whatever, people involve themselves more in the rearing of a child or wish to have their names registered on the birth certificate.There will always be cases where people have a personal difficulty or problem. At the end of the day, people can have recourse to the courts to establish parentage. We would prefer it if they did not have to go to such lengths, but that opportunity is available to people if they want to establish their parentage. The court will then advise an tArd Chláraitheoir to register the father's name and details.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	376	I move amendment No. 13:
In page 23, subsection (2)(d), line 4, to delete “child.” and substitute the following:"child,or(e) declare that they are the mother and father of the child concerned or the prospective parents of the child yet unborn and make a statutory declaration to that effect containing the required particulars needed to register the birth or stillbirth as the case may be.”.We are all agreed by now that it is a good idea that a child should know his or her paternity. Can we include a provision to accommodate unmarried couples where, for example, a non-national father who plans to leave the State can make a statutory declaration acknowledging paternity of a child or stillborn child to be? A father could be registered as the father of a child on the basis of such a declaration.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	377	That cannot be done until the child is born.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	378	I move amendment No. 15:
In page 25, between lines 21 and 22, to insert the following subsection:"(9) When the person to whom section (2)(d) applies makes a request to a registrar under that provision, the registrar shall notify the mother of the request before re-registering the birth.”.Section 23 makes provisions on re-registration. I have been advised that Senator Henry is more expert on this matter than me and I will let her come in on it. I may have been advised of that inadvertently, however.The intention of amendment No. 15 is to insert a new subsection (9) to make provisions in respect of a re-registration some years after the birth. The registrar would be obliged to notify the mother of a request before re-registering the birth. We are all aware of a number of tragic cases which have come before the courts. Are there circumstances in which it would be advisable to provide that a mother should be entitled to know if someone was attempting to re-register? The Minister may well tell me that the mother is entitled to know as the law stands. However, there are some tragic cases in which it would be advisable to ensure that a mother is informed if a re-registration application is made by a father or a person alleging to be the father. Examples include circumstances in which there is violence in a relationship or other legal difficulties. Have the Minister and her officials considered this matter in the context of section 23?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	379	Will there be double indexation of surnames, in particular, if a child is re-registered? That could be very important from the point of view of the father, the mother and members of the extended family who wished to look the names up in future.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	380	Double indexation will happen. A father is entitled to have all his details on certificate whereas Senator Brian Hayes is referring to cases in which a mother would not wish to have a father's name on the register. That cannot be prevented under the Status of Children Act. There is an automatic guarantee.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	381	It has been brought to my attention that there may well be a handful of cases in which estranged fathers can be prevented from re-registering on the basis of a very violent relationship. There is no basis in law, which means the information can be openly obtained by him.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	382	The information is a matter of public record.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	383	Amendment No. 17 is consequential on amendment No. 16 and both amendments may be discussed together. Is that agreed? Agreed.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	384	I move amendment No. 16:
In page 25, line 26, after "1931" to insert "as amended by subsection (2)."Amendments Nos. 16 and 17 seek to correct what appears to be an outdated provision in section 1 of the Legitimacy Act 1931. The provision operates to legitimise children whose parents subsequently marry only if the father is domiciled in the State. There appears to be an inappropriate form of discrimination in the provision. I ask the Minister to consider the amendments positively in view of that fact.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	385	As the Senator has rightly said, the section provides for the re-registration of a child legitimised by his or her parents marriage to each other. Section 1(1) of the Legitimacy Act 1931 provides for the legitimising of a person where his or her parents marry each other and the father of the illegitimate person is, at the date of marriage, domiciled in the State. The amendment seeks to provide that either the father or the mother of the child is domiciled in the State at the date of marriage. As this proposal does not relate to the re-registering process covered under this section, it is not proposed to accept the amendment as appropriate for inclusion in the legislation.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I accept what the Minister said. The relevance of the Legitimacy Act 1931 could be called into question. This is clearly the case in terms of attempting to legitimise children after the parents get married. It may not be a matter to be considered in the context of the legislation before us, but it points to the inadequacy of the Legitimacy Act 1931.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 26, before section 25, to insert the following new section:25.—(1) The State shall endeavour, insofar as is practicable, to ascertain and register the name of the birth father at the time of registration of a birth.(2) Nothing in section 23 or 24 shall prejudice or restrict the right of a child to ascertain his or her birth father.”.This amendment represents an attempt by Fine Gael to include a new section to encompass the aspirations of every Member of both Houses of the Oireachtas. It seeks to ensure that nothing the State ever did would stop a father registering his name on a birth certificate. I am sure the Minister will tell me a father already has this right. This new section would be useful particularly in the context of sections 22 and 23. Inclusion of the new section as an overarching protection would be seen by many men as a validation of a man's right to include his name on a birth certificate. The provision is copperfastened in subsection (2) which states that nothing in sections 23 or 24 shall prejudice or restrict the right of a child to ascertain his or her birth father. The Minister will probably tell me the right already exists.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	388	It does.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	389	While the right may already exist, the wording of our new section is better and clearer. That is all I have to say about that matter.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	390	That is one-nil to this side. The right is established.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	391	Is the Senator happy with the right?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	392	I accept the Minister's word on it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	393	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 26, subsection (1), line 28, after "like effect", to insert "made within 12 months of the registration of the birth".It has been suggested to us that it may be sensible to put a restriction on the time length during which people can make the alteration — up to 12 months from the registration of a birth. The argument put to us is that this sort of provision would constitute good record-keeping. I am interested in the Minister's views. As currently worded, there can be an alteration at any time. Would that not be open to abuse in the future?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	394	That restriction was in the legislation in 1980 but was taken out sometime in the 1990s. I think this would be very restrictive. We give people a once-off opportunity to change the forename. As the Deputy knows, a year is quite a short period and it was considered restrictive in the 1990s, so it was removed. Maybe it was a Fine Gael Minister who removed it. I am not quite sure.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	395	There were not too many of them at that time.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	396	The provision was considered somewhat unnecessary and slightly restrictive, and it was decided to take it out. Re-introducing it might not serve much purpose.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	397	We will discuss amendments Nos. 20 and 21 together by agreement, as amendment No. 21 is an alternative to amendment No. 20.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	398	I move amendment No. 20:
In page 26, subsection (2), lines 39 to 43, to delete all words from and including "in" in line 39 down to and including "to" in line 43.We are suggesting the removal of five lines from subsection (2) because there is no necessity for them. Subsection (2) states that where a forename is changed, altered or registered, or one or more forenames are added under subsection (1), the then existing entry concerned shall be retained. Why is there a need to add the remaining five lines? They have no purpose. We ask the Minister to consider the amendment in that context.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	399	Amendment No. 21 is an effort to remove part of the bureaucratic straitjacket attached to the Bill. I am also led to believe there was no provision to change a forename once it has already been changed. I appeal to the Minister to remove the bureaucratic straitjacket and accept the amendment. That would make history.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	400	Remove the verbiage.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	402	That is the beauty of Opposition.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	404	This is a once-off opportunity to either amend or change or complete a birth registration, for example where the name which is not originally registered is, for example, in common usage. That happens on a number of occasions.If I were to accept this amendment, it would result in the possibility of multiple changes of forenames with resulting degradation of the birth record. I have said that there should be only one opportunity to make the change. If we were to remove what the Deputy referred to as the verbiage, one could change the name on a continual basis, and that would not be appropriate. That is why the additional five lines are there among the seven.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I move amendment No. 22:
In page 26, between lines 43 and 44, to insert the following subsection:"(3) Where a person whose birth is registered as being of a particular gender, subsequently undergoes gender reassignment surgery and produces a certificate in a prescribed form from a registered medical practitioner to the effect that the person's gender has now altered from that stated on his or her birth certificate, the birth may be re-registered with particulars of the person's gender at the time of re-registration.".We know this Bill covers wide-ranging areas and is sensitive in parts. The purpose of this amendment is to address a defect in the law currently for a small number of people who undergo gender reassignment surgery. Currently, such people are forced to live with birth certificates denoting their original gender for the rest of their lives, with no provision for change. This is an unsatisfactory situation for such people, and the amendment provides the necessary legal protection.The European Court of Human Rights has already issued a warning regarding this kind of legislation. It recently ruled that failure to make provision in law for transsexuals is a breach of the European Convention on Human Rights. If we do not take action in this area, we will hear about it from the powers that be in Europe. A ruling will be made against it. I am interested to hear the Minister's response. It is important that Ireland, which has signed up to the convention, would actively lead from the top. If we do not act soon, it is only a matter of time before a ruling is made against the legislation by the European courts.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	406	The registration of a birth is designed to record personal details as they pertain at the time of birth. The issue of the amendment of the birth certificate following gender reassignment arose in an application for a judicial review of a decision of an tArd-Cláraitheoir at the time, not to amend an entry in the register of births following an application from a person who had undergone gender reassignment surgery. The High Court declined to grant the application. The judgment noted that the applicant raised many personal complex social, ethical and legal issues. I understand that the High Court decision has now been appealed to the Supreme Court, and pending the outcome of the appeal and the enactment of the provisions of this Bill, I am not currently in a position to accept the amendment. We must await the decision of the Supreme Court.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	407	Even if the Supreme Court upholds the High Court decision, I urge caution in this regard, because we are dealing here with a powerful European instrument. If this State were to violate the European Convention on Human Rights, it would be shameful. I accept that the Minister is following due legal process on this, but it is only a matter of time before the European Court of Human Rights will rule that this country is in dereliction of its duty, despite having signed up to the convention and having fulfilled obligations thereunder. Even if the Minister will not accept the amendment, I urge her to be cognisant of the situation. If the Supreme Court upholds the High Court ruling, what action will the Minister take?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I prefer not to pre-empt the Supreme Court decision. I would not dare to do so. Once we get the decision, we will determine what to do. The action taken by the European Court of Human Rights pertained to marriage and its inter-linking with the birth certificate. That is being investigated and considered by the inter-departmental committee on marriage reform currently working. It is best to await the Supreme Court ruling before any further decision is made.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I move amendment No. 23:
In page 36, before section 43, to insert the following new section:43.---The date of birth of a dead person shall be recorded on the death certificate.".Section 43 refers to the place of death and the circumstances involved. We suggest that the date of birth of a dead person shall be recorded on a death certificate. I was not aware that was not the case.On Second Stage the Minister informed me that going forward there would be a cross-tabulation between people who die and their birth certificates. I raised an issue with the Minister that had been brought to my attention in that it was still possible to obtain, for illegal purposes, birth certificates of people who had died and she said, in the course of her reply, that from cross-tabulation in the future she would be able to clamp down on that.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	410	That is right.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	411	That led me to table this amendment whereby we suggest that the date of birth of a person should be recorded on the death certificate. It would certainly help in terms of that cross-tabulation.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	412	I support Senator Hayes. This is very important. There are many Mary Henrys and it might be as well if they had my date of birth when they are certifying my death in case they confuse me with someone else.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	413	I support this amendment. We have accepted the provision on the place of birth and the date of birth should also be included for the reasons outlined by Senator Brian Hayes. It should not pose a major difficulty. I hope the Minister accepts the amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	414	The Bill now provides for the date of birth or age last birthday of the deceased to be entered in the register. The Senator is right. Going forward we will be able to cross-tabulate from a control point of view.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	415	The Minister accepted it in the other House.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	416	If the Bill were here first, I would have accepted it.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	417	I just thought I would ram home the point that we got one amendment accepted.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	418	I move amendment No. 24:
In page 37, subsection (1), lines 23 to 29, to delete paragraph (b) and substitute the following:"(b) attend at the office of that registrar, or at any other convenient place specified by that registrar, including an Embassy or Consulate of the State, at any time during normal business hours——(i) not less than 5 days (or such lesser number of days as may be determined by that registrar), or(ii) in the case of a person who has resided outside of the jurisdiction for at least three months preceding the date of marriage, whose place of residence has no Irish diplomatic representation, not less than 1 day (or such lesser period as may be determined by that registrar)before the date aforesaid and make and sign a declaration in his or her presence that there is no impediment of kindred or alliance or other lawful hindrance to the said marriage.".This amendment concerns people who are residing in another country coming home to be married. The five days restriction is practical. These people should be allowed go to an embassy or consulate and do what is necessary. What we suggest in this regard is self-explanatory. We are foreseeing difficulties that may arise in such circumstances and we would welcome the Minister's opinion on it. This matter was raised in the other House and we felt it should be raised here because we foresee practical difficulties if the section is left as it is.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	419	Provision is being made in the Bill to facilitate couples working or living abroad. They can notify the registrar under the prescribed form by post. They can submit any other required documentation, for example, a divorce decree, by post but they must attend a registrar's office a minimum of five days prior to the date of the intended marriage to produce the identification and to sign a declaration of freedom to marry. Where a couple is unable to meet this requirement due to exceptional circumstances, special arrangements can be made by agreement with the registrar. We can all appreciate that something might happen, and that can be facilitated.In addition, it is proposed that the designated registrar's office will be open late one evening each week to provide an expanded service for our customers. All marriage notification details, including the couple's signatures, will be captured electronically and this can only be done now by a personal attendant at the registrar's office. We will certainly facilitate people as best we can. The couple's electronic signature will be used for comparison purposes with those on the marriage registration form when the marriage is being registered.It is a principle of international law that couples wishing to marry outside their country of residence must comply with the marriage laws of the country where the marriage is to take place. We are all aware of that happening. Given the significance of marriage to the couple in society, it is not unreasonable to require a couple to attend a registrar's office in person to complete the civil preliminaries for marriage. It is an intrinsic part of making all necessary arrangements for the marriage.I consider that adequate provision is included in the Bill to cater for couples resident outside the State who wish to marry in Ireland. That flexibility is being given to the registrar.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	420	Is the Minister saying the registrar has discretion to dictate for special circumstances that may arise?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	421	Yes. The local registrar would be aware of something happening. If, say, there was a death, an accident or whatever, the registrar, who would be local and would most likely know the person, would be able to facilitate him or her.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	422	However, that does not extend to consular or embassy services abroad.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	423	No, it does not. As I said, the signature has to be made with our registrar. We talk about a minimum of five days and circumstances may arise where documentation may not be correct, for example, and that would have to be dealt with. That is the reason we are providing for a minimum of five days. That is the framework we are looking at, for example, if somebody forgot something or needed to come back with something else. It might be a bank holiday, and many people get married on bank holidays or on Sundays in some areas. These things happen and we are providing contingencies for them but it is felt that it is best that the person would appear before the registrar to ensure that all the documentation is correct. A consular would not be adept at dealing with many of the permutations and considerations that a registrar might face and it would be unfair to expect that. If exceptional circumstances arise where people are coming home to get married, the registrar would usually facilitate that. I know from a good deal of experience that the mother usually has to sort it out, for some reason or another, and that will be facilitated.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	424	I presume this is the section which makes everything all right for the Church of Ireland service in section 51, where the two people are required to say if there is any impediment to their marriage. In the Book of Common Prayer, the minister says to the couple:The vows you are about to take are to be made in the name of God, who is judge of all and who knows all the secrets of our hearts. Therefore if either of you know any reason why you may not lawfully marry, you must declare it now.Nothing used to be said, so I presume it is this declaration——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	425	No, it is not. Section 51 will deal with that.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	426	Does the declaration five days before make up for the fact that no one says anything? Section 51 states that the two people——
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	427	This is a totally different measure. This is to provide for the three months' notification. The other issue is dealt with in section 51 and we will deal with it when we get to that section.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	428	I thank the Minister.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	429	I move amendment No. 25:
In page 37, subsection (4), line 37, after "marriage" to insert ", provided that where a marriage takes place in contravention of those provisions in circumstances where the parties believe in good faith that one or both of them is in danger of death, and the parties or either of them or the person or the person celebrating the marriage proves the existence of such belief to the satisfaction of the Circuit Court, which application may be made after the celebration of the marriage, the said subsection shall not apply".In 1995 the rainbow Government introduced the three months notification period. Naturally there was a commitment to this and it appears to be a good idea in principle. However, there is the difficult case in marriages where one of the partners is in imminent danger of death. While in principle it is possible to get an exemption from a Circuit Court judge, this may not be possible in a very limited number of cases and this amendment makes provision accordingly. I recognise this is an inherently difficult area.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	430	This section does deal with a notification of marriage and the requirements set out in subsections (1) and (2) of section 46 are substantive requirements for a valid marriage. Provision is made in the Bill for an application to the courts for an exemption to the three month notification requirement, as Senators will be aware. However, where special or exceptional circumstances arise, the party can arrange with the registrar a place and time convenient for completion of the civil preliminaries for the marriage and the issue of the marriage registration form. In those circumstances, the registrar has the flexibility to facilitate a couple and determine a time and place to deal with the legalities. The flexibility is there to facilitate those unfortunate circumstances.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	431	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 40, subsection (6), line 36, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".This amendment is self-explanatory and one that appears in various Bills. The difference between "may" and "shall" is very weak. There are different implications for both words. Given that the Bill is weak, the amendment would give the Minister discretion as to whether to allow correction of errors. There is a belief in some quarters that there must be a provision for correction of errors. It is a semi-technical amendment.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	432	Subsection (6) of section 49 makes provision for the Minister for Health and Children to make regulation for the correction or errors in the register of marriages. It gives the Minister discretion on whether he wants to regulate on the matter. In the interests of better regulation, the need to regulate it is carefully analysed to prevent creating unnecessary legislation. It is in keeping with the practice to allow for discretion on the matter. In the circumstances it would not be appropriate for the Minister to be obliged to make a regulation. It gives the Minister the facility to make regulation if needs be, but he is not obliged to do so. If the word "shall" is introduced he would have to make a regulation, when there may be no necessity for it. It is only an enabling provision for the Minister for Health and Children in the advent of the need for a regulation. Does that explain the matter?

#DerekMcDowell	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-party	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-dob	unknown-#DerekMcDowell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	438	I move:That Seanad Éireann notes:1. the very small number of criminal convictions secured by the Revenue Commissioners in relation to tax offences;2. the apparent reluctance on the part of the Revenue Commissioners to have revenue related offences prosecuted in the courts;3. the failure in particular to seek or secure convictions for offences arising out of the 1993 tax amnesty;therefore calls on the Government to take whatever action that may be required to ensure that the law is effectively enforced, including, if necessary, the transfer of responsibility for the prosecution of offences to a body other than the Revenue Commissioners.This motion deals specifically with prosecutions arising from tax evasion. The resolution makes three points: that the provisions of the tax amnesty that were to act as a stick have not been enforced as rigorously as they should have been and even now, 11 years later, they should be more rigorously enforced; the general powers of the Revenue Commissioners to institute criminal prosecutions have not been used as often or as rigorously as they should and that they should be used more often in future than is currently the case; and if the Revenue Commissioners do not have the will power or are unable to do this, we should allow other State bodies, such as the Garda, the CAB or others, to do itWe are not talking about the small man making an innocent mistake or pushing small businesses to the wall if they are a couple of months late with their VAT returns. This resolution is about serious tax evasion and those who consistently develop schemes to evade tax and defraud the Revenue Commissioners and the taxpayer. We are talking about people who take it for granted that they, and they alone, are entitled to freeload on the services paid for by the rest of us — people who are criminals and should be treated as such and prosecuted.I acknowledge the political background to the tax amnesty. The Labour Party was in power with Fianna Fáil when the amnesty provisions were introduced in 1993. I was on the Government backbenches at the time and many in the Labour Party were unhappy with the tax amnesty then and have become even more unhappy about it since. It is important, however, to remember that we voted for it because we knew the Exchequer was not as bountiful in tax resources as it is now and because we were reassured by the then Minister for Finance, who is now Taoiseach, that the enforcement provisions contained in the 1993 Act would be rigorously applied in the future.The Act set out in detail tranches of liability for those people who failed to make a proper declaration, made an improper declaration or who did not use the amnesty. It stated that such people could and should be prosecuted. The amnesty was not voluntary — people who had unpaid taxes in 1993 were obliged by it to pay up, with a decent discount, and to come clean.Failing to do that was, and remains, a criminal offence and should have been prosecuted as such. That is why it is difficult to understand why, based on the response the Minister for Finance gave yesterday in the Dáil, there has not been a single successful prosecution for failure to comply with the 1993 amnesty. Section 9 of the Act has never been used in the courts although there are tens of thousands of people who did not comply with the terms of the 1993 amnesty. Tens of thousands of people who had bogus non-resident accounts did not comply with the amnesty and thousands of them also did not comply with the 2001 voluntary disclosure scheme. I have every sympathy for the small business man who lets his VAT deadline slip by a couple of months but I have no sympathy for people who have been given the benefit of statutory schemes not once but twice to come clean. They have not just failed to do so, they have refused.The Labour Party believes that such people should be prosecuted and pursued through the courts not just to get back the tax, but "pour encourager les autres”, in the words of Marie Antoinette. Criminal prosecutions act as a serious deterrent to those who would evade tax. The penalties and interest are hefty but in cases of serious evasion, there should be prosecution through the courts. It is remarkable that has not happened.The Minister for Finance said in the Dáil yesterday that it had not happened in amnesty cases as a result of the confidentiality requirement of the 1993 amnesty. The Minister knows that the 1993 Act also provides for an investigating officer of the Revenue Commissioners to go to the appeal commissioners to seek permission to go behind the confidentiality certificate issued by the Revenue Commissioners in circumstances where there are reasonable grounds for believing someone has not made a full declaration. It is remarkable that they have done so in only 20 cases and that in almost two thirds of those cases, they were not successful. It is also remarkable that they have tried to do so in so few cases and, although I do not know the details of the cases that failed, that the success rate is so low. It is unacceptable.I read the Revenue Commissioners report for 2002 and it sounds strong on the issue, stating that it is policy to prosecute cases, particularly high profile cases. It gives examples of the cases where it would be appropriate, such as the use of forged or falsified documents, systematic schemes to evade tax, false claimants for repayment, failure, as distinct from minor delays, in remitting fiduciary taxes and deliberate and serious omissions from tax returns.On the face of it, that policy is fine but it does not sit comfortably with the experience of so few successful prosecutions. The number of cases investigated in the last six years ranged from 18 to 30 in any given year. Of those, three or four per year were successfully prosecuted before the courts, giving a total of 21 for 1997-2003. In those cases, around half received a custodial sentence and, of those custodial sentences, half were suspended. The number of people who wound up serving time in jail was an average of less than one per year.That does not sound like an aggressive policy of prosecution; it sounds like a lenient policy. If it is the case that the Revenue Commissioners are pursuing a lenient policy and do not feel comfortable or see it as a priority to prosecute, they should say so. They should come out and say their primary purpose is to raise money, to maximise the take to the Exchequer and that when it comes to prosecuting people in the criminal courts, they do not want to be a part of it and somebody else should do the job. If that is the case, the Garda or CAB should do the job, or they need a specialised unit within the Revenue Commissioners to do it. I accept that Revenue will still have to do most of the investigating but, nonetheless, the prosecution should be undertaken and dealt with elsewhere. However, it must happen on a far more widespread basis than is the case at present because the deterrent factor is important.The Minister of State might say that in cases such as this there are a number of legal problems, and I acknowledge there are. In cases where people have not paid their taxes, the primary penalty is the interest and the civil penalty they pay. In terms of the monetary loss, in all cases, the penalty imposed on the individual concerned is likely to be far higher than any fine they might have to pay. Nonetheless, there is an importance in prosecuting. Whatever about the shame of having one's name printed in a newspaper for having made a settlement over a certain amount, there is a far greater shame and stigma attached to prosecution and to being convicted in the courts. It is necessary for the Revenue to take a view on occasion that what should be done in a particular case is to secure a criminal conviction. If that means delaying pursuing the matter of civil penalties, that is what should be done because it needs to be done simply on the basis that it is a deterrent.There is an issue of self-incrimination. I was interested to hear what the Minister said on this issue in recent days. In effect, he said that if a person makes a voluntary full disclosure, he or she is immune from prosecution. I understand that argument. It would encourage people to make a voluntary full disclosure if they can at least be assured that they will not be prosecuted through the courts and the penalty will be simply a monetary one. The Revenue would seek to encourage people to move in that direction. However, I am strongly of the view that there needs to be a balance in this regard. While that approach might be good in most cases, it is not good in all, and it is necessary to make an example on occasion by foregoing the civil penalty and going down the road of criminal prosecution.I acknowledge that the Revenue in recent years has very much sharpened up its act in terms of special investigations. A great deal of money has been brought into the Exchequer as a result of the special investigations carried out into the scandals that came to light during the course of the 1990s. I refer to Ansbacher Cayman, NIB and so on. The total take from those various investigations is approximately €1,000 million or a little less. Those investigations have sent out the right signal. That they have been carried out quite rigorously, in so far as we can judge from the outside, has made it clear to people, who might have been inclined in the past to hide their money offshore, that offshore is no longer out of sight, beyond the reach of the Revenue Commissioners or, for that matter, beyond the reach of Irish law. Good work has been done in this regard and it would be churlish of me not to acknowledge that the Revenue has done a fine job in recent years in this area.The resolution we propose to the House is specifically on the issue of criminal prosecutions. It is to make the point, and I again make it forcefully, that in dealing with amnesty cases, in particular, and some high profile cases, of which we are all aware, this is a road which also must be taken.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	439	I second the motion.I wish to pick up on a point Senator McDowell made regarding the efficiency of the Revenue. Nobody could argue with the fact that the Revenue Commissioners have become far more efficient in their role in collecting taxes due to the Exchequer and the State from the myriad sources from which they need to be collected. One must commend them on that. However, the efficient collection of taxes is only one of the roles of Revenue.In recent times I have received serious complaints from two accountants who have complained to me as a public representative that they have found it difficult, particularly in the past year or two, to deal with the Revenue in regard to employers, in particular, attempting to get their affairs settled by the end of the year. They are experiencing difficulty with Revenue officials coming back to them; they have to make endless telephone calls, points have to be checked and so on. I would like to Minister to consider those complaints in the context of compliant taxpayers, people who want to ensure their employees have full cover and that their responsibilities as employers and taxpayers are fully met. We must remember that the vast majority of people are compliant taxpayers. Hopefully, the culture of tax evasion and the sense in past years that it was a good thing to get away with not paying tax is gone and that culture has at least faded.The subject of this motion is worth exploring. We are questioning whether the Revenue Commissioners are carrying out their other function of the effective prosecution of offenders, a role they play on behalf of members of the public, which we, the legislators, have given them to ensure that tax offenders are properly investigated and prosecuted.In the change of culture that has occurred around the issue of taxation in the past 20 or so years, it is necessary to have a sense that Revenue, in acting on our behalf, is doing so in a way that ensures that compliant taxpayers are fairly and efficiently treated and that the full rigours of the law are reflected in the outcomes in respect of those who do not comply. Hence, the strong powers given to Revenue when the tax amnesty legislation was passed, to which my colleague, Senator McDowell referred.There is a sense in the public domain that somehow tax offenders get away with it. There are penalties and one recalls the fairly recent publication of the list of the tax offenders; it is no bad thing that the list is published. However, the public embarrassment of one's name being on such a list and the financial penalty one must pay falls far short of a prosecution in court and of a potential penalty which might be handed down by the courts. That practice is a reflection of how the Legislature and members of the public view tax offenders. This is a matter I would like the Minister to examine. In other words, is it enough to simply have a financial penalty and the embarrassment of one's name being on such a list, even though that is quite severe in its own way? Why did we put a provision in regard to prosecution in the legislation? We, who are elected by the people, have placed it there to reflect our view and that of the public that tax offending is a serious offence. In that sense, it is a disappointment that it is not being fully exerted, and I believe members of the public share that view.If one is a compliant taxpayer and reads in the newspapers that the full powers of the Revenue are not being exerted in this regard, it causes one to question why one would be a good, honest and upright citizen. There is a sense abroad that the full rigours of the law should not only be used but should be seen to be used and that there should be rigorous enforcement of the tax code and of the powers that have been given to the Revenue Commissioners.There is much to be said for the separation of the roles of the collection of taxes, on the one hand, and prosecution of offenders on the other. The culture of the Revenue Commissioners is largely centred around the issue of collection, hence the issue of settlement. If a person is a tax offender, negotiations are entered into and there is a settlement. In other words, it is a case of getting the money in whatever happens, and that should be the case because the State and members of the public are entitled to have such tax revenue and to know that what is required to be paid is being paid. However, the issue of the pursuit and prosecution of offenders is extremely important and there is no doubt that there is a sense abroad that it is not being pursued as actively as it could be. It will have to be asked whether it is part of the culture of the Office of the Revenue Commissioners to do so. When one considers the Criminal Assets Bureau, for example, although the context is entirely different, one will note that the establishment of this single, dedicated unit to pursue a particular set of offenders has not only been highly effective, but has also resulted in a public perception that there is a serious commitment on the part of the State and Legislature to ensure that those offenders are prosecuted.

#IvorCallely	unknown-#IvorCallely-party	unknown-#IvorCallely-dob	unknown-#IvorCallely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	441	I apologise on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, who would like to be here but cannot attend because he is taking Committee Stage of the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Bill 2003 at present.I support the Government amendment, which highlights the Government's commitment to, and support of, the work of the Revenue Commissioners and their increasing success in tackling tax evasion in recent years. The primary function of the Revenue Commissioners is to enforce compliance with the customs and taxes legislation through collecting taxes and duties. A key objective in this regard is to meet the annual budget target. To this end, the Revenue Commissioners have been assigned responsibility for the care and management of all duties and tax and have been provided with a range of powers to enable that mandate to be fulfilled. These powers are reviewed regularly to ensure they are adequate for the task. The Seanad will be aware that the Minister for Finance recently published the report of the Revenue powers group, which he established last year to carry out a review of the powers available to the Revenue Commissioners.The Revenue Commissioners have made it very clear both by their actions and commitments that they have no tolerance of tax evasion. Their most recent statement of strategy for 2003-05 affirms their commitment to "making compliance easy while making non-compliance very unattractive" and to achieving this by a balanced approach combining a sharp uncompromising response to evasion and default while providing high quality services to compliant tax and duty payers. The statement of strategy has as its first goal maximum compliance with tax and customs legislation and this requires a balancing of Revenue resources between their various programmes so they are deployed effectively and efficiently in identifying and combating risk to the Exchequer.This approach to risk has been extremely successful with over €1 billion having been recovered for the benefit of the Exchequer through the special investigation projects initiated in recent years. This sum is additional to the recoveries made under the normal audit programmes of the Revenue Commissioners. The majority of cases where evasion is discovered are concluded on the basis of a negotiated settlement with the taxpayer, which involves collection of the unpaid tax together with interest and civil penalties. The level of civil penalties imposed is usually far greater than the level of fines imposed by the courts in similar cases and settlements are published on a quarterly basis in the tax defaulters list in Iris Oifigúil if the terms requiring such publication are met. Generally, the amounts paid by tax defaulters under this civil penalty settlement process are a multiple of the tax evaded in the first place.However, the Revenue Commissioners fully recognise that in addition to initiating programmes whose focus is largely on the recovery of unpaid taxes and the imposition of heavy penalties, offenders should also be prosecuted where this is possible. The statement of strategy for 2003-05 signals as one of its key strategies maximising compliance, the deterrence, detection and prosecution of evasion, smuggling and other breaches of the tax and customs legislation. This is regarded as a vital element in maximising compliance and ensuring the proper taxes and duties are paid on a timely basis to the Exchequer.The approach of the Revenue Commissioners is increasingly to investigate greater numbers of cases for criminal investigation with a view to their referral to the Director of Public Prosecutions. To this end and as part of their restructuring programme, the Revenue Commissioners recently established a new investigations and prosecutions division. This division, which now combines tax and customs and excise investigators, is tasked with co-ordinating all criminal investigations activity by the Revenue Commissioners and has been provided with additional resources to enable it to conduct more criminal investigations into serious evasion. All other areas of Revenue have been mandated to identify cases that are potentially suitable for prosecution and to refer these to the investigations and prosecutions division.These developments build on the approach which was adopted in 1996-7, when Revenue initially took on the function of investigating cases with a view to prosecution and referring them directly to the Director of Public Prosecutions. To achieve this, a number of officers in their investigation branch received training to develop the skills needed to investigate offences and meet the evidential requirements of criminal investigations. The initiative was undertaken in consultation with the Director of Public Prosecutions, who provided one of his professional officers to give guidance and advice to the Revenue investigators. Currently, the Director of Public Prosecutions has two officers available to Revenue investigators to discuss evidential matters and any other issues that arise in the course of investigations. Prior to 1990, the Revenue Commissioners referred cases to the Garda for investigation. As noted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report for 1995, the arrangements in place were not effective as only one case had reached the courts in the previous four years.Since 1996, 28 individuals and companies have been convicted of a variety of serious tax offences, six of these in the past 12 months. In 11 of these cases, jail sentences were imposed, although seven of these sentences were suspended. Fines were imposed in the rest of the cases. Currently, there are 42 cases of serious tax evasion under investigation with a view to prosecution, including six cases which are currently with the Director of Public Prosecutions awaiting directions. Additionally, there are a further two cases in respect of which bench warrants have been issued by the court because the defendants have absconded. With the procedures now in place in the investigations and prosecutions division and the arrangements between it and other areas of Revenue, new cases are being identified and added each month. This represents a considerable ratcheting up by the Revenue Commissioners in a relatively short timeframe of their prosecution activity. In addition to the aforementioned prosecutions, over 6,000 individuals and companies have, in the same period, been convicted of offences of failing to file tax returns following action by the Revenue Commissioners.Experience in the criminal investigation of tax cases to date indicates that there are very exacting evidential standards to be met to satisfy the criteria for a successful prosecution. Particular difficulties arise where vital documentation is not available, often due to the lapse of time or where witnesses are not available due to their location or reluctance to become involved where the suspect is an employer or business associate. This is in line with the experience of dealing with white collar crime generally. A selective approach must be adopted to avoid Revenue resources being tied up in what is an extremely labour-intensive process and where the outcome may ultimately be non-productive. Consequently, resources tend to be focused on cases in which it is reasonably clear from the outset that evidence of wrongdoing is available or likely to become available in the course of an investigation.Equally, the courts must be satisfied that the standards applied by investigators in conducting the investigation and gathering the evidence meet the requirements all of us like to ensure of fair procedure and due process, because of the potentially serious consequences for a suspect. Revenue officers must take care that at all stages of the investigation, not just the evidential aspects, the appropriate standards are met. Investigating a case with a view to possible prosecution and then taking suitable cases through the courts can be a slow and resource-intensive undertaking, regardless of who is involved. The process can be lengthy and cases can often involve officers in a number of appearances in court at the various stages.Another factor which influences the process of criminal investigations is the level of the powers available to the investigators. Revenue officers, in the course of their work in this area, have identified deficiencies which have curtailed their capacity to assemble the best evidence in some cases, and as a result of these experiences suggest matters for inclusion in Finance Bills.As the Seanad is aware, the current Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has a track record second to none in introducing legislation to augment Revenue powers in Finance Acts. Appearing last year before the Committee of Public Accounts, the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners pointed out that almost all of the developments in the "offshore area" could be attributed to the 1999 powers introduced by the Minister for Finance, which allows the Revenue to examine financial institutions in a way that was not possible previously.Most recently, the Minister for Finance received the report of the Revenue powers group, which examined the powers available to Revenue generally, but also considered the area of criminal investigation of tax evasion, and made certain recommendations which have a bearing on the matter. As my colleague, Deputy McCreevy, stated at the time of the introduction of the Finance Bill 2004 a few weeks ago, the recommendations of the group are being published to allow public debate and will be considered for next year's Bill.The Revenue Commissioners are satisfied with the level of success achieved to date in criminal prosecutions for tax evasion in the courts, but are determined and confident that their new approach and the establishment of the investigations and prosecutions division will increase the numbers of such cases. The level or severity of the sentences imposed is a matter for the courts but it should be remembered that the impact on a defendant is not limited to the sentence imposed by the court. For example, in one of the cases accepted for investigation in 1999 in which a conviction followed in 2003, a total fine of €1,750 was imposed. However, the convicted man and his company settled the liability to Revenue by paying in excess of €1.65 million. The courts are influenced by the fact that the Revenue Commissioners impose heavy penalties.The judgment of the Court of Criminal Appeal in the case of the Director of Public Prosecutions v. Redmond includes the following:It is plainly not possible for a sentencing court in a case such as this to ignore the fact that other penalties, which may be much greater in amount than the cumulative sum of the maximum fines for those charges, have already been made.Section 9 of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993 provides for an offence of failing to comply with the 1993 tax amnesty, that is, where a taxpayer who had knowingly and wilfully submitted false returns etc. either failed to make an amnesty declaration or gave a false amnesty declaration.Contrary to recent reports the Revenue Commissioners have never taken a general decision not to prosecute cases for breach of amnesty legislation. They have, however, experienced difficulty with investigating such cases.The 1993 amnesty legislation specifically prohibits access by Revenue auditors or investigators to amnesty declarations. Consequently it is not possible to examine these declarations to establish whether taxpayers are in breach of that legislation. Persons who made an incorrect declaration to the chief special collector would normally only be discovered during the course of a Revenue audit or investigation. The amnesty legislation provides that Revenue must apply for the consent of the appeal commissioners to conduct further inquiries into a case where it is suspected that the declaration is incorrect. The Revenue Commissioners have made approximately 20 such applications and consent has been given in about one third of the cases to date. Other cases have been investigated with the consent of the taxpayer, outside the 20 such applications to which I have referred.I am informed by Revenue that it has not been possible in any cases examined to date to obtain the evidence necessary to meet the required standard of "beyond reasonable doubt" as regards amnesty non-compliance offences. It is generally the case, also, that where a taxpayer agrees to co-operate in an investigation and Revenue cannot otherwise access relevant evidence, the taxpayer's rights against self-incrimination will restrict the potential for a prosecution.Those availing of the provisions of the Waiver of Certain Tax, Interest and Penalties Act 1993 benefited both by a financial saving — that is, the amount they had to pay to satisfy their debt to the Exchequer was less than it would otherwise have been — and by an assurance of confidentiality in their dealings with the special collectors appointed to deal with the amnesty. This provision of confidentiality restricts the ability of the Revenue Commissioners to gather evidence to support a criminal prosecution.In the course of the large scale investigation projects undertaken by Revenue in recent years, such as the investigation into the bogus non-resident account holders, taxpayers have paid additional taxes relating to years for which amnesty declarations should have been made, and it is likely that some have not made any amnesty declaration. Due to the vast scale of these investigations and the potential they have to lock up Revenue resources for years, the approach has been a pragmatic one, aimed at collecting the undeclared taxes together with substantial interest and penalties in the shortest possible time. Had Revenue adopted a criminal investigation approach to these cases, it would not have been possible to achieve these results, as a taxpayer once cautioned, is not obliged to incriminate himself or herself.This programme is continuing and will now focus on the small number of cases that have not come forward. They will be pursued and will be considered as potential prosecution cases and, where selected, will also face the prospect of being prosecuted as regards amnesty offences, if the relevant evidence can be assembled.I am also assured by Revenue that if in the course of any investigations, amnesty offences are identified and the necessary evidence is available, they will be investigated with a view to taking a criminal prosecution for such offences. There have been some reports that a ten year rule applies as regards amnesty offences. The Revenue has informed the Minister for Finance that the legal advice available is that there is no time limit on an investigation of indictable offences and investigators proceed on that basis.It can be seen from the results and the progress referred to already, that the Revenue Commissioners are serious about the pursuit of non-compliance with the tax code and the balanced approach being adopted has proven to be extremely successful. Their resolve to increase the number of cases being investigated and referred to the DPP is already bearing fruit, with the numbers of such cases at an all time high. The present arrangements are working effectively. The Law Reform Commission in its consultation paper on a fiscal prosecutor and a revenue court, published in July 2003, looked at the treatment of revenue offences, including the workings of the public prosecution system and surveyed the existing system for bringing revenue prosecutions. The paper includes a recommendation that the arrangements currently in place for the prosecution of revenue offences be maintained for a period and then reviewed in a few years. The Law Reform Commission's final report is due to issue later this year.The message should be clear. Anyone who hides taxable income or evades tax will be pursed by the Revenue Commissioners. Unlike others who had the opportunity but failed to do so, the Government backed the efforts to tackle evasion with important and effective legislative initiatives, to which I referred earlier, and has provided significant extra resources and an additional 400 staff in the audit and compliance area. By comparison to earlier years and having regard to the excellent results achieved on general tax compliance initiatives by Revenue and the emerging results in prosecutions, the Government sees no reason to disturb the existing arrangements for prosecutions.The Government's commitment to provide the Revenue Commissioners with the necessary resources and powers is clear. I, therefore, ask Senators to support the Government amendment.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	442	I welcome and endorse this timely, opportune and valid Labour Party motion and agree with the thrust of Senator McDowell and Senator O'Meara's remarks in that regard. I am galled by the manner in which the Revenue Commissioners wastes so much time and resources investigating the small taxpayer. In my previous capacity as a Deputy and currently as a Senator I have been approached in my clinics by 20 or 25 people who received forms and queries in triplicate from the Revenue Commissioners regarding the holding of overseas bank accounts. I know the individuals concerned, some of whom are in receipt of small farmers benefit and non-contributory old age pensions. The majority of them have never worked outside the country or, if they did, they worked on building sites and returned here and invested whatever small savings they had for a rainy day. In none of the cases with which I have dealt and on behalf of which I have contacted the Revenue Commissioners is there any evidence of overseas bank accounts. When they replied to the Revenue Commissioners' queries, they received another series of registered letters in triplicate which frightened them. In some cases, the people concerned were suicidal as a result of the constant barrage of queries, yet there was no evidence to substantiate the claim.The Minister of State said that since 1996 some 28 companies have been convicted of a variety of serious tax offences, six of them in the past 12 months. In 11 cases, prison sentences were imposed, seven of which were suspended. There have been only 28 prosecutions during the past seven years plus. That is derisory. We are speaking here of criminal prosecutions. The Minister of State referred in his contribution to "serious tax offences" yet prison sentences in seven of the 11 cases mentioned were suspended. Were any of the people involved in the other four cases ever sent to prison? Will they go to prison? Are they currently in prison? While 28 convictions were obtained, prison sentences were imposed in only 11 cases, seven of which were suspended. What happened in the other 17 cases? If the offences committed were serious, the people concerned should have received custodial sentences as in the case of Lester Pigott.

We will not get to grips with the situation until such time as people who commit serious tax offences are imprisoned.The Minister of State referred to yet another review of the powers of the Revenue Commissioners. Its powers have been reviewed time and again. An announcement by the Revenue Commissioners in 1997 that it was going to vigorously pursue tax dodgers received banner headlines in the media. The compliant taxpayer and, in particular, the PAYE taxpayer who has carried the can for so long, who watched tax evaders availing of creative accountancy and obtaining higher education grants while they had to pay to put their children through college, felt that at long last they would get a fair deal and the tax dodger would get what was coming to him. That has not happened. The figures speak for themselves.The Minister of State and Senator McDowell spoke about the 1993 amnesty. The Minister said:The 1993 amnesty legislation specifically prohibits access by Revenue auditors or investigators to amnesty declarations. Consequently, it is not possible to examine these declarations to establish whether taxpayers are in breach of that legislation.A section of the legislation which seeks to dig out tax dodgers undermines the thrust of that legislation. Why should the Revenue Commissioners have to seek from the appeals commissioners further information on whether a person falsely availed of a tax amnesty? That is a farce.The underlying arrogance of the Revenue Commissioners was discussed in the House in relation to the Ombudsman's report to both Houses of the Oireachtas on tax refunds due to two widows in Cork. The matter was also dealt with by an Oireachtas joint committee and eventually refunds were made. Senator Mansergh, who is a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, will be aware of another case involving a major stand-off between a recommendation made by the Ombudsman and the failure of the Revenue Commissioners to comply with that recommendation even though it was found to be out of court.There is no comparison between the Revenue Commissioners and the Criminal Assets Bureau which investigated John Gilligan, Ray Burke and other major transgressors. It dug its teeth in even though tax evasion issues is not its primary function. Such issues only arise if there is evidence of serious corruption. The time has come to handover these powers to the Criminal Assets Bureau, to give the Garda working within that bureau the powers they so effectively use so that at last this issue can be addressed. The Revenue Commissioners, which has had these powers for long enough, has not confronted the problem.

I do not necessarily agree with the thrust of every recommendation it makes but this is a matter well worth airing. I would like to pick up on a point made by Senator Higgins. I strongly believe that the Ombudsman's recommendations should be observed and carried out by the Revenue Commissioners or any other public authority. If there is a lack of legal power to ensure they do so, annual legislation should take care of it.I welcome the success and progress in recent years in tackling tax evasion. It has been a factor in the significant revenue buoyancy we have enjoyed. In a little more than a decade, revenue has tripled, due mainly to economic growth, higher employment and broadening of the tax bands. Also, there is more compliance with tax laws than was previously the case. One cannot measure the success of the Revenue Commissioners by the number of people it catches. One must consider those it deters, something we cannot measure. Increased revenue, as we all know, helps to fund services and to reduce the weight of the tax burden born heavily by a limited number of people, in the PAYE sector in particular.I welcome the more rigorous, without fear or favour, approach taken by the Revenue Commissioners. We have to take note in this discussion of the statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, in the Dáil yesterday in reply to a question on refocusing the establishment of an investigations and prosecutions division:If in the course of investigations amnesty offences are identified and the necessary evidence is available they will be investigated with a view to taking a criminal prosecution for such offences.In addition to the Revenue Commissioners, there is the Criminal Assets Bureau but I accept this operates in a different context.I understand that the Revenue Commissioners adopt a certain pragmatism. The objective is to maximise revenue. They not only collect from the non-compliant but they also encourage compliance by others. It costs €85,000 per year to imprison somebody. Generally speaking, tax offenders are in a different category from other offenders in that they have a large amount of income and assets.

There is no doubt that officials of banks and other financial institutions encouraged people — they often germinated the idea in those people's minds in the first instance — to open non-resident accounts. The idea of prosecuting them seems to have been brushed aside but I hope that some individuals will take civil cases and that some of these will be successful.Another point which must be borne in mind and which is often forgotten is that we are operating in a totally different context than was the case 20 years ago. At that time we had a high tax regime which — it does not justify it in any way whatsoever — encouraged evasion, as every country has discovered. It was difficult when we had a currency of our own to pursue hot money because there was a danger of creating black holes, particularly in terms of withholding tax. The single currency has helped us to adopt a much more rigorous approach because the effects of money leaving the country are no longer the same as they were previously.Senator McDowell gave a fair account of the 1993 tax amnesty. I agree that it was a marginal exercise. If memory serves, it raised approximately £230 million and followed a much more successful amnesty in 1988 which raised £500 million. Part of the reason for its success is that confidentiality was promised and guaranteed.There are signs, with the establishment of the new branch, of a realisation that a great deal of expertise is needed to deal with the type of issue highlighted by the tribunals. I am sure that the tribunals have only shown the tip of the iceberg. Labyrinthine accounting practices have been used which make it extremely difficult to know who holds income and where.I recall being shocked approximately ten years ago, when my party was in government with Labour, at a dinner at which a senior executive of a well known media organisation was present. He and several others began giving out about a man much in the news at present, namely, the then Commissioner Flynn, in respect of his socialist tendencies in Europe. The topic of conversation was the social charter. The individual in question said to me that he hoped the Government was not pursuing tax evasion too seriously.There is a large and complex task to be undertaken in respect of a few people on higher incomes. The Revenue Commissioners have a great deal more to do. As Senator Higgins stated, the Revenue Commissioners are, on the whole, successful in capturing evasion by relatively small people or businessmen. I wish we could be convinced that they were equally successful in dealing with all the bigger individuals.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I wish to raise the issue of tax reliefs. The chairman of the Revenue Commissioners was quoted recently as saying that in extreme cases exploiting legal tax loopholes is not very different from a guilty man walking free because of a legal technicality. Despite those remarks, the recent Finance Bill introduced a number of new tax shelters and reliefs which will benefit the very wealthy. The Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, has done little to remove tax loopholes. For example, nothing has been done about reliefs for the bloodstock industry and numerous other reliefs in order to try to stop that type of tax avoidance. People who avail of these shelters are denying the country revenue which could be used to pay for public services, etc. Everyone suffers as a result.Little has also been done in the past couple of years to remove more people from the higher income tax rate. I understand that more than half of taxpayers will be paying at the higher rate in 2004. An array of non-income related taxes have been introduced under the Government's policies. An obvious example, about which I feel strongly, is the waste charge county councils must pay. This charge shows up the difference in way people are treated. Ordinary people are treated in a totally different way when they do not pay their tax. The Government introduced a provision where if people do not pay their waste charges, councils can refuse to collect their rubbish. The people who are affected could be totally compliant as regards their income tax but they might be on low incomes or there could be many other reasons for their not having paid their waste charges. However, non-payment means that they are being denied an important service.The type of people who avoid paying millions in income tax receive all their services and are able to settle with the Revenue if they are caught. In general, these individuals do not face jail. I do not support or agree with the kind of protests that have been mounted against waste charges. However, it is sickening to see those involved in these protests jailed while others who have effectively robbed the country of millions can travel abroad and enjoy themselves. Ordinary people are becoming extremely angry about this type of tax evasion and that is why they get annoyed about additional charges such as the bin tax.The Government seems to have decided that it will take this route in order to obtain the additional taxes. It is not prepared to deal with tax evasion or close the loopholes which aid tax avoidance. It is determined to hammer those on middle and lower incomes for everything it can. The Government will probably come forward with proposals in the future to bring back third level fees. It charges fees for every type of service etc., which do not bear any relation to people's incomes but it will not properly pursue those who do not pay sufficient income tax.
#LiamFitzgerald	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-party	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-dob	unknown-#LiamFitzgerald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I second the Government amendment to the motion.The motion measures success and effectiveness in the enforcement of the tax laws solely in terms of the number of criminal convictions secured on the basis of those laws and the 1993 tax amnesty. To be fair to Senator McDowell, in the course of his contribution he covered a much wider area. However, I must interpret the motion on the basis of its text. The motion calls for the transfer of responsibility for the prosecution of offences to a body other than the Revenue Commissioners. While his analysis of that was quite reasonable, Senator McDowell did not justify the proposal to transfer jurisdiction in these matters. The proposal has echoes of a recent proposal to transfer powers to deal with institutionalised child abuse from the Department of Education and Science to the Department of the Taoiseach.One is tempted to ask if we are witnessing the emergence of a pattern whereby people who put forward arguments which do not seem to be cogent are tempted to propose that responsibility for the matter under discussion should be transferred to another agency to let someone else deal with it. I do not accept the validity of that argument. I apologise to Senator Higgins as it is my own fault I could not hear him. While Senator McDowell's arguments were very balanced, I do not accept that the logical conclusion is that there is clear justification for transferring those powers. I would not like to see that tactic becoming pervasive in the Houses of the Oireachtas. It would take from the reasoned exchanges of which Senator McDowell is more than capable. He does not need me to tell him that.The Government amendment is a clear acknowledgement that we have had a problem of tax evasion for many years. It is still with us as Senator Mansergh pointed out. It is being dealt with although it is a long way from being fully addressed. The amendment further acknowledges that the powers and resources available to the Revenue Commissioners must be reviewed constantly and increased as appropriate. As the evidence shows, the Government has assiduously set about that task since 1997. That cannot be contradicted. The work the Government has done and its initiatives have had significant and growing success which has been acknowledged by all sides this evening. Major changes have been made to the powers of the Revenue Commissioners, the most significant of which were introduced in the Finance Act 1999. It must be acknowledged that the capacity of Revenue to investigate tax evasion has been substantially improved.Some of the most significant changes in the 1999 Act related to financial institutions and the taxpayers' information which they held. Among other measures, the Revenue Commissioners were given powers to carry out on-site audits of banks whereas previously they were prohibited from entering bank premises. They were also given powers to carry out proper audits of DIRT returns by getting behind non-resident declarations to check their bona fides. This was unheard of up to that time. The Revenue Commissioners were given powers of access to bank accounts of named taxpayers and to a class of unidentified taxpayer with the consent of the appeal commissioners or the High Court.In the same year, the Revenue Commissioners were given much freer access to third party information for the purpose of validating tax returns. A number of miscellaneous powers were enacted including the introduction of a requirement that the donor of a gift, as well as its recipient, should make a return to Revenue detailing its particulars. These extensive and previously unenvisaged powers have had profound effects on the successful pursuit of institutional and individual tax evasion. It cannot be denied that they have struck at the core of the culture of secrecy employed so effectively by institutions and individuals in a manner which allowed fraud and evasion to thrive and spread for decades. The evidence of this fraud and evasion is emerging now.The 1999 measures, additional powers granted since then and new structures within the Revenue Commissioners, including the establishment of the dedicated investigations and prosecutions division last year, have resulted in the recovery of upwards of €1 billion under different headings. Under the DIRT heading alone, some €800 million has been recovered. All speakers have referred to the recent report of the Revenue powers group which I wish to refer to in detail later if there is an opportunity. The report states that certain recently introduced Revenue powers have clearly been used to considerable effect.The report also states that Revenue figures show a clear link between the power to access information on DIRT from financial institutions and the substantial yields from settlement of cases arising from the use of these powers. It further states that the powers have been cited by the Revenue Commissioners as essential to their success in the DIRT look-back audits, follow-up projects investigating the underlying depositors and the inquiries into Ansbacher and other offshore entities. According to the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners when addressing the Committee of Public Accounts last October, the aggregate figure in the context of these matters comes to approximately €892 million.To be fair, no Minister for Finance in the history of the State has provided the Revenue Commissioners with as many additional powers as the current office holder. If any Minister has been the bane of tax experts and analysts, history must record it has been him. The name and shame campaign has been referred to and, with some reservations, I believe it has been successful, although some might say that success has been moderate. The Minister for Finance's programme of providing additional powers and resources to the Revenue Commissioners on a review by review basis together with the establishment of the investigations and prosecutions division will reap rewards in the years ahead. The division refocuses the thrust of the Revenue's programme of investigation.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The motion has prompted many levels of agreement on all sides of the House, but we should cast our minds back. It is not that long since a Taoiseach addressed a St. Patrick's day group in Washington with the infamous words that income taxation was still something of a novelty in Ireland. As we have been finding out ever since, that is part of the problem. There was a macho view until very recently that it was a great thing not to pay taxes. That view continues to be maintained in many places. I dislike the focus in this debate on those decent public servants who work in the Revenue Commissioners and do their utmost in the face of all sorts of difficult circumstances. Those circumstances are often created by Members of the Houses of the Oireachtas who make regular representations at senior level on issues of tax which they should not go anywhere near.Since I saw the film "Al Capone", I have held a view on the best way to deal with such people. He was finally brought to justice by the US Department of the Treasury rather than by armed agents of the FBI. I spoke recently to the senior Northern Ireland police officer dealing with the establishment of a copy-cat version of our Criminal Assets Bureau. He said that in all his investigations and discussions with people he has come to one conclusion, namely, that in terms of dealing with violent criminals or with those criminals who are not tax compliant, he would prefer to see the latter poor and out of prison than rich and in prison. I feel strongly about that and would prefer above all to see such people stripped of their assets.I appreciate the point made earlier by Senator Higgins suggesting a closer tie-in — I accept it is there, and growing — between the Criminal Assets Bureau and the Revenue Commissioners. They should work hand in hand. We should recognise too that this is partly a resources problem. On three occasions in the last year I have raised in this House the lack of support within the Criminal Assets Bureau. The situation has marginally improved in recent times, but when I checked within the last year, there were only either two or three detectives attached to the Criminal Assets Bureau to deal with the biggest crime growth area in our country. That is a reflection on the political system for which the Government must take responsibility. It is not good enough that this situation should be allowed continue.We also need to look at the issue of naming and shaming. There have been improvements but we need to consider the issue further. Naming and shaming is very effective nowadays but would not have been so 15 years ago. Let us be honest with ourselves. People who evaded tax 15 or 20 years ago were almost heroes. People did not know or did not acknowledge that the money was ultimately coming out of their own pockets. There has been a sea change in attitude. I agree with the motion in that there has been a certain duplicity in the political view of this issue. That comes into play very often when one talks of compliance and is dealing with the issue of paying taxes and giving powers to the Revenue Commissioners; people then talk of the difficulty of attracting foreign direct investment. That argument has been used time and again.The other argument is that the country would fall apart if one of the major banks were found to be involved in any type of fraud or activity that was less than compliant. That attitude still exists. I came across a lot of it when dealing with the audit review group. In his speech, the Minister of State said we are now part of Europe, and could look at the matter. That is no help. In Germany, listed companies on the Dax, the German stock market, might have to comply with four different sets of compliance from different backgrounds, states and places. There is no co-ordination between the auditing standards boards of the US Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington and the equivalent groups in the UK and the euro area. Those are three huge areas which cannot get together.I do not know how many years it took us to get people to decide on the colour of a passport. This matter is similar. The idea that we cannot do it is quite extraordinary. There are people in this city working in auditing for the Revenue Commissioners and others who have different standards with which they must comply depending on who they are doing the work for. It is a mess. The only positive aspect I can see is that in recent times many people who work for Elan — not far from the constituency of the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera — were saved by this. As Elan had to comply with the more stringent compliance regulations of the Irish authorities, it was able to prove it was not on the same wavelength as those companies perpetrating the major frauds that were going on in the US at the time, regarding the selling of advance royalties back to themselves and paying the money over again. There are huge problems in this area which will not be dealt with until we get some sort of co-ordination. That is an issue in which I would like our EU Presidency to show some interest.I agree with the tenet of the motion, that not enough people have been jailed. More should be jailed, and if that does not happen, we will all look like fools for putting up with the situation.I do not agree with the criticism of the Revenue Commissioners. They have been invested by us with the power to make judgment calls, which they can and do make. We do not know the inside stories. For every case we might hear of, I could match it with another. Within the last two weeks I was talking to a Minister who told me of someone in his constituency who was going to lose his farm because of his offshore involvements some ten years ago. That is an example of the Revenue Commissioners holding a line. The significant fact is that every politician who was in that circle of discussion felt sorry for that ordinary farmer who was going to lose his farm. I do not blame them, and I felt sorry too. On the other hand, it was the Revenue Commissioners who were taking a stand on the issue and who were not prepared to back off in such situations, just as they never do. Every time they take a strong line they are equally criticised.This is not an easy issue. The motion has been hugely important and I congratulate the Labour group on tabling it. As Senator Mansergh said, it raises issues which we must address. I do not know the easy answers. More resources are called for, along with a cleaner system of reportage back to both Houses, so that we have a clearer understanding of what the Revenue Commissioners do. They have not helped themselves by their rejection of the Ombudsman on two occasions in the last year. That does not help their public image.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	455	This motion is ill-timed because it comes at a time when the Revenue Commissioners have successfully completed the roll-out of a dynamic new customer-focused risk-based regional operating structure. After a period of fundamental redesign, restructuring and upskilling of a complexity never before attempted in the Irish public service, the Revenue Commissioners and their staff have enthusiastically and with great flexibility responded to the ever-changing needs of a modern economy. This process of change continues and deepens apace under the umbrella of Sustaining Progress, and benchmarking.The Revenue Commissioners have willingly embraced changes in work practices, fully integrating Customs and Excise with the mainstream taxes service, and launching new specialist operating divisions dealing nationally with the largest and most complex cases, as well as a new investigation and prosecutions division.This motion is also ill-timed because it comes after a period of intensive capability building, where Revenue Commissioners chairman Frank Daly and Commissioners Fehilly and O'Grady have undertaken Trojan work to energise staff at all levels and rebuild morale after the trials of the Committee of Public Accounts hearings of 1999.The Progressive Democrats is committed to ensuring the Revenue Commissioners are given all necessary resources, financial and human, to discharge their onerous duties. My party in Government will guarantee that the programme of modernisation already successfully started, and now copperfastened by the benchmarking flexibilities, is fully implemented. This motion asks us to respond to Revenue's initiative and change by launching an unveiled disingenuous attack on their professionalism, ability and commitment.This motion is more than merely mis-timed. It is seriously ill-informed and ill-judged because it displays a breathtaking ignorance of critical elementary legal principles. All taxpayers are obliged to pay the proper amount of tax due on their income or capital whether corporate or personal. Where a taxpayer fails to do so, Revenue vigorously pursues 100% of the tax underpaid, plus interest due from the date it should have been paid, and a tax year penalty payment. This penalty is the punishment for failure to take due care, for error, omission, gross carelessness or negligence. These civil penalties are robustly but fairly and successfully enforced by Revenue.This motion ignores this highly successful aspect of Revenue's audits programme, looking instead at a very different issue called evasion. The motion misunderstands the legal reality faced by Revenue. Tax evasion is a crime. The prosecutions that the Opposition representatives call for are criminal in nature, and if they are to succeed, they must meet the heavy burden of proof required in such cases. Most importantly, the motion fails to realise that the Revenue Commissioners do not have the right or authority to prosecute. That responsibility lies with another agency, the Director of Public Prosecutions. It is the DPP who directs whether a case should be prosecuted. The DPP will rightly only permit proceedings to be initiated if satisfied on the available admissible evidence that there is a case to answer and where the evidence is sufficiently robust to prove beyond doubt that an offence was committed.It may have slipped the minds of my colleagues on the opposite side of the House but under our sound legal system, the accused, even those accused of tax evasion, are innocent until proven guilty. That guilt must be established beyond reasonable doubt. To successfully prosecute a case the Revenue must establish that a tax is not only underpaid but that the evader set out wilfully and knowingly on a pre-determined course of action, with deliberate intent to evade lawful tax. The mere fact that the tax due was not paid is not sufficient. That could be as a result of neglect or gross carelessness as opposed to the evil intent of the wilful evader.The burden of proof rests rightly with the prosecution, the Revenue Commissioners. This is the fundamental issue facing Revenue. It must know a taxpayer is evading and how he or she is doing that but it must also establish that it is a wilful act of deliberate criminal intent beyond reasonable doubt. No matter where responsibility for tax prosecutions rests, this remains a mountain to be climbed. Indeed, one might consider the larger strategic question as to whether it would be in the national interest for Revenue or any other State agency to initiate prosecutions for criminal wrong-doing where it had little prospect of securing a conviction due to a lack of credible evidence as to criminal intent. What message would a series of acquittals send to those who might consider wrong-doing?I urge the House to reject this unworkable, illogical proposal which would add a further layer of bureaucracy between the investigating officer and the prosecution service. Does anyone seriously believe this proposal will improve efficiency or the chances of successful prosecutions by divorcing investigation from prosecution?
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I welcome the Minister of State.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that in many cases examined to date it has not been possible to obtain the evidence necessary to meet the required standard of beyond reasonable doubt in amnesty non-compliance offences. It is generally the case also that where a taxpayer agrees to co-operate in an investigation and Revenue cannot otherwise access relevant evidence, the taxpayer's rights against self-incrimination will restrict the potential for a prosecution.Apart from the amnesty aspect, however, Revenue has been successful recently in collecting outstanding tax and interest and imposing civil penalties on many tax evaders in its ongoing investigations. Individual tax evaders have made considerable retribution for their offences as a direct consequence of the large monetary settlements resulting from investigations.Revenue's criminal investigation programmes have been refocused recently with the establishment of an investigation and prosecutions division. If, in the course of investigations, amnesty offences are identified and the necessary evidence is available, they will be investigated with a view to taking criminal prosecutions for such offences.On the matter of the prosecution of officials from financial institutions who may have assisted in placing funds in bogus non-residential accounts, the primary responsibility for ensuring that a tax return is correct rests with the individual making that return. There is a statutory offence in the tax code of knowingly aiding or abetting another person to make an incorrect tax return. In the case of third parties generally, however, the standard of evidence required to incriminate them for alleged wrong-doing by a taxpayer who has failed to declare correct income or gains is very difficult to meet.I understand from the Revenue Commissioners that while in their experience aiding and abetting offences are notoriously difficult to prosecute, it will be their general policy to pursue such cases if such evidence becomes available.As Senator Fitzgerald mentioned, it should also be noted that no Minister for Finance in the history of the State has given the Revenue Commissioners more powers in Finance Acts to preclude tax evasion than the current Minister, Deputy McCreevy. The Finance Act 1999 in particular gave the Revenue Commissioners a host of powers that were not previously available to them, and the Minister has added to those powers in other respects.Tax avoidance is the legal use of sections of the Finance Acts or other legislation for purposes for which they were not intended. No Minister has acted as quickly as the current Minister for Finance to close off the unintended uses of legislation. He acted in this manner in the recent Finance Bill and in announcements he has made since the publication of the Bill. The Revenue Commissioners are charged with operating the tax code and are currently engaged in the investigation.Having been a self-employed business person for many years and having taken out loans in various banks, particularly in the 1970s and 1980s, I am aware that when one inquired about borrowing money there was no mention of the tax man. However, if a self-employed person tries to borrow money from a bank today, the first question they are asked is whether they are fully compliant in terms of their tax affairs. That is a welcome development. From personal experience of the people I deal with in business on a weekly basis, I do not know anybody who is not fully compliant with the tax code.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I will try to be brief and not breach the time available. There is not much difference between both sides of the House in what we hope for from the implementation of the tax laws by the Revenue Commissioners. There is a general determination on all sides that illegality, impropriety and evasion should be rooted out and dealt with severely. The question arises as to the method by which that might be best done in the interest of the State and its citizens, and in the interest of fair play.Coming back to a point made by Senator O'Toole, there have been major improvements over the past 15 years. The culture has changed dramatically. Perhaps there is still some way to go but at that time people who evaded tax were regarded as heroes in some quarters. A name and shame policy would not have been effective. It is effective now and there is a general desire on the part of the public to ensure everybody pays their taxes. Part of the reason for that is that the burden of tax on individuals has been greatly alleviated through successive Governments and the rates are lower. When we started talking about the need to reduce personal rates of taxation there was a general negative reaction to it on the basis that services would be reduced. The proposition put forward of increased revenue to the State was widely rejected at the time. Fortunately, that culture has changed.There should be no need for further amnesties. The purpose of amnesties was to draw a line and it is correct to say, as Senator McDowell said — I can vividly recall it when the legislation was going through the House — that the penalties for false declarations would be so draconian nobody would make any attempt to avoid their responsibilities. That was put into the legislation to ensure the reservations in the Labour Party and elsewhere were dealt with. The Revenue has enormous powers with regard to those false declarations.I also accept the proposition that some of these matters would be more appropriately dealt with through the Criminal Assets Bureau than by Revenue. The Revenue Commissioners do a very good job. Revenue is far more user friendly than many Departments. It is a model in terms of the clarity of the advice one gets, the fact that one gets rapid decisions and that it is very helpful, from my experience as a taxpayer, when one has reason to contact them. They are also sensitive to individuals.To some extent Senator Higgins wants it both ways. He wants the poor man who came back from England with a few bob in his pocket and who is living in the west to be dealt with——

I accept that but there are also individuals who came back and who appeared to live in frugality but when they died one read in the newspaper what they left in their will and they were obviously wealthy.It is appropriate that the Revenue Commissioners have the type of flexibility and sensitivity needed to deal with each case on its merits as it arises. I do not see anything wrong with that. They do that to a reasonable extent. The late Senator Paddy McGowan got apoplectic about the ruthlessness of the Revenue Commissioners in Donegal. Perhaps there are cases where individuals are less sensitive than others. That can be dealt with, but the best place to hit wealthy people who are greedy is in their pockets.

#JohnDardis	unknown-#JohnDardis-party	unknown-#JohnDardis-dob	unknown-#JohnDardis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	466	Whether a jail sentence is an effective deterrent in the case of very large sums of money is questionable. I know of one case with regard to the misuse of hormones in cattle where the person chose to go to jail rather than pay the fine because, in his view, it was worth £20,000 per week, or whatever, to go into relative luxury in a jail in the west and remain their for the period. We need to be aware of what these people are about.On the issue of offshore accounts, I accept there are double taxation treaties. I accept that if people are resident outside the country, they pay the tax in the country in which they are resident. Apparently, Portugal has tightened up its property laws with regard to people avoiding — not evading — capital taxes. Somebody somewhere has to recognise that what is good business is not good citizenship and that citizens have a responsibility to their country. There are wealthy individuals who accept those responsibilities but there are others, who are extremely wealthy, who do not and questions have to be asked.My final point, which was raised on the Order of Business this morning, relates to the taxation of the bloodstock industry. The first thing that has to be said is that the exemption is on the stud fees of stallions. While the flagships of Coolmore and Godolphinare in the public eye, many others are struggling to make ends meet in the industry.If this country means anything to many countries abroad, it is the quality of its bloodstock industry. We saw last night on "Horse Operas" Aidan O'Brien going to America with Johannesburg and High Chaparral and winning, effectively, the world championship of racing. The comments made by the leading American trainers about the quality of the Irish bloodstock was something to behold. This industry was dying on its feet because the best stallions in the world were being exported. Now, at least, we have Saddlers Wells and the one we are not meant to speak about because of the dispute which is taking place at present, Rock of Gibraltar. These are world class animals and they should stay in this country so that our world class industry survives and prospers. I am not critical of the exemption on stallion fees. In my county of Kildare, there are far more people involved in the horse industry, 10,500, than in farming. It is a hugely important industry and it has provided jobs to people who had little going for them. Let us be clear about it — it is an exemption on stud fees. It is represented as an exemption on all the activities of the industry but it is not.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	467	I thank Members for what was a reasonably serious debate. What prompted me to raise this issue, and I did so on the Order of Business, was a report, which I have not heard contradicted, that the Revenue had concluded that there was no evidence that any bank encouraged people to set up bogus offshore accounts of which there were 145,000 in their heyday. I am supposed to believe there is no evidence that people did other than go into banks and open bogus accounts, on their own initiative, without any assistance, advice or encouragement from the very banks which were advertising ostensibly the benefits of a non-resident having an account in Ireland. I do not believe that is true. I am not saying the Revenue is doing anything improper; I am saying that in the way it does its business it concluded it could not find evidence. I do not believe that is the case.I do not think most citizens believe one could have 140,000 non-resident accounts and not have the banking system, to some extent, involved in encouraging it. One starts from that position about the Revenue Commissioners that they have come to that conclusion. I shall quote a little of what the Minister of State said, but Senator O'Toole has been disingenuous because I do not want this to be an attack on good public servants. It is an assessment of the capacity of one group of public servants to do a particular job and a judgment call about whether it could be done better by other people. If Members of the Oireachtas are not able to do that about the public service generally, we might as well forget about our job altogether. That is all it is about. There are no attacks on people. In his contribution the Minister of State referred to the "approach which was adopted in 1996-7, when Revenue initially took on the function of investigating cases with a view to prosecution and ... a number of officers in the investigation branch received training..." He stated further:Since 1996, 28 individuals and companies have been convicted of a variety of serious tax offences, six of these in the past 12 months. In 11 of these cases, jail sentences were imposed... Currently, there are 42 cases of serious tax evasion under investigation with a view to prosecution...That is in this period when they began to do it.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	469	We are talking about serious offences here. In the same period, between 2,000 and 3,000 people have been convicted of welfare offences. What I would like to highlight is that there are very exacting evidential standards to be met in order to satisfy the criteria for a successful prosecution. Why is that not the case when 300 or 400 people per year are prosecuted successfully for welfare abuse?A selective approach must be adopted to avoid Revenue resources being tied up in what is an extremely labour-intensive process. Why is that not the case? The reason is that the average citizen who is charged with Revenue offences — not all, but most of them — does not have access to high quality accountants, high quality lawyers and all the other high quality advice about their rights. They are, therefore, easy targets to prosecute. I am not saying the Department does anything illegal but the average citizen does not know what he or she does not have to say or what he or she can avoid doing. They do not know any of that and, therefore, it is comparatively easy to prosecute.Effectively, what the Revenue is saying is that it cannot prosecute them because the difficulty of proving it is so great. The difficulty of proving it is that these people, as they are entitled under the Constitution and under our law, use all the devices every citizen has to ensure they are dealt with fairly. However, what it looks like to society, correctly in my view, is that it is essentially a system of one law for the rich and one law for the poor.People mentioned imprisonment. The word "imprisonment" is not mentioned in our motion because I am not greatly enthusiastic about locking people up. For instance, I am not a great enthusiast for locking old people up, whatever their offences might have been during their political careers, but I am an enthusiast for the process of trial and conviction. As I have said before in the House, I would not have liked to see General Pinochet locked up; putting an 80 year old man in jail does not appeal to me. However, the fact of prosecution is an enormously significant matter in the context of the point made by Senator Dardis regarding the view rich people have of themselves and the view of rich people that other people have.I agree with Senator Dardis that we, in this country, are moving on. However, if we are to move on, the citizens must believe that everybody is equal before the law and has similar rights before the law, and that everybody's rights are taken equally seriously by those who enforce the law. People notice that while, of course, some are now paying over large sums of money, for the past 15 or 20 years most people were told there was no great pot of unpaid tax money. It turned out there was an enormous pot of real money, bigger than most on the Left ever suggested, deliberately hidden, with malice aforethought, to prevent people paying tax.That ought to have been evident in the first year after the DIRT tax was introduced, when the first year's revenue from that tax was three times higher than the Revenue Commissioners had forecast, even though interest rates had dropped relative to the previous year. That was a signal that something did not match and that estimates of income, bank deposits and revenue were way out of kilter. From then on, citizens have watched a succession of issues emerge and matters arise. At the end of it all, after the best part of 20 years, some 28 individuals or companies have been convicted of serious tax offences, six of them in the last 12 months — we are getting a little better.That does not make a case for retaining the present situation but for an independent vigorous body to deal with the issue of the criminal prosecution and criminal conviction of those who commit what is a criminal offence. We should remember it is a double offence: it is a criminal offence not to pay tax and also scandalously non-civic minded, having not paid tax, to use all the services that society provides for which such people do not pay.Senator Dardis referred to those who try to avoid their civic duty of paying tax by moving in and out of the country. While we may not be able to force such people to pay what they ought and what most of us feel morally obliged to pay, the least we could do is to avoid giving such people the adulation of allowing them to preside over large charitable fundraising efforts, from which the charity does not raise a fraction of the amount of tax that such people have avoided paying.

In page 49, subsection (1), line 40, after "divorce" to insert "or makes an order recognising a foreign decree of divorce as being valid in the State".The amendment seeks to provide a comprehensive registration of decrees of divorce to cover circumstances where a court recognises a foreign order as being valid in this country.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The section provides for the registration of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity of marriage granted in the State. Currently, each court holds its own records of decree of divorce and civil nullity of marriage. There is no central database or repository of decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity within the court system. Persons wishing to remarry, following the granting of such decrees, must provide a copy of the decree to the registrar from the relevant court. The Courts Service will act as the registrar and these are considered a vital event as they have serious legal and social implications for the status of individuals. The provision will facilitate persons granted a divorce in the State who wish to remarry.The civil registration service, except in specific cases of births and deaths, records vital events occurring to the person within the State. It is not the purpose of the civil registration service to record vital events occurring in foreign jurisdictions. The provision to record all decrees of divorce and decrees of nullity granted by the courts will provide a complete record of all such events from a future date. To include a provision that allows parties to such decrees in the past to apply to the Courts Service for the decrees to be entered in the register would mean the register would not be a complete record of these events from a certain date. In the circumstances, it is not appropriate to accept the amendment.

It is both desirable and reasonable that an appeals mechanism be formally included in the Bill underpinning the central registration system as fair and open, addressing grievances in a timely, structured and impartial manner and confirming the principle of good customer service.The functions of the registrar include the registration of births, stillbirths, marriages and deaths, and the correction of errors on the registers. In future the persons registering the event must be notified of the reason for a refusal by a registrar to register an event or to correct an error in an entry in the registers. An appeal may be made where a register fails or refuses to register an event, or where an tArd–Chláraitheoir or an authorised officer fails or refuses to correct an error in a register of births, stillbirths or deaths. The decision of an tArd–Chláraitheoir may be appealed to the High Court so there is adequate provision within the legislation to address the concerns of the appeal. The additional wording suggested in the amendment is unnecessary and would confuse the issue instead of clarifying it.

In page 51, subsection (1)(a), line 40, to delete “may” and substitute “shall be entitled”.This is the most important amendment I have tabled. I am concerned about the use of the word "may" in the Bill because in sections 50 and 52 of the Births and Deaths Registration Act 1880, which is repealed by this Bill, the public has a right to search all indices, local and national. It is important that "may" now appears in this Bill because it could mean "shall be entitled to" or "may be allowed to" and it grants huge discretion to superintendent registrars or the registrar general as to who can look at sections.My wording is specifically chosen to accord with section 35 of the Bill, dealing with the privacy of adoption records which states that "no person other than an tArd-Chláraitheoir or a person authorised in that behalf by an tArd-Chláraitheoir shall be entitled to search the register". It is important that in that section the Bill states "shall be entitled", but in this vital section it states "may". That gives huge latitude to controlling access to these registers that did not exist in the past. How does the Minister interpret this? Section 35 looks very tight. Will "may" be interpreted in a tight manner? Will it mean "shall be allowed" or "shall be entitled"?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	483	Senator Henry's amendment is superior to my amendment, which is clumsy. We wanted to delete from "may" until "section 13". It is an important issue and we need clarity on it. As it is currently worded, "may" gives a great deal of latitude to the officials concerned and Senator Henry's much clearer amendment, substituting "may" for "shall", will give a firm view about searches, an issue of paramount importance.

I accept that "may" has two meanings but it is clear in this context that "may" means "has a right to" and I cannot conceive of any court interpreting it any other way.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	485	Senator Mansergh has answered the question. The registrar general and his officers have always facilitated those who wish to search the register. That, however, does not include the adoption index, a totally different record. "May" is the normal legislative form and its interpretation is "will be obliged to".Concerns were raised by the genealogical groups that were unfounded because I gave a commitment that we will retain a genealogical and family research facility in Dublin. The GRO has been transferred to Roscommon but that facility will remain and electronic research equipment will be introduced in the research room in the GRO office in Joyce House in mid-2004. Access to paper or microfilm copies of the index books and registers will continue to be available until all historical data are available electronically in mid-2004.With the transfer of the GRO to Roscommon, it is envisaged that discussions with the OPW will take place on considering a more suitable location for the research facility, perhaps within a university or in another more appropriate location. As Members will agree, the development of the research facility is most important. We will continue another phase of the civil registration system to incorporate an Internet research facility, which will be beneficial. Consideration will be given to the level and type of access to registration data which will be provided to users of this service. If concerns are expressed about access to such research or data, the consultative groups will be the appropriate people with whom to air them and, accordingly, deal with them.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	486	Having re-read the subsection, I want the Minister to further clarify the matter. The subsection states "on payment to him or her of the prescribed fee, may, subject to such conditions (if any) ..." What possible conditions would there be? In the case of adoption, I am aware there is specific law on this area which requires a great deal of discretion from the officials concerned, but I am not aware of any other legislation concerning any other life event. Will the Minister give some examples of what those conditions may be? This matter has been raised by the organisation to which I referred earlier, Treoir, the unmarried parents association, who have made representations to me about this matter. They are satisfied with the current situation and recognise the work done by all the officials concerned, but they have raised the issue of why any conditions were inserted in this section when the only current conditions which would allow a search not to occur would be in regard to adoption.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	487	I take Senator Mansergh's point about "may" being the word that is usually used in legislation, but I am concerned about the use of the word "shall" in section 35. "May" is the word that is usually inserted, so why has the word "shall" been inserted in section 35?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	488	It must refer to something that has to be done. Section 35 deals with privacy and contains an imperative. It states that "No person other than an tArd-Chláraitheoir or a person authorised in that behalf by an tArd-Chláraitheoir shall be entitled . . ." It is a compulsory requirement that the person shall not have access unless there is a court order or the adoption society advises the Ard-Chláraitheoir otherwise. That is the most definitive way of saying that no one else will have access except the two people alluded to. The word "may" means that people will be facilitated.The words "if any" in the section refers to the practicalities involved. If some 150 people were standing outside Joyce House, the Ard-Chláraitheoir would have to tell them that they would have to wait or come back tomorrow. On that basis, a person could say that the registrar cannot stop him or her looking up some information, which the registrar could not. However, the practicality of the matter may be that there is no room for the person to do so and the person may be asked to return tomorrow and may be given a time. The words "if any" are included on that basis. Such information is a matter of public record and therefore people are entitled to find out whatever information they want to. The words "if any" are inserted to provide for the practicalities of doing that. It enables a registrar to tell a person to come back to the office another day, that the person will have access to computerisation or whatever.

Otherwise one might, in theory, have a right to consult such records at midnight or at 3 a.m. When people are consulting records of this kind they normally agree to abide by whatever conditions are in place. Such conditions will not obstruct them from getting access to the record under normal conditions.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	490	I thank the Minister for her interpretation of those words, on which I concede. Will she consider framing the section a little better for Report Stage on the basis that on practical grounds it may be difficult, as Senator Mansergh said, to carry out a search? Will she consider inserting such an explanation to provide some definition in this regard? I am not being overly prescriptive but if there are practical difficulties and those considerations must be considered, that should be stated explicitly rather than a definition being made in this regard. I accept the Minister's word on this and I am not suggesting that anyone would interpret the provision otherwise but we need to be a little prescriptive on this.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	491	We spent a good deal of time earlier talking about the importance of paternity and of a child knowing his or her parents, but section 35 poses a major block to adopted children in trying to find their parents. In these days of much more open adoption, I do not know how in tune that provision is with modern life. I am involved with people whom I would encourage to consider adoption and the Crisis Pregnancy Agency. I know the Minister would have read its report, which deals encouragingly with open adoption. Between that and the block in this section to checking registers, unless one can has a pretty good idea of one's date of birth, one cannot do the types of trawls people were able to do in the past. I am concerned about these two sections.I do not believe the Minister or her officials are trying to be devious in bringing forward the sections together, it is merely that both seem to make matters difficult for adopted children trying to find their genetic parents. We spent the afternoon discussing how important that could be as between genetic mothers, gestational mothers and so on, and it could be very important especially from a medical point of view. Certainly they are blocked by section 35 and also by this section. Life is made much more difficult for them than under the old registration bills.I know people of my age who were adopted when nobody went around as a single mother with children. Those people were able to trawl the records of Holles Street, and they may have checked within a month of when they were born in case the registrations were not quite right. That does not seem possible now. I do not believe the Minister is trying to do people down but I am concerned that such people may be blocked at every turn. That is not what we are trying to do here.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	492	Section 35 provides for the transposition of the existing arrangements. As it stands, the Ard-Chláraitheoir can release such information only on the order of the adoption board and of the courts. As Members will be aware, the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, is examining a new adoption Bill. If a decision is made arising from that legislation which frees matters up and changes the modus operandi , we will reflect that in these legislative provisions.This is a sensitive issue because there are two sides to the argument. There is a greater openness in society now and greater comforts and supports to deal with issues that may arise. From a medical perspective, I am aware of an instance where access was provided under a medical portfolio through the adoption society on the basis of a particular disease. On the basis of the public consultation that has taken place, the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, has given a guarantee that he will deal with this matter from a legislative point of view when dealing with adoptions. Until such time as that has been completed, I do not consider it appropriate to go beyond what is in existence at present save, in effect, an amalgam of the registers. We have had a foreign and national register of adoptions and now we will have one register. Furthermore, the certificate will be available all over the country.It was not and is not my intention to restrict access to searches in any way. As I stated, we hope to provide an Internet facility. This would be an excellent and very progressive way of dealing with searches. The registrar would naturally have to set down rules and guidelines on access to and interference with the public record. It would be on this basis — in conjunction with a consideration of the practicalities — that the registrar would decide on any variances with regard to access to searches. The provision will only come into play if something untoward happens.The idea is that access will be greater. We can now facilitate searches from people's area of residence rather than asking them to travel all the way to Dublin to obtain information. Gaining access will be quicker because the information is now available electronically. The work carried out by those in the GRO in Roscommon in transposing all the historical facts into electronic format has been tiresome, but they have done it brilliantly. The service that will be provided will result in greater additionality and a greater service to anyone who wants to carry out a search. In no way does it restrict anyone from gaining access to what is, of course, a public record.

I will withdraw the amendment for now because I want to think about it.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	495	Amendments Nos. 35, 36 and 47 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	496	I move amendment No. 35:
In page 51, subsection (1), after line 48, to insert the following paragraph:"(c) on payment to him or her of the prescribed fee (if any) and subject to subsections (3) and (4), shall be entitled to, subject to such conditions (if any) as may stand determined by an tArd-Chláraitheoir (without the need of recourse to any index) search any(i) register of births (whether in original or other form) currently in the custody of a Superintendent Registrar or registrar and compiled one hundred or more years before the year in which such application is made;(ii) register of marriages (whether in original or other form) currently in the custody of a Superintendent Registrar or registrar and compiled sixty or more years before the year in which such application is made;(iii) register of deaths (whether in original or other form) currently in the custody of a Superintendent Registrar or registrar and compiled twenty or more years before the year in which such application is made.".These three amendments, all of which deal with searches, aim to deal with some concerns raised by people who work in this area. There is a concern that the existing right to search locally and nationally could be taken away because of this section. An idiot-proof note I have received in respect of amendment No. 35 states:Currently, under sections 50 and 52 of the Births and Deaths Registration (Ireland) Act 1880, searches may be conducted at the index volumes held centrally and in both indexes and register books held locally. If effective searching for both genealogical and legal purposes is to be promoted, then it is imperative that searching actual register books held locally should continue.There is a concern that if amendment No. 35 is not accepted, the practice currently in place will be discontinued. If the Minister is telling me she believes such a practice will continue and that people will have the absolute right to search locally in all their local offices, I will accept her word. One must question the purpose of the GRO in ending this provision. Does the Minister still insist on bringing forward an amendment to allow all register books currently held locally to be centralised out of public access in Roscommon town?Amendment No. 36, in my party's name, proposes that a public genealogical search facility be established and maintained in the city of Dublin.

Would it not be more sensible from a legal perspective to address this in the Bill now, given that we are putting in place a civil registration code for the next 15 to 20 years, as I have said repeatedly this afternoon? I am very happy for the people of Roscommon town because the GRO is now based there. We all welcome it.

It would be sensible to establish and maintain a public genealogical search facility in Dublin. What are the Minister's views on this?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	508	The Senator referred to the older legislation. There were no indices at the time and when they became available it was possible to search them manually. They are now being transferred to an electronic format. Perhaps I am presumptuous in believing that some prefer to be turning pages than checking information on a computer, but the exact same information will be made available in either case. The indices will be available locally, but electronically.There was some concern about the back-up of the electronic system, but the copies will always be held centrally. If every light in the world went out, for example, we would still have the copies in the registrar's office.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	509	It is not like electronic voting.

The existence of the copies should address the concerns of those who raised the issue with Senator Brian Hayes.There is no legislative framework for moving the GRO to Roscommon. Equally, there is no necessity for it, nor is there any necessity in a legislative framework to have a facility available in Dublin. I have said — I believe the approach adopted is more prudent — that those who use genealogical services on an ongoing basis are usually students and academics. There are also secondary users such as visitors who like to come to Ireland to check records. Moreover, people wish to have records from a practical perspective. The current setting of the facility is certainly not on the main tourist trail or a part of Dublin with which people are familiar.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	511	Off the beaten track.

Once all the information is available, we will have discussions with the OPW to identify a more appropriate location. Institutions such as the National Library, Trinity College and other buildings in Dublin would perhaps be more appropriate. I hope this addresses the concerns raised.Any information that was available will now be available locally in electronic format.

I remember a debate 20 years ago about whether the reputed grandfather of President Ronald Reagan was listed as "John Regan" or "John Ryan" in the parish register at Kilbehenny, I believe. Obviously, one needed to look at the original very carefully. Many of these registers were kept in manuscript, at least in days gone by, and therefore there could be instances where one would need to look at the original rather closely.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	514	To support what Senator Mansergh said, it is very important that people should have access to originals. I dread to think of people copying my handwriting on to computer disks and people asking in years to come if my married name was McIntaggart or McEntaggart. Access to original documents is terribly important. I support the——

An tArd–Chláraitheoir will have jurisdiction over that but access will be made available to people in particular circumstances.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	520	I appreciate what the Minister has said. Presumably all of this material is not currently in electronic format.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	522	This new provision will kick in when it is in electronic format, but to take Senator Mansergh's point, nothing would prevent an historian or indeed anyone else, from getting the original copy. The Minister is giving a commitment on that. On another point as regards genealogical searches, the capital city has huge numbers of people arriving from other parts of the world, North America in particular, who want to find out about their heritage. Given that Dublin is the capital city people will continue to use it above all other centres. However, in future there is nothing to prevent any of this information being made available on the Internet, no matter where people live.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	523	That is right.

At the same time, the view is that the Internet facility, as the Senator has said, will be of great benefit to people and give access from a worldwide perspective.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	527	When does the Minister expect this to be rolled out?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I move amendment No. 37:
In page 52, subsection (2), line 26, to delete "specified by the applicant".
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I would like to speak on section 62. I am somewhat concerned that this section is limited. When I first came into the House, Deputy Mervyn Taylor was Minister for Equality and Law Reform and I tabled a matter on the Adjournment asking for a stillbirths register to be set up. One of the reasons I asked for it to be set up was because of the importance of knowing about stillbirths from a medical viewpoint, for example if there was a dump somewhere around the country and stillbirths were taking place due to toxicity in the area. Unless someone was registering births there and noticing that there was a pocket of stillbirths, say within a 7 km radius of the dump, much important medical data would be lost.Access to this register has been made so narrow that the same could be happening again. We could miss out on really important issues about increased incidences of stillbirths. This does happen. We know from epidemiological surveys that environmental factors can be important, so I am rather concerned how narrow the access to the register is. It can be important to individual people. I am sure the Minister will have been aware of court cases recently in England regarding cot deaths.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	531	Is the Senator on section 62 or section 61?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	532	On section 62.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	533	We must first dispose of the amendments.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I thought Senator Brian Hayes had withdrawn the amendments.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	535	No.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	536	I am sorry. A woman called Patel who was accused of being implicated in three cot deaths was eventually able to show that her grandmother had a series of stillbirths.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Amendment Nos. 37 and 38 may be taken together, with the House's agreement.Amendment No. 37 is something I am not hung up about but I am interested in the issue contained in amendment No. 38. I think Senator Henry would agree that what the Minister is doing here as regards the stillbirths register is a welcome development and she is to be congratulated for it. However, an issue was raised with me, and I think it was something Senator Henry touched on. In section 62 the power to search the register of stillbirths is specifically given to fathers and mothers. Is that not right?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	538	It is given to parents.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	539	What I have suggested in our amendment is that fathers and mothers should be deleted and substituted by "the father, mother, blood relation, or descendant of the parents of the stillborn child". I am not hung up entirely on that, but I want to outline the reason behind it. If the Minister has another way of saying it that is more accurate than what I propose, all the better. People apart from the father and mother who may be blood relations of the stillborn baby may at some point in the future want to search the register for genetic and other reasons suggested by Senator Henry. I do not think it is a good idea to prevent them from doing that. The father and mother would be dead, presumably, in most cases, but there are medical reasons why it would be important for someone, for example, to find out his or her genetic makeup. If the search is limited simply to the parents are we not doing ourselves a disservice for the future? This point has been raised with me and that is why we have put down the amendment.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	540	This is a serious issue. We now know that information obtained as regards stillbirths can be extraordinarily important for future pregnancies. We are totally excluding any medical practitioner from having a look at this data. I would go even further than Senator Brian Hayes's amendment. Perhaps the Minister could consider it before Report Stage. We all want the best for a child and for any subsequent children a family may have. With advances in neo-natal medicine and genetics — this country is in the forefront of these areas — we need to think about this. This could be terribly important for future pregnancies and to diagnose familial conditions.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	541	All this information will be available under vital statistics legislation.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	542	As a number.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	543	Yes. Equated to that, in section 62, which relates to the search of the register, it will be seen that an tArd–Chláraitheoir has the discretion to give access to that register to others.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	544	Where is that?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	545	It is on page 52 under the reference to searches of registers, paragraph (iii) of which says: "in his or discretion, an tArd Chláraitheoir, so determines,".Section 73(5) states:Information referred to in subsection (4) may be disclosed to persons engaged in medical or social research or to medical officers of health boards if the Minister consents in writing to the disclosure and the disclosure complies with such conditions (if any) as are attached to the consent; and the Minister is hereby authorised to attach such conditions as he or she considers appropriate to a consent under this subsection.What normally happens is that the doctor or researcher applies to the Minister for Health and Children for access to that type of information. It must be done in that way because otherwise any person could seek vital information. Such information, which has always remained confidential, may only be used for research purposes. As far as we are aware, there has never been a break of confidence on issues such as how a person died or a stillbirth. Members who have viewed vital statistics on cancer, heart disease and so on will be aware of that point. The concerns expressed are covered by both sections.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	546	When this provision was first introduced by former Minister Mervyn Taylor, a parent could apply for a certificate within 42 days. The Minister is now increasing that to one year. Is it possible that the new provision could apply retrospectively to 1995, the year the legislation was introduced? Can parents of a stillborn child who did not realise this provision existed now register that stillbirth under the new provision? I suspect I know what will be the answer. I am not sure many people were aware they could register stillbirths, although I know current figures in that regard are increasing.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The hospital concerned would have registered the stillbirth if the parents did not do so after the four month period. Therefore, the number of unregistered stillbirths would be low.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	548	Is the Minister saying that hospitals registered stillbirths independently of the parent or parents?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	549	This provision was included in the 1994 Act. Perhaps some people are not aware it exists.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	550	I hope the provision is applied as the Minister intends. We now know more about the importance of genetics in such situations. It would be regrettable if people were refused such useful information. However, I do not think that will happen.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	551	I move amendment No. 39:
In page 52, subsection (2), line 47, to delete "may" and substitute "shall".This amendment raises the "may" and "shall" argument in relation to the correction of errors at the request of a person having an interest in the matter. I will respond having heard the Minister's reply.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	552	This section provides for the correction of errors at the request of the person having an interest in the matter. The correction of error requires that the superintendent registrar is satisfied that an error exists and that evidence is produced to support the request being made. The proposed amendment would remove any discretion which the registrar would have in the correction of errors. That discretion must be retained in cases where, in the view of the registrar, no error existed. The introduction of the word "shall" would provide that the registrar must make the correction thereby removing his or her discretion.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	553	Would that be bad?

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	555	I will take the Minister's word in that regard.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	556	The legislation provides for an appeals mechanism for those unhappy with decisions made.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	557	Amendments Nos. 40, 42 and 45 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	558	I move amendment No. 40:
In page 53, subsection (2)(a), line 2, after “error” to insert “or omission”.This amendment also relates to the correction of errors. It is good that people can correct errors. I am sure a percentage of all registrations contain errors. The Minister has not included the word "omission". It would appear sensible that a person who realises there has been an omission can apply at some point to have that omission included. I am interested to hear the Minister's views on this matter. It is good that we are providing for the correction of errors. I am reliably informed by my enormous back up team that there is a 15% error rate on indices. I am concerned in this case about omissions. The inclusion of that word would add to the legislation.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	559	The section provides for the correction of clerical errors and errors of fact in the registers relating to birth, stillbirth and death at the request of the person who has interest in such matters. Decisions on such matters are being vested in the superintendent registrar. In principle, a clerical error is a minor mistake which occurs in the recording of particulars in the registers. An error of fact would encompass any omission of detail in the register. Therefore, the legislation adequately addresses cases of omissions as raised by the Senator.

#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	564	I move amendment No. 44:
In page 53, subsection (3), line 19, after "oath" to insert "or affirmation".I am interested to hear the Minister's reply to this amendment which refers to affirmation. I will respond having heard the Minister's reply lest she would think I do not know what the amendment is about.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	565	Section 63 provides for the correction of errors in the register of births, stillbirths and deaths following a request by any person having an interest in the matter. The Office of the Parliamentary Counsel advises that the provisions of section 22 of the Interpretation Act 1937 provides that the word "oath" in the case of persons for the time being allowed by law to affirm instead of swearing in includes affirmation. As the provision in that Act allows for affirmation it is not necessary to qualify "oath" any further for civil registration purposes.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	566	The Oaths Act 1888 which allows affirmation applies to administrative matters relating to proceedings. The Minister stated she had received advice on this from the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. Did she obtain advice on it from the Attorney General's office? How does it impact in terms of the Oaths Act 1888?
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	567	It is traditional that affirmation is allowed. The Minister will be obliged to return to the Lower House regarding the issue involving the Church of Ireland. Could she not throw us a bone and allow for affirmation because it is traditional that it is allowed? It would be nice if, when the Minister returns to the Dáil, she could say that she accepted an Opposition amendment.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	568	It may be contrary but the Minister's reply appears to indicate that affirmation is a sub-class of oath, at least for the purposes of the legislation.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	569	We could have this argument over and over.

If Members wish to change that Act, they are welcome to do so. However, the advice given to me by the Attorney General and the Parliamentary Counsel is that this is the usage that is acceptable for affirmation.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	572	I accept that the Minister has received advice to the contrary but no one has explained how the Oaths Act 1888, which may only apply to legal proceedings, applies to administrative matters.

I am, therefore, not au fait with its contents. I am of the view that, without a doubt, the interpretation that has been afforded to us is one which is taken from a traditional perspective in the House.

In any event, I thank the Minister for her reply and I will withdraw the amendment. However, this matter needs to be considered, particularly in terms of future legislation, because it is clear that there is an issue in respect of the interpretation of affirmation via the Oaths Act 1888. I did not expect the Minister to have read that Act before she came before the House.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I move amendment No. 46:
In page 55, subsection (1), line 5, after "may" to insert "initiate and shall on request by an interested person in writing".This section is designed to allow the Ard Chláraitheoir to initiate inquiries. The amendment suggests inclusion of the words — they may not be necessary but I would be interested to hear the Minister's reply — "initiate and shall on request by an interested person in writing". Section 65(1) states that the Ard Chláraitheoir "may conduct or cause to be conducted such enquiries as he or she considers necessary to ascertain ..." Would it not be easier to include after the word "may" the phrase "initiate and shall on request by an interested person in writing"? In other words, instead of the Ard–Chláraitheoir doing it willy nilly, an interested party could write to him or her and ask that it be done and a decision could then be taken. Perhaps it is already provided for but I believe the version I have outlined would give people the power to make submissions to the office on the basis of whatever reason they wished to offer. The officer holder could then decide whether to investigate.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	577	Whatever about its merits, the amendment is too strong. It uses the term "shall on request" which removes any discretion. It seems that if somebody makes a request, the registrar should have the right to look at it critically and decide whether to initiate an inquiry.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	578	The Senator is correct. We have spoken about the ability of the Ard Chláraitheoir to institute an inquiry. He or she may do so on his or her own initiative or as a result of information that comes to his or her attention. There is nothing to stop someone writing to the Ard–Chláraitheoir and requesting that an investigation take place on the basis of section 65(1)(a) (i) and (ii). Spurious requests, which would not stand up to scrutiny, could be made to the Ard–Chláraitheoir. If we introduce the word “shall”, the Ard–Chláraitheoir would be compelled to carry out an inquiry if such a request was made whereas that might not be the right thing to do. We are being over-prescriptive to allow the flexibility for the Ard–Chláraitheoir.

#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	581	If the registrar decides against an applicant in respect of this matter, can he or she appeal the decision?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	582	The other issue is that if we introduce the term "initiate and shall on request by an interested person in writing", the Ard Chláraitheoir could not, of his or her own volition, carry out an inquiry. The Ard Chláraitheoir may discover, for example, that a double registration of a birth occurred. If he or she is restricted, an investigation can only be done on the request and at the behest of someone else as opposed to being done on the registrar's initiative. We would, therefore, be limiting the registrar to a huge degree. We could have a situation where we would restrict the registrar's initiative or where an investigation would have to take place in respect of a spurious matter. I agree with the Senator that inquiries must be carried out. People will always have recourse to the appeals mechanism.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	583	Is the Minister stating that if the answer is negative the applicant may initiate an appeal?

In page 62, before the First Schedule, to insert the following new section:"74.—An tArd-Chláraitheoir will, in consultation with the Director of the National Archives and the National Archives Advisory Council, formulate and publish a policy document or statement setting out a framework for greater public access to civil registration registers or register books where one hundred or more years have elapsed since the date of creation of the last entry in such register(s) or register book(s).".This amendment is self-explanatory. It seeks that the registrar, in consultation with the director of the National Archives and the National Archives advisory council, formulate a policy concerning records over 100 years old. This is a novel amendment which suggests the insertion of a new section which would, in effect, force the bringing about of joined-up Government. However, I believe that the latter would be a good development. In the Lower House, the Minister stated that the National Archives already have access to the GRO's information.

In page 63, Part 1, line 14, to delete "Marital status of mother" and substitute "marital status of parents of child".Fine Gael's proposed wording is more appropriate.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	587	Amendment No. 49 is proposed because it is offensive to persons to require them to produce in the future a birth certificate which, not for the first time, states whether or not their mother and father married. It is inappropriate to say the least.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	588	Parts 1 and 2 of the First Schedule set out the required particulars to be entered in the register of births and stillbirths. The Civil Registration Service is required under the Vital Statistics Act 1952 to collect information concerning life events including births. The service is required under the Act to record the marital status of the child's mother when registering a birth. It is used to determine if the presumption of paternity of the husband applies and also to determine whether section 22 of the Bill, which addresses instances in which the parents are not married, applies. To address Senator McCarthy's concerns, marital status does not appear on the birth certificate as that would be inappropriate. It is only recorded for statistical purposes.During the extensive Committee Stage debate in the Dáil, it was stated that in the interests of equality, the marital status of the father should be included. I agreed to that proposal and provided for the requested amendment on Report Stage. Therefore, the provision the Senator seeks has been made.

In page 63, Part 1, between lines 14 and 15, to insert "Place of birth of mother.".Amendments Nos. 50 and 54 represent an attempt to place more information on the register by seeking to include the places of birth of the mother and father of a child. The inclusion of this information would be of great assistance to genealogists and would help to ensure that people knew where their mother and father were born. The information would represent a useful addition to the register of births.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	592	Part 1 sets out the required particulars which shall be registered in respect of a birth. Additional information will be required to be registered including the personal public service numbers of the child and his or her parents, the dates of birth of the father and mother and their marital status. It will also be necessary to record the birth surnames of the father's mother and the mother's mother. The particulars required to be registered for a birth were first set out in 1863 and remained unchanged until updated by the Registration of Births Act 1996. The 1996 Act provided for the registration of a surname for a child, the mother's address and the occupation and former surname of the father. Those particulars were further amended by the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2002 which provided for the registration of the personal public service number in respect of each of the parents and the assignment of a personal number to the child. These changes were required to facilitate the introduction of the new electronic civil registration system.Part 1 of the First Schedule includes other changes among which is the recording of the marital status of the mother and the father, the surname at birth and any other surnames of each of the parents of the child and the details of each parent's mother's birth surname. This additional information is required for the allocation of the child's personal public service number, the verification of the parent's personal public service number, the creation of family relationships between the child and the parents, the administration of a person's public service identity set and the auto-triggering of a child benefit claim. The additional information to be captured by this amendment is not required for the purposes of registration, vital statistics or the allocation of a personal public service number. The amount of information and the cross-tabulation in place are more than adequate.

While everything the Minister has said is absolutely accurate, genealogical family research constitutes another side of this albeit a secondary one. If the information could be recorded where available without overloading the system, it would be helpful to genealogists. It is difficult to think of instances in which the information might not be available, although it could be the case with migrant parents who might be a little vague about where they were born. Genealogy is a significant industry. A great many tourists come here in search of their roots. They do not just come to Dublin or, for that matter, Roscommon, they go all over the country. I ask the Minister to examine the proposal. If she cannot accept the amendment tonight, she should at least consider it before Report Stage.

In page 63, Part 1, line 16, to delete "surname of mother's mother" and substitute "surname(s) of mother's parents".The Bill introduces further gender discrimination in the particulars required to be registered on a birth certificate. For the first time, the birth certificate will record the surname of the mother's mother, but not the surname of her father. In a minority of cases, the surname of the father would be different but this information will go unrecorded.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	597	The Senator is requesting the recording of the surnames of maternal grandfathers. The birth registration will include the personal public service number allocated to the child and the parents' personal public service numbers. The system has been designed to capture information in the event of a birth or stillbirth using standard naming conventions. These include one's forename and the surname in common usage across Departments and agencies. The combination of the date of birth and the mother's birth surname uniquely identifies a person in the vast majority of cases. The mother's birth surname is therefore vital in the validation of the personal public service number. As part of the registration process a personal public service number is allocated to the child, the parents' personal public service numbers are validated or traced, a relationship is created between the child and the parents and a claim for child benefit is automatically triggered to the Department. There is no requirement to collect the mother's father's or the father's father's birth surname from the registration or personal public service number validation perspective.The Bill is drafted to provide that a birth may be registered by the parents, surviving parent or other specified qualified informant. Part 1 of the First Schedule allows for the assignment of a combination of both parents' surnames or either parent's surname to the child. The parents, or a parent if one is deceased or cannot be traced can, if they so wish, apply to assign a surname other than their own name or a combination of their names to the child.It is not proposed to extend this provision to any person other than the parents. The Deputy is trying to circumvent some of the searches and insist on having grandparents' information on the birth certificate. That is not necessary because the PPS number will be established, as will a link between the child and the parents, as a consequence of the number being there.

In page 63, Part 1, line 31, after “either” to insert “or both”
The existing law under the 1986 Act allows a child to be given a double-barrelled surname consisting of the surnames of both parents. I presume that is the intention of the Bill.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	601	Yes.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	603	Part 1 of the First Schedule sets out the required particulars to be entered in the register of births. The provision in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Part 1 of the First Schedule allows the parents or a parent if one is deceased or cannot be traced to assign a surname other than their own name, or alternatively a combination of their names for the child, which is what the Senator mentioned. As the existing provisions cater for the objective of this amendment, I do not see the necessity of having another. We cater for what the Senator wishes to provide.

In page 63, Part 1, line 37, after “contacted” to insert “or by the informant if both parents are dead or cannot be contacted after reasonable efforts to do so have been made”.
This amendment is designed to rectify an omission in the Bill. The 1986 Act allowed an informant to propose a surname for the child in the event of the parents being dead or uncontactable, but this provision has been omitted in the Bill.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	609	The parents or parent can apply to assign a surname other than their own name, or a combination of their names. It is not proposed to extend this provision to any person other than the parents. When a child is born it naturally has parents. The Senator is asking that another person be allowed the right. Paragraph (b) of the First Schedule refers to:such other name as may be requested by both of the parents or by one of them if the other is dead or, after reasonable efforts to do so have been made, cannot be contacted (if an tArd–Cláraitheor or an officer of an tArd–Cláraitheor duly authorised by him or her in that behalf or a Superintendent Registrar is satisfied that the circumstances warrant it and he or she agrees to the request).A father could be devious and include a surname that would be outside the ambit of the Act and it is on that basis that one must reserve the right for parents only. One cannot expand that role. It comes under the Status of Children Act. Accordingly, we must ensure that a child's name could not be changed.

In page 65, Part 5, between lines 36 and 37, to insert the following:"Forename(s) and birth surname of father of deceased."Forename(s) and birth surname of mother of deceased.".The purpose of this amendment is to change the death certificate to include the forename or names and birth surname of the father and mother of the deceased. As I understand it, this data is currently recorded in both the birth and marriage certificates. I am proposing to extend to the death certificate the data already in place in two other certificates. For the sake of consistency it should be included in the death certificate.I know the Minister advanced this issue some time ago in agreeing to the place of birth being inserted. That was a very welcome change which we appreciate, but it would be useful to go the full circle, so to speak, and extend it further, given the connection we have in this country with names, places, history and genealogy, which is important not just as an industry, but in terms of who we are, where we come from and who are our relations and forefathers. I ask the Minister to consider this issue. She has already conceded one new section in the death certificate. We are very much out of line with other countries when it comes to information contained in the death certificate. We should try to upgrade it and include as much information as possible, for all the reasons stated earlier.
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	615	There is considerable force in this amendment for the reasons stated by Senator Hayes. It can be argued that the place of birth allows one to make the connection, but to do so imposes more work on the researcher. In the case of certain very common names, such as "John Ryan" in Tipperary, for example, this could lend itself to confusions of identity. I urge the Minister to look sympathetically at the amendment. Obviously, it is almost entirely for the benefit of genealogists as opposed to its more general mainstream function, but if the Minister was to accept any amendment arising from this evening's discussion, this is the one I would recommend to her.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	616	This is also very important for generations in 50, 60, 70 or 80 years' time, who will not have known their grandparents and want to develop a family tree. Those people — amateur genealogists perhaps — could then find the information on the death certificate. People need to know where they are from and who their forbears were, and having this information on the death certificate would be a great advantage to people who want to know that type of information.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	617	Part 5 of the First Schedule sets out the required particulars to be registered in respect of a death. The following additional information will be required to be registered: The date and place of birth; birth surname, address and PPS number of the deceased person; the date of certificate of cause of death; forename, surname, registered qualification, daytime telephone number and the business address of the registered medical practitioner; the date of certificate of cause of death; forename, surname, registered qualifications, daytime telephone number and business address of the coroner; and the forename, surname, office of the coroner and date of inquest or post mortem, as appropriate.One of the concerns expressed to me, particularly by the genealogical people, is that this is an opportunity to lessen their need to look back over records but that view is reflected in terms of a paper based society whereas the inter-linking from an electronic point of view will now be almost instantaneous. One will not have to physically go through all of the information. One keys in the information available and that link will be made. I appreciate that people are sincere in their view but having discussed this issue with an tArd-Chláraitheoir and staff in his office, they are of the view that they will be able to facilitate as quickly as possible any information that may be requested from a genealogical point of view through the electronically based system which will now be provided.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	618	Why is there an inconsistency between the marriage certificate and the birth certificate in respect of this information? Why is it not contained in the death certificate as well?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	619	My officials are looking for a marriage certificate; it is a while since I saw my own, and we had to go before the judge to change it. A birth certificate only shows the names of the parents, not the grandparents, which is what this is trying to do. The Senator is going back another generation. The next linkage can be done through the information made available to the person.

We do not have a fully electronic society. There is a good deal of validity in what the Minister said about the register but it is a mistake to think that 60 year old Australians or 70 year old Americans are completely computer literate.I would emphasise that this is a very important economic branch. In the late 1980s, Charles Haughey established a sort of family plans office to encourage this type of activity as an aid to tourism. It is a bit like all airlines deciding that one can only book over the Internet. We are still some considerable distance from that. Perhaps some tolerance should be allowed for the fact that we are not a totally electronic society in terms of these type of paper records instantly flying from one computer to another.

What they are expecting is that we will now do that for them. We have accepted two amendments on behalf of the Genealogical Society of Ireland, one to do with the date, place of birth and the birth surname of the mother in order that people would have greater access.With regard to computerisation, I appreciate what the Senator is saying. Many people are afraid of computers, and older people certainly do not want to know about them. I have been advised that assistance will be made available to such people in the office where the searches will take place.

In page 66, Part 5, line 2, after "the" to insert "name,".Part 5 states: "If deceased was married, the profession or occupation of spouse,". It is a little strange that on a married person's death certificate the Bill requires only that the profession or occupation of the spouse is recorded and not his or her name. Perhaps the Minister might explain the reasoning behind that.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	641	The Minister and I travel under different names than those of our spouses. This provision is vital, otherwise we might get left out on the certificate which will just refer to distinguished Members of Dáil Éireann and Seanad Éireann. It is important that the name of the spouse should appear on the death certificate.

It is not considered necessary for registration purposes to collect the name of the spouse of the deceased person. Such proposal could lead to distress or confusion for the deceased's family in certain circumstances, for example, where the parents are separated or divorced. An issue could arise in that case.
#MichaelMcCarthy	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-party	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcCarthy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	645	The reason we will not include the details in terms of his or her name is because of circumstances where the marriage has broken down, separation or divorce.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	646	Yes. A problem could arise in such cases, although sometimes it is not a legal issue. One cannot expect the Ard–Chláraitheoir to go around searching, when a person dies, to see whether they were divorced or separated or had a judicial separation. If that information is introduced, in some instances it could cause angst among families.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	660	The new certificate looks shorter. Senator McCarthy might need one when he is getting married. On it will be the names of the man and woman, their respective surnames, any other surnames; their dates of birth; their current addresses, their future address; their respective occupations; their marital status; the mothers' birth name of both; the fathers' name of both; the date of marriage; the signature of the witnesses; the solemniser as well as the name of the registrar, the district of the registrar, their superintendents' district, the county, the date of registration and the registration number. It will contain quite an amount of information.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	661	Any changes we try to effect are normally held within the First Schedule because it sets out exactly what needs to be done. I accept that the Minister said it was contained in the sections but why is it not contained in the First Schedule? The 1952 Act concerning marriage certificates was the last legislation in this area, if we are changing it why is marriage not included in the First Schedule?
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	662	We have to specify it by regulation. It takes into consideration a number of other issues, in particular, section 46 which states:A marriage solemnised in the State, after the commencement of this section, between persons of any age shall not be valid . . . unless the persons concerned—(a) (i) notify any registrar in writing in a form for the time being standing approved by an tArd–Chláraitheoir of their intention to marry not less than less 3 months prior to the date on which the marriage is to be solemnised, or(ii) are granted an exemption from the application of sub-paragraph (i) under section 47 and give a copy of the court order granting the exemption to any registrar before the date aforesaid.The approval of an tArd-Chláraitheoir must be given. The issue is that there may be a necessity to introduce a regulation.

#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	670	I wish to raise the urgent need for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to approve the preliminary report for Galway County Council on the provision of a sewage treatment system at Kinvara, County Galway, and provide funding to prevent the ongoing discharge of untreated sewage into the coastal bay at a rate of 50,000 gallons per day in an important tourist area.As a result of the publication of the recent EPA report, which outlined the serious situation where a quarter of the sewage in the country was being released untreated into rivers, bays and estuaries, if we are to comply with EU directives we will have to change our ways. Kinvara, County Galway, is one of the few coastal towns which discharges raw sewage at the rate of 50,000 per day. That discharge is increasing at the rate of 10% per annum. We cannot allow this to continue. The preliminary report has been sent by Galway County Council to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and is with the Department for some time. I seek the immediate approval of this preliminary report and the provision of funding for the service. Cairde Cuan Kinvara has undertaken, at its own expense, an in-depth report on the quality of water in the bay. Due to the uniqueness of the bay there is a high volume of underground river fresh water entering the bay at the southern end.Due to the narrowness and length of the bay, which is approximately three miles long, great difficulty arises because of salt sea water mixing with the fresh water coming into the bay on the quay side, with the result that there is stagnant sewage in the inner bay at Kinvara. Not only is there obvious discolouring of the water, but its content and quality is seriously affected. The presence of e.coli has been monitored by the Western Health Board and the county council. All the agencies involved have found it to be seriously above not only national limits, but also European guidelines. The situation will become very serious if this is allowed to continue, especially as it is the Minister's goal to adhere to European directives in regard to the quality of water. It is also a serious and current topic given that the Water Services Bill 2003 came before the House some weeks ago.I ask that the Minister provide funding specifically for this project. As this issue is so far back on the county council priority list in regard to preparation, design and preliminary reports, it might otherwise be many years before it could be addressed. I emphasise that one of the best blue flag beaches in County Galway is next to Kinvara at Trácht. If prevailing winds did not take the currents away from the area, that wonderful beach would be seriously polluted.I ask that the Minister make this issue a priority, approve it and allocate the necessary funding to Galway County Council. Kinvara is probably the only coastal town in the country in this condition. As far back as 19 November 1997, after I first entered the other House, I asked the then Minister to provide funding but he did not have the preliminary report with which he could advance it. This was subsequently provided. Through the initiatives of local people, in conjunction with the county council, a unique plan has been prepared for a very sensitive town — sensitive in so far as it was the first town plan drawn up with co-operation between a local community and the advance planners of the county council. A wonderful plan has been prepared and is in place for the improvement and development of Kinvara. At the same time, that development cannot be allowed to go ahead because 50,000 to 60,000 gallons of untreated sewage goes into the bay each day.Kinvara is adjacent to and has always been an important shellfish area. However, oysters are long gone and although mussels are present, out of 37 water samples taken, 35 were seriously polluted, one was acceptable and one reasonably polluted. Kinvara is also a very important tourist area. Despite these factors, a quarter of the total amount of local sewage is released untreated by the local authority into the waterways. I ask the Minister, Deputy Coughlan, to convey to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government the absolute urgency of a response in regard to this issue, which has been called for time and again and should be made before the issue is highlighted in a more serious way.The water quality has been condemned; it cannot be used for drinking or even for recreational purposes and has been clearly shown to be unacceptable by European standards. The smell and appearance of the water is totally unacceptable and it would be a disgrace if this situation was allowed to continue, especially at this time when we are trying to achieve our European goals by responding to EU directives.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	671	Gabhaim buíochas don Seanadóir as an tseirbhís thábhachtacht seo ina dháilcheantar a lua. I would like to give a brief overview of the major investment being made by my Department in improving water services infrastructure in County Galway and throughout the country under the national development plan. Last August, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Cullen, published the Water Services Investment Programme 2003-2005. Made up of 737 schemes at different stages of development, with a total investment value of €5.4 billion, it is the most significant milestone yet in the push to bring our water services infrastructure up to a world standard.The total allocated to Galway county and city under the latest phase of the water services programme comes to almost €465 million, extending to some 54 individual schemes. It includes the recently completed treatment works for the Galway main drainage scheme, as well as major sewerage projects for Knocknacarra, Headford, Athenry, Barna, Clifden, Oughterard, Tuam, Carraroe, Glenamaddy, Milltown, Ballinasloe, Kilronan, Dunmore, Craughwell, Corofin and Claregalway. It also includes major water supply schemes for Galway city, Carna-Kilkieran, Headford, Gort, Tuam, the Costelloe area — I am sure that is the Gaeltacht, which would not be known as Costelloe — Ballinasloe, Loughrea and Clifden. Funding has also been provided under the serviced land initiative to bring additional residential sites on stream as rapidly as possible to meet housing needs at a number of locations around the county, including Kinvara.It is clear from all of this that a large number of towns and villages in County Galway are directly benefiting from the drive to bring our water and sewerage infrastructure up to a modem standard. I am pleased to say that the investment programme also includes a new sewerage scheme for Kinvara, which has been approved to go through planning. A preliminary report has been received from Galway County Council for this scheme. It is being examined by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and Galway County Council will be informed of the outcome as soon as possible.I have listened to the Senator's views on the impact on the economy and tourism as well the personal impact of the lack of a sewerage scheme at Kinvara. I will advise the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to take into account the issues raised by the Senator and will ensure that the examination of the preliminary report for the scheme takes place as quickly as possible.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2004-02-18 00:00:00	Prelude	672	I wish to raise an issue regarding Ballyraine national school which was brought to my attention in recent months by the school board of management. Lobbying in this regard has been ongoing since 1984. The board of management began some months ago to try to move the refurbishment project forward and they have tried to make this process as non-political as possible. Last Monday week, they met privately with the Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Deputy McDaid, and with Deputy Keaveney. In addition, they held a public meeting at the school, to which I and Deputy Blaney were invited. They are trying to keep all the parties together on this issue. The major theme on the night was that the school cannot continue to allow the pupils to suffer the experiences they have endured. The major theme was that they can no longer accept these conditions — lack of space and a lack of basic infrastructure to create a proper learning environment — for their children.Guarantees have been given across the political spectrum at local level to bring the lobbying process to fruition by early 2005. The Minister's reply to parliamentary questions from various politicians have been consistent, namely, that the project is at architectural stage. The school and the board of management want the project to be brought to advanced architectural stage within the next few months, with the possibility of it going to tender in 2005. The board of management encompasses a wide range of people from different backgrounds who have a common goal. The common goal is that this project, which dates back to 1984, a distant memory, must be brought to fruition.One of the main features on the night of the public meeting was that it was not just present day pupils and their parents who attended, past pupils and their parents were also invited. There were two generations in the same prefabricated building, and the message was clear. I want to bring to the Minister of State's attention that the timeframe must be given top priority. These people have done their own fund-raising and implemented short-term measures by bringing in new prefabs and so on. They feel they are being discriminated against for keeping things in place, sellotaping or putting band aids on the problem. It appears there is a good school system in place but I believe they are being discriminated against for keeping the building in a good state of repair.While it is the Minister, Deputy Dempsey's, brief, I know the Minister of State will convey to him my concerns. I want to put on public record that this is a non-political lobbying process, which has received backing from all parties. The project dates back to 1984, when I was just beginning secondary school. That is how far back the issue goes. These people deserve some timeframe or indication of when the tendering process will begin. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.

A full design team has been appointed and architectural design of the project is progressing. The project is currently at stage 3 of architectural planning — detailed plans and costs. It has been assigned a ‘band 2' rating by the Department in accordance with the published criteria for prioritising large-scale projects.Ballyraine national school building project is listed in section 8 of the 2004 school building programme. I am pleased to inform the Senator that the projects listed in section 8, including the Ballyraine national school project, will be authorised to progress to advanced architectural planning during 2004.The budget announcement regarding multi-annual capital envelopes will enable the Department of Education and Science to adopt a multi-annual framework for the school building programme which, in turn, will give greater clarity regarding projects that are not progressing in this year's programme, including Ballyraine national school, Letterkenny. The Minister will make a further announcement in that regard during the year.
