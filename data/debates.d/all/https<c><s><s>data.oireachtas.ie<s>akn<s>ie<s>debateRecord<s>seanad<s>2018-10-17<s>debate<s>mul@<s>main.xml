            <p eId="para_11">I thank the Minister of State for being available this morning to deal with this matter. It relates to Scoil Cara in Cork city. The school started off in 2011 with 30 students. It now has 72 students for 2019. This Commencement matter relates to children with special needs and the need for adequate services to be put in place. My question this morning is about the adequate provision of people who can provide therapeutic services. I understand that there is a certain guideline as regards the number of hours that should be made available for each child. The staffing levels at the moment are not adequate to provide that level of therapeutic services for these children. In fairness to them, parents are working very hard with the board of management and the principal of the school to make sure that the best possible education and support is provided for these students, but one of the key elements of the children's development is the provision of these services. I understand there has been a difficulty in getting the necessary support. I know this area covers two Departments in the sense that the Department of Education and Skills would be involved in respect of the school while the support services come under the Department of Health and the HSE. Can something be done to make sure we provide the adequate support services for these children? If we provide them now, when the children are very young, there will be huge long-term benefits. Long-term costs are also reduced when the services are produced at a very early stage. It is in that context that I am raising this issue with the Minister of State this morning. Raising it is urgent because it is important that no time is lost in providing these services.</p>

            <from>Minister of State at the Department of Health (Deputy Jim Daly)<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T10:30:00+01:00"/></from>
            <p eId="para_12">I thank the Senator for raising this issue. On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, I am happy to provide an update to the House on therapeutic services in Scoil Cara junior school.</p>
            <p eId="para_13"> As the Senator may be aware, Scoil Cara is one of a number of primary schools for children with autism in Cork. It was established in 2011, as outlined by the Senator, following a decision to divide Scoile Triest into a junior cycle school and a senior cycle school. Scoil Triest now provides special education to children with autism and mild to moderate intellectual disabilities who are aged 12 to 18 years. Scoil Cara provides special education for children with autism and mild to moderate learning difficulties aged five to 12 years. Both schools are under the patronage of the Brothers of Charity. The multidisciplinary supports provided to pupils of Scoil Cara include two days of speech and language therapy and two days of occupational therapy. Alongside this, psychology and physiotherapy services are provided on referral. These multidisciplinary resources were assigned to the school when it was established with 30 pupils in six classes back in 2011. However, the school now has 60 pupils in ten classes and, unfortunately, the Brothers of Charity services have not been able to increase the level of multidisciplinary support to the desired levels over the years.</p>
            <p eId="para_14"> As the Senator will be aware, the demand for therapy services has grown alongside significant year-on-year increases in the number of children applying for assessment, including assessment for autism spectrum disorder and disability services generally. The HSE recognises that services for school aged children with disabilities and early intervention services are paramount and need to be improved and organised more effectively. This process is well under way nationwide. HSE disability services is currently engaged in a major reconfiguration of its existing therapy resources for children with disabilities into multidisciplinary, geographically-based teams as part of its national programme on progressing disability services for children and young people aged up to 18 years. The key objective of this programme is to bring about equity of access to disability services and consistency of service delivery with a clear pathway for children with disabilities and their families to services, regardless of where they live or the nature of the individual child's difficulties. Evidence to date from areas where this has been rolled out shows that implementation of this programme will also have a positive impact on waiting lists both for assessments and therapies. The HSE is working towards having the progressing disability services model in place in Cork by the second quarter of 2019. It is expected that this will facilitate access to therapies for all children with disabilities.</p>

            <p eId="para_16">I thank the Minister of State for his reply. I note that this programme is to be rolled out during the second quarter of 2019. I believe it is an area that should be given priority. It is very important for the children. One of the people providing therapeutic services in that school has retired or resigned and there has been difficulty in appointing a replacement. It is so important for the children. Any parent with a child with a disability works extremely hard to give that support to children. The parents are giving their support and I note that the Brothers of Charity have done a huge amount of work in this area over a long number of years. However, it is important the State gives the necessary support, especially when a school has made so much progress in a very short period in terms of expansion and the growing of services. The key element is the therapeutic service. We must ensure we have the level of service required and that it be put in place at the earliest possible date so that we do not have to wait until the third quarter for the roll out of the programme.</p>

            <p eId="para_17">I appreciate the opportunity to address this issue. Anytime we focus on an issue such as this it is very welcome because it allows a very challenged HSE management and service to refocus and re-prioritise a particular service. I welcome the opportunity the Senator has given myself, the officials in the Department, the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, the HSE officials and management in the Cork and Kerry community health services to refocus and reorient attention towards this issue. I appreciate the Senator's point about the second quarter of 2019 being quite a while away for a child who has a need today. Every day there is delay in the delivery of a service is to be regretted rather than celebrated. I will take his plea on board and reiterate it along the chain to see that we refocus and re-prioritise.</p>
            <p eId="para_18"> Funding for an additional 100 therapists for children with disabilities was announced in the budget and we look forward to that having an impact on the bigger, macro picture over time.</p>

            <p eId="para_19">I asked that the Minister come to the House so that I could echo my colleagues, Deputies Calleary and Lisa Chambers, and my Seanad colleague, Senator Conway-Walsh, in calling for the drug Spinraza to be made immediately available. Spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, is a group of inherited diseases of the motor nerves that cause very debilitating muscle weaknesses and wasting. It is life threatening, rare and the leading cause of death in infants and toddlers. There are 25 children in this country with this condition. It presents them with several burdens. They are wheelchair bound, suffer muscle recession and considerable pain and the day-to-day exercise of their lives is virtually impossible in things such as handwriting and other small things. I have met some of their family members. All they want is to give their children the best life they can.</p>
            <p eId="para_20"> Hope for these children comes in the form of Spinraza, the first treatment of its kind in the world. There is significant evidence from countries across the world, and from clinical trials, that Spinraza is changing children's lives significantly, slowing down muscle wastage and, in many cases, allowing muscle strengthening to occur which allows them to live a much more active, healthy life. Grace O'Malley from Robeen near Ballinrobe in County Mayo, along with her parents Paul and Lorraine, and other family members of those suffering from SMA are begging for access to this drug. They know it will not cure Grace but they also know from the CHERISH trial results, which outline the effectiveness of Spinraza, that these are the children who are most at risk of losing the muscle function which Spinraza has the potential to greatly manage and to improve Grace's condition and afford her some level of independence.</p>
            <p eId="para_21"> Earlier this year, Ireland entered an international alliance with the Benelux countries which was said would strengthen Ireland's hand in negotiations with big pharmaceutical companies. The Minister, Deputy Harris, hailed it as an agreement that would improve Irish patients' access to new and innovative drugs. I, like many others, am waiting to see the fruits of this arrangement. The Minister's repeated reference to the Netherlands and Belgium negotiating for Spinraza prior to Ireland joining the Benelux countries' initiative is misleading and confusing, considering the statement from Biogen on 20 September which said that in July 2018, Ireland was offered the same terms as other countries, regardless of the time of joining the initiative.</p>
            <p eId="para_22"> The latest information received by the families is that Spinraza has been referred to the rare diseases technical review committee. They have questions to which I would like answers. Who forms this committee? How does it differ from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE, assessment? I understand that Professor Michael Barry is the head of the NCPE and the rare disease review committee, which raises a question about the impartiality of this whole process. As there is no new medical information to consider since the original dossier was presented to the NCPE, what exactly will it consider? The evidence will be the same as will the people. Will this review group engage with the patients? Has a timeframe been put on the assessments given the very serious nature of the disease?</p>

            <p eId="para_23">I thank Senator Swanick for raising this matter.</p>
            <p eId="para_24"> Spinraza is indicated for the treatment of 5q spinal muscular atrophy, SMA, a disorder characterised by progressive muscle atrophy and weakness. I am mindful of the fact that access to potentially beneficial drug treatments is an important issue for all people with serious illnesses. I fully appreciate that SMA sufferers and their families face enormous day-to-day challenges in dealing with this progressive and debilitating condition.</p>
            <p eId="para_25"> Securing access to new and innovative medicines in a timely manner is a key objective of the Irish health service. The challenge is to deliver on this objective in an affordable and sustainable way. The Oireachtas has put in place a robust legal framework in the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which gives full statutory powers to the HSE to assess and make decisions on the reimbursement of medicines, taking account of a range of objective factors and expert opinion as appropriate. The Act specifies the criteria to be applied in making a reimbursement decision, which include the clinical and cost effectiveness of the product, the opportunity cost and the impact on resources that are available to the HSE.</p>
            <p eId="para_26"> In reaching its decision, the HSE will examine all the relevant evidence and take into account such expert opinions and recommendations that are appropriate, including from the National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics, NCPE. This ensures that each reimbursement decision is made on objective, scientific and economic grounds.</p>
            <p eId="para_27"> The HSE received an application for the reimbursement of Spinraza in July 2017 and referred it to the NCPE for advice. The NCPE conducted a health technology assessment on Spinraza and did not recommend reimbursement at the price sought by the applicant. The application for the reimbursement of Spinraza is currently being considered by the technology review committee on rare diseases and the HSE drugs group. These expert bodies are carefully reviewing the clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness of the product in light of the prices being charged by the company which make it a very high cost treatment. </p>

            <p eId="para_28">This is nothing personal but I am disappointed with the Minister of State's answer, which is pretty generic. What will the rare disease committee review? The information is exactly the same as that already received by the NCPE. The dossier is exactly the same, as are the patients and the medical evidence. That is not an adequate answer for people such as Grace and her parents. I have put four or five questions to the Minister of State and have listed them on a piece of paper that I will give to him because I sought specific answers to them. Why is this process being delayed? Why have the families heard nothing? When will a decision be made? Will the families be engaged with in this process because currently there is no engagement? I remind the Minister of State that a petition has been signed by more than 40,000 people. This may be an orphan drug, used in rare conditions by a small number of people in this country, but there is a far greater movement of people behind them who understand that price should never be an issue when it comes to children's lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_29"> Why has the process been delayed? Why are the families hearing nothing about it and will they be engaged with? I remind the Minister of State that this drug is being reimbursed in countries such as Romania, Slovenia, Slovakia, Cyprus, Lithuania and Croatia. It is time we showed some respect to this cohort of patients and reimburse this drug as a priority.</p>

            <p eId="para_30">I think Senator Swanick understands better than most that it is not a decision for politicians. The House made that decision in 2013 when the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act was passed by both Houses. It was agreed that politicians would not decide what drugs would be reimbursed and what prices would be paid to drug companies. I agree with that.</p>
            <p eId="para_31">I do not think politicians should make those decisions. The Senator has a number of questions. I respectfully suggest he refer to the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013, which will answer each of his five questions, or at least four of them. If there are specific questions, it would be more appropriate to direct them to the HSE because neither I nor the Minister have any role or function in this process. That was a decision taken by the House.</p>
            <p eId="para_32"> The Senator said price should never be a barrier when it comes to the health of children. The State is not going to approach drug companies, which are part of a multi-billion euro industry, with that mantra and suggest price never a barrier in approving any drug. That would be reckless, irresponsible and dangerous in the extreme. As these are powerful multinational companies - multi-billion euro companies - that have a lot to gain, there is a healthy tension there that demands time and necessitates things being done properly and a process that is held up to scrutiny, transparency, clinical effectiveness and cost effectiveness because, as the Senator and all of us here are aware, there are many competing demands on the limited resources that are available to the HSE on an annual basis for the delivery of services. </p>

            <p eId="para_34">The Minister of State is very welcome. I welcome Professor Maura Adshead from the school of politics and public administration at the University of Limerick who is in the Public Gallery. As she is shadowing me for the day, it will be an interesting experience for both of us.</p>
            <p eId="para_35"> I am here to inquire about an update on the advertisement for a specialist MS nurse for University Hospital Limerick. We had this same debate last May where I was informed that the position would be advertised and filled. The report that was issued in March 2016 stated there should be three specialist MS nurses for any hospital that serves over 475,000 or close to 500,000 people. There is no specialist MS nurse in University Hospital Limerick. It is terrible for those who have been diagnosed with MS. The number of people diagnosed with the condition has increased in recent times. It is crucial that this position is filled as soon as possible. MS nurses are very helpful in terms of helping with the diagnosis, as well as helping MS patients with their medication and advice. Patients must contact a nurse in Cork or other parts of the country, which is not satisfactory. The report highlighted the fact that we need three specialist MS nurses in the mid-west but we currently have none. I am really disappointed because I was informed in May that the position would be advertised and filled very quickly yet there has been no advertisement to date so I would really like an update today. </p>

            <p eId="para_36">I thank Senator Byrne for raising this issue in the House and giving me an opportunity to address it. I am advised that the UL Hospitals Group recognises the need for the appointment of a clinical nurse specialist post in neurology. The national clinical programme for neurology clearly outlines the resource requirements for the neurology service across the University Hospital Limerick site and nationally to achieve the best outcomes for neurology patients in line with best international practice. The neurology model of care also recommends the appointment of a clinical nurse specialist as part of a multidisciplinary team treating patients with MS. It is in this context that the UL Hospitals Group has taken the decision to prioritise the recruitment of an MS nurse. I understand a job application for this position has been finalised by the UL Hospitals Group for submission to the HSE national recruitment service.</p>
            <p eId="para_37"> It is timely for me to use this opportunity to update the House on developments with the model of care for neurology services. The national clinical programme for neurology has developed and published a model of care for neurology services, which provides a framework for neurology services to be delivered through an integrated service approach. It is intended that such services will be delivered in an efficient, equitable manner by supported, skilled professionals working in a multidisciplinary manner using a person-centred approach to care. The model of care promotes best practice in the delivery of neurology services by adopting key international standards and promoting support for evidence-based and research-led practice throughout the service. At the centre of the model of care for neurology is the role of cohesive and comprehensive multidisciplinary team care in the management of patients. The model envisages audiologists, nurses, occupational therapists, physiotherapists and other health and social care professionals working with patients and collaborating with specialist colleagues in providing optimal care for patients in the Irish healthcare system. </p>
            <p eId="para_38"> The purpose of the clinical nurse specialist post within this broader team is to improve and enhance the care of patients and their families by improving existing services and developing new services with regard to neurology and to assist overall in optimising the quality and continuity of care. The clinical nurse specialist will work as a key member of the multidisciplinary team in the hospital service providing physical, psychological and emotional support to neurology patients and their families. He or she will act as a liaison between community services, primary care teams and other agencies. </p>
            <p eId="para_39"> It is my understanding that the UL Hospitals Group will continue to work with the national clinical programme for neurology and is prioritising the recruitment of the clinical nurse specialist post within that context to progress the need for further strategic development of neurology services in the mid-west region. </p>

            <p eId="para_40">I note the Minister of State has acknowledged how important the service provided by the MS specialist nurse is. The disappointment I feel is because something similar was said last May. It was said it would be prioritised. As we are midway through October, I seek a commitment from the Minister of State that he will keep up the pressure on the hospital group to advertise this post and have it filled as quickly as possible because, as the report stated, it is necessary to have three such nurses. This is only the first of those three nursing posts. We are six months on and we still have none. It is really important for MS sufferers and their families that this post be filled as soon as possible. I would like to see it filled tomorrow rather than this time next year. I would be very grateful if the Minister of State could give me a commitment that he will keep up the pressure on the hospitals group to fill this post as soon as possible.</p>

            <p eId="para_41">I echo the Senator's welcome for Professor Maura Adshead from the school of politics and public administration at the University of Limerick, who is shadowing the Senator for the day. If I can tell the professor anything about her study for the day, one thing the Senator possesses, and she possesses many attributes, is consistency. I am on record previously as having said that it is one of my favourite attributes in any politician. We can all get very animated and exercised about individual issues but we tend to move on and drift more than we stay focused. It is timely that the Senator is being shadowed by an academic for the day on which I make that point. I thank the Senator for her consistency with regard to this issue. It is typical of her tenacity and determination.</p>
            <p eId="para_42"> HSE-speak and Civil Service-speak can be highly frustrating for us as politicians on many occasions. What does it mean that something continues to be a priority? We want timelines and deliverables. These are real people who are waiting for this service and want to have a nurse in place today rather than tomorrow. The commitment is that it will be progressed significantly by year end. Again, what does that mean exactly? As that is the frustration I share with the Senator, I will certainly take up the issue. In my role as Minister of State, with help from the Minister and his office, I will ensure I do justice to her prioritising of it in the House. I will ensure it receives attention back down the chain to ensure there is a timely conclusion of the recruitment process.</p>

            <p eId="para_43">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, who is a regular visitor to this House and sometimes brings good news. He might be aware that last Thursday was World Sight Day, a day on which an opportunity is taken to highlight issues relating to sight loss and the various complex challenges people with sight loss face. There are 40,000 people on waiting lists for ophthalmology procedures, which is a very high figure. I know that it will not be dealt with overnight but I hope we will see a downward trajectory in due course to help those who get into the system and engage.</p>
            <p eId="para_44">More often than not, unfortunately, they get bad news. Sometimes it is children and sometimes adults. There must be mechanisms to assist them. The child of a lady from Mayo, Ms Natalie Cramp, was six months old when irregular movement was spotted when looking into the child's eyes, something that was done on a regular basis. An appointment was eventually secured with a consultant who advised that the child had a condition called nystagmus. As it happens, that is one of my own conditions. It took three years from that point for the family to be connected with the National Council for the Blind of Ireland, NCBI. That is the organisation which provides practical support for people with sight loss, puts programmes in place to advise them and connects them to low vision aids, low vision supports and peer counselling. That is particularly important for parents who discover their children have visual impairments. It can be traumatic. There is, however, a whole suite of supports available to assist people to come to terms with sight loss and deal with the challenges.</p>
            <p eId="para_45"> The issue I have is that it took nearly three years for somebody in the medical profession to connect Ms Cramp to the NGO that could give much support. That would not happen in the United Kingdom. There are what are known as sight loss clinics in the UK in all the major hospital groups. Over the last couple of years, NCBI has endeavoured to have a sight loss adviser appointed to most of the hospital groups in this country to engage with parents who get devastating news. They will also engage with adults who are told they are going blind or are losing their sight in a way that is going to have a life-lasting effect. If there is an adviser, at least people can get supports quickly. They can be equipped to come to terms, as best they can, with the new reality of their lives.</p>
            <p eId="para_46"> Some of the hospital groups in this country are very proactive in doing that but some are not. It should be compulsory that there is a sight loss adviser in all the hospital groups. I was very tempted to table an amendment to the Children's Health Bill 2018 to ensure it was enshrined in legislation that a sight loss adviser would be appointed to the national children's hospital when it is eventually built. I hope that will not be necessary and that it would happen as a matter of form. The quicker people get interventions, the faster and easier they can adapt their lives to dealing with their new reality. I often say we should get our eyes checked on a regular basis because the faster a deterioration is identified, and the quicker supports and interventions put in place, the better chance there is of eyesight being retained.</p>
            <p eId="para_47"> That extends to a situation where a person finds he or she has lost his or her sight. In order for his or her quality of life to be maintained as best it possibly can be - and it can be because there are plenty of supports - the sooner interventions happen from a mental health perspective and a practical perspective, the better. That is especially the case with young children. The quicker they get supports such as low vision aids and the faster they connect with the various suites of supports that are available, the better the chance they have of adapting to the reality they face for the rest of their lives. I sincerely hope the Government will see the logic of what I consider a practical step to connect the NGO structures and the various other structures when it comes to visually-impaired teaching services, etc. I await the reply of the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_48">I thank the Senator for raising this issue and giving me the opportunity to provide an update to the House. The Government is committed to delivering disability services that are person-centred and putting those who need supports at the centre of our focus. We want to empower people to live independent lives by improving access to the services they require. The 2016 census figures indicate 54,810 people, or 1.2% of the population, have a sight-related disability. This represents a 6% increase since 2011. The people in question have the right to the same access to healthcare services as everyone else.</p>
            <p eId="para_49"> In 2015 the Health Service Executive published "Guidelines on accessible health and social services". The guidelines were developed by the HSE in consultation with the National Disability Authority to give practical guidance to all health and social care staff about how they can provide accessible services to all. The key message in these guidelines is ask, listen, learn, plan and do. Communication with patients is key to being able to plan appropriate supports to improve accessibility. From access to buildings to managing appointments and communicating clearly with patients, the HSE is committed to ensuring that access to services is a priority.</p>
            <p eId="para_50"> Within acute hospitals and across the hospital groups, access officers support staff in dealing with matters where additional support or guidance is needed. Where gaps exist, access officers are working to address systematically the gaps and ensure future services and facilities comply with national guidelines, standards and legislation. The quality improvement division within the HSE is working in partnership with patients and families to improve the quality and safety of care for patients. The National Council for the Blind of Ireland has also developed specific information resources for healthcare professionals working closely with the HSE to provide input and invaluable advice.</p>

            <p eId="para_51">I thank the Minister of State for the update on what is probably a new way of thinking. I hope it will evolve in a positive way. All the chief executive officers of the hospital groups in this country have a duty to sign up to what is being proposed. It is modest. I know the NCBI certainly provides supports, both human and financial, in this scenario. This, however, is something to which we will come back. It is also something I will monitor closely because I really believe in the concept of early interventions right across the board. I know the Minister of State does as well because we regularly speak about the importance of early interventions. I refer to when there is a deterioration in somebody's health, in whatever shape or form it happens. Society needs to click in, help and support. The Minister of State's answer is in that vein and that is the type of policy we need to look at moving forward. We have to take an holistic approach. If a person finds that he or she has a disability, we must have an holistic approach to how we can ensure his or her ability rises to the top and he or she can overcome his or her disability. I thank the Minister of State.</p>

            <p eId="para_53"> On the point about early intervention, the key is awareness and people having conversations about it. I particularly welcome, therefore, the opportunities Senator Conway has in this House to raise awareness and champion these issues. Starting that conversation and encouraging it is leading to much more awareness. Many more people are having that conversation and, ultimately, that leads to people taking up the invitation and the challenge from Senator Conway to have eye examinations as often as possible. By being proactive and having a healthy eye check, people are able to avail of earlier intervention. I thank him again for his contribution to this issue and his continued good work on it. I wish him continued success in highlighting it.</p>

          <p eId="para_77">The security on the INIS website is low level. It has been reviewed by security academics. A website usually asks one to confirm that one is not a robot by asking how many cars are in a picture. The INIS website does not have any of these security provisions so a bot has been able to go in, buy up the slots and sell them on Facebook for €25 to €30. This is unfair and immigrants are being exploited. I have brought this to the attention of the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, as have some of my colleagues from Fianna Fáil. I bring it to the attention of the House because it is something that could readily be fixed. Pragmatism and urgency are required in order to do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_78"> People have come to my clinic who are in receipt of asylum work permits. It looks like a grant of probate - it is a cream form. One person got a job, presented the asylum work permit and was told that the head office of the company will not accept it. It might be apt for the Government to consider putting this into the equality legislation. Refusing to accept work permits like this should be one of the equality grounds for discrimination. It is not acceptable that employers are refusing to accept these work permits if the Government is issuing them.</p>
          <p eId="para_79"> I welcome the recommendations of the Joint Committee on Mental Health that smartphone protocol be introduced, especially for young children and in schools. There should also be a protocol for adults. Addiction to smartphones can cause mental health and addiction issues. It can lead to overworking, and many Senators probably suffer from that. We need to have a debate on the proper use of smartphones. Our relationship with smartphones is unhealthy. I commend the recommendations of the joint committee.</p>

          <p eId="para_85">On Monday I met Irish emigrant campaigners and leaders in London. They are seeking to secure the vote for Irish emigrants in next year's proposed referendum on voting rights for the Irish abroad. I look forward to working with the many emigrant groups to help win this referendum that the Government has proposed for May 2019. The Taoiseach and Government are committed to getting this referendum over the line. As I told my London audience, we will have to fight for every vote. We will seek to expand the home to vote movement for the third time in four years. We will put together a modern, 21st century political campaign to overcome the old-fashioned, 19th century attitude about who has the right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">Opponents of the extension of voting rights will rise up and say that such people left Ireland, do not pay taxes here and are not connected to Ireland and if they vote in large numbers, they will swamp the home vote. However invalid those arguments may be, we must be ready to counter such concerns. It should be noted that our opponents always seem to forget that Thomas Clarke, who was the heart and soul of the Easter Rising, was a returned Irish emigrant and an American citizen.</p>

          <p eId="para_88">They also want to forget that the founders of the Republic called for a government elected by the suffrages of all of our men and woman, not one elected by a small group of taxpayers and landowners. Our demand for rightful equality - to have the immigrant vote counted - goes back to the founding democratic principle of this nation. We want to fulfil the promise of the Proclamation: one citizen, one vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_89"> Why are emigrants not allowed to vote? If one is not on the island or is on the wrong part of the island, one cannot vote. There are almost 100,000 Irish-born citizens living in greater London who cannot vote here. The entire political landscape of Ireland will undergo a profound transformation in the next 20 years driven by five factors: Brexit, the possibility of a referendum on a united Ireland, rising immigration, an increasing population and our demand that Irish citizens living overseas or in Northern Ireland be given the right to vote.</p>
          <p eId="para_90"> These issues should be front and centre in the current presidential campaign. I would like to hear the opinions of each of the candidates on these pressing matters.</p>
          <p eId="para_91"> Irish emigrants should have the right to vote in Irish presidential elections and referendums. They also need greater representation in the Seanad. Postal voting is well established as a means to achieve such aims in many European countries.</p>

In 2014, the European Commission stated that citizens exercising the right to free movement should not be disenfranchised in national elections. A few weeks ago, the European Parliament took up the issue of voting rights and Ireland was once again cited as having poor voting mechanisms. In the months ahead, I will appeal to the sense of fair play and commitment to equality of my fellow Irish citizens to advance the democratic principle of one citizen, one vote and give all Irish citizens, including emigrants, the right to vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_96">I commend my colleague, Senator Swanick, for again raising the issue of the drug, Spinraza, as a Commencement matter this morning. However, the answer he was given by the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly, was wholly unsatisfactory. Some of the children in need of the drug are in intensive care units but we are given the nonsense of being told the drug is under consideration. It is cruel and dehumanising. It is beyond comprehension that the Minister cannot meet the families of those affected. I understand there are statutory responsibilities, but I want the Minister to meet these families to see the situation first-hand. The Minister of State has stated these decisions are made on objective scientific and economic grounds. What about humane grounds?</p>

          <p eId="para_98">I am, but I wish to reiterate it because we are united across parties in trying to address the needs of these vulnerable families and the children who desperately need that drug.</p>
          <p eId="para_99"> Last Friday roads and communities in County Mayo were once again cut off by flooding. The flooding is largely due to the lack of investment in local and regional roads. Some €40 million was announced in the budget in that regard but hundreds of millions of euro have been cut from the local and regional roads budgets in recent years while we nationalised the debt of the banks. This is vital infrastructure. Additional local authority staff are needed to address this problem.</p>
          <p eId="para_100"> I ask the Leader to bring the Minister to the House to have a full and proper discussion on regional and local roads and some honesty on the issue. Because a certain Minister takes it upon himself to announce every LEADER grant allocated in County Mayo, the impression and illusion is given that lots of money is being committed to the county. However, there are no funds to clear drains in the county, which could have prevented much of the flooding last Friday. The flooding is serious because it led to entire communities being cut off from Mayo University Hospital. I ask the Leader to request that the Minister visit County Mayo. He has been to Crossmolina and other areas but I ask that he come to County Mayo.</p>

          <p eId="para_103">This is International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. In Europe, the wealthiest continent in the world, some 25% of citizens are at risk of poverty or social exclusion. A large proportion of them are the great majority of the 80 million European people with disabilities. I applaud the work of the European Anti-Poverty Network and, in particular, its Irish branch in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_104"> On people with disabilities, citizens have the right to vote in an election and referendum on Friday 26 October but not every citizen can exercise that right. Serious access issues remain for people with disabilities. We now have a hard-won template such that the visually impaired can for the first time vote privately and confidentially in a referendum, although not yet in other elections. That template was fought by the system through the courts. The right to vote in confidentiality is a powerful and necessary expression of what democracy and a republic is about.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> There are outstanding issues relating to access to polling stations in 11 constituencies or one quarter of constituencies nationwide, namely, Carlow-Kilkenny, Dublin Central, Dublin Mid-West, Dublin South-Central, Dublin South-West, Dún Laoghaire, Kerry, Limerick City, Limerick County, Tipperary, Waterford and Wexford. Although there are not issues in every polling station, it is a blight across the country.</p>
          <p eId="para_106"> Will the Leader ask the Minister to come to the House at an early date and set out his plan to sweep away those barriers as quickly as possible? At least two elections will be held next year - local and European - and it is important that all citizens be able to cast their vote.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">I raise concerns that have been expressed by many Members relating to ongoing delays in the processing of illness benefit payments. I am dealing with a case involving an individual who is not from my constituency and who contacted me having waited eight weeks a claim to be processed. I raised this issue two weeks ago in another context but it does not seem that the situation has improved since then. Members have been told in reply to parliamentary questions and in the most recent statement by the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, which was published on its website on 21 September, that the delays result from the introduction of a computerised programme to process these payments. It is no longer good enough that people have to wait a significant number of weeks to claim a basic payment from the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_108"> The illness benefit is a payment for a person who is sick and cannot work. Such persons pay into the system and expect to receive a service in return.</p>
          <p eId="para_109">My understanding is the delays arise from the lack of negotiations with GPs on the transition from a paper form to an online process. From talking to GPs, my understanding is that very little in the way of negotiations has taken place. The Department and the National Association of General Practitioners, NAGP, had looked at appointing a mediator to resolve the issues they had but the idea was pulled at the last minute. In the meantime, thousands of people are waiting for illness benefit payments to be made to them. The people concerned are in very difficult circumstances but the only response from the Department is to go and see the community welfare officer. Nobody wants to have to go to see the community welfare officer to enable themselves to make ends meet while they await the processing of a payment. I ask for the Minister to ensure sufficient staff are allocated to the illness benefit processing section of the Department and to allow claims made on the old forms to be processed forthwith, because there are many people who have been living on the clippings of tin over the past few weeks awaiting their payment. This is something this House can unite on so I ask it to appeal to the Minister to ensure there are sufficient staff to process these payments. People have been waiting far too long for payments to which they are entitled through the stamps they have paid.</p>

          <p eId="para_110">I refer to an issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh and by Senator Swanick on a Commencement matter earlier relating to the drug Spinraza which could transform the lives of a small number of children and adults. No decision has been taken yet and I fully realise the Minister is not directly involved. The advice of the HSE and the NCCP is taken on board because new drugs come onto the market every day and the Minister cannot be involved in all of the decisions but the issue here is the vacuum and the delays for the parents of the children involved. I know some of the families involved in Mayo and they have told me of the uncertainty and the lack of information or timelines. I ask the Leader to emphasise to the Minister that there needs to be information for these families who are in a very traumatic situation. I also ask the Leader to urge the Minister to get the HSE to give information to the families when a decision is made. It is available in 20 other countries and it would not compromise any negotiations to say that, if the drug companies are looking for a higher price in Ireland than in the other countries, it should be brought out into the open. Pressure should be put on those companies if that turns out to be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">I echo the points made about the drug Spinraza. I also echo the comments of Senator Conway-Walsh on coastal erosion in the Erris region. I put some harrowing footage on my social media pages last week. It was very scary and hopefully the Minister of State, Deputy Kevin Boxer Moran, will visit us on the topic.</p>
          <p eId="para_112"> I have raised the restoration of the FEMPI cuts and the general practice contract many times before. FEMPI has destroyed general practice, particularly in remote areas and in deprived urban areas. It is not possible to take €2 billion out of general practice without it having devastating effects on the health service. Every €1 spent in primary care saves €5 in the rest of the health service. Almost 12 months ago, in November 2017, the Minister for Health signalled his intention to commence the reversal of the FEMPI cuts to GPs and announced that he would engage with GP representative bodies next year with the aim of establishing a new contract and an approach to multi-annual fees in 2019. I ask the Leader to ask the Minister, following his announcement last year that he would engage with GP representative bodies, how many meetings or engagements he has had and what progress there has been. In a response to Deputy Harty in August, the Minister said he had had only two face-to-face meetings with the IMO representatives this year and none with the NAGP. The NAGP has been excluded thus far and I want to see genuine action on these talks. They are emergency talks because general practice has been decimated over the past number of years. I want there to be inclusion to ensure the talks succeed and that means the NAGP being at the table.</p>

          <p eId="para_113">I have had many discussions on Jadotville and the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, is to be commended on ensuring the Jadotville medal was struck. I also owe a great debt of thanks to the Leader for organising the parade to commemorate those fine men in Athlone barracks. It has always been said that there were no recommendations for medals or that, if there were, they were not to be found. Company Sergeant Jack Prendergast, Sergeant John Monaghan, Sergeant Walter Hegarty, Corporal Tadhg Quinn and Private Gerald Hennelly were each nominated for the military medal for gallantry in Jadotville. Captain Liam Donnelly, Lieutenant Kevin Knightly, Lieutenant Noel Carey, Lieutenant Tom Quinlan, Company Sergeant Jack Prendergast, Sergeant John Monaghan, Sergeant Walter Hegarty, Sergeant Tom Kelly, Corporal James Rea, Corporal James Lucey, Corporal Tom McDonnell, Corporal John Foley, Corporal John McDonagh, Corporal John McManus, Corporal Tadhg Quinn, Corporal Michael Lynch, Private Joe O’Kane, Private Robert Larkin, Private Michael McCormack, Private Tom Gunn, Private Charles Cooley, Private Thomas Flynn, Private Michael Tighe, Private Daniel Molloy, Private John Nicell, Private Jim Feerey, Private Noel Stanley, Private Michael Brennan, Private Gerald Hennelly, Private Matt Quinlan and Private Michael Galvin were all nominated for the distinguished service medal for their action in Jadotville.</p>
          <p eId="para_114"> Thankfully, due to the work of the Defence Forces, these names were found. A total of 196 nominations for distinguished service medals for action in the Congo were discovered in recent days and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence, the Taoiseach and the Government will want to honour each of the people concerned. I believe the medals are long outstanding.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">A number of the people in question have gone to their grave and, sadly, of the Jadotville group whose names I have read out, only nine are still alive. Walter Hegarty, the father-in-law of my niece, has one distinguished service medal but should have had two, as well as one for gallantry. The medal for gallantry is the Irish equivalent of the Victoria Cross and I ask the Leader to assist me, as he did for that wonderful parade in Athlone, in now honouring all the men who were there. Let us have a trawl to see how many more distinguished service medals were nominated but not delivered throughout the country. I commend the Defence Forces for uncovering the names. Now let us get the medals for the men in question.</p>

          <p eId="para_117">The Eddie Fullerton dam, just north of Buncrana, is the biggest civil engineering project in the history of County Donegal. It supplies water to a huge area and will now be extended. I rise today to ask the Leader to raise with the Minister for Housing, Planning and the Environment, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, the need for Irish Water to meet Donegal's public representatives because the pipe network which supplies water from the dam to the south Inishowen area,= was not constructed to the required standard, something that is well known locally. It bursts again and again and private businesses, homeowners and public service providers are regularly affected by it. The matter has been raised with Irish Water but Irish Water has refused to even consider an investment programme to replace the pipes, even though it knows that they were not constructed to the required standard.</p>
          <p eId="para_118">Not only are they not agreeing to invest in the replacement of these pipes, but they are proposing to extend that water supply from the Inishowen Peninsula to Letterkenny, the major town and urban centre in Donegal, which is incredible. As they refuse to listen to the concerns of public representatives in Donegal, I am asking that the Leader ask the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, to say to Irish Water that it needs to meet the public representatives. The company arrogantly refused to meet us about another issue in the north Inishowen area earlier this year. Irish Water representatives need to meet us about this issue and they need to agree an investment programme before the company considers pushing the water further on to Letterkenny. This is becoming farcical at this stage and I ask for an intervention from the Minister to make sure that this time Irish Water listens to the concerns of public representatives in Donegal, acts on them and ends this farce relating to the water pipe supply to south Inishowen.</p>

          <p eId="para_160"> On jobs growth in Ireland, we are entering challenging times with Brexit coming down the road and it is good news to see the announcement of new jobs. For instance, this morning Voxpro announced 400 new jobs in Cork. The company started off in Cork with a small number of staff. It was built by people from Cork and it now employs more than 3,000 people in Cork and Dublin. Overall, it has more than 5,000 employees. That started off with two or three people and it has now grown substantially. It shows the positive way in which the economy has been managed in the past seven years because, despite the threat of Brexit people, feel confident that they can invest in new jobs in Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_161"> There are many challenges in Dublin because of the cost of accommodation and the cost of setting up but Cork is an attractive place for companies to locate in. For example, 1 Albert Quay is a building that has been completed beside the railway station and it accommodates more than 1,700 office workers. When all the other projects are completed in the area, there will be more than 10,000 people working in offices within five minutes walking distance of the train station in Cork, which shows the confidence that people have in the region. One of the challenges that we now need to deal with is to make sure that we have adequate residential accommodation for those people who want to take up employment in Cork. We need to work on that area. One of the significant complaints at the moment relates to residential accommodation. The cost of building apartments is way in excess of what can be recovered from their sale. I call on the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government to come to the House to debate what we can do to help deal with that issue and to make sure building apartments for this new spurt in population is a viable proposition and that they can be built in a timely manner.</p>

          <p eId="para_162">The report that came out today entitled, Growing Up in Ireland: The lives of 13 year olds, informs us about what we need to do in policymaking, legislation and collecting data on a range of issues in the areas of health, physical development, social and emotional well-being, schooling and learning, etc. Of significance in that report is obesity among children. Some 20% of children in that age group are considered overweight with more than 6% being clinically obese. Most notable is the disparity between the children's weight and how they perceive themselves. It is often termed weight insightlessness. I bring up this issue because, as Senator Dolan alluded to, today is UN International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and poverty is highlighted in this report. Children from a background of significant inequality and social disadvantage were found to be at much higher risk of poor health and being diagnosed as clinically obese.</p>
          <p eId="para_163">We could all do with reading this report and reflecting on what further policies, legislation and education are required. I also wish to promote the launch of the report of the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care. It will be launched in the audiovisual room at 1 p.m. today. Smartphones and so on caught the headlines, but really what is most important for the mental health services in this country is the retention and recruitment of appropriately trained staff. Suggestions, objectives and proposals will be put forward in the report.</p>

          <p eId="para_164">I raise the issue of the bus services - or perhaps I should say the lack of services - provided by Bus Éireann for the people of Monaghan. For people in Monaghan who wish to use Bus Éireann, the main bus travelling to Dublin is the Letterkenny to Dublin express, which stops in Monaghan. Last week an 84 year old lady was planning on going to Dublin Airport using Bus Éireann services to catch a flight. She stood at the side of the road along with a few others and waited for the bus to come for almost an hour. When the bus eventually arrived, the bus driver pulled up to inform her that there were no seats available on the bus. In a panic she had to ring a neighbour to rush her to the airport in order to catch her flight. I can only imagine the stress and annoyance that would have caused that 84 year old lady. For the people of Monaghan, the only show in town for those using public transport is buses. Surely the Leader will agree that some form of update should be provided to people, or some form of tracking device should be used, in order that people would know whether the bus is going to be five minutes late or, in some cases, over an hour late and whether there is any space on the bus. We can imagine that if people are using bus services to catch a flight or, like many people at present, to travel to hospital appointments in Dublin, or are among the many students who travel to college daily, it is important to know whether there is space available on a bus or whether it will appear at all.</p>
          <p eId="para_165"> It is an issue that needs to be tackled. I recently met the chief executive officer who informed me that Bus Éireann planned to increase the daily services from Letterkenny to Dublin, which would have facilitated the people of Monaghan. He told me those services would be in place by September at the latest. It is now heading towards November and there is still no sign of those services. Clearly people are losing confidence in Bus Éireann and in the service it provides to the public. With that in mind I ask that the Leader invite the Minister into the House in order that we can address the issue to ensure that the people of Monaghan who wish to travel to Dublin and who have no other choice but to use buses can at least be sure the bus will arrive when it is meant to arrive.</p>

          <p eId="para_174"> I am very disappointed this morning to hear that the plan for a civic plaza at College Green has been turned down by An Bord Pleanála. This issue is about the €10 million proposal to pedestrianise the space in front of Trinity College Dublin, to the side of Bank of Ireland and up Dame Street and to turn the area into a vibrant, car-free, child-friendly central plaza for Dublin city. The space was identified as potentially the most important civic space in Dublin by Dublin City Council's public realms strategy in 2012. It is hugely important in terms of building Dublin as a liveable city. I have not yet read the report in full, only the reasons and considerations. The report was released this morning. It throws it back to Dublin City Council to go back to the drawing board again to sort out what An Bord Pleanála considered to be significant shortcomings associated with the traffic modelling and the effects of bus rerouting. The people of Dublin deserve a city that flows, in that they can get where they want to go, but it should be a liveable, child-friendly, pedestrian city. This is a project I passionately support, but we need to get it right.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I wanted to raise one issue, but I will very briefly support my colleague, Senator Gallagher, in calling for the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come to the House to discuss Bus Éireann. It provides an excellent service in the main but there are some difficulties.</p>
          <p eId="para_176"> Last August, An Post announced the names of 156 post offices which were to be closed in the Twenty-Six Counties over a period of months. It also announced an appeal mechanism and the criteria such post offices had to meet to appeal that decision. In spite of a detailed submission by Killeshandra Community Council, which clearly outlined the huge range of business activities in the town and the wide diversity in commerce and enterprise, its appeal was turned down. The council was informed of that in recent days. Like any rural community, there is a large cohort of older people. Unfortunately, in many instances, they do not have their own transport or access to technology. At a recent public meeting held in the town, which was attended by my colleagues, Councillors Sean Smith and John Paul Feeley, there was a determination in that community that its post office should remain open. It was doing excellent business and the local community was, and is, using it to a large extent. The community felt that its post office met the criteria for an appeal but unfortunately, as I said, it was turned down in recent days. In a recent Dáil debate my colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, outlined clearly to the Minister that in assessing the need for a post office facility, An Post should factor in the population of the town and its hinterland. I believe Killeshandra meets and met all of the necessary criteria. Unfortunately it was unsuccessful. </p>
          <p eId="para_177"> I appeal to the Leader to facilitate the new Minister to come to the House in order for us to outline to him our views, and to get his views, in respect of the appeals process because it is obviously not adhering to its own criteria. I would appreciate it if we could look to the future of our post offices and not the past, as is normally the response from Government representatives in both Houses. Unfortunately, the Leader meets those criteria. I would like to look to the future and, if there are criteria set aside for appeals and communities meet them, those communities should be successful, not unsuccessful. We want the Minister in here to discuss that process in detail.</p>

          <p eId="para_178">Like other colleagues, I am very disappointed that the plaza on College Green is not going ahead. In many other European cities, one sees that the centre of the city has a plaza. I often reflect on decisions made by An Bord Pleanála. I believe it needs to be radically reshaped. Political accountability is good, not bad. There is no political accountability for An Bord Pleanála. I am open to correction but I do not believe An Bord Pleanála has ever come into the Houses of the Oireachtas to answer questions on some of the decisions it makes. Perhaps it is precluded from doing so. If that is the case perhaps we need to change the legislation in that area.</p>
          <p eId="para_179"> I wish to speak about another issue I know that will be close to an Leas-Chathaoirleach's heart, because he comes from a county that benefits greatly from tourism, which creates thousands of jobs throughout the west coast. We have done so well from initiatives like the Wild Atlantic Way, Ireland's Ancient East and so on. The Government's commitment to investing in greenways is the new way to go in terms of developing a year-round weather-resistant tourism product. There are now many people who do not come for the weather.</p>
          <p eId="para_180">They come because they want to get involved in activities and be on the move. It is what we call healthy tourism.</p>
          <p eId="para_181"> I request the Leader to invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to come before the House in order that he might provide an update on the greenways programme. Additional resources for the programme were announced in the budget, which is very welcome. We could be doing more to promote the greenways. In County Clare, we have a walk along the Cliffs of Moher that goes from Hag's Head as far as Doolin. It is between 8 km and 10 km in length and thousands of people do it every year. The walk requires significant investment. Some 1.5 million people frequent the Cliffs of Moher visitor experience each year. A proportion of the resources generated by the facility needs to be redirected into upgrading the cliff walk and enhancing the partnership that already exists between the local community and farmers and the State agencies which promote the walk. The farmers need to see a greater dividend. The walkway needs to be upgraded and significant money needs to be spent on it. The Minister needs to come before the House and provide an overall presentation on greenways and walkways. In the course of that, he might be kind enough to outline his plans for the future of the Cliffs of Moher walk in County Clare.</p>

          <p eId="para_182">I also want to mention College Green. It is certainly disappointing that a pedestrian plaza will not be developed at that location. I would have liked the plans to have gone much further, including for the Bank of Ireland building there, which has a long history, to be taken into State ownership.. I have always believed part of the dividend of the bank bailout should have been Bank of Ireland handing over the building at College Green. I have heard the Leader state on many occasions that he agrees this should be done.</p>
          <p eId="para_183"> There is a trend with An Bord Pleanála's decisions. Today, this major infrastructural proposal has fallen. A development in Poolbeg West, which would provide 3,500 units to house up to 8,500 people, has been delayed until January at least. The previous Minister with responsibility for housing and current Tánaiste, Deputy Coveney, promised that ground would be broken on the Poolbeg West site in 2017 and that residents would move in by 2019. This will not happen. An Bord Pleanála must be resourced properly, it must be independent and it should not be answerable to the House. We established it as an independent authority. Many Senators were elected by local authority members. An Bord Pleanála upholds the development plans of local authorities. This is its key role. I certainly would not like to see-----</p>

          <p eId="para_190">I support Senator Ardagh's comments on the INIS website. I did not realise there had been such problems with it. It is only right that Members of the Oireachtas have full confidence in the INIS website and I fully support her in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_191"> On the issue raised by Senator Conway-Walsh, one would think by what she said there had been no investment in the road network. The road network is in the very best state I have ever seen in the context of surfacing, signposting, etc. I remember an occasion in the late 1990s when Senators, as public representatives, had to propose that the Government introduce a 10p increase in the price of a gallon of fuel to be ring-fenced for filling potholes throughout the country. I have never seen the roads I travel in as good a state of repair as they are.</p>
          <p eId="para_192"> On quite a number of occasions, my colleague, Senator Mulherin, has referred to obligations of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The latter has delayed a number of projects in County Mayo. It has delayed a bridge at Cloongullane in Swinford. A bridge over the River Moy was proposed for a new road from Ballina to Swinford but the project was refused. Recently, funding of €500,000 to develop and widen the Castlebar to Belmullet road was held up by the National Parks and Wildlife Service. I hope the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht will come to the House at some point to discuss the role of the National Parks and Wildlife Service. The freshwater pearl mussel has cropped up all over County Mayo. I am sure it is also the case in other counties. It has prohibited some farmers from draining their land. Senator Conway-Walsh alluded to situations where some drains were not opened. Many farmers are not allowed to open drains and this freshwater pearl mussel is causing some problems. I support the call that the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht come to the House to discuss the National Parks and Wildlife Service.</p>

          <p eId="para_206">I accept that I coming to this matter a little late. I have no comment to make on the circumstances of the resignation of the former Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Naughten. In his capacity as Minister, I found Deputy Naughten very forthcoming, available and engaging and I want to give him credit, particularly for the hands-on approach he took to trying to secure energy supply and security in the Shannon Estuary. He was very involved in a project that is close to my heart, namely, that relating to liquefied natural gas, LNG. Unfortunately, that project has once again been delayed by an objection. I hope that when there is an outcome in that regard, the new Minister, Deputy Bruton, might come to the House and take up from where the former Minister, Deputy Naughten, left off.</p>
          <p eId="para_207"> I want to bring the attention of the House to an article by Simon Carswell in today's edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>. It includes an interview with Mary Casey of Inniskeen, County Monaghan, regarding the death of her father, Johnny, in a tragic appalling murderous act carried out by the IRA on August 22, 1972, when it exploded a bomb at a Border crossing in Newry. The explosion resulted in the deaths of eight people, including Mary's father, who was an innocent lorry driver who had stopped to get his documents in order. The article is very interesting. It brings to mind all of the atrocities committed by the IRA and its equally mad counterparts on the extreme unionist side. It is important that we dwell on these things, especially at a time when there is a lot of loose talk about Brexit. I have heard some outrageous comments by Neanderthal British politicians about letting the Irish shoot it out among themselves. There have been equally irresponsible comments from the other side, with people stating that it is time to take advantage, have a Border poll and get a united Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_208">They should read the newspaper article in question today. I commend it to every Member of every party. We do not want to go back to those murderous mad days. The IRA finally realised the futility of its activities and moved on. Thanks be to God, it perished in the dustbins of history. However, there are equally mad people up there who still think they can do the murderous things the IRA thought it had authority to do. Now is the time to reflect on that before it gets any further and let saner voices prevail in the Brexit debate.</p>

          <p eId="para_235">It is unacceptable that the website could be hacked so easily. This issue can be addressed as a matter of urgency but also as a matter of ease. There are technologies which can be put in place which will ensure information is secure and people can have their information protected. Technology can also ensure the system can be overridden to protect applicants who are looking for important visa interviews and want to get their paperwork processed quickly.</p>
          <p eId="para_236"> I agree with Senator Ardagh that it is unacceptable that some employers are not accepting the asylum work permit. We should work collectively to ensure people's applications are accepted as it is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_237"> Senator Lawless raised the issue of voting rights. It is part of a national conversation, leading to a referendum next year. I look forward to having many a healthy debate both here in the House and in wider forums.</p>
          <p eId="para_238"> Senators Murnane O'Connor and Devine referred to the Oireachtas committee on mental health and welcomed its impending report. Equally, it is important to recognise the work being done by Professor James O'Higgins Norman in DCU who has now joined up the National Anti-Bullying Research and Resource Centre with Facebook to put in place a new anti-bullying and online safety training programme. We all welcome this. The report being published today by the cross-party committee will be an important step in this area.</p>
          <p eId="para_239"> Senators Conway-Walsh, O’Mahony and Swanick raised the issue of Spinraza. The response of the Minister of State to this issue on Commencement matters earlier recognises the serious potential benefits of the drug for people with a serious illness. I accept that it is frustrating. The HSE will examine all the evidence. I hope it will look favourably on the request made.</p>
          <p eId="para_240"> Senators Conway-Walsh and Paddy Burke raised the issue of flooding and roads in County Mayo. I do not want to get into a particular argument but I am not sure where Senator Conway-Walsh is in terms of investment in regional and national roads. As Senator Paddy Burke rightly said, an extra €286 million has been made available in the national planning framework for roads. Part of the difficulty we have with the opening of drains is due to issues with the freshwater pearl mussel. It is also about local authorities, farmers and landowners being proactive. I would be happy for the Minister to come to the House to discuss the matter.</p>
          <p eId="para_241"> Senators Dolan and Devine raised the issue of child poverty and mentioned that this is the International Day for the Eradication of Poverty. The Ministers for Children and Youth Affairs and Employment Affairs and Social Protection are acutely conscious of the need to have more young people out of poverty. That is why we have seen an increase across the board in social welfare payments. Changes have been made to a plethora of schemes such as the back-to-school allowance, access to childcare, school meals, lone parent's allowance and jobseeker’s benefits. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has an allocation of €127 million for affordable childcare and €89 million in addition to being able to change access routes for childcare. I would be happy to have a debate on the matter. One person in poverty is one too many.</p>
          <p eId="para_242"> Senator Dolan raised the important issue of access to voting and mentioned that there were outstanding issues related to access to polling stations in 11 constituencies. We should welcome the independence given to people who are visually impaired when voting. It should be extended to all elections. We need to see returning officers making decisions at a local level with regard to where they locate polling stations. If they are not wheelchair accessible or disabled person friendly, then they should not be used as a polling station. Extending the voting franchise through the postal system for people who are housebound or who may find it difficult to get to a polling stations should be looked at. If other countries can do it, I do not see why we cannot.</p>

          <p eId="para_245"> Senator Nash raised the problems with illness benefit payments. My own office has had several cases where people have had issues with the payment of illness benefit. It is a matter on which I am happy to ask the Minister to attend the House.</p>
          <p eId="para_246"> Senator Swanick raised the issue of FEMPI. Today talks are taking place between the HSE, the Department and the medical unions. Central to healthcare reform under the overarching umbrella of Sláintecare is a new GP contract. We all recognise the centrality and the importance of primary care in the healthcare system.</p>
          <p eId="para_247">That is why today's talks at the beginning are welcome. Equally, I commend the Minister on reaching an agreement with the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform on new multi-annual budgeting for the provision of GP services. The Minister for Health has made the point that there are three prongs to the stool. One is increasing access to the existing GP primary care. The second is disease management and the third is to make existing GP practices sustainable, which is what we hope to do. I remind Senator Swanick that it was his own party, when in government, that introduced the FEMPI legislation. It was the Fine Gael-led Government that reduced FEMPI in the past number of budgets with a view to phasing it out completely. </p>
          <p eId="para_248"> I did not catch all of the names that Senator Craughwell read into the record of the House. I am happy to assist him in any way I can in ensuring that we honour and commemorate their service. I am happy to talk to him at a later date about the matter.</p>

          <p eId="para_306">I suggest the Senator submit a Commencement matter on the subject, as I do not have the information.</p>
          <p eId="para_307"> Senator Norris raised a matter that Senator McFadden raised yesterday regarding landlords demanding a fee of potential rental clients or people. It is extraordinary and unacceptable that a landlord would have the audacity to ask and expect to receive a payment. I completely abhor any such attempt to extract a payment from people seeking to rent an apartment or a property and join with Senators McFadden and Norris in condemning the practice. I am not sure that the legislation spoken about by Senator Nash is relevant or correct but certainly such a practice should not be accepted. </p>
          <p eId="para_308"> I join Senators Murnane O'Connor and Colm Burke in welcoming yesterday's announcement of jobs in Carlow and today's announcement of jobs in Voxpro in Cork. It is a sign of a growing economy. As Senator Colm Burke rightly said, investment is now taking place outside Dublin. I know that both the Senators will welcome, as they have done, the new jobs announced for Carlow and Cork. </p>
          <p eId="para_309"> Senator Murnane O'Connor mentioned the report by the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care, which I have addressed. Equally, I join her in congratulating all those involved in kickboxing and their massive haul of medals. Sport is a wonderful gift that unites communities and greatly benefits young people and all those involved. I did not catch the name of the sports club in Carlow but commend all involved. I also did not catch the fourth item that she raised and apologise. </p>

          <p eId="para_312"> Senator Colm Burke mentioned the growth of Cork city and the needs to build viable apartments. As he said, the management of a growing economy with its expectations and demands needs to be met by both central and local government. Housing is the central issue that we must face in this term and the points made by him were well made. </p>
          <p eId="para_313"> Senators Gallagher and Wilson raised the issue of the bus service in Monaghan. I am afraid that I do not have the answers on that particular matter. If they choose to table a Commencement matter they might get the answer. I will invite the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to this House to discuss transport matters in the coming weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_314"> Senators Warfield, Conway and Humphreys raised the issue of the plaza on College Green. I fully accept that the need for a plaza is self-evident. I regret the decision made by An Bord Pleanála and hope that Dublin City Council will resubmit a planning application. I believe that Bank of Ireland should have been asked to give the building back to the State in the fallout of the bank bailout, but that did not happen.</p>
          <p eId="para_315"> Senator Wilson raised the issue of Killeshandra post office and the fact that the appeals process or mechanism for its re-opening has run its course, which is disappointing. I am happy to invite the new Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment, Deputy Bruton, to the House to discuss the issues of post offices. Senator Marie-Louise O'Donnell made that request yesterday. </p>
          <p eId="para_316"> Senator Conway raised the issue of greenways and walkways. I am happy to have the Minister come to the House for that discussion. Equally, Senator Paddy Burke asked for the Minister for Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht to come to the House to discuss an issue. </p>

          <p eId="para_335">I do not know whether Senator Ned O'Sullivan touched a nerve or detonated some type of whatever in the House but he certainly raised the issue of Simon Carswell's newspaper article this morning on Mary Casey and her father, Jack, and the atrocities of August 1972. Earlier Senator Mac Lochlainn got very animated. I must say to him that all of us who are republicans and who want to see a peaceful Ireland, as Senator Ned O'Sullivan does and as I am sure Senator Mac Lochlainn does also, recognise there were atrocities that are wrong.</p>

          <p eId="para_381">It is great to be back in the Seanad. I could nearly have honorary membership at this stage as I am here a lot at the moment. I thank Members for considering this Bill and giving it a Second Reading. This is a short, technical Bill with only five sections. It provides for the amendment of certain provisions of the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which relate to the recognition of non-Irish professional qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_382"> Before explaining the Bill in more detail, I will provide the House with some background to the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, which this Bill seeks to amend, and a brief update on its implementation to date. The Act currently provides for the statutory regulation of 17 designated health and social care professions. Regulation under the Act is primarily by way of the statutory protection of professional titles by confining their use solely to persons granted registration. The structure of the system of statutory regulation comprises registration boards, a committee structure to deal with disciplinary matters and a Health and Social Care Professionals Council, HSCPC, with overall responsibility for the regulatory system. These bodies are collectively known as CORU and are responsible for protecting the public by regulating health and social care professionals in Ireland. CORU is also charged with the promotion of high standards of professional conduct and professional education, training and competence among the registrants. The Act provides for a transitional period of two years during which existing practitioners may register on the basis of specified qualifications. Following this period, only registrants of a registration board who are subject to the Act's regulatory regime or those who applied during the transitional period and whose applications are still being determined or are under appeal are entitled to use the relevant protected title or titles. </p>
          <p eId="para_383"> From a public protection viewpoint, a crucial milestone in the regulation of the Act's designated professions was the introduction of the Act's fitness to practise regime in recent years. This involved the commencement of Part 6 of the Act to allow for complaints about the conduct or competence of registrants to be investigated. Where complaints are substantiated, disciplinary sanctions up to and including cancellation of registration may be imposed. The regime is similar to that applicable to medical practitioners, nurses and midwives. </p>
          <p eId="para_384"> To date, 11 registration boards have been established in respect of 13 professions. Eight registers are open and their respective professional titles are now fully protected under law following the close of the two-year transition period attaching to each register. The registration boards for the professions of medical scientist, podiatrist, psychologist and social care worker, while established, have not yet opened their registers but are working hard to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_385"> I also take the opportunity to update the House on the regulation of counsellors and psychotherapists. As Deputies may recall, these professions were not designated for regulation under the 2005 Act. Following consultations with the HSCPC and a detailed public consultation on the question of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists, I decided last year to proceed with the designation of two distinct professions under the Act, that of counsellor and psychotherapist - each with its own register under one registration board. I signed the regulations in April this year designating the new professions and establishing the Counsellors and Psychotherapist Registration Board following the approval of the regulations by both Houses. This was followed with the advertising over the summer period by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, of a campaign to recruit 13 members for appointment to the registration board. Following the conclusion of that process in September 2018, I intend to make the board appointments in the coming weeks. Once appointed, the registration board will give consideration to a number of outstanding issues and will advise the council and the Department accordingly. These include titles to be protected and the minimum qualifications to be required of existing practitioners applying for registration in the transition period and for future graduates. As the House will appreciate, and given that a number of other jurisdictions have tried and failed to regulate these professions, this is a challenging work programme that will take CORU time to achieve but I thank it for taking this work on. It is important that we get this area right. Counsellors and psychotherapists come across people who are often at the most vulnerable moments in their lives and it is important that when someone goes to see a counsellor or psychotherapist, they know who they are going to see and their qualifications. This is a big body of work but one that is worth doing and getting right. </p>
          <p eId="para_386"> I am aware of other professions seeking designation under the Act. Perhaps it is a sign of the times that we have gone from a system where people might not have wished to be regulated or fear regulation to one where nearly everybody comes forward and asks for their profession to be regulated. Of course, there needs to be proportionality in that regard, but professions such as creative arts therapists, play therapists, athletic rehabilitation therapists, chiropractors, audiologists and various scientific professions, to name but a few, have been making a case for regulation for some time. The immediate priority, however, is to bring to conclusion the regulatory process for the 17 professions designated. We must finish that body of work. </p>
          <p eId="para_387"> When all the registration boards have been established and their work programmes well under way, the Department will turn its attention to the question of how best to treat the unregulated professions. A risk assessment, in terms of public protection, of the principal health and social care professions seeking designation will be undertaken in 2019 as a first step. I very much welcome this. It will inform decisions to be taken concerning options for their possible future regulation. Departmental officials will work with CORU in progressing this project taking into account the ongoing and extremely demanding work programme being undertaken by the agency. </p>
          <p eId="para_388"> In addition, I am also obliged to take into consideration the recently adopted EU directive on a proportionality test before the adoption of new regulation of professions. This directive establishes rules for member states to conduct proportionality assessments before the introduction of new, or the amendment of existing, professional regulations to ensure the proper functioning of the internal market while guaranteeing transparency and a high level of consumer protection.</p>
          <p eId="para_389">Its intention is to harmonise the ways in which proportionality tests are carried out before member states introduce new regulations on professions and the criteria to be applied in accordance with European Court of Justice rulings. It does not, however, affect the member states' competence to decide whether and how to regulate a profession within the limits of non-discrimination and proportionality. This directive must be transposed by July 2020, following which member states which wish to adopt new regulatory procedures will be required to justify to the European Commission that such procedures are necessary and appropriate. The Commission may take action if it deems such regulations to be insufficiently justified and, therefore, disproportionate, for example regarding their effect on free movement.</p>
          <p eId="para_390"> I propose to provide some background to the amendments contained within the Bill. The Bill will amend the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 to provide that all non-Irish professional qualifications which have been recognised by the Minister and by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for a health and social care profession will continue to be recognised for the purposes of registration under this Act. This will allow holders of such qualifications to be statutorily registered and to practise their profession. As Senators are aware, the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory regulation for 17 health and social care professionals. When statutory regulation is introduced for a profession, a practitioner cannot practise in his or her professional capacity without being registered with the relevant registration board established under the Act, one of the requirements for which is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification. </p>
          <p eId="para_391"> Section 38 provides that persons hold such a qualification if they hold an Irish qualification which has been approved by the relevant registration board, if they hold a European Economic Area, EEA, qualification which has been recognised under Directive 2005/36/EC on the recognition of professional qualifications, if they have been practising the profession for not less than five years and hold certain Irish historical qualifications, or if they hold a professional qualification which the registration board decides attests to a standard of proficiency which corresponds to the approved relevant Irish qualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_392"> Section 38 as it stands, however, does not encompass non-EEA persons or persons with a non-EEA qualification who have previously had their qualifications recognised in Ireland on an administrative basis using processes that mirror those of Directive 2005/36/EC or its predecessors. A serious difficulty, therefore, has arisen for these persons when they apply for registration. While their qualifications may have been recognised in the past, the legislation as currently framed does not allow for their registration. This gap in the legislation must be resolved to allow such persons to register and practise their professions. The Bill before us addresses this gap by providing in section 38 that the qualification of an applicant who has evidence that such qualification has been recognised by the Minister or by a body acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for the relevant profession will be considered to be an approved qualification under the Act. This means that there will be no requirement for reassessment of the qualification. </p>
          <p eId="para_393"> The Bill has five sections. Section 1 provides that the "Principal Act" referred to throughout is the Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005, while section 2 amends the definition of "qualification" in that Act. Section 3 of the Bill amends the registration provisions of the Act to address the gap in the legislation by providing that a member of a relevant designated profession who holds a relevant professional qualification which has been recognised by a relevant person is considered to hold an "approved qualification". Section 4 provides for the insertion of a Schedule to the Bill which sets out the list of relevant designated professions and corresponding relevant persons. Section 5 provides for the Short Title of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_394"> This matter is a priority as without the amendments each registration board at CORU is required to undertake a detailed assessment of the professional qualifications of certain health and social care professionals whose qualifications have previously been recognised by the State. Such persons must submit an application to CORU and await a decision which can take a number of months as their formal training and post-qualification experience must be compared on a case by case basis against the current Irish reference standard. This puts a consequential administrative burden on applicants and CORU. As we know, CORU has enough to be doing and we would like it to focus on the areas we need it to focus on, rather than placing an additional and unnecessary burden on it or the applicants in that regard. For these reasons I am keen that this Bill proceeds through the various Stages of this House and the Dáil as quickly as possible in order that we can pass it into law and address what is a technical but important matter. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>

        <speech by="#KeithSwanick" eId="spk_296">
          <from>Senator Keith Swanick<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_395">I welcome the Minister back to the House. Fianna Fáil will support this Bill which makes minor technical amendments to the relevant Act and will facilitate any non-Irish health and social care professional qualification which was recognised in the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration with CORU in 2005. Although a number of professions in 2005 had informal or voluntary systems of registration organised by their respective professional bodies, only five health professions were then subject to statutory registration in Ireland: doctors, dentists, nurses, opticians and pharmacists.</p>
          <p eId="para_396"> The 2001 health strategy, Quality and Fairness: A Health System for You, gave a firm commitment to strengthen and expand provisions for the statutory registration of health professionals. The Health and Social Care Professionals Bill, therefore, represented an important step forward in strengthening the regulatory environment. The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 provides for the introduction of a system of statutory regulation for certain health and social care professionals: clinical biochemists, counsellors and psychotherapists, dietitians, dispensing opticians, medical scientists, occupational therapists, optometrists, physiotherapists, podiatrists, psychologists, radiographers, radiation therapists, social care workers, social workers and speech and language therapists. This means that a practitioner cannot use the protected title, that is, he or she cannot practise in his or her professional capacity, without being registered with the relevant registration board. Among other things this regulation protected vulnerable people from those who sought to prey on them with alternative therapies, which is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_397"> One of the requirements for registration under the Act is that the applicant must hold an approved qualification and section 38 provides several routes for the recognition of qualifications. This Bill adds a new route which provides that any non-Irish health professional qualification which was recognised either by the Minister or by bodies acting on behalf of the State prior to the introduction of statutory registration for a health and social care profession, will be considered to be an approved qualification under the Act with no requirement for assessment by CORU.</p>
          <p eId="para_398"> Section 3 is the key section of the Bill. It proposes to amend section 38 of the 2005 Act. A relevant professional qualification for the purpose of this section is defined as a professional qualification that has already been recognised by a relevant person as of a standard of proficiency which rendered the holder eligible for recruitment by the HSE in that profession. Recognition must have been granted either before the establishment of the register for that designated profession, or on or after the establishment of the register where an assessment for recognition was commenced by the relevant person before that date. The health and social care professions have been to the forefront in setting and maintaining standards of patient care and professionalism in this country. They have been proactive in working towards a statutory system of registration and are supportive of the general principles underpinning the system.</p>
          <p eId="para_399"> We are happy to support the Bill and look forward to seeing it implemented in the near future.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#JoeOReilly" eId="spk_297">
          <from>Senator Joe O'Reilly<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T13:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_400">I join in welcoming the Minister to the House and acknowledge the dynamism and commitment he brings to his ministry. We are delighted to have him in the House yet again.</p>
          <p eId="para_401"> My party is happy to commend the Bill also and add to the unanimity on it. The Health and Social Care Professionals Act 2005 was of extraordinary importance. It established statutory regulation which was crucial for the whole social care practitioner area. Societal change, the needs and complexities of society, greater resources and a new environment have all created myriad new social care worker areas. Therefore, regulation was and is crucial, and the 2005 legislation was seminal to that extent. It established statutory legislation which ensures there is a minimum standard of education, proficiency and, insofar as it can be achieved, objective standardisation in these professions, which is to be welcomed.</p>
          <p eId="para_402">I commend and welcome the amendment to the 2005 Act proposed by the Minister in the Bill to incorporate non-EEA personnel who have qualifications previously validated by the regulatory bodies in the host country, in this case, Ireland, whereby they will automatically gain registration and acceptance, as would be the case if they were from the EEA. That is the objective of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_403"> Having commended and endorsed the Bill and having recognised the serious importance of the 2005 Act in the first instance, I will make some general observations. The Minister referenced the importance of regulating counsellors and psychotherapists. As he said, people are in a very vulnerable state when they go to somebody like this. They almost put themselves in a complete dependency situation. It could be extraordinarily dangerous if we do not have the highest standards and regulations, proper qualifications and recognised monitoring and establishment of those occupations. This is crucial. As the Minister said, this all happens under CORU, the registration body for all 17 designated health and social care areas. It is good that the range is wide and that nothing escapes this net.</p>
          <p eId="para_404"> This is a Second Stage debate which allows a level of latitude, but my next point is pertinent. I have discovered through meeting people and through general evidence, anecdotal and otherwise, that there is a huge problem with CORU's speed of processing. I have come across instances of returning emigrants who, to continue in their profession, must establish that while they were abroad, they gained a certain amount of professional experience. There is undue delay because, they are told, there must be a board meeting but surely a board could have designated officers who operate the established criteria of the board. These would be proper professionals who understand the board's objectives and criteria and who could adjudicate on individual applicants with haste, without a lack of thoroughness but with haste. Returning emigrants deserve this.</p>
          <p eId="para_405"> We are encouraging nurses, health professionals and social care professionals to return to Ireland and it is wonderful we are in this space. The Minister has made a big effort to get many health professionals back working in this country. If we invite them back should we leave them in limbo? I could cite for the Minister privately later, as it would not be appropriate to do so publicly, instances of people sitting for months awaiting registration after returning home. In one instance a particular high-quality professional is working in the bar business. There is absolutely nothing wrong with working in the bar business <i>per se</i> but she is working in hospitality when in fact she is a qualified professional who has worked abroad. She has been waiting for months for the registration process. This is completely unacceptable. The Minister is a very senior member of the Cabinet and this point needs to be made to him. We encounter emigrants coming home from Australia, the US and England who are allegedly welcomed to Ireland, and we would all state there is a céad míle fáilte for them, but they are having nightmares with banking, insurance and driver licenses. To be germane to what we are speaking about, they are having nightmares with delays in professional recognition. These roadblocks to the talent and brains we are trying to attract back to our country should be removed. It is a real issue. I encounter it throughout the area and it needs addressing.</p>
          <p eId="para_406"> I ask the Minister to examine two particular issues with CORU. These are whether it needs more staffing resources and the degree to which it could delegate within the organisation in order that it is not necessary to have cumbersome board meetings - that happen only at intervals of a few months - to register people. This would mean that someone who appears with qualifications does not have to wait for the next board meeting. I gather the next meeting is scheduled for November, which is appalling if it is true. If it is not true, I would be happy to be so informed by the Minister, but I understand the next board meeting of CORU to process material will be in November. What happens to a person who has come home and who has dependants, a mortgage and normal living expenses which, God knows, are high? What must that person do in the intervening period?</p>
          <p eId="para_407"> As a professional, I cannot see how established professional people in CORU who understand the objectives of the board could not be delegated with the capacity to register people on a day-to-day basis. There should not be a cumbersome bureaucratic procedure. An issue of policy and accepting a particular qualification may arise in a broad sense, but surely it could be executed efficiently on a day-to-day basis. I look forward to hearing the response of the Minister on a real issue for the people whom I represent.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#ColmBurke" eId="spk_298">
          <from>Senator Colm Burke<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T13:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_408">I thank the Minister for bringing forward the legislation which is very welcome. There is a need for regulation and I have come across it quite a bit in recent years. Certain areas not covered by this are still not regulated and I acknowledge the Minister is also working on these areas. It is important that we make sure everyone who provides a professional service has gone through a unified standard of training, whether it is for physiotherapy, speech and language therapy or social work, in order that we have a standard to be met before a person can hold him or herself out as being professionally qualified.</p>
          <p eId="para_409"> I have come across an issue on a few occasions with regard to medical practitioners. We must ensure those applying for jobs have not been barred from practising in the country from which they have come. This is something that can easily fall through and it needs to be very carefully watched. Recently, I came across the case of a medical practitioner who had obtained a job in a hospital and who had given information that was absolutely incorrect. When it was corrected, the hospital acted immediately to remove the person from working on the wards and that person was suspended immediately. Information had been supplied inaccurately and wrongly. This is a huge area because people are going abroad to obtain qualifications and people are coming from other jurisdictions with qualifications.</p>
          <p eId="para_410"> I agree with Senator O'Reilly on the registration process. I came across one case of someone who had set up in Ireland after practising in the UK for more than ten years, believing a suitable qualification to carry on the practice here was held. However, the person has been dealing with CORU for the past four to five months and has been requested to close down the facility, which is unfortunate. We have come across problems where people set up practices and genuinely felt that they had fulfilled all of the criteria and had gone through the registration process but, for some reason, there was a misunderstanding about what had and had not been done.</p>
          <p eId="para_411">That is a challenge. All those seeking registration must comply in full with the regulation and produce all of the necessary documentary evidence to show that they are qualified and can provide a service.</p>
          <p eId="para_412"> Although it is not covered by the Bill, the area of physical therapists is of concern. It is being followed up on by the Department. There is a concern regarding many physical therapists who are practising in Ireland but may not be allowed to continue their work in a particular area. That issue must be addressed. The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health, of which I am a member, has written to the Department on the issue on a few occasions. It is an issue of great concern which must be dealt with by the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_413"> Another area not covered by the Bill and which needs to be monitored is that of people who provide scanning services. Many companies offer scanning services without providing any additional support. I previously gave the example of a pregnant woman going for a scan on a Saturday with a person operating privately and being advised that the foetus was not alive but no back-up support being immediately available for the woman. That is an issue which causes me great concern. It is important that anyone providing scanning services has professional indemnity insurance and so on. Some GPs have difficulty getting such insurance. If they wish to provide a scanning service, they must have adequate professional indemnity insurance. That area must be addressed. Aside from the issue of incorrect information being given, if there is no back-up support in a clinic, where can a person go to access such support, in particular at weekends? It is an area that must be looked at.</p>
          <p eId="para_414"> I welcome the Bill. It is extremely important that the regulations be properly implemented for all of the professions listed in the Bill and that structures be in place to ensure adequate supervision. I thank the Minister and his officials for bringing forward the legislation and the work that has been done by all involved, including those who agreed to sit on the boards. It is very important that people are giving a commitment and dedicated to ensuring there is a standard which is maintained and improved on a constant basis. I thank CORU for the work it is doing. However, it is of great importance that the issues raised by Senator O'Reilly be addressed.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SimonHarris" as="#Minister_for_Health" eId="spk_299">
          <from>Minister for Health (Deputy Simon Harris)<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T13:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_415">I thank Senators Swanick, O'Reilly and Colm Burke for their contributions and unanimity on the importance of what is a technical Bill that we need to pass as quickly as possible through both Houses of the Oireachtas in order that CORU can place its attention, effort and resources where we all want them to be. We do not wish to cause delay to people who are perfectly well qualified to provide services here and whose qualifications have been recognised but who, under the existing Act, would again have to go through an individual assessment process. I thank the Senators for their support in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_416"> I thank Senator O'Reilly for raising several important issues and for his support regarding the need to regulate counsellors and psychotherapists. This is a big area. As I stated in my opening remarks, other jurisdictions have tried and failed to implement such regulation. I am determined that we will succeed and get this right. In the course of discussions of women's healthcare I have been horrified by some of the advice which I was told had been given to women, often pregnant women or women in crisis, by people who call themselves counsellors or psychotherapists. If one examines the qualifications or lack thereof of such individuals, one would not want them to treat one's loved ones. It is very important to regulate in this area out of respect for the qualifications of the many brilliant and qualified people who work in it and in order to control the rogue elements which often enter it.</p>
          <p eId="para_417"> On CORU, its busyness and the potential for delays, I thank Senator O'Reilly for highlighting this important issue which he encountered through interaction with people in his constituency of Cavan-Monaghan. Applications for recognition of non-Irish health and social care professional qualifications are assessed in accordance with the European directive which I outlined. It provides for a detailed assessment on a case by case basis of an applicant's formal training and post-qualification professional experience and how those compare with the qualifications required to practise here. The competent authority must issue a decision to an applicant within four months of the submission of a complete application. Of course, the Senator is correct that due to the improved economic climate and the fact that we are increasing the number of professional registers, far more people are now applying for recognition. In fact, the volume of applicants seeking registration has more than doubled since 2015.</p>
          <p eId="para_418"> The Senator is entirely correct that more people are coming to Ireland, want to work here and want their qualifications to be recognised. In response, CORU has allocated additional resources, including additional staff, to ensure the four-month timeline stipulated in the directive is met. Although CORU endeavours to process applications as quickly as possible, its overarching objective, as the Senator will agree, must be to ensure patient safety and that the required criteria are applied rigorously. I have some good news in that regard because I have been advised by CORU that an online application system which will greatly assist applicants and CORU in terms of processing applications will be operational in the coming months and should lead to an improvement in the situation. Documentation accompanying an application is often incomplete, which adds to the back and forth between the applicant and CORU. Ensuring complete applications are submitted and then dealt with in a chronological and fair order is how CORU must proceed. I will keep a very close eye on its resourcing and staffing, but the new online application system will be of assistance to applicants and CORU and I hope it will result in an improvement in some of the issues highlighted by Senator O'Reilly.</p>
          <p eId="para_419"> The Senator also asked me to consider the issue of delegation. While I understand his point, the situation is quite complex in the context of the 2005 Act, under which it is clear that the board makes the decision. However, I will consider the broader point he raises.</p>
          <p eId="para_420"> The whole-of-government point made by the Senator in regard to returning emigrants is very important. The Government has discussed the issue on several occasions. Thankfully, we are back in an era of net immigration into our country. All Members want the return of Irish people who had to leave the country because they could not get a job or did not see a future here. Thankfully, as we approach full employment, people are coming back to the country. The Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, Deputy Cannon, is very eager to ensure their return is as smooth as possible and I will pass on the Senator's comments in that regard to him. It is an issue in which the Taoiseach has taken a personal interest.</p>
          <p eId="para_421"> I will write to Senator Colm Burke on the issue of physical therapists and the correspondence I received from the Joint Committee on Health in that regard. I will pass on his important remarks regarding scanning to the HSE and, in particular, the national women and infants health programme. It is important that a full range of services and supports be provided, with the results of a scan. It is sometimes traumatic and very difficult for people to receive certain scan results.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T15:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_427">I am pleased to introduce the Greyhound Racing Bill 2018 to the House. The greyhound racing sector contributes a substantial number of jobs to the economy, estimated at 5,000 as recently as 2017 by Mr. Jim Power, economic consultant. The sector also contributes €300 million annually into local economies. In addition, it is estimated that there are approximately 7,000 greyhound owners, with an estimated 12,000 people deriving an economic benefit from the sector. It is further estimated that more than 14 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings in Ireland since 2002.</p>
          <p eId="para_428"> Bord na gCon is a commercial State body. It was established under the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to control greyhound racing and to improve and develop the greyhound industry. It is responsible for the regulation, control, promotion and operation of greyhound racing. The activities of Bord na gCon include the licensing of greyhound tracks and their officials, the authorisation of bookmakers to conduct business at tracks, the operation of totalisator betting at greyhound tracks, the regulation of public sales of greyhounds, the making of grants for prize money, the allocation of grants to improve amenities at tracks, and the collection of levies from on-course betting. Bord na gCon licenses a total of 16 greyhound tracks and owns and operates a number itself. These are Shelbourne Park, Cork, Tralee, Waterford, Youghal, Limerick and Galway. It also has a 51% share in the Mullingar track.</p>
          <p eId="para_429"> Bord na gCon receives direct subvention from the State, through the horse and greyhound fund, to assist with the development of the sector. Funding for the greyhound industry declined significantly during the economic downturn from a high of €15.3 million in 2008 to a low of €10.8 million in 2014. Since 2014, funding has been restored to pre-recession levels through a series of annual increases. In 2017, the industry received €16 million and this accounted for approximately 39% of its total income. In 2019, it will receive a modest increase of €800,000, bringing the total Exchequer contribution for the year to €16.8 million.</p>
          <p eId="para_430"> As I am sure Senators are aware, until recently Bord na gCon was servicing a substantial burden of debt which has acted as a financial straitjacket on the industry. The sale of Harold's Cross greyhound racing track has lifted that burden. The surplus of approximately €6 million from the sale will allow Bord na gCon, as set out in its strategic plan for the period 2018 to 2022, to make further welfare enhancements and improve basic facilities at its tracks. That will be to the benefit of all those who participate in and enjoy the sport.</p>
          <p eId="para_431"> Before dealing with the substance of the Bill, I would like to refer to the Indecon report, Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon, which was commissioned in 2014 by the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney. A wide-ranging stakeholder consultation process was undertaken by Indecon consultants in 2014. As part of the review, advertisements were placed on the Department's website and in the farming and sporting press seeking submissions from interested parties. A total of 17 submissions were received from a broad range of respondents.</p>
          <p eId="para_432"> The report made a number of recommendations on governance, regulation and financial matters. The Minister, following publication of the Indecon report, invited and received feedback on the report. The Department also consulted directly with Bord na gCon, the Irish Coursing Club, the Bord na gCon stakeholder forum and with various representatives on the issues. This report has broadly been accepted as a roadmap for the development of the sector. A number of recommendations in the report required legislative change and these recommendations are being addressed in the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_433">Recommendations were also made in a 2016 report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, and in a 2015 Bord na gCon-commissioned report on anti-doping and medication commonly known as the Morris report. Elements of these reports have also been taken into account in drafting the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_434">The general scheme was subject to very thorough pre-legislative scrutiny by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine in 2017. I believe the committee heard from all the major players in the industry and departmental officials also appeared before it. The appropriate observations of the joint committee, identified as part of the pre-legislative process, were incorporated into the general scheme on 15 May, which was then approved by Government for drafting by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel. I will be happy to detail the changes on Committee Stage, but in the meantime, I acknowledge and thank members of the committee for their useful input into the development of this Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_435"> In addition, during the course of drafting a number of changes were made to the Bill on the advice of the office of the parliamentary draftsman. One such change places a greater emphasis on fair procedures, particularly with regard to the conduct of investigations by the board in respect of possible breaches of racing regulations and with regard to the conduct of hearings by the control committee into suspected breaches. Another requires Bord na gCon to consult with stakeholders and the Minister prior to making regulations. Additionally, where regulation breaches lead to criminal offences, the consent of the Minister is required to those regulations. The ability to make regulation under "incidental, ancillary and miscellaneous" provisions has been removed.</p>
          <p eId="para_436"> There also has been a modernisation of the provisions relating to the borrowings of Bord na gCon, where explicit reference is now made to a requirement for the consent of the Minister for Finance, in addition to that of the Minister of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform before all borrowings can be undertaken.</p>
          <p eId="para_437"> Before going through the Bill in detail, I draw the attention of the House a number of changes in the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013, which were not in the general scheme. The programme for partnership Government states that the Animal Health and Welfare Act 2013 will be strengthened and enforced. The opportunity is being taken, in fulfilment of this commitment, to revise elements of the Act on the basis of legal advice, experience gained in operating the legislation and to remove some minor errors of a typographical nature.</p>
          <p eId="para_438"> Returning to matters related to greyhound racing, in broad terms the Bill addresses issues relating to governance and regulation in the greyhound racing sector. It addresses governance issues in Bord na gCon, strengthens regulatory controls in the industry, modernises sanctions, improves integrity, includes the welfare of greyhounds as one of the statutory functions of Bord na gCon and provides it with powers to make regulations in relation to integrity, anti-doping, administration and traceability to improve welfare and integrity deficits impacting the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_439"> I will now provide Senators with details of the Bill. Section 1 provides for the Short Title, collective citation and commencement of the Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_440"> Section 2 provides the definitions for the Bill. Significantly it inserts definitions for "Racing code”, "Sanction breach" and “Racing sanction". These definitions provide a basis for administrative sanctions for breaching the rules of greyhound racing in addition to the current criminal sanctions. It also inserts a definition for a substance, a veterinary practitioner, the control committee and the scientific advisory committee and includes a definition for disqualification and exclusion orders as racing sanctions.</p>
          <p eId="para_441"> Section 3 amends the definition of "the Board" and "the Minister" in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958.</p>
          <p eId="para_442"> Section 4 updates the provisions for service of documents and provides that emails may be used to serve documents.</p>
          <p eId="para_443"> Section 5 is a general regulation making provision and sets out the procedures to be followed by the board, including consultation with interested parties, when the board proposes to make new regulations under this Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_444"> Section 6 allows for summary prosecution by the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_445"> Section 7 provides that existing regulations will be revoked on enactment of the measures in the Bill. Provisions similar to those in the statutory instruments are being brought into primary legislation. However section 7(2) allows matters before the regulatory committees to continue as though the regulations have not been revoked for the smooth administration of justice. If this provision is not inserted, cases before the committees may have to be reheard by the statutory committees under this Act. Any appeal from a decision of the control committee provided for in subsection (2) shall be appealed to the appeal committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_446"> Sections 8 provides for a change of name for Bord na gCon to Rásaíocht Con Éireann.</p>
          <p eId="para_447"> Sections 9 and 10 are on foot of recommendations in the Indecon report and relate to the governance of Bord na gCon. They are as follows: an increase in the number of members of the board from a chairperson and six members to a chairperson and eight members, and an increase in the quorum of the board from four to six; a term of office of five years for the chairperson, as opposed to the current indeterminate period; a statutory prohibition on the re-appointment of a person to the board beyond two consecutive terms, to reflect the code of practice for the governance of State bodies; statutory powers permitting the Minister to remove a board member where the member falls ill and is unable to perform his or her duties or breaches the code of practice for the governance of State bodies as published by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform; cessation of appointment to the board in a number of circumstances, including if a board member is adjudicated bankrupt, is found guilty of offences relating to the greyhound industry, welfare of animals, intimidation or assault, fraud or dishonesty. </p>
          <p eId="para_448"> Section 11 provides for the current standard provisions in relation to elected representatives participation on State boards. This provision is standard in modern law. </p>
          <p eId="para_449"> Section 12 provides for disclosure of potential conflicts of interests. This is a new provision and was recommended in the Indecon report.</p>
          <p eId="para_450"> Section 13 sets out for the first time by statute, an overarching statement outlining the functions of the board. It is intended to provide additional legal certainty in relation to the functions of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_451"> Section 14 provides that the board is statutorily subject to the code of practice for the governance of State bodies issued by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.</p>
          <p eId="para_452"> Section 15 allows the board of Rásaíocht Con Éireann to delegate its functions to the CEO as the board considers necessary for efficiency and effectiveness reasons.</p>
          <p eId="para_453"> Section 16 inserts an explicit provision permitting the board to apply funds to enhance greyhound health and welfare.</p>
          <p eId="para_454"> Section 17 modernises the wording regarding the ability of Rásaíocht Con Éireann to borrow, but retains the requirement for the consent of the Minister and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, acting with the consent of the Minister for Finance. Section 17 of the principal Act is, therefore, repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_455"> Section 18 explicitly provides for the reporting of the accounts of subsidiaries of the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_456"> Section 19 increases the maximum fine to €250,000 on indictment for operating a greyhound racing track without a licence. This brings the 1958 Act into line with current sanction regimes.</p>
          <p eId="para_457"> Sections 20 to 22, inclusive, of the Bill replace section 25 of the principal Act. Section 20 provides for the making of regulations in relation to race tracks and provides for a sanction of a class A fine. It provides for regulations prohibiting racing officials operating unless they have permits and prohibiting individuals from having beneficial interests in aspects of the business. Section 21 extends the regulatory powers of the board to control racing officials and ensuring the integrity of the sport. Section 21(1) deals with the control of racing while section 21(2) deals with the conduct of racing and the promotion of integrity and fair play in racing, including the use of information technology to assist towards this end. Section 21(3) deals with the administration of racing, including the registration and grading of greyhounds and the promotion of racing, section 21(4) deals with charges for entry of a greyhound to a race and section 21(5) states that breaches of regulations provided for in this section carry racing sanctions. Section 22 allows the board to make guidelines to control the establishment, lay-out, construction and maintenance of greyhound race tracks or the use of equipment at such tracks. Enforcement of guidelines in this area will be through the track licensing regime.</p>
          <p eId="para_458"> Section 23 repeals section 25 of the principal Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> Sections 24 to 26, inclusive, are a recasting of the provisions in sections 37 to 39, inclusive, of the principal Act in relation to the training of greyhounds for reward, the public sale of greyhounds and the artificial insemination of greyhounds. The corresponding sections or subsections or both in the principal Act are repealed.</p>
          <p eId="para_460">The consent of the Minister is now required for any new regulations made under these sections. It continues to be an offence to engage in these activities without a licence, permit or approval issued by the board. However, the contravention of regulations made under these sections by a licensee, permit holder or approval holder now carries racing sanction.</p>
          <p eId="para_461"> Section 27 details the regulation making powers of the board in the area of doping control and the administration of substances to a greyhound. Among other things, it allows the board to list substances that may or may not be given to a greyhound, setting residue limits, withdrawal periods, declaring thresholds and the methodologies by which thresholds can be determined for substances. The board may make regulations requiring the keeping of records regarding the administration of substances, the controls to be operated and records to be kept by persons participating in greyhound racing in relation to doping and medication control. The advice and recommendations of the scientific advisory committee are to be used to determine the processes, methods, levels of accuracy, etc., by which samples are deemed to contain a substance. It also provides that a greyhound that fails a test for a prohibited substance is disqualified from racing or trialling until it passes a subsequent test.</p>
          <p eId="para_462"> Section 28 relates to regulatory powers for the traceability of greyhounds. The board may make regulations to require the registration of greyhound owners, the registration of racing greyhounds and the notification by owners, breeders and trainers of greyhounds of many more life events than those currently captured on existing stud book and microchipping databases. These regulations will support the board in its ambition to establish and maintain a new comprehensive tracing database for racing greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_463"> Section 29 allows the board to make regulations for the health and welfare of a greyhound, including requiring those involved to provide information for the sound administration of the industry and to protect the health and welfare of greyhounds. It also allows the board to set down provisions for the treatment of diseased and injured greyhounds and the establishment of funds to protect the health and welfare of a greyhound.</p>
          <p eId="para_464"> Sections 30 to 34, inclusive, relate to the board's right to grant or refuse licences, to attach conditions to licences, permits and approvals, make charges for the grant and renewal of licences, etc., and to revoke or suspend such licences. The fair procedures to be followed, including the right to reply where the board refuses, revokes or suspends a licence, etc., is provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_465"> Sections 35 to 37, inclusive, and 40 relate to the appointment, investigatory powers and functions of the authorised officers. This is the first time the appointment of authorised officers for the purposes of greyhound legislation has been provided for in primary legislation. It provides amplified powers for authorised officers to investigate matters, including investigating the use of performance altering substances. Section 40 specifically provides that, subject to the jurisdiction of the District Court, authorised officers may seek a search warrant, including to search a domestic dwelling, where the authorised officer believes there may be evidence of a breach or an intended breach of the racing code or of the commission or intended commission of an offence under the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.</p>
          <p eId="para_466"> Sections 38, 39 and 41 relate to the obligation of persons to provide assistance for and follow the directions of authorised officers when carrying out their functions under the Act, including a requirement to produce a greyhound at a specific time and place. In addition, it is being made a criminal offence to obstruct, fail to give information, to give false information or to fail to provide assistance or follow the direction of an authorised officer when carrying out his or her functions. The standard provisions regarding self-incrimination are provided for.</p>
          <p eId="para_467"> Section 42 sets out the procedures for the conduct of investigations by the board and permits the board to notify the club where there is a possibility that matters known to it may be of concern to the club. </p>
          <p eId="para_468"> Section 43 sets down the classes of people who are subject to the jurisdiction of the control and appeal committees. It also states the determination of racing sanctions rests with these committees.</p>
          <p eId="para_469"> Section 44 provides for the establishment by statute of the control committee and details its operations. The control committee will consist of a chairperson and a maximum of eight other members to ensure there is a sufficient pool of members to deal promptly with control matters. The control committee will require a quorum of the chairperson, or deputy chairperson, and two other members. Appointments to the committee are made by the Minister for a maximum of two terms. The chair has a term of five years with ordinary member having a term of four years.</p>
          <p eId="para_470"> Section 45 provides for fair procedures in relation to hearings of the control committee. It specifically provides that decisions may be made <i>in absentia</i> in respect of persons who fail to attend the control committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_471"> Section 46 sets out the details of the racing sanctions which may be applied by the control committee and appeal committee. Racing sanctions may be advice, admonishment or censure, the disqualification of greyhounds, or the exclusion of individuals from racing activities or the revocation or suspension of licences or permits. In addition, a person may be required to pay a sum not exceeding €12,500 to the board in certain circumstances, including where the person has an adverse analytical finding for a prohibited or controlled substance. It provides that a person who fails to make a payment shall not be permitted to train, transfer ownership of, race greyhounds or attend a greyhound race track until the amount is paid in full. It also provides for the publication of the names of those who have failed to pay a sanction payment.</p>
          <p eId="para_472"> Section 47 relates to disqualification orders. At present, the board may issue a disqualification order in respect of a greyhound for breach of the racing code. Such disqualification orders apply to racing and trials only. Some individuals have circumvented these orders by transferring ownership. This section provides that disqualification orders issued by the control committee or the appeal committee are racing sanctions and disqualify greyhounds from racing and trials and circumvention of the order is prevented by extending the potential restriction to transferring ownership of the greyhound and use of the greyhound for breeding purposes. The disqualification order can be for a specific period and the terms and conditions for revocation or variation of the order will be specified at the time of making the order.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> Section 48 provides for the exclusion of individuals from certain activities relating to racing greyhounds. This power currently rests with the board or the club. However, under this Bill, power to issue an exclusion order is limited to the control committee and the appeal committee. In addition, it is now possible to specify a time period for which the order applies and the terms and conditions for revocation or variation of the order will be specified at the time of making. Non-compliance with an exclusion order is a criminal offence. The club will issue its own orders under its rules. This section also provides explicitly that the committee is independent in the exercise of its functions and requires the committee to publish its decisions.</p>
          <p eId="para_474"> Section 49 sets down the procedures for appeals in respect of racing sanctions or payments imposed by the control committee. </p>
          <p eId="para_475"> Section 50 provides for a single avenue of appeal for decisions in relation to sanctions and payments imposed by the control committee following the abolition of the current control appeal committee established under article 10 of the Greyhound Industry (Control Committee and Control Appeal Committee) Regulations 2007, which is SI 301 of 2007. The appeal committee retains its function in respect of appeals under section 51 of the principal Act from decisions of the board. In the interests of good governance it imposes a maximum of two terms on committee members. It also provides that the board will pay the remuneration and expenses of appeal committee members and will provide secretarial services to the committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> Section 51 provides the procedures for appeals in respect of sanctions or payments imposed by the control committee and is a recasting of existing provisions in section 51 of the principal Act. </p>
          <p eId="para_477"> Section 52 provides for the communication of decisions of the control committee and the appeal committee to the individual concerned. This section also provides for the staying of sanctions and payments while the situation is under appeal. An exception applies to decisions in relation to adverse analytical findings where sanctions are effective immediately.</p>
          <p eId="para_478"> Section 53 provides for appeals to the District Court for findings of the appeal committee in relation to exclusion orders and/or sanction payments. Appeals in relation to sanction payments are limited to the quantum of the sum. It also provides that the District Court may grant a stay on the application of the relevant determination of the appeal committee.</p>
          <p eId="para_479"> Section 54 relates to evidential certificates issued by testing laboratories in the case of adverse analytical findings. Section 55 provides for the updating of fines generally, the modernisation of wording and the deleting of sections of the principal Act that are no longer relevant.</p>
          <p eId="para_480"> Section 56 is intended to provide legal certainty in regard to the eligibility of greyhounds registered in the stud book. </p>
          <p eId="para_481"> Section 57 makes it a criminal offence for a person who is intoxicated or aggressive to refuse to leave a track or sale when required to do so. </p>
          <p eId="para_482"> Section 58 allows for the transfer of information between different entities for the purposes of those Acts relating to greyhounds.</p>
          <p eId="para_483"> Section 59 relates to the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011 and provides that only progeny produced in compliance with subsections (2) and (3) of section 11 of the Welfare of Greyhounds Act 2011, that is, the first litter to the sixth or the seventh litter and eighth following certification, are permitted to be registered in the Irish greyhound stud book and makes it an offence for a person to attempt to register litters not in compliance with the Act.</p>
          <p eId="para_484"> Section 60 provides a definition specific to Part 11. Section 61 makes technical amendments in regard to offences under section 36 of the Act and is to be read in conjunction with section 63. </p>
          <p eId="para_485"> Section 62 is a technical amendment that clarifies the penalty applicable for the breach of an obligation under an EU regulation. </p>
          <p eId="para_486"> Section 63 provides for making and recovering charges for the costs associated with the detention of seized animals. </p>
          <p eId="para_487"> Section 64 provides explicitly for record-keeping requirements and the making of returns to facilitate monitoring compliance with animal health and welfare notices.</p>
          <p eId="para_488"> Amendments to section 65 are to be made, on legal advice, to remove doubt as to the extent to which the Minister may make regulations in regard to EU matters, databases, animal traceability and transport. </p>
          <p eId="para_489"> Section 66 provides for a range of minor amendments to the Act either of a typographical nature or that could be better clarified, and they are proposed on the basis of experience in applying the Act since it came into operation.</p>
          <p eId="para_490"> This legislation will improve the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions, improve integrity in the sport through new anti-doping provisions and improve the welfare of the greyhound through the traceability measures being introduced and the increased powers being provided for the authorised officers of the board. All of this is with a view to building a reputation for excellence in the sector. The Bill will strengthen the Irish greyhound racing industry, enabling it to deal with the existing challenges it faces and help to maximise its potential. I commend the Bill to the House.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#GerryHorkan" as="#Acting_Chairman" eId="spk_305">
          <from>Acting Chairman (Senator Gerry Horkan)<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_491">I thank the Minister of State for his opening statement. It was one of the most detailed we have heard in a good while. I am not sure how anyone will respond to it but Senators will probably have a good few questions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#PaulDaly" eId="spk_306">
          <from>Senator Paul Daly<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_492">I welcome the Minister of State and thank him for a very comprehensive and detailed explanation of the Bill. It was really appreciated. I do not intend to go through the Bill in such detail step by step today. That would be more appropriate to later Stages. Fianna Fáil supports the Bill and its passage to the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_493"> The Bill, as the Minister of State said, seeks to improve governance of Bord na gCon. It strengthens the regulatory framework and controls in the racing industry. It also updates sanctions and improves integrity in the sector, including in respect of greyhound welfare, as a statutory function of Bord na gCon, which will soon be known as Rásaíocht Con Éireann, while empowering the authority to make regulations with respect to integrity, traceability, anti-doping and administration. Unfortunately, this is another example of the Government's sluggish legislative delivery. It has dragged its feet in implementing the recommendations in the 2016 all-party joint committee on the Irish greyhound industry, the 2014 Indecon report on the sector and the 2016 Morris review of anti-doping and medication in Ireland, commissioned by Bord na gCon itself. All these reports have exposed deficiencies in the governance of the greyhound industry, industry standards and greyhound welfare. The proposals in the reports are pivotal to securing the future of the industry and strengthening governance, administrative and animal welfare structures.</p>
          <p eId="para_494"> Promoting public confidence in the sport, industry and business was important. It is a sport that is often portrayed in a bad light, as is most evident from the highlighting of illegal and horrific training regimes that were in practice in Australia. By virtue of the fact that we were waiting for this Bill, it left our industry somewhat vulnerable and open to an onslaught by the general public. I hope this Bill will help to enhance the image of greyhound racing. The Government should have exhibited greater urgency in trying to pass this legislation swiftly.</p>
          <p eId="para_495"> Greyhound racing employs over 5,000 people and contributes an estimated €300 million annually in economic output to local economies around tracks over a wide geographical spread. Since 2002, over 10 million people have attended greyhound racing meetings. As the Minister of State said, the majority of the 18 tracks are in rural areas. Most training yards and most greyhound owners are rurally based. The associated financial input is vital to the rural communities concerned.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> Fianna Fáil is committed to developing the greyhound industry as a quality Irish industry through good regulation and maintaining premier animal welfare standards and enforcement. It is vital, in ensuring the integrity of the industry, to make sure the highest standards permeate all levels. We do not condone any cruelty to any animal, including greyhounds. I encourage anyone who is aware of cruelty to report it immediately to the relevant authorities.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> The Bill relates to the welfare of greyhounds, including the use of funds to enhance the welfare of greyhounds and improved investigatory powers in regard to greyhound welfare. Animal welfare groups inputted their policy proposals at the pre-legislative stage of the Bill before the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, of which I am a member. Great credit is due to the committee because the Bill was examined very thoroughly. All those who deserved or needed to have an input were invited to meetings of the committee, and all their recommendations were taken very much on board.</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> Representatives stated additional funds were needed to look after dogs when they stop racing. The State must ensure sufficient funding is made available to cater for this. Fianna Fáil supports the annual horse and greyhound racing fund proposals laid before the Houses, as provided for under the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001. This Act paved the way for substantial changes in both structures and funding for this key national asset. As stated, €80 million was allocated in 2018 to the horse and greyhound racing fund, with 80% going to Horse Racing Ireland. This amounted to €64 million, while 20%, amounting to €16 million, went to Bord na gCon. It is welcome that, in budget 2019, it is proposed to increase the funding by €800,000 to €16.8 million. I hope that, following the sale of the stadium at Harold's Cross, and now that Bord na gCon is in a position to write off its long-standing debts, there will be more financial resources available within the industry to invest in the smaller rural tracks and to put towards the implementation of many measures in the Bill. I look forward to the Bill progressing through the Houses and its imminent implementation.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#BrianODomhnaill" eId="spk_307">
          <from>Senator Brian Ó Domhnaill<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_499">I welcome the Minister of State . I acknowledge his work in bringing this Bill to fruition. I appreciate that the delay in bringing the Bill to the Seanad was partly because it was subjected to pre-legislative scrutiny by the committee. That was the correct course of action because it gave the committee the opportunity to engage with stakeholders to hear their opinions and views. It allowed for the strengthening of the legislation. That was good and helpful.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> Overall, the Bill is long overdue. It dates back many years.</p>
          <p eId="para_501">Even before the Government came into office, there was a need to strengthen the industry to protect all of the stakeholders. I will keep my comments general and then reserve the opportunity on Committee Stage to bring forward more specific queries or amendments, if the opportunity arises. The greyhound industry is a tremendous industry with huge potential. At its core are those who provide the dogs, the owners and the breeders. The greyhound has often been referred to as the poor man's race horse. Down through the years, particularly when the recession hit, there was a decline in the financial standing of the Irish Greyhound Board. As a result, many issues came to the fore that were not dealt with. </p>
          <p eId="para_502"> Recommendations were made by the Morris report, as well as by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, when Deputy Doyle was the Chairman and the 2014 report from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, under the stewardship of the then Minister, Deputy Simon Coveney. These all shed light on issues emanating from the sector that needed to be addressed. That is why this Bill is here, why I welcome it and the opportunity to engage with the Minister of State and his officials to tease out some of the issues.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> Much criticism has been levied at the Irish Greyhound Board, Bord na gCon, which is now to be renamed, and much of the criticism is absolutely justified. The greyhound industry is a wonderful sector, but it is one that has been diminishing in recent years. There is a new chief executive officer, CEO, at the head of the Irish Greyhound Board. That is welcome. I have engaged with the CEO and there is now an engagement process for Members of the Oireachtas to engage with the Irish Greyhound Board. I welcome that also. There were issues with the governance of the organisation at management and executive level. The issues raised were very serious. We do not have to go over them today, but I did want to say that. I welcome the attempts in this Bill to try to regularise some of those issues. I refer, in particular, to governance, board appointments and the length of time of some appointments, particularly in the role of chairman. One chairman was there for years. It was almost an issue beyond reproach. The owners and the breeders were totally isolated and not being listened to. </p>
          <p eId="para_504"> We cannot have an industry without the most important aspect of the industry, the greyhounds. The people sitting in the office in Limerick do not produce the greyhounds. It is the ordinary people who are breeding greyhounds. If they felt disenfranchised and not listened to, I hope that was a shortcoming the Bill will address. There are also financial issues which need to be addressed. It is hoped that under the stewardship of the new CEO the Irish Greyhound Board can improve its own financial standing because it has largely become dependent on the State for income. The Minister of State mentioned 2007-2008 when the horse and greyhound racing fund provided around €15.3 million. The overall income of the Irish Greyhound Board, however, was about €78 million. The percentage of State intervention, therefore, was approximately 20%. That has, however, grown to the region of 40% this year. I understand that is due to the economic recession, attendance numbers and the income outside of the State levy. Nonetheless, there is a need to bring this sector to a better level of financial independence. </p>
          <p eId="para_505"> There will always be a need for the levy. I welcome the levy and also the recent introduction in the budget of an increase in the levy from 1% to 2%. It is the right way to go and it was one of the recommendations we touched on in the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine back in 2016. We cannot, however, just provide money to sectors that are not endeavouring to improve their own financial situations. I acknowledge the strategic plan launched by the Irish Greyhound Board. I welcome the plan which goes to 2021 and the objectives therein. That will help the sector. There is much more I could say but I will confine my remarks to what I have said. I might just add some comments on doping in the sport. It has been tarnished by the issue of drugs and that links into an animal welfare issue also. </p>
          <p eId="para_506"> Animal welfare has to be central to the future of the greyhound industry. I refer to dealing with cruelty in the sport, setting up a fund to protect retired greyhounds and dealing with drugs in the sport. There can be no place in the greyhound industry for drugs. The testing facilities being used in Limerick have come under question, unfortunately. If there are questions on the testing and laboratory facilities in Limerick, then they need to be addressed in this legislation as well. I am sure they will be. Those are my remarks. I support the Minister of State fully in what he is trying to achieve. It is the right way to go. I will reserve judgment in respect of small amendments I may or may not bring forward. This is a very important Bill. It follows on from the excellent legislation which was brought in on Horseracing Ireland a number of years ago. This is the right way to go. The Minister of State is on the right path and I am fully behind him. The sooner this legislation is passed in both Houses, the better. The Minister of State may, I hope, be able to indicate when he expects Committee Stage to take place, if there is a timeline for it. There is no need to rush it because it is better to tease out the legislation and give all of us an opportunity to interact.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">I welcome the Minister of State. I also welcome this legislation which will serve to modernise the greyhound racing industry. That is very important, not only from an animal welfare point of view but to provide more governance appropriate to the times we are in. That is particularly the case since substantial Government funding goes into the greyhound industry. This year it is €16.8 million, which I welcome. It is fair to say, going back to 2014 when the then Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, commissioned the Indecon report, there were a number of issues not addressed in respect of governance and animal welfare. Many of them have been elaborated on. I am a member of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine. We got to hear witnesses setting out their concerns and giving their suggestions as to how issues could be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> Much work has been done. As has been mentioned, we have the report from the joint committee, after it heard the witnesses. The Indecon report rightly embraced all the stakeholders, in order that we could get a full picture as to how we were to go forward with the greyhound racing industry. More recently, we had the Morris report commissioned by Bord na gCon itself. It looked at issues on anti-doping and animals being medicated, which is an animal welfare issue as well as a competition issue. All of this is very healthy for the industry. That is the general import of my colleagues' contributions.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> It has already been said, but there is €16.8 million going into the greyhound industry this year. This is an industry that deserves investment. Now that we are updating the whole industry, it is important to reflect and communicate, because communication has been a problem and a concern at times for the public at large. Those issues have now had a light shone on them. It can be seen that we are now addressing them. In his report, Mr. Jim Power stated that between full-time and part-time jobs, there are 5,058 people employed in the industry. That has a spin-off of additional spending of €121 million. There are also 7,313 greyhound owners who derive some economic benefit from their involvement in the greyhound industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_510">That generates €135 million for the economy. That is a considerable number of people and it illustrates the depth of interest and passion. While some people derive an economic benefit from racing, I expect many are not making any money and it is more a labour of love. </p>
          <p eId="para_511"> In towns and areas with race courses, meetings provide a great boost for the local economy with many people attending them. It means a lot and is a great source of pride. While Mayo does not have a greyhound stadium, there is a horse racing course in Ballinrobe. The town benefits significantly and great work is put into maintaining the course so well. There is so much local activity when the race meetings happen. Greyhound racing provides a platform for people who love dogs and want to race them.</p>
          <p eId="para_512"> The Minister of State comprehensively set out the governance framework. We now know much more about corporate governance and what happens with boards when we do not have proper governance and how things can go wrong. Many lessons have been learned, not only in the greyhound sector but across the board. It is welcome to see these lessons being applied to Rásaíocht Con Éireann. It is also welcome that the legislation stipulates that there should be a gender balance. There will be more women on the new board, which is welcome. It also provides for more interface between the Minister and the board itself. It is more serendipitous, so to speak. </p>
          <p eId="para_513"> The Bill provides for regulation of the race tracks and the nuts and bolts of racing, which I welcome. There is considerable concern among the public regarding animal welfare. From what I see locally, breeders treat their dogs like princes, but we cannot rely on individuals or expect that animal welfare will be delivered on an <i>ad hoc </i>basis. There must be standards and regulations and the Bill provides for this. The vast majority treat animals very well, but there are people who have their own ideas. They have no concept of what it is to neglect or abuse an animal and they have no compunction about mistreating animals or show no concern when that happens. We must ensure that in an industry such as this animals are cared for in an appropriate manner and that animal welfare is central. We must also ensure we take steps to strengthen regulation to combat doping of animals. Traceability is welcome and this legislation reinforces that. </p>
          <p eId="para_514"> I welcome the legislation and look forward to it progressing through the Houses. I acknowledge all the stakeholders, individuals or organisations who have prepared reports or made inputs into the process. It has given a new impetus to the industry and it can be seen that there are many people who are serious about their business. They want everything to be done properly and now, through legislation, the Government will facilitate this and complement the welcome funding that has been provided.</p>

          <from>Senator Grace O'Sullivan<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T15:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_515">I thank the Minister of State for outlining the provisions of this Bill, which is welcome. It was only produced recently despite a long process, which led to its provisions and scheme being complied. It will proceed quickly. We are on Second Stage and Committee Stage is set for next week. I welcome this, as it demonstrates the Minister of State's determination and leadership. I wish we could see more of that when it comes to other legislation such as the Fossil Fuel Divestment Bill 2016, of which I spoke in the House yesterday.</p>
          <p eId="para_516"> This is an important Bill. It is an important industry in Ireland, but the welfare of the animals is also important. It was great to see the different stakeholders involved during the pre-legislative scrutiny and their evidence has led to the Bill as drafted. I am from Waterford where Kilcohan Park greyhound stadium has operated for years. It is a place of great community interest. </p>
          <p eId="para_517"> I welcome action from the Government on regulating an area of animal sporting life in Ireland that has so often been open to mismanagement and problems relating to welfare. Each step we take in changing the way the greyhound industry operates has usually led to an improvement in the welfare of the animals involved, but we must still be cognisant of animal welfare and still have a long way to go before we can be sure the sport is safe and free from cruelty and neglect.</p>
          <p eId="para_518"> I refer to a number of aspects of the Bill. Section 28 establishes a system of traceability for greyhounds, but the language is too voluntary. There is no provision for the greyhound board to collect and collate relevant data. This makes it difficult to assess the health, safety and welfare conditions of these animals.</p>
          <p eId="para_519"> The specific issue of export regulations and controls is not covered in this legislation. It seems that despite the fact that current exports must be authorised by the Department and the greyhound board, there are no publicly available figures on the total number of dogs exported, nor their destination. We need a whitelist of countries with strict animal welfare regimes that we are authorised to trade with without fear that doing so would endanger the animals involved. Such a system would lessen the burden of regulation falling on the Department and the board, with some inappropriate destinations being ruled out.</p>
          <p eId="para_520"> We are all well aware of some of the grotesque cruelty and neglect that takes place in some countries where greyhounds race, and that Irish dogs should be sold to these countries where their safety is not guaranteed is clearly a contradiction of the principles of this Bill and the concept of a fair level of animal welfare. I am reminded of the old adage, "What you can't see won't hurt you". This legislation sets us out in the right direction but it would be remiss of us not to consider the welfare of greyhounds should they be exported.</p>
          <p eId="para_521"> The amendment of section 28 to create an obligation rather than the option for the Minister to regulate in respect of transparency would be a small but important improvement to ensure the welfare of dogs can be accounted for throughout their lives. This lifetime protection of animals is also key. How greyhounds are treated in the latter years of their lives is often unfair and presents a burden to the taxpayer and those who give their time to work in voluntary shelters such as those run by the Dogs Trust, ISPCA, PAWS, Retired Greyhound Trust and Irish Blue Cross, instead of those that have profited from dogs during their lives. Plans and regulations for the retirement of dogs need to be put in place, and they need to be funded by the industry. That is only fair.</p>
          <p eId="para_522"> Other Civil Engagement Senators and I support this legislation so far.</p>
          <p eId="para_523">As I have indicated, however, there could be some strengthening of the legislation and we support any improvement in the general standard of care for greyhounds in Ireland. We cannot make a mockery of such controls by allowing the export of live animals to countries where there is no protection for them. We believe that is a shortcoming.</p>

          <from>Senator Paudie Coffey<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T16:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_524">I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this debate. I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, who I know is committed in this area. I commend him on bringing forward comprehensive legislation for the governance of the greyhound industry in Ireland. He covered in detail all of the sections of the Bill with regard to animal welfare, traceability and regulation. It is all leading to the modernisation and the renewal of the greyhound industry in Ireland. I am a greyhound owner and have been all my life, as have my family with track and coursing greyhounds. It is in the interest of owners and trainers to see a strong industry. That is important. Ireland has a world-class industry, where the standard of greyhound produced from here is recognised right around the world. Not only do we race them in Ireland, we have also exported top-class greyhounds to the UK, Australia and other locations around the world. To me, this says we are doing something right. There have been some issues, about which I will speak briefly, and there have been some legacy problems in the industry, but we should recognise the world-class ability of breeders and trainers to produce top-class greyhounds for Ireland and the world. As has been pointed out by the economist Mr. Jim Power, the industry leads to more than 5,000 jobs in the Irish economy and it contributes some €300 million in economic benefits to the State. Jim Power is a Waterford man, like myself, and comes from a traditional greyhound area in Glenaphouca, Whitestown, Clonea Power. I come from the neighbouring parish in Portlaw where the Droopys Stud is run by the Dunphy family. This is a world recognised breeding establishment in Ballyvalican, Portlaw, where top-class greyhounds come from. I want to recognise that it is not all bad news. We often hear the media headlines about the bad news about the greyhound industry, but it is important to highlight the positive news that world-class greyhounds are produced in Ireland by Irish people from our own communities.</p>
          <p eId="para_525"> I referred to the legacy issues. We have had doping scandals in the greyhound industry and this issue needs to be rooted out. We need to restore the integrity and the confidence to the sector. We have had governance issues where substantial debt was being raised and where taxpayers' money might not have been spent in the most effective or efficient way possible. We have also had animal welfare issues in the greyhound industry. This Bill presents a real opportunity for renewal in this area. I wish the new chairman of the Irish Greyhound Board, Mr. Frank Nyhan, well. I also wish the new chief executive officer of the board Mr. Gerard Dollard well. I wish the Minister of State well in that regard. There is a new strategic plan and it has been well consulted. It is ambitious for the industry and will mean change and reform, but, with the Bill, this will present opportunities to strengthen the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_526"> On governance, the Bill provides for an increase in the board numbers from six to eight members, and that the chairman can only stay for a maximum of a five-year term, which I believe is good. Any member will only be able to spend two maximum terms on the board. This measure will bring motivation and a sense of renewal to the board in how it governs, which is important. This board is responsible for proper governance, oversight and accountability in the Irish greyhound industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_527"> I welcome Senator Paul Daly's earlier comments on Fianna Fáil support for the budget. I also support the horse and greyhound fund, which is now seeing incremental increases and it is back to €16.8 million for 2019. I support this horse and greyhound fund on behalf of the Fine Gael Party. It is important. It has been an easy target for some populist parties in the past when they have tried to reduce that fund. We have, however, heard of the economic benefits of this to the area. While the sale of the Harold's Cross stadium was controversial, it has produced a surplus of €6 million that needs to be invested in resolving debt and invested in sustaining the future of the greyhound industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_528"> The owners and the trainers are the foundation of the industry. The breeders and the racegoers need to be supported. I come from Waterford, which has a very traditional track in Kilcohan Park. It has had its challenges. I put it to the Minister of State, to the departmental officials, to the board members and to all of those in authority in the greyhound industry, to visit the tracks, attend a night's racing, meet the stakeholders, the trainers, the breeders and the regular racegoers. These are the people who support the industry and the way to connect and engage with them is to listen to them. This is how we will identify ways such as in the strategic plan to sustain the greyhound industry. That is something I want to support. We need to represent the social side of the sport to the Irish public. People enjoy a good night racing at the greyhounds. We have some excellent calendar dates: the Derby Final at Shelbourne Park; the St. Leger in Limerick; the Laurels in Cork; and the Red Mills Waterford Masters. These are all excellent race nights out for any racegoer and we need to encourage more of that and support the industry. The Minister of State's Bill will go a long way in trying to develop it.</p>

          <p eId="para_529">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Andrew Doyle, and the comprehensive Bill he has provided for us to discuss. I worked on the Horse Racing Ireland Act, which also went through a long process. Is there much of a repeal of the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, which is the basic Act that will be taken over by this new Bill? One key point, as noted by Senator Coffey, is the change of board membership from seven to nine members. In fairness, in 1958 they actually clearly stated what the chairman could or could not be. The 1958 Act clearly states: "The chairman of the Board shall not be beneficially interested in the ownership, control or operation of greyhound race tracks, the holding or conduct of public sales of greyhounds or the training of greyhounds for reward or in bookmaking". We do not see any such provision in the Bill about what the chairman is or is not to do. It does not give any detail; it is just very broad as to what the Minister would do.</p>
          <p eId="para_530"> With regard to the nine board members, when we worked on the Horse Racing Ireland Act, we included in the legislation the provision for all the various sectors within the horse racing industry who could be on the board of Horse Racing Ireland. The Bill provides that it is up to the Minister to decide who is to be in the legislation. In his own words, could the Minister of State tell the House whom he would like to see on the greyhound board? Perhaps he might give us an indication. If so, would he consider including in the legislation the provision for certain sectors that are heavily involved in the greyhound industry to be included on the board, for example, the Irish greyhound owners and breeders associations? These are the organisations that are contributing because it is the owners who pay the fees to participate in the races. Perhaps the Minister of State will outline whom the Minister might consider to be put on the board and put specifics into the legislation, as we did with the Horse Racing Ireland Act whereby owners, trainers and people were included in order that they could then be identified clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_531"> I have alluded to the chairman and what he or she can and cannot do, and that it is quite ambiguous in the Bill. On the finance side, the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 said that the board shall not borrow more than "twenty-five thousand pounds" without the "concurrence" of the Minister. This Bill does not have that provision. The Bill should give some leeway to the board to borrow money without running cap in hand to the Minister. The Bill could include some figure - be it € 2 million or €5 million or whatever - in order that the board does not have to keep coming into the Department to make sure they are okay with spending. I am aware there were issues on the overspend, especially on the track in Limerick, which caused financial problems for the board.</p>
          <p eId="para_532"> One of my pet hates is the totalisator - the tote - but it is actually run well in the Irish Greyhound Board. Perhaps the Minister of State might look at this again and I could speak to him about it when the Bill is brought back for the next Stage.</p>
          <p eId="para_533">The word I am hearing on the street is that there are problems associated with the testing facility in Limerick. Will the Minister of State have a look at that, as well as the costs associated with testing?</p>
          <p eId="para_534"> I would like to see the board report to the agriculture committee on a regular basis without the CEO because most of the time when a CEO comes in with a board or a chairman of a board, the prompts from the CEO help the chairman of the board. If the chairperson is as good as he or she says, and the board members are good, they should have a knowledge of the industry. I request that the Minister of State arranges for the board to appear before the committee without the CEO.</p>
          <p eId="para_535"> The 1958 Act was easily read and understood because of the language that was used. I wish to read a sentence from section 15(1) of the Bill:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_536">The members of the Board may appoint an officer of the Board to be the chief executive officer and the chief executive officer shall carry on, manage and control generally the administration and business of the Board, advise the board of the Board in relation to the performance of its functions and perform such other functions as may be determined by the board of the Board as it considers necessary for the efficient and effective operation of the industry having regard to the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies.</p>
          <p eId="para_537">It is one sentence, but I had to read it three or four times to get my head around it. The language of legislation is for the legal profession. Legislators are mostly ordinary fellas and gals who try to work in simple English. When can we get legislation in the language of the ordinary people and not of the legal profession?</p>
          <p eId="para_538"> There is one equine sport that has still not been legislated for, which people seem to be scared to go near, namely, trotting. It might not come under the Minister of State's brief, but he might discuss it with the Minister. We need to do something about it. It is unregulated, there are many issues with it, and we need to do something about it. I know that State funds are being requested, but I would be nervous about doing something like that because I am worried about that industry.</p>

          <from>Senator Ray Butler<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T16:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_539">I welcome the Minister of State and this long-overdue Bill. I have been involved in the breeding of greyhounds and the greyhound industry all of my life. It is the best breeding industry we have in this country and Irish greyhounds are raced all over the world. Between full-time and part-time trainers in the greyhound industry, approximately 10,000 to 10,500 people are involved countrywide.</p>
          <p eId="para_540"> Many tracks have closed down in the past five, ten or 15 years, which is sad. The bookmakers' afternoon greyhound service, BAGS, meetings are the new show in town, and they are a lifeline to tracks because they can get anything between €5,000, €8,000 and €10,000 per meeting for showing pictures. I worry about them, however, being overly favourable to or run by big bookmakers. I am not talking about the small man who comes in with a satchel but rather the big multinational companies that come in and throw out their rules and regulations about how many times a dog can run or what kind of greyhounds are running on the tracks. Lower-grade greyhounds are being kept to run these BAGS meetings and, in certain cases when one tries to look at the races and the race meetings, God himself would not come down and pick the winners. It is welcome as a lifeline but we should not let these multinational corporations come in and start running the industry. They are welcome, but there must have governance.</p>
          <p eId="para_541"> Although I did not welcome the sale of Harold's Cross stadium, we have moved on. It is welcome that there is extra money, that the debt will finally be paid off and that we have €6 million to put into doing up Shelbourne Park, I hope, because it needs a lick of paint and a restructuring. I would like to see money being spent on other tracks around the country, not least in Mullingar where there was a fire escape in the building which was up to standard a couple of years ago but when it applied for a late licence, the fire officer nearly closed down the whole place. They are now restricted to 120 or 150 people per meeting, which is sad and has a huge impact. The board has promised money, but that money is in the clouds. I wish it would come down from the clouds to allow us get it up and running and get the job done in order that people can be attracted to the track again. It should have been done for this Christmas because the Christmas trade now takes up approximately 60% of the total turnover of the year. It is huge and I would have liked to see it being done before now.</p>
          <p eId="para_542"> During the years I have noted that people who are employed in the industry get somewhat indoctrinated. It is as if they say that now they are in the job they will just go with the <i>status quo</i>. We need to push on and push out boundaries to get more people coming through the doors like in the good years of the Celtic tiger when people came through for charity meetings. We have lost that impetus of the charity meeting and we need to advertise it. My local track is Mullingar, and if one asked someone about that track in Trim, where I live, the majority of people would not even know about it even though it is only 30 minutes down the road. We should get people out there on the road in all areas, such as Munster and Leinster, advertising the greyhound industry and the tracks for charity meetings. Many people are stuck in offices for five or six days a week looking out the window when they could be telling schools, GAA clubs or various fundraising charity organisations that they have a product for sale, that they want the organisations to come, and that special offers will be made in order that the charities or organisations will benefit.</p>
          <p eId="para_543"> I welcome the governance in the Bill of doping and breeding, but the legislation on doping is not strong enough. Governance committees are set up, but the fines do not fit the crime. Giving somebody a €500, €1,000 or €1,500 fine for doping dogs is not enough. Anyone found to be doping dogs should be struck out, gone and banned for life. On breeding and its governance, any unauthorised people who breed in back sheds and are caught doing so should also be banned, as should anybody responsible for any cruelty or suffering caused to the animal. </p>
          <p eId="para_544"> Some 90% of all the dogs which race in Great Britain are Irish-bred. The need for passports, clearance from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and injections such as rabies jabs to get one's dogs into England has increased the expenditure on breeding. This should be looked at so the breeder would get some little allowance for exporting his or her dog, as long as it is done correctly and to the right countries which have proper governance of greyhounds. It is welcome that all dogs are microchipped, but it is expensive to have an ordinary vet to get one's dog microchipped.</p>

We had a scheme in the 1990s that worked well, where if one kept a brood bitch and raced her for ten races, one received IR£150, while if one kept her for another ten races, one received IR£300. If that bitch produced a litter of pups, the owner received IR£300 when the pups were on the ground. We must implement something like that for the industry to get breeding going again because there is a shortage of dogs.</p>
          <p eId="para_547">I thank the Minister of State for coming. I welcome the Bill. I will contribute further on it when it returns to the House.</p>

          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine (Deputy Andrew Doyle)<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T16:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_548">I thank all Members for their contributions and positive engagement and the general welcome and support they expressed for this legislation. I share the anxiety and desire to have the legislation enacted as soon as possible, as I have done since I was given responsibility for the greyhound sector. I appreciate that the industry has a long and traditional connection with many urban and rural parts of the country. The industry is held dearly in the hearts of many communities. I have experienced the odd night of greyhound racing in my role as Minister of State. Therefore, I have witnessed the joy and ecstasy experienced by families and people from villages. Such joy, especially when the underdog wins, is something to behold. </p>
          <p eId="para_549"> Some Members have referenced operational issues and policies. Senator Lawlor referred to membership and I take the point made about the HRI. What we are trying to do is underpin the sector with modern fit-for-purpose legislation. Our ultimate aim is to have robust legislation to rebuild - let us be honest - the reputation of the industry in order that one can have charitable events, engagement and, without fear or favour, promote the sector for fundraising and charity events in the knowledge that governance, integrity and welfare have all been dealt with comprehensively. </p>
          <p eId="para_550"> The strategic plan has been mentioned, which is important. Some people have a difficulty with the betting tax. If we are going to continue to increase both the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund then we must demonstrate that it is self-financing, which it more or less will be though that tax. It is not just those sectors that are supported by the betting tax, which will increase to the rate it was 12 or 15 years ago.</p>
          <p eId="para_551"> There has been a focus in the debate on the three issues of doping integrity, welfare and governance. All of them have been comprehensively dealt with in the Bill. We have taken a long time. There has been a lot of toing and froing with the Office of the Attorney General about some of the sanctions and penalties and it took time to place some of the responsibilities of the board on a statutory footing.</p>
          <p eId="para_552"> Money is referenced because there are still powers and competence. Section 15 allows the board to delegate to the CEO certain functions in order that the board does not micromanage. The CEO must report back to the board at all times. I do not know the logistics of the board. It will be the first time that any chairman has ever to come before a board without the support of the officials. There is no precedent for that but I do not expect that will be the case. </p>
          <p eId="para_553"> Regarding board appointees and the chairman, every appointment must be approved through the PAS and candidates must have a certain competence. On Committee Stage, we can consider cross-representation. Based on my experience of the work done on the HRI legislation during pre-legislative scrutiny, we included in our recommendations at the time that the stable staff would have a nominee on the board. The recommendation was taken on board in the final draft of the legislation. </p>
          <p eId="para_554"> It is my ambition to have this legislation through both Houses before this session concludes. We have scheduled Committee Stage to be taken in the House next Tuesday when I will be happy to comprehensively deal with any amendments that are tabled. I appreciate the concerns expressed by Senator Grace O'Sullivan. I can deal with the white list. EU law determines all exports from the EU. We would certainly not support, in so far as our statute allows us, exporting to any countries that do not have welfare as a priority. However, we cannot control secondary exports where some country decides to export to another country that is not on a white list, if it were prepared. Such a situation is beyond our control. I ask the Senator to bear that in mind in respect of the limitations of this Bill in that general area. </p>
          <p eId="para_555"> I again thank all of the Members. In particular, I thank the members of the joint committee for the work that they did as part of pre-legislative scrutiny. In 2016 I was Chairman of that committee and we prepared a report on foot of hearings at the time. The process has been long, but it has been worthwhile because the legislation will assist the industry in rebuilding its reputation, and becoming an industry one can be involved in or enjoy in the full knowledge that everything that needed to be taken care of in the context of welfare and integrity has been addressed and catered for.</p>

          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_561">I move amendment No. 1:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_562">In page 3, line 12, to delete "traveller" and substitute "Traveller".</p>
          <p eId="para_563">I welcome the newly appointed Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, to his first week in the job, or first week in school as it were. I acknowledge the work of his predecessor, Deputy Bruton, whose support was evident in the progressing of this Bill. We have many visitors from the Traveller community here today because this is a significant event since the recognition of Traveller ethnicity.</p>
          <p eId="para_564"> This amendment proposes to capitalise the "t" in Traveller in this section and throughout the Bill. This is an important adjustment to a simple drafting error, a necessary and important rectification.</p>
          <p eId="para_565"> On 1 March 2017, the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, said in Dáil Éireann, "I now wish formally to recognise Travellers as a distinct ethnic group within the Irish nation." In that same speech, the then Taoiseach acknowledged, "Our Traveller community is an integral part of our society for over 1,000 years, with its own distinct identity – people within our people." The same sentiment was echoed by Deputy Micheál Martin, leader of Fianna Fáil, during the debate on Traveller recognition on 1 March 2017 in Dáil Éireann. He said, "As recent research and work has shown, Travellers have been a distinct part of our history for as long as written records exist."</p>
          <p eId="para_566"> Since March 2017, Travellers have been formally recognised by the State as a distinct ethnic group, Ireland's only indigenous ethnic group. The inclusion of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum of Irish primary and post-primary schools is a logical and necessary continuation of the State's historic recognition of Traveller ethnicity. It is surprising that Traveller culture and history is not already taught, and taught well, in schools. Listening to the recent ill-informed, ignorant, insulting, ill-advised, and close enough to incitement, remarks of a presidential candidate about the recognition of Traveller ethnicity, mercifully at 1% in opinion polls for the presidential election, these dangerous remarks are yet another argument and reason for Traveller culture and history to be taught and taught well in our schools, for all of us, including those who would be our President, our Head of State. I know on what side of history I want to be. I know that I prefer to align with, not attack, the least powerful and most marginalised, and not side with the rich and the millionaires. I understand the presidential candidate in question, Peter Casey, made further comments this afternoon. He should consider withdrawing from the race.</p>
          <p eId="para_567"> Last week Dr. Karl Kitching, an educationist and director of equality at UCC, said at an Oireachtas briefing held on this Bill that it was difficult to overstate the historic importance of the proposed amendments to the Education Act that the Traveller Culture and History in Education Bill would bring to all children in all schools. He also spoke about the impact of the Bill on young Travellers at school with worryingly low levels of educational completion and attainment. The numbers really are striking. Secondary school completion among young female Travellers stands at 13%, as opposed to almost 70% in the general population, while only 167 Travellers have ever completed third level education out of a population of 40,000 people. Dr. Kitching said that in the school curriculum, young Travellers rarely see or hear narratives about their lives that are not paternalistic. I would go further in that Travellers rarely see or hear narratives which are not negative, inaccurate or even downright prejudiced, as the recent remarks of a presidential candidate confirm.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> At the same Oireachtas briefing last week, Hannagh McGinley, a Traveller, a mother, a teacher and PhD candidate at NUIG, spoke about the fact that Traveller children's literacy and numeracy were behind those of their settled peers. She said we could not improve their maths and literacy if we did not improve their overall well-being and sense of self. She added that if we did not instil a sense of pride in them, then everything else was a waste of time.</p>
          <p eId="para_569"> The mainstreaming of Traveller culture and history in the curriculum, taught well of course, is key. Dr. Kitching cited relevant international precedents in curricula development in New Zealand, Australia and Ontario, Canada, and successful examples of where states have mandated the teaching of indigenous contributions, histories, cultures and perspectives across primary and secondary curricula. He concluded his presentation by underlining his support for the Bill. He said that we need to deeply recognise what Travellers have to teach and contribute to the settled majority in society because the story of Travellers in school is engaging the story of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_570"> Dr. David Edwards, an historian at UCC, also speaking at last week's Oireachtas briefing on this Bill, emphasised this point too. He said Travellers were among the oldest of the Irish and the last vestiges of an old, Gaelic, tribal society. He added that during the Middle Ages, the Irish were a semi-nomadic, pastoral people but that this way of life was knocked sideways by the imposition of direct English rule with its insistence on a sedentary life in the 16th and 17th centuries. He said the majority of the Irish population today is an acknowledgement of the success of the English plantation project while the Travellers resisted, stayed on the margins and managed to retain a semblance of the old way of life. In Dr. Edwards's view it would be quite easy to incorporate the story of Travellers into the history of Ireland because it is, in many ways, the story of Ireland. I am sure Dr. Edwards would be available to give a history lesson to the presidential candidate and to give him some background of which he ill-advisedly speaks.</p>

        <speech by="#LynnRuane" eId="spk_321">
          <from>Senator Lynn Ruane<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:00:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_571">I support the amendment to capitalise the "t" in Traveller. We also need to capitalise Travellers in general in terms of their knowledge, their understanding and their contribution. We need to acknowledge their cultural and social capital and the history they have brought to Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_572">Today I heard the comments of the presidential candidate, Mr. Peter Casey. I do not want the debate today to focus on him, but his comments signify the ignorance that is still to be fouind in this society; that he felt it was okay to make those remarks. If we were talking about people of another race or ethnic origin, he would be called quite clearly a racist. We need to come out very strongly and say that his remarks were clear discrimination and racism against a very important part of our community and society.</p>
          <p eId="para_573"> The reason the Bill is so important and why it is so important for me as someone who is not from the Traveller community is that I can understand my own history because our history is Traveller history too. I teach in NUI Maynooth on a Monday. It is an Access programme which allows students to enter and diversify the teaching profession. It was the former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, who introduced the funding for the PATH 1 programmes and this comes under that programme heading, which is a really important initiative. </p>
          <p eId="para_574"> I realise I must have internalised something because of my lack of education around Travellers. What I internalised was a fear of talking about Travellers in a setting, or a fear of attempting to tell their story for them. This became really obvious to me in the past few weeks because I have a young Traveller girl in the class and when we are talking about oppression, poverty and lack of education, I have not once said the word "Traveller". Why am I afraid to say the word "Traveller"? This is something that should be celebrated, but I am afraid to draw attention to this wonderful young girl in the classroom. That comes out of some fear inside me of what may happen if attention is turned to her and she is on her own in that classroom and nobody else understands the history, culture and importance of her presence in that room. We as teachers and politicians have missed out. Travellers not only miss out by not being able to be fully active in society, but we miss out by not having Travellers fully participate in our society. We are missing out by not having them in that space with us. </p>
          <p eId="para_575"> When I heard Peter Casey, I thought of the four county councils who put their weight behind him. Are those four county councils going to come out and completely reject his comments on the Traveller community? They should do so. Every Senator in this House that has connections with those local authorities should reject his comments and ask their county council to reject his claims, the discrimination and the hate cited by him.</p>
          <p eId="para_576"> I hope the new Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, will be a champion of this legislation. We have recognised Traveller ethnicity and that is for nothing if we do not have policy initiatives. These policy initiatives are the least we can do in terms of making it up to the Traveller community. The State destroyed the Traveller community and its participation in a way of life. It destroyed their identity and rejected them. We forced Travellers into situations where they had to descend on cities and could not travel or carry on their identity. We forced them to reject their identity. We owe it to them to not only introduce legislation to reject any racism that comes from any person with a public platform-----</p>

          <p eId="para_583">I welcome the Minister, Deputy McHugh, and congratulate him on his appointment. I compliment Senators Kelleher, Ruane and Grace O'Sullivan on bringing forward this Bill. It is very important legislation. I am aware that the former Minister, Deputy Bruton, had asked the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, for reports. I am aware that Bill is pending also. The Bills will be complementary, but we do not know what will come out of the NCCA Bill.</p>
          <p eId="para_584"> I also pay tribute to the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Stanton, who has been doing tremendous work in terms of Traveller authenticity. I served for ten years on the Traveller consultative group when I was a member of the local authority. I had a great deal of interaction and made good friends with people who originally came from the Traveller community, some of whom went on to college and others became role models for their community. I know of one man who through sport and education became a role model for Travellers. He left school at an early stage but through his involvement with Pavee Point and a teacher from his school days who encouraged him to return to education, he went back to education and educated himself and his wife. His children are in education and one of his children is doing the leaving certificate examination this year. Though his involvement in sport and education he has worked with many in the Traveller community who live near him and he has been a fantastic role model for them.</p>
          <p eId="para_585"> That really fits into what the Senators are proposing in the Bill. It is about encouragement, participation and getting involved. Education plays a significant role. I can understand the reason we give the word "Traveller" a capital letter. There is so much heritage and culture associated with Travellers and that was very much to the fore. The Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, was in Limerick recently on the day a report was being launched on the culture and background of Travellers. It was a fantastic day. There were more than 200 people there, though not all were originally from the Traveller community but had connections to them. It was a positive report and I know that representatives from Pavee Point were there also. It was all about inclusivity. </p>
          <p eId="para_586"> I welcome the Bill and support it overall. We have to work together towards furthering not only education but bringing everybody with us. It is also about inclusivity.</p>

          <from>Senator Frances Black<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:10:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_587">I welcome the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy McHugh, to the Chamber. I join my colleagues in wishing him well and the very best of luck in his new role. Education and skills in an enormously important brief and has a significant impact on the shape of our society and the values we hold. I see the Bill as a clear recognition of that fact. I assure the Acting Chairman that as we are on Committee Stage, I will speak only to the amendment which I see as very important. </p>
          <p eId="para_588"> When the Bill was first debated in the Chamber on 11 July, I was also introducing a Bill and was not able to speak at that point. I warmly welcome the Bill and commend Senator Kelleher, fellow Senators and the team who have been involved, the individuals and civil society groups who worked so hard on it. I am so proud to support them.</p>
          <p eId="para_589"> I will now address amendment No. 1. As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality, I will never forget the meetings we held in 2016 where the delegate who made presentations to the committee were people who worked with and were members of the Traveller community. Those presentations were so powerful and one could hear the passion from people as to why recognition of Traveller ethnicity was so important symbolically and as a concrete step towards real equality and inclusion. I was delighted to support the call for recognition at the time and was proud to be there in March 2017 when the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, took the historic step of formally recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group in the Irish nation.</p>
          <p eId="para_590"> The amendment to the Bill is an extension of that spirit. It is not just about capitalising a letter "t" for drafting sake, it is about making sure recognition is explicit in everything we do. We are stating very clearly that the Traveller community is a valued and cherished part of Irish identity. We are making the point that if we talk about Irish history and culture, Traveller history and culture is central to it.</p>
          <p eId="para_591">It has been pushed to the margins and stigmatised but, through a meaningful and inclusive education system, we can change that. We can begin to transform attitudes throughout society and tackle the discrimination and racism that sadly are still to be found, as we have seen today and about which my colleague, Senator Ruane, spoke very clearly.</p>
          <p eId="para_592"> I think most about the impact this measure can have on schools and on how they welcome young members of the Traveller community. Speaking at a briefing this week, Dr. Karl Kitching from University College Cork stated Traveller young people rarely saw themselves represented in the media in a positive way and, indeed, children across the country were not given the opportunity to connect with realistic and positive narratives of Travellers' lives. That is what we are trying to change. Can one imagine the difference it would make for young Travellers and their classmates if we could begin to dismantle the us-and-them mentality that has been present in our society for too long? In a real republic, the classroom should be an inclusive and a welcoming place. This is a really important step towards that. Dr. Kitching went on to refer to research from Stanford University on the knock-on effects of such a change and how it could help to tackle dropout rates and increase academic progression. As he noted, it is difficult to progress academically in a certain environment when one does not feel one belongs.</p>
          <p eId="para_593"> I am working with the Traveller community as part of a RISE Foundation programme we run every Friday. My experience of this community is mind-blowing. The women working in the group are almost warrior women. Their power and passion for their families, children and grandchildren are just unbelievable. I will never forget the excitement among them two weeks ago when there was talk of this legislation being introduced. They were coming in asking, "Oh my God, did you hear the news, did you hear the news?" The rumour that people would be talking about and teaching their culture in schools generated such excitement among them because they believed and hoped that, at last, their culture would be respected. Their culture is so important to them. It is part of their identity. We can learn from the Traveller community. We can learn so much about how powerful they are and what they have to go through living in an environment where they are subjected to what is almost racism. That is really what it is. That is why they are so strong and empowered. They really do stick together.</p>
          <p eId="para_594"> This legislation is a matter of tackling stigma, marginalisation and discrimination. I commend the Bill to the House. I am proud to support it and the amendments proposed by my colleague, Senator Kelleher. I really hope the Minister will support us today. I really hope, for sake of the Traveller community, that what has been outlined becomes a realistic theme for it because it would be absolutely fantastic.</p>

          <from>Senator Pádraig Mac Lochlainn<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:20:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_595">This is my first public opportunity to congratulate my colleague from Donegal, Deputy McHugh, on his appointment as Minister for Education and Skills. I have known him for a long time. While we do not agree on everything, I have a lot of regard for him personally. He is a very sincere, decent person. I have no doubt that, in the light of the very welcome statement of his predecessor, he will implement the legislation in the spirit in which it is intended.</p>
          <p eId="para_596"> Mr. Peter Casey resides on the Inishowen Peninsula, where I am from. He has been widely condemned, and rightly so, but let us not fool ourselves. He said out loud what a very significant section of public representatives in this country privately believe but do not say out loud, although some have done so in the past. A very significant number of public representatives across this country share Mr. Casey's views. Those views are ignorant and demonstrate ignorance of Irish history.</p>
          <p eId="para_597"> In the recent briefing organised by Senator Kelleher, an historian was present who made a number of very important points that all Irish people need to understand. They need to understand their own history. Irish Traveller culture dates back thousands of years. Travellers have continued with the nomadic ways. All our ancestors were nomadic. They lived lives aligned with cows and other livestock. They moved up to the mountains and down to the pastures at different times of the year. They moved from place to place, overseen by chieftains. That is ancient Gaelic civilisation. We are a nomadic people. Those are our Irish roots. These roots reflect the roots of almost every civilisation in the world. The Traveller people have continued that tradition. That is what makes them a distinct ethnic group that we should value and cherish. I refer not only to their nomadic lifestyle but also to their association with Irish traditional music and Irish traditions. They maintain dearly a connection with our ancestors in a way that the rest of us no longer maintain.</p>
          <p eId="para_598"> To live a settled life was to embrace new ways. In Ireland, we were colonised. Increasingly over the years, those of us who settled were adapting to an English or European lifestyle and leaving behind the old ways. It is tragically ironic that the political leaders in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s, who presided over the new State that was apparently free from oppression of colonialism, went on to lead us to the Commission on Itinerancy, which produced one of the most appalling reports in the history of this State. It basically criminalised and demonised the Irish Traveller way of life. The political leaders to whom I refer would actually have regarded themselves as nationalists. As I said at the briefing, they would have championed the O'Neills, O'Donnells and the ancient Gaelic civilisation, and they would have sung songs about these. They would have told the tragic story of the flight of the earls from Lough Swilly, which is in my county and that of the Minister and the loss of the earls' civilisation. They were criminalising the very people who adhered to the old ways of Gaelic times. That is the reality of our history. That is why the Bill is so important. It is actually a beautiful story. It is a tragic story but it is a story with which we need to reconnect. By doing that, we give true value to Travellers' lives, particularly those of Traveller children across this island.</p>
          <p eId="para_599"> I yearn for the truth to be told in schools. I yearn for children to be told the true story of Irish Traveller people in order that they may love and embrace the culture Travellers held on to dearly in addition to their own history, truth and story. By doing so, we could end the horror Traveller children have faced. Traveller children have grown up with being bullied and called knackers, tinkers and dirt throughout the decades. Adults, privately in their own so-called polite society, have held conversations reflecting such thinking. What Peter Casey did in his ignorance was say out loud what many believe privately. That is the truth; let us not deny it. That is why the Bill is so important. The day of the recognition of ethnicity was an amazing and a powerful day. The people behind me fought long for it. I refer to the activists and leaders of the Irish Traveller community. The steps taken will not be enough, however, unless we continue to reverse the decades of ignorance. If we can teach children the truth of our history and celebrate the Irish Traveller tradition and Travellers' immense and true contribution to our island, all Traveller children can in ten or 20 years be truly proud of who they are, where they come from and how they held on to the old ways - the honourable ways of our people. Most of them are proud already.</p>
          <p eId="para_600">I thank Senator Kelleher and the Minister. I have no doubt that he will uphold the statement of his predecessor as Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, and implement this legislation to make sure history is taught in schools. I refer to reversing all the years of ignorance and nonsense in order that in future generations we will not have another Peter Casey, or some other politician, with these private views and that we will see the light instead of darkness.</p>

          <from>Senator Robbie Gallagher<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_601">Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCathaoirleach-Ghníomhach. Ba mhaith liom fáilte mhór a chur roimh an Aire, an Teachta McHugh go dtí an Teach seo inniu. Ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh leis as an bpost nua atá aige freisin. I welcome the Minister and congratulate him on his appointment. It is good to see someone promoted from a Border county and particularly someone from my own native county of Donegal. I sincerely wish him well. I also extend a warm welcome to the people in the Visitors Gallery. They are very welcome to this discussion on this important issue. I also congratulate Senator Kelleher and her colleagues on bringing forward this legislation. It is disappointing that it has to be done, but it is necessary. I compliment them on it.</p>
          <p eId="para_602"> From a Fianna Fáil perspective, we fully support the Bill, as we did on Second Stage. We look forward to the Bill travelling swiftly through the Houses. I have no doubt that the Minister will follow in his predecessor's footsteps by ensuring this legislation passes in both Houses without delay. It is sad that we have to bring this forward. I note the comments of my colleague, Senator Mac Lochlainn, on the remarks made by one of the presidential candidates this afternoon. I hope the picture is not as bleak as he has painted it. The people will have the opportunity and time to make their own decision in that regard. I am confident they will do the right thing.</p>
          <p eId="para_603"> When we talk about any section of our society, it is important that every child, regardless of his or her background or history, have an equal opportunity to achieve all he or she wants and all he or she is capable of in life. By bringing the Bill forward and, as Senator Mac Lochlainn outlined, by creating a platform where people can educate themselves about the history of the Traveller movement, perhaps there might be better understanding of their journey and what they had to undertake to get this far. Much has been said by my colleagues in the House on this issue and I will not repeat all that has been said. We, in Fianna Fáil, fully support this Bill. It is unusual, if I can use that term, to bring in legislation to facilitate this. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, would normally facilitate this goal, as the previous speaker mentioned. Either way, however, that is a technicality and the main thing is that we all speak with one voice on this issue. We all want to see this legislation brought through as quickly as possible in order that the comments to which Senator Mac Lochlainn referred will be very much in the past.</p>

          <from>Senator John Dolan<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_604">I am delighted to welcome the Minister, Deputy McHugh, to the Upper House. I wish him the very best. He will I hope have plenty of time to put his feet under the desk and get to grips with a really important brief in the Department of Education and Skills. I thank Senator Kelleher for having the drive, energy and guts to push on with this Bill and to be able to involve others and get support across the House. I welcome everyone in the Visitors Gallery. Education and prejudice, it is easy. Senator Mac Lochlainn put his finger on something very pertinent. Many people - I cannot say I am not one of them or have not been one of them; we need to be honest about this - carry easy prejudice and at times we all do. People hold views and it is important to challenge them, but to challenge respectfully. Education is a powerful tool, as is the symbolism of this Bill. We know the power of symbolism on this island for good and ill. This Bill is a symbol and from it will come discourse, learning and sharing about identity, background and the contributions people can make.</p>
          <p eId="para_605"> I was working in a polling station back in the early 1980s when we had a slew of elections. I was somewhere on the northside of Dublin, in Coolock or that area. This woman arrived into the door, stood there foursquare and asked "Where do I vote for Charlie Haughey as he got me my tigín?" She was a Traveller woman and could not write, but she was doing something other people would not have got out of bed to do that morning. She was coming to vote. She understood the political process and the importance of it and that there was a value in it. I said to myself, "I hope she is not coming to my table." We were not allowed to coach people. The big problem was as Cathal Ó hEachaidh was not a candidate in that constituency, how was I going to square that one? We had a Coolock solution to a Coolock problem and the woman was satisfied she got to vote for candidates that would have been her preference.</p>
          <p eId="para_606"> Somebody with that strength of purpose and that strength in herself did not give a damn. She was there to vote, she had a preference and she wanted to share it. I have never forgotten the power of that moment that morning. I suppose the woman had never been to a school. I refer to not just going to school but being in school as an equal.</p>
          <p eId="para_607"> The point I want to make is about prejudice. People will point to all sorts of things that Travellers do - crime, this, that and the other. We all do crime, this, that and the other. It is an issue in any society. We all have to face up to that. It is not true to say all people do that or a class of people do that. There is a more benign way to talk about it. I have been involved in the area of disability for 40 years. People used to say disabled people could not do this and could not do that. That was a prejudice that has had to be ground down and filed away slowly. The Bill is a new file or rasp to slowly, day by day, year by year, file away the roots of prejudice.</p>
          <p eId="para_608"> I have previously mentioned and spoken about the Nazis. They made 300,000 disabled people, of whom we know, disappear. They made countless thousands of people who were nomadic travellers and gypsies disappear. All that was be done for one simple reason. Strip people of their dignity and basic humanity and one can do whatever the hell one likes with them the next day. It took the Nazis a decade. They had to bring in the Nuremberg Laws to strip the humanity and dignity from people of the Jewish faith. They did not have to do that for people who were homosexual, travellers, gypsies or disabled.</p>
          <p eId="para_609"> There is something really big at play. I do not say that in a negative but in a positive way. This legislation is gold dust. It can go right to the heart of supporting children and families from the Traveller community and the wider community.</p>
          <p eId="para_610">Of course, there is prejudice, but we must try to check ourselves on a daily basis and not denigrate groups of people.</p>
          <p eId="para_611"> I thank my parents. I remember Travellers coming to our door while we were having dinner and my parents inviting them in. Their attitude meant that I did not see a difference between us and Travellers. I remember an elderly farmer who lived near us and dealt in ponies and so on. On one occasion when returning from making hay we passed a Traveller camp. He knew the Travellers and we went in. That was the first time I sat around a campfire. I was only a young boy and found it very exciting. He chatted to them and they chatted to him. I am grateful to have had those two experiences because I could have had two very different ones which might have set me on a different course. I will not suggest what such experiences might have been as all present know to what I refer.</p>
          <p eId="para_612"> This is a powerful issue. We should not underestimate the life and death value of celebrating people and their dignity and helping to heal the intergenerational wounds that a group of people carry in their hearts and which can be so easily opened by a simple remark on the street or in public.</p>
          <p eId="para_613"> I thank Senator Kelleher for bringing forward the Bill. I wish the Minister every success. It is wonderful to see the Gallery full of people who have a great stake in this issue and the future of what should be a true republic for everybody.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#NiallODonnghaile" eId="spk_332">
          <from>Senator Niall Ó Donnghaile<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_614">Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as a bheith linn agus cosúil le achan duine eile déanaim comhghairdeas leis as an bpost nua. Go n-éirí go geal leis ann. I welcome the Minister and, like other Senators, congratulate him on his appointment.</p>
          <p eId="para_615"> I commend Senator Kelleher on the Bill before us on Committee Stage. As all Members know, she is a strong champion of and advocate for the marginalised, disenfranchised and those who in many instances have been forced onto the fringes of our society. I stated last week on Second Stage of the Mental Health (Capacity To Consent To Treatment) Bill brought forward by Senator Devine that it and legislation such as this Bill proved what an active, experienced, committed and passionate Seanad with Members of the calibre of Senator Kelleher could do. The Bill appears to have the support it will need. This Chamber is a great platform for initiating and contributing to the necessary debates which must happen in the public arena.</p>
          <p eId="para_616"> As other Members have mentioned, events in the past 24 hours prove that when prejudice, nastiness and racism raise their heads in the public forum we must face them down, challenge them and ultimately stamp them out. On the side of St. Patrick's school on the Antrim Road in Belfast there used to be a quote which I think might be from William Butler Yeats: "Education is not the filling of a pail, but the lighting of a fire". A Bill such as this has the capacity to do just that. Although we rightly recognise and appreciate the significance of the Government's recognition of Traveller ethnicity, very often in this House the Minister in his various guises will hear Senators stating that such recognition is all well and good but there being a need to resource it. This Bill seeks to affirm that expression by Government in a practical way and, while acknowledging that the statement of the Taoiseach was good, positive and welcome, asks what we are going to do about it. How will we realise that vision and expression in a practical and tangible way in Irish society?</p>
          <p eId="para_617"> My experiences are somewhat different from those of Senator Dolan. When I was a young boy in Belfast there was a Traveller site on East Bridge Street, close to my home, and another on the Glen Road near where I went to school on Bóthar Seoighe. There was a site at the Monagh bypass, close to where my grandmother lived in Ballymurphy. None of those sites remains. Although we have come some way on this issue at a political level and perhaps more so at community and grassroots level, and although it is possible that we have fallen behind slightly, we certainly have a significant distance to go to recognise and address it fully. While I do not want to sound patronising, we have a political responsibility to address the reasons which were far more eloquently expressed by Senators such as Senator Mac Lochlainn for the Traveller community having been pushed to the fringes of our society through ignorance, prejudice, hatred and, worse again, as mentioned by Senator Mac Lochlainn, the former institutional policy of demonising our Traveller people. The Bill can form a significant part of that attempt. Let us take this opportunity. It is to be hoped the implementation and adoption of the Bill will go some way towards bringing a positive representation and reflection of Traveller culture and history to schools, schoolchildren and students. It is crucial that we recognise this. Listening to the remarks of Senator Mac Lochlainn was an education for me in terms of a greater understanding of Traveller culture.</p>
          <p eId="para_618"> Along with appreciating the cultural practices, historical legacy and so on of the Traveller community, we must look at, understand, embrace, cherish and support the Traveller community that exists within our society and what they continue to bring to our lives, whether at community or political level. I have no doubt that is central to Senator Kelleher's intention in the legislation. It is to be hoped there can be increased Traveller involvement in politics; perhaps we will have a Traveller Senator. The Government could affirm its intentions in this area by the Taoiseach appointing a Traveller to the Seanad. We need to understand, support, develop and invest in the Traveller people and their needs and requirements in 2018.</p>
          <p eId="para_619"> I do not wish to finish on a negative point. When I am blowing my top and flying off the handle, Mr. Jim Gibney who works in my office says to me, "Do not curse the dark; light a candle." This Bill seeks to light a candle, but I will curse the dark when Travellers suffer not because of ignorance but rather hatred or prejudice. While Senator Mac Lochlainn outlined the negative and shameful aspects of our history and other speakers probably did likewise before I entered the Chamber, we have a very proud history of facing down that kind of extreme prejudice. No matter where it emanates from or where we are, we should continue to challenge such prejudice. I will allow Senator Kelleher to light the candle and I will curse the dark.</p>

          <p eId="para_622">It is good to be back in the Seanad, of which I was previously a Member for almost five years. During my time in the Seanad I was afforded many opportunities to discuss various issues and it was always a pleasure to be here. I am particularly delighted to be here today on this issue. </p>
          <p eId="para_623"> I thank Senator Kelleher for bringing forward the Bill. I will support its passage through Committee Stage, mindful that following receipt of the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, report further amendments may be necessary.</p>
          <p eId="para_624"> Having listened to the contributions made today, I think there is something more powerful going on in terms of what this Bill seeks to achieve. Senator Gallagher spoke about the precedent and mechanics of introducing primary legislation to bring about curriculum change. This Bill is more a statement of intent. The timing of it is excellent in terms of the day that it is in it. When listening to the radio this morning I heard of the statements made by Mr. Peter Casey, with which I disagree, and it brought me back to 1989 when I was studying sociology in Maynooth University, my alma mater and Senator Ruane's current place of work and to the work of Mícheál Mac Gréil's, <i>Prejudice and Tolerance in Ireland</i>. He was the champion at a time when prejudice was rife within this country. He conducted analytical research in this area, which I am sure many people have taken the opportunity to read. On listening to the discussion on radio this morning, Mícheál Mac Gréil came to mind and I reflected on just how far we have come. As a glass half full politician, I am of the opinion that we have come a long way. During my time as a member of Donegal County Council I participated in the Traveller Consultative Forum and as a youth I worked with settled Travellers. At the time, we were acting as leaders for the Traveller community. There are now many within the Traveller community who have obtained bachelor's and masters degrees and are now leading their own communities. As I said, much progress has been made.</p>
          <p eId="para_625"> I believe what Senator Kelleher is trying to do by way of this Bill is an acknowledgement of Traveller ethnicity since 2017. I am happy to work with her and this House in this regard. Following receipt of the NCCA report in four months' time I will work with Senator Kelleher on it. I note the Senator has also met the NCCA and as such she will be aware that it is conducting research on the place of Traveller culture and history in existing curriculum, the current intercultural education guidelines and other resources for schools in regard to the Traveller community and the opportunities to teach Traveller history and culture and how it is incorporated into existing curricular subjects. As pointed out by Senator Byrne, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, is also doing work in this area. There is a broad spectrum of work under way. All the contributions made today were interesting. One of the most beautiful Irish words which I learned in the last couple of years is "oidreacht", which means both heritage and legacy. We are duty bound to promote all of our heritage and I will supportive of that endeavour.</p>
          <p eId="para_626"> Senator Ruane spoke about the cultural aspects of the Traveller community. Senator Mac Lochlainn will be aware of the wonderful piece of art at Letterkenny fire station, which was commissioned and delivered by members of the Traveller community in a workshop. If Senators are ever in Letterkenny they should go to the fire station to see it. I acknowledge that Senator Mac Lochlainn is also a strong advocate of the rights of the Traveller community and that he too spoke about the leadership issue. He will be aware of the great work that is ongoing in our county. The powerful leadership being provided by women was referenced in the context of the resilience of the Traveller community.</p>
          <p eId="para_627"> Senator Gallagher spoke about equality of opportunity. Following my engagement with the Taoiseach on Friday night I expected the first question from the media would be what is my vision for education, which I knew I would have only approximately six seconds to answer. My vision for education was articulated by a number of Senators today, including Senator Dolan. I want to create an environment where everybody can realise their potential in the education system, including members of the Traveller community. I will work to ensure every person has the opportunity to realise his or her full potential. </p>
          <p eId="para_628"> Senator Ó Donnghaile spoke about the link between legacy and heritage and what we needed to do in real time to support communities, of which I am conscious. The Department of Education and Skills has a role in the Creative Ireland programme, in which the Department of Culture, Heritage and the Gaeltacht is also involved. There may be provisions relative to this area within that programme on which both Departments can work together.</p>
          <p eId="para_629"> Senator Dolan spoke about dignity. He is correct that if one strips people of their dignity one strips them of their freedom. St. Columbanus, who he left Bangor, County Down, to go to Rome once said, "If you take away liberty, you take away dignity." He never made it to Rome but he did get to Bobbio in Italy. When I get to visit Rome, I will definitely go to St. Peter's Basilica to see the mosaic on which his quotation is inscribed. The dignity aspect is important and I am very conscious of it.</p>
          <p eId="para_630"> Earlier I was at the Department of Education and Skills in Marlborough Street, where I met my officials and staff for the first time. My new brief is a fairly wide one. My head is about to explode with all of the information I was given this morning. By way of background, I am a former secondary school teacher and I previously worked in the community with members of the Traveller community. I am happy to come to the Seanad on aspects of education, time permitting. As we all know, education is what is left when everything else is forgotten. I am happy to work with Senators on education matters.</p>

        <speech by="#ColetteKelleher" eId="spk_336">
          <from>Senator Colette Kelleher<recordedTime time="2018-10-17T17:50:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_631">I thank the Minister for being here. I am delighted that his first day as Minister for Education and Skills is an interesting one. As a fellow community and youth worker in the past, we have much in common already. The Minister spoke about the concerns raised by Senator Gallagher regarding the potential politicisation of the curriculum suggested in this Bill. I took on board these points when previously made inside and outside of this House and I received advice in that regard from Mr. James Kane, barrister, who helped with the drafting of the Bill. As the Minister mentioned that he may be bringing forth amendments on Report Stage, it might be useful if I share that advice with him.</p>
          <p eId="para_632"> The Bill does not envisage that the Minister would prescribe the syllabus in a vacuum. Under the Bill, as drafted, the Minister would take advice from only entities that he or she feels necessary, including parents' organisations and the NCCA, which the Minister's predecessor has already asked to do some work on this issue. As mentioned by the Minister I have met the NCCA and that work is already in train. The position envisaged by the Bill, as drafted, is clearly not that the curriculum would reflect a Minister's personal agenda or personal beliefs.</p>
          <p eId="para_633">Obviously none of us would wish that to happen. What I suggest through this Bill does not contravene that convention.</p>
          <p eId="para_634"> The Minister's role in this process does not render the process politicised. Rather, it ensures there is a person who is responsible and accountable for the content of the syllabus of recognised schools. The Bill is fully consistent with the existing state of affairs where the Minister prescribes the content of the syllabus of recognised schools. In that regard, as things stand in the Education Act 1998, the following provisions show that the role of the NCCA is advisory in nature only and that the Minister is responsible for prescribing the syllabus. Section 41(1) of the Education Act 1998 states: "The object of the Council shall be to advise the Minister on matters relating to - (a) the curriculum for early childhood education, primary and post-primary schools," and section 41(2) of the Act states: " ... it shall be a function of the Council: (a) from time to time to review the curriculum, or any part of the curriculum, for schools and the syllabuses taught and to advise the Minister;". Section 30(1) of the 1998 Act provides that: “The Minister may, from time to time, following such consultation with patrons of schools, national associations of parents, recognised school management organisations and recognised trade unions and staff associations representing teachers, as the Minister considers appropriate, prescribe the curriculum for recognised schools, namely - (a) the subjects to be offered in recognised schools, (b) the syllabus of each subject". Section 30(3) of the 1998 Act contains an express power for the Minister to “consult with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment and such other persons or bodies of persons as the Minister considers appropriate on any matter relating to the curriculum for recognised schools.”</p>
          <p eId="para_635"> As appears from the provisions just mentioned, any amendment to the Bill that proposes that the Minister does not prescribe the curriculum is, in fact, a deviation from the present position as set out in the Education Act 1998. It does not appear to be justifiable to have one approach for the current curriculum, which the Minister prescribes in consultation with other bodies, and a different approach for Traveller culture and history. If the Minister is not to prescribe the syllabus, the question arises as to who is responsible for prescribing the content. The Bill would be toothless without stipulating that a particular person or entity is responsible for making this change to the syllabus.</p>
          <p eId="para_636"> In case there is any argument of floodgates whereby it is feared that other people, or groups, might want to initiate Bills to reflect further changes to the syllabus to reflect their own culture and history, a number of points can be made. Travellers are an ethnic minority and ,therefore, specific considerations arise from this. It should also be noted that there are numerous EU recommendations in existence dealing specifically with Traveller education. Any future Bill would have to be considered and debated on its merits in the normal way and it may well be found that the curriculum is lacking in other areas and requires amendments. If that turns out to be the case, so be it. This is no reason to hold back on the Bill. It is inconsistent with the provisions of Article 42(1) and 42(2) of the Constitution for the Oireachtas to foreclose on, or to express hostility towards, parental choice with respect to the education that their children receive. The Oireachtas must, if it is to act consistently with Article 42, remain open to the voice of parents in articulating important changes to the curriculum. Accordingly, the Bill should not be attacked on the basis of a floodgates argument. I hope this addresses some of the concerns voiced in this House today, or other concerns that might arise from the amendments. The barrister whose advice I quoted is available to meet with the Minister and his officials while we wait for the NCCA's approach which I have been promised will be delivered by the end of March.</p>
