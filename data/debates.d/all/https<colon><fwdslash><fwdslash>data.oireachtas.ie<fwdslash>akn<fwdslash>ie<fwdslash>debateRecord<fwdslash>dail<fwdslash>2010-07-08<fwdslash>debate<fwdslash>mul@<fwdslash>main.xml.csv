#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Before coming to the Order of Business I propose to deal with a number of notices under Standing Order 32.  I will call on Deputies in the order in which they submitted their notices to my office.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I seek the adjournment of the Dáil under Standing Order 32 to discuss an issue of local and national importance; namely, the urgent need for this House to have a full and frank discussion on the farming crisis.  Farm incomes have dropped by more than 40% on average, but in many difficult wetland areas that figure is much higher.  Even more serious are the unworkable regulations that have been imposed, especially on intensive units such as poultry and pig farms, at variance to what is happening in other EU countries.  It is unrealistic to expect farmers to farm according to fixed dates for slurry and fertiliser spreading regardless of weather conditions, and the agreements made must be renegotiated.  This cannot be dealt with today but I hope it will send a message that we need an urgent debate once the Dáil resumes.

This week a 91-year-old woman was left for nine hours on a trolley at Midland Regional Hospital Mullingar, County Westmeath——

This is despite the Minister's claim that there have been no cutbacks in services at Mullingar hospital.  Such claims are par for the course for Ministers, but no amount of spin can hide the fact that the Government has failed Longford-Westmeath again.

I am concerned that in the legislation that created the Commission for Taxi Regulation, no facility was granted for an appeals procedure should drivers disagree with any decision taken by the commission, which since its inception has amassed €23 million in funds from the sale of licences, licence renewal fees and on-the-spot fines.  I call on the Minister and the Government to support taxi drivers with common-sense policies, particularly at this difficult economic time.

I acknowledge that the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Moloney, came to the House around midnight last night and gave us the good news that the Galway services are safe until the end of this year.  However, the Limerick service remains closed and we must have an announcement today that the service will reopen for those families.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, for coming before the House last night.  However, what we want is a commitment from the Government today that this respite service will be reopened.  Elderly people came to Dublin yesterday about this issue.

What we want is for the Minister for Health and Children or the Minister with responsibility for disability to come before the House to say this service will be reopened.  This is about real people's lives.  Yesterday, the Taoiseach was here talking about 130 people as if they did not exist.

#SeamusKirk	unknown-#SeamusKirk-party	unknown-#SeamusKirk-dob	unknown-#SeamusKirk-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The Deputy should allow the Chair to put the proposals to the House and then he can deal with them as we go along.Is the proposal that the Dáil shall sit later than 4.45 p.m. tonight agreed to?  Agreed.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	69	It is not agreed.  Once again the guillotine is being applied to motions.  Fine Gael intends to oppose every guillotine.  Not alone that, the motion before us, the proposed approval by Dáil Éireann of the draft commission of investigation very conveniently leaves out any hand, act or part of the Ministers or the Department of Finance in this.  That is totally unacceptable to this side of the House.  It is very clear now that the Minister for Finance had the wool pulled over his eyes.  Plainly and simply, he was conned by the banks.  It appears that the only people left now to pick up the tab are the taxpayers, who are decreasing in number daily as more and more people lose their jobs.

That is a significant amount of money for an international expert who will come and tell us why the banks failed.  That is important.  The Government has accepted the extension of the terms of reference, as proposed by the Labour Party, to cover the period to 15 January.  However, the commission of inquiry will not look at the role of the Taoiseach or of Ministers for Finance or the role of the current Taoiseach when he was Minister for Finance.  They are all carefully excluded from the terms of reference of this investigation and of the other two investigations.  There is to be a private benchmarking inquiry into the Department of Finance and its failures and there is to be a Dáil committee to look at the macro-economic lessons we can learn.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	75	No, this country is going to drown in inquiries, but that will not result in an extra euro of credit getting out to businesses in the country that are hanging on by their fingernails and letting employees go.  This inquiry will take into account the actions of banks that have, clearly, lied to NAMA.  The Government accepted those lies uncritically and told us the Irish banks were fine because stress testing showed they were fine.  It is proposed that we deal with this matter in one hour and ten minutes and that the debate will be guillotined.  That time will allow approximately only one person from each of the parties, including the Government, to speak briefly.  In terms of parliamentary democracy, that is completely inadequate.  The guillotine is not appropriate to this particular motion.  It used to be the case that before the summer recess there would be a two to three-day Adjournment debate on the performance of the Government, the situation of the economy and the plight of the unemployed.  This Government is running away from telling people how it proposes to recover the economy, rebuild the country and get people back to work.

However, the import of the motions cannot be addressed in an hour and ten minutes.  That is an absolutely inadequate timeframe to address what is of huge importance.  What is contained in all of this is absolutely at the core of everything that has gone wrong in terms of our economy and its impact on the daily living conditions of so many ordinary people the length and breadth of this State.It is important to be balanced in one's contribution on this.  We welcome the extension of the period, up to January of last year, that the commission of inquiry will investigate; that is an important step forward.  However, there are many other matters that must be addressed.  While the joint committee will consider the matter, it should be also debated in plenary session.  This Dáil Chamber needs to devote more time to this very important issue which, as I said, is at the core of all our economic difficulties.  We oppose the time allotment in this case.

I take this opportunity to indicate that we oppose the guillotine being imposed on each of these tranches of legislation, including No. 19, to which the Ceann Comhairle referred one moment ago and which had not been objected to at that time.  For each of the three tranches of legislation, that is, the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, the Criminal Procedure Bill and the Multi-Unit Developments Bill, the guillotines applied are inappropriate and unnecessary.

However, on this occasion I must acknowledge that the Government has acceded to a request from the Labour Party that the Multi-Unit Developments Bill would be passed on Second Stage before the summer recess to allow it to go on Committee Stage.  This is legislation the Labour Party has sought for some considerable time.  There are significant problems in various apartment blocks with the operation of management companies and their functioning and this area has been unregulated for a long period.Some time ago we moved proposals and we pressed Government to introduce and pass legislation dealing with multi-unit developments, management companies and everything that goes with that.  I acknowledge that the Government has included Second Stage of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill in today's Order Paper, the conclusion of which will allow it to go on Committee Stage during recess.  However, I very much regret that it will be three months before the Bill can come back into the House for Report and Final Stages and be enacted.  That is something I will deal with when I contribute on proposal No. 7.  I should acknowledge, in fairness, that the Government has acknowledged to the Labour Party that this Bill be taken today.

They obviously look forward to their break of three months.

They do not have regard for the people who have no respite care for the summer or the rest of the year.  Galway might have been given a reprieve but the people of Limerick, Dublin and elsewhere will get none.  These are the people we are supposed to serve.  However, this Government has become increasingly self-serving.  We are facing an economic crisis with rising unemployment.  If this House were a company, it would be laughed out of court for taking holidays at such a time.  The people are outraged and aghast at what is happening.  They cannot fathom how the House can be so detached from the realities of the lives of ordinary people.We utterly oppose this recession, or should I say recess.

We must go back to 2003 to find a later date for the resumption of the Dáil that the Government is proposing for this year.  Undoubtedly, when the Government uses its majority shortly to get this proposal passed, and it will be opposed by the Labour Party, it will inevitably be reported that the Deputies are taking holidays for three months.  That misses the point.  This is not about holidays, but about politics.  The reason the Government is doing this is that it will have three months in which it will not run the risk of being defeated in a vote in this House.  It will be three months of the period of time it is serving out its notice in which it will not be challenged or questioned in the House about any of its proposals.The Government will have three months to carry out openings, launches, events and news management in the hope——

Will it reconvene the House for one day at the beginning of September to introduce the Bill to hold the referendum on children as well as table a motion to move the writ for the three by-elections for the three vacancies in the House?  We could at least use the month of September to put the referendum on children before the people, have it adopted and hold the three by-elections.  The last time the writ was moved in the House the Government said it did not wish to interrupt Dáil business by holding the by-elections.  It can now hold them in September if it reconvenes the House for one day at the beginning of that month to move the writ, as well as introduce the Bill to hold the referendum on children.  These could be held at the end of September and, at least, have some political business carried out in September if the Government insists that the Dáil cannot be back in session until 29 September.  The Labour Party is absolutely opposed to the proposal that the Dáil be closed down until 29 September.

We do not want the Government back, but a dissolution of this Dáil.  The problem is not the length of time the Dáil will go into recess for the summer, but the Government that holds office over the State.  That it would not return is the best answer we could get today.  It should agree to a dissolution because it has no mandate.

The list is endless and the record of this Government is shameless.  What we want is not a proposal to recess until 29 September but this Government to face the fact that it has no mandate to continue in office.  We want a decision on its part to go before the people not only in three by-elections, an Údarás election and a Dublin city election, although there is a question about that, but in a general election so the people can decide who they will trust to continue to govern the affairs of this State into the future.  They do not trust this crowd here, Fianna Fáil and the Greens.  The point was lost here.  Deputy James Reilly made a very valid observation and it was lost in the melee of laughter.  The fact of the matter is that legislation went through this House last evening, shoved through this House, the prescription charges Bill.  Deputy Mary Harney, as Minister, sat there from the beginning to the end.  There was not a single Fianna Fáil or Green Party Minister, Minister of State or backbencher present while that matter was being rammed across the 1.3 million people who depend on medical cards, at 50 cent per prescription item and €10 per month, but leaving the Minister and the Minister for Finance the opportunity to raise that at their behest and without any further reference to this House.  There is no end of shameful decisions and failures on the part of this Government——

They will be participating in their normal duties as Members of this House and all of the committees, which have done a considerable amount of work this year, will continue in that vein.During this session we have participated in discussions in the provision of 23 pieces of legislation and I think it appropriate we have that recess to allow time for every Member of this House to take a justifiable occasion of at least two weeks off.  I want to take this opportunity to wish everyone well during this recess.  We will continue to do our work in hand which is very important.  Therefore, the Government, proposes the date I will put to the House.

#DrJamesReilly	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-party	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-dob	unknown-#DrJamesReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	159	I echo the sentiments of the Ceann Comhairle.  I wish all sides of the House a safe and good summer holiday.  I thank the staff of the House who have worked so hard to make the workings of this House run more smoothly than it otherwise would.  Many people work very hard here.I refer to the reference pricing for drugs Bill.  We were told last night by the Minister for Health and Children that it might be introduced in September but it has been long-fingered so often that I would like to know there is a commitment from the Government side to introduce it this year.  This Bill could save hundreds of millions of euro in drug costs.  We know we pay ten to 20 times the amount paid for generic drugs in Northern Ireland.  That has not been addressed by the Government.  Only the Government can address this, it is not a matter for pharmacists or manufacturers of mainstream drugs that remain under patent.  It is an issue for generic manufacturers and providers.  It puts into stark contrast the savings that may be made on the Health (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill.  I would welcome an indication on this point.The public health (sunbeds) Bill is due to come before the House.  There is an indication that it will include a prohibition on individuals using sunbeds.  We need to see the heads of this Bill in order to see precisely what is in it.  Reports in the newspapers suggest those with type 1 fair skin will be prohibited from using them.  This seems unconstitutional.  People must take responsibility for their health but no more than we can stop people smoking, we cannot stop people using sunbeds if they are over 18 years of age.  They have a constitutional right to do as they see fit, notwithstanding medical advice.  Finally, I wish the media a good summer.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	160	The Minister indicated legislation on the reference pricing of drugs will be published later this year.  Approval was given by the Government to prepare draft heads of the Bill on sunbeds.  I will try to find out the updated position and when we expect publication.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	161	I echo the good wishes of the Ceann Comhairle to all who work in this House — members, staff and media.  I return to the issues I raised with the Tánaiste when we were debating the date for the resumption.  I refer to the Government's plans for the children's referendum and the three by-elections.  What is the Government's intention with regard to these matters?  Will the Government consider recalling the Dáil for one day in early September to pass legislation to allow the referendum to be held and to pass the required motions to move the writs for three by-elections?  From a democratic point of view it is unacceptable that three constituencies — Dublin South, Donegal South-West and Waterford — are without representation in this House.  Over the course of the past week we have seen votes where the margin by which matters were decided was less than three.  People in those constituencies are entitled to their full representation in the Dáil.  What are the Government's plans regarding the by-elections in the referendum?It has been decided the Dáil will not be back until 29 September and it would be sensible to hold the children's referendum and three Dáil by-elections in September.  It would have the advantage of not disrupting Dáil business later in the year and would achieve what has been agreed on an all-party basis, that the rights of children are written into the Constitution by referendum.  This can be put to the people and the people of Dublin South, Donegal South-West and Waterford will be fully represented in the House.

I emphasise that because I concur with the point made by the Tánaiste.  I know the limited opportunity for a break in real terms that I will enjoy.  Across this House, we will all be working throughout the rest of this month and for much of the period until the Dáil resumes.  I wish everyone in the Houses of the Oireachtas, the media, who were missed out so far, and everyone who contributes to the smooth running of this institution a pleasant and restful holiday.I support Deputy Gilmore's proposal and I reiterate it now.  A formula should be adopted to avoid having to come back on 29 September, as has been agreed by the House, and face the constant haranguing that is part of the daily performance with regard to matters not yet decided or progressed by the Government.  We are speaking specifically about the promised referendum enshrining children's rights in the Constitution and the three outstanding by-elections in Donegal South-West, Dublin South and Waterford.  We should recognise that much time has been taken up on these matters.  No clarity has been provided and the Taoiseach's response on this point gives no certainty that these important excursions for the electorate will happen this year.  It is the view of Sinn Féin that they should all happen.The most important of those four opportunities to consult the electorate is the referendum on enshrining children's rights in the Constitution.  An all-party committee recommendation was made on wording and this was not only a construction of elected representatives with varying degrees of legal abilities, it was backed up by the support of four counsel engaged by the committee over the period.  There is considerable legal scrutiny of the work of the committee and the content of the third report and its recommendations, including the specific wording offered and signed off on by all parties.  The Taoiseach made the point that he must go through this with a fine-tooth comb.  Much work was done over 62 meetings and it was not a vague notion pulled out of the sky.  The scrutiny employed by the elected representatives and the counsel engaged by the committee was considerable.  It will be difficult to replicate even in the Office of the Attorney General.  We hope there will be an early indication that these matters will be progressed.  Deputy Gilmore's proposal that this be done and dusted before we resume on 29 September makes eminent sense and I formally support it.

As the Government wishes to avoid unintended circumstances, this work is ongoing.  Clearly, however, the Government intends to have a referendum.  With regard to the by-elections, nothing has been decided.

I do not believe Members should leave this House today without ensuring that those people also get a break.  I only seek a minute or two because he has been having meetings.

While Members obviously can be updated individually, if possible, in the interests of complete clarity, the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, should come before the House at some point this evening to make a brief statement to the effect that the respite services will be restored at the centre run by the Brothers of Charity in Limerick.  This would bring great certainty.

However, I received a letter from the Ceann Comhairle disallowing the question on the basis that a similar question had been tabled by my colleague, Deputy Clune, last week and naturally, he forwarded a copy of those replies to me.  In those replies, the Minister stated that he is currently in consultation with the Attorney General following a judgment of the High Court last year in respect of women seeking maintenance orders for themselves and their children.

#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	203	I wish to raise two issues with the Tánaiste.  First, I refer to legal costs and legal charges.  This week, the Taxing Master expressed his outrage in respect of the costs the legal profession was charging.  When will the legal costs Bill come before the Dáil?  I urge the Tánaiste and the Government to push this forward because the charges that some legal people are charging are outrageous.  There is only law in Ireland for the rich, not for the poor.Second, I note the Tánaiste once had responsibility for this portfolio and as she is aware, the Department of Social Protection issued letters recently in respect of child benefit.  Some people did not respond to the letters because of a change of address or different reasons and, consequently, the telephone lines to the child benefit section are inundated with people trying to contact it.  People are obliged to wait on the telephone for two or three hours.  What will the Department do with regard to people who need their child benefit payments but who cannot get through to the Department?

I said then that a comprehensive understanding of the events that took place in the banking sector in recent times was an essential component of any economic recovery.  We have a duty as a Government and as Members of the Oireachtas to ensure that not only the origins of the crisis are understood but that lessons are learnt and that international and domestic confidence in the banking system is restored so that the economy can return to growth and employment creation.As the first stage of the process of investigation, the two preliminary reports prepared by Klaus Regling and Max Watson and by the Governor of the Central Bank, respectively, provide a comprehensive and authoritative examination of the crisis in the banking sector in Ireland.  The authors have provided us with a detailed and insightful analysis of the global, European and domestic macroeconomic factors at play over the relevant period.  Governor Honohan's report details the failures in the regulatory and supervisory arrangements and the weaknesses in the evaluation of the stability of the banks.  These reports draw attention to a number of issues which require further analysis and provide a sound basis for the further investigation of these significant issues.  I welcome their direction in that respect.The reports were laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 9 June and were debated.  The Oireachtas Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service has had two separate and lengthy engagements with the authors and subsequently with me to discuss how we should proceed.  Those meetings allowed a comprehensive analysis of the issues raised in the reports and some necessary rebalancing of the initial interpretation and media commentary by highlighting the complex factors at work that culminated in the extreme turbulence that impacted on the banking system in September 2008.In their report, Klaus Regling and Max Watson distinguish between those issues that are amenable to further investigation through a legally orientated process and other issues, which are less concrete and verifiable, and may be more appropriately the subject of policy review.  That distinction formed the basis of the Government's proposed approach to the next steps in the process.I draw the attention of the House to a number of points about the findings of the preliminary reports.  First, both reports, but especially that of Mr. Regling and Mr. Watson, describe in some detail the nature of the explosion in the availability of credit in the Irish banking sector and characterise the failures in governance and risk management in the banks as disastrous, and ultimately leading to systemic difficulties in the financial system.  What went on in the banks leading up to the crisis remains a cause of significant public concern.  The public interest demands that we investigate the very serious failures in the standards and controls that should have ensured prudent risk management policy and procedures.Second, it is clear that there were especially egregious failures in corporate governance and risk management at Anglo Irish Bank and the Irish Nationwide Building Society. Certain matters are already the subject or investigation by the relevant authorities, and I do not propose to comment on them now.  However, there is a clear need to examine more deeply and broadly what went wrong in those two organisations while taking account of the other investigations.  That is why the draft terms of reference prepared by the Government specifically set out the need for a full examination of the business models and strategies adopted by the boards of those institutions and the implementation by their senior managements of business and lending practices which resulted in those institutions experiencing such uniquely severe financial distress.  The investigation will cover the period from 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009, the date on which Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised.Third, building upon the need to investigate failures in governance and risk management, it is proposed that the commission should also investigate whether the external auditors commented in their audit reports on the standards and controls and risk management policy and procedures or on the business models and strategies and business and lending practices that led to the severe difficulties experienced by the banking system.Deputy Burton made an interesting suggestion in the course of the committee deliberations about how that particular element of the terms of reference should be drafted.  I raised her concerns with the Attorney General but he insists that the current formulation before the House today is the best one to ensure that the commission can bring its business to an expeditious conclusion and that the adoption of the alternative would unnecessarily prolong the duration of the commission's deliberations.  That said, I assure her that the matter was considered in some detail.Fourth, on foot of the analysis by Governor Honohan of the failures of financial supervision, there is a need for further examination of the nature of supervision and oversight of the banks by the Financial Regulator. For that reason it is proposed that the commission would examine the failures of the Central Bank and Financial Regulator to regulate and supervise the covered institutions and to maintain financial stability.These draft terms of reference are appropriate in the light of the findings of the preliminary reports.  Under the Commissions of Investigation Act 2004, a commission of investigation may be established by the Government, with the approval of the Oireachtas, to investigate any matter considered to be of "significant public concern".  There can be no doubt that the banking crisis and its origins fall squarely within that category.  It has had a profound impact on the State and on its financial position and we will live with its consequences for some time to come.  It is essential that we identify what went wrong and why and that we learn the lessons of the past to ensure that we never make the same mistakes again.I am pleased to inform the House that Mr. Peter Nyberg, former director general for financial services at the Finnish Ministry of Finance, has agreed to lead the commission.  Mr. Nyberg has the necessary experience to undertake this important role.  He will be supported by the expertise he requires.  I have made provision in my Department's Estimate for this year to cover the costs of the commission.I also remind the House that there are ongoing investigations by the relevant regulatory and other authorities into specific matters of a serious nature in a number of institutions.  The commission of investigation will not supplant or hinder those investigations.  In fact, it is open to the relevant authorities to initiate further investigations into additional possible breaches arising out of any findings that the commission may make.The motion before the House seeks approval of the draft Government order, laid before the Houses yesterday, providing for the establishment of a commission of investigation into the banking sector.  I draw the attention of the House to the Government's decision, following the recommendation of the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service at a meeting last Monday, to extend the period to be covered by the commission of investigation from 1 January 2003 to 15 January 2009.  This means that the commission will now be in a position to examine all relevant matters relating to corporate governance and risk management in each of the banks covered by the Government's guarantee up to the date of the Government's decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.The second motion before the House seeks to refer certain macroeconomic policy lessons to the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service arising from recommendations set out in the Regling and Watson report.  As is clear from that report, these policy issues can be divided into two groups; those that relate to macroeconomic management and those that relate to financial stability and prudential matters.  The former are primarily my responsibility in the first instance and the latter fall within the remit of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.I propose that the joint Oireachtas committee, taking account of the emerging EU proposals on fiscal and economic governance, examine the following matters highlighted in the Regling and Watson report: the role of macroeconomic management and surveillance in securing the long-term sustainability of Ireland's economic performance and also in responding on a timely basis to risks and imbalances that may build up in both the private and public sectors of the economy, including external imbalances vis-à-vis other euro area members and the funding of any imbalances that might arise; the role of fiscal policy in securing an appropriate alignment of the national business cycle with monetary conditions in the economy; the requirement for the design and conduct of budgetary and taxation policies to take account of the cyclical nature of particular revenues as well as their temporary nature in certain circumstances in order to maintain an appropriate and effective tax base and; the case for the establishment of new institutional structures to provide an independent validation of economic and fiscal projections as well as for the introduction of domestic medium-term fiscal rules.Following my discussions with the committee, I understand that the committee is agreeable to the main elements of the overall proposed scope.  It is proposed that its deliberations be concluded by the end of October in order to publish and report back to this House and the Upper House by 4 November 2010.Regarding the issues within the remit of the regulatory system, the House will be aware that the Central Bank published a report on 21 June setting out its proposed approach to future regulation of the banking sector.  This report also addresses how the range of measures it is putting in place will address the issues raised in the Governor's report and that of Messrs Regling and Watson.  This is another step on the road to the recovery of the banking system.It is the Government's view, underpinned by the two preliminary reports, that certain decisions and processes which are fundamentally political in nature, are not amenable to an investigation whose purpose is to make findings of fact.  The Government will not be changing its position on that point.  There are no good reasons for it to do so.  Let me also be clear however that my Department will feature in significant ways in both of the investigations.  First, the terms of reference of the commission require it to examine whether any advices or directions given by the Department to the Financial Regulator were in any way relevant to failure of the Financial Regulator in the performance of its supervisory functions.Second, in regard to the proposed policy review by the committee, I have already indicated my own availability to meet the committee as the accountable Minister to assist it in its deliberations as necessary.  At all times, my predecessors and I have been accountable to this House for the decisions taken as Minister and for the actions of my Department.  That will continue to be the case.Deputy Noonan suggested yesterday evening the terms of reference of the commission should be broadened to include advices given by the Department to the Minister.  My Department is now finalising the documents on the bank guarantee and the deliberations thereon that it intends to put into the public domain.  The request was initially made by the Committee of Public Accounts but the documentation will be also put at the disposal of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  My Department has had to take the advice of the Attorney General on complex issues associated with legal professional privilege and the confidentiality of Central Bank information and certain banker-customer information in the preparation of these documents.On Deputy Noonan's suggestion that the documents be made available, I am open to persuasion that documents pertaining to the period up to 15 January 2009 should be put into the public domain.  I am examining this with a view to making a decision on it in a short period.  As Minister, I am accountable to the House regarding the documents, but I am also prepared to make myself available to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for questioning in respect of them.As I have informed the committee and the House, I am establishing an independent review by an international expert or experts with relevant international or domestic experience to evaluate the systems, structures and processes used by the Department of Finance in providing advice to the Minister and the Government.  The review will examine the Department's role and performance in the past ten years in providing advice to the Minister and the Government.  This would include advice on the Government's management of the current crisis, with a view to ensuring that the lessons of this period of extraordinary stress will inform the development of the Department in the future.  The review will have due regard to the skills, training and staffing mix required by a modern finance and economic Ministry so it can best fulfil its role and mandate.I want to ensure for the future that the Department of Finance can give the best possible policy advice, better assess risks and opportunities in the fiscal, economic and financial system, and manage its own operations with high levels of effectiveness and efficiency.  The Department has good, skilled and capable staff but I want to be sure they are used to best effect and that the mix of skills is optimised.The matters we are discussing today are important and will have enduring consequences for future economic and financial policy.  It is appropriate, given the scope and cost of measures that have been necessary to stabilise the Irish banking sector, that this matter be completely investigated and that lessons be learnt in order to put in place the best systems and structures so this kind of crisis can never happen again.  I commend the motion to the House.

We are not coming cold to it because there has been considerable discussion on this matter at the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  I attended last week's meeting but Deputy Burton and others have been attending meetings for quite some time.  The amendments being made to the proposed terms of reference by the Minister are acceptable.  He has moved very close to the position at which the committee wanted to arrive.I want to comment in particular on the Minister's extension of the period under investigation.  The original terms of reference would have required the commission of investigation to cease its inquiries once events up to 28 September 2008 had been investigated.  This is a significant date as the guarantee was discussed on 29 September 2008 in the Department.  On that day, the Minister informed the House of the serious problem emerging in our banking system.  He obtained the approval of the House for the guarantee he introduced, and he had the support of Fine Gael on the day.  We felt the crisis was such that we would take the Minister's advice on trust.It has emerged since that time that events after 28 September 2008 need to be the subject of an inquiry.  One should consider the period of crisis I want investigated as beginning with the guarantee across the banking systems and ending on 15 January 2009.  The latter date was the date of the nationalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  Between the two dates, an enormous number of events occurred that threw light on the banking system.  They need to be inquired into.When the Minister sought the approval of the House on the guarantee, he presented, on the basis of the information available to him, the crisis as a liquidity crisis.  It emerged subsequently that it moved very quickly from a liquidity crisis to the associated insolvency crisis, on foot of which the banks went bust.  I am glad the terms of reference allow for the failures in corporate governance and risk management at Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide Building Society to be investigated.  In effect, they became insolvent and went bust, and the State had to move in and rescue them.There are many events to be considered.  One of the most curious was the information that Anglo Irish Bank was involved in a process entailing back-to-back loans with Irish Life & Permanent.  Its money was channelled through the latter institution and was returned as deposits.  This improved its balance sheet.  This was an attempt to disguise the fact that the bank was well on the way to insolvency.  How this happened needs to be investigated.  It is very important that the period in the terms of reference was extended.It emerged that the Central Bank was aware of this matter, in addition to the Financial Regulator.  Officials in the Department of Finance have put it on record that PricewaterhouseCoopers became aware of it and informed the Department at official level.  For some reason, this information was not passed on to the Minister.

#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	220	It was eventually but not at the time in question.  This must be examined.  It is very important that this be done.One point made by the Minister may meet the requirements I sought last night when we referred to these issues during the debate on the Private Members' motion.  He said in his speech that "the terms of reference of the commission require it to examine whether any advices or directions given by the Department to the Financial Regulator were in any way relevant to failure of the Financial Regulator in the performance of its supervisory functions."  That is appropriate but there were surely advices from the Financial Regulator and Central Bank that were given to the Department.  Submissions, petitions and advices were submitted by the banking sector to the Department.  These should be also the subject of investigation and not be ruled out in the terms of reference.The Minister has moved a certain amount by stating he will examine in due course the appropriateness of putting the advices on the public record.  Considerations associated with legal privilege, etc., must be taken into account.  However, the Minister should include in the terms of reference provision for the commission to examine the advices that flowed to the Department in addition to those that emerged from it.The referral of certain macroeconomic and fiscal policy lessons to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service for its approval is appropriate.  It is a little unclear what the ultimate product will be.  On first reading, the committee will require professional economic advice.  Since the procurement process involved could be long, the Minister may need to reconsider the dates on which he expects the committee to report.  Were the standard 90-day European procurement notice to commence now, the committee would not get under way until October, so having it conclude by November would be difficult.  The Minister might take note of this point.I am pleased with the proposals and we will not call a vote on them.  The Minister has met the committee's request fairly.  We never get everything, but the many serious concessions he has made will improve the work of the commission.  Were he able to find a formula for taking my other requests on board, I would be pleased.

He has extended the period covered by the commission of inquiry from 1 January 2003 to 28 September 2008 in respect of all elements bar the supervisory role of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  The Minister has extended the period in respect of the institutions to 15 January 2009, when Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised.  Where the supervisory role is concerned, however, the period has not been extended.  I do not know whether this is a typo.  Will the Minister clarify the situation?  It is important that the date be extended to 15 January to match the period applied in respect of the other elements, namely, the individual banks, specifically Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide, and the external auditors.My reason for making this request is straightforward.  In terms of the issue of Anglo Irish Bank and the back-to-back loans with Irish Life and Permanent, €3.45 billion was provided on 26 September and the balance of the €4 billion was provided on 30 September.  The latter action would fall outside the period under review.  The preliminary financial report on Anglo Irish Bank was published in December 2008, putting it outside the terms of reference.  In those accounts, bank deposits were represented as customer deposits to give the impression that the bank's balance sheet was stronger than it really was.  I hope the Minister will clarify this point and extend the period.I wish to raise two issues concerning the commission.  The Minister, the Taoiseach and former Ministers for Finance should make themselves available and evidence should be given in public.  It is critical that the advice given to the Minister at the time be made available to the commission.I will deal with the macro level shortly.  I am digressing slightly, but these are important matters.  NAMA's revised business plan is inadequate in that it has no profit and loss accounts or cash flow projections.  When the draft business plan was debated, the Minister did not state from where the information had come.  He now informs the House that it came directly from the banks.  In late 2008, he commissioned PricewaterhouseCoopers, PWC, to carry out due diligence reviews of the various institutions and their loans.  Those PWC reports need to be disclosed in full so that we can know what advice was available to the Minister while NAMA's draft business plan was being proposed.  Anything less and there would not be proper disclosure.The macro report will be before the finance committee, of which I am a member.  According to the Minister, it is the Government's opinion that certain decisions that were fundamentally political in nature are not amenable to an investigation the purpose of which is to make a finding of fact.  When the report is before the committee, it is important that officials from the Department of Finance attend our meetings with the advice in question if we are to implement clear measures.I hope the Minister will take my request for an extension on board.  Where the commission of investigation and the committee's macro level review are concerned, I also hope he will accept the necessity of making available all of the advice given to him by the regulator and departmental officials.  Ministers drive policy and officials only implement it.  We need to know the background to decisions.The PWC due diligence reports started in August or September of 2008.  Commissioned by the Minister, they should have fed into the NAMA process.  It is not good enough to say that——

Subordinated debt will not be guaranteed under the new loan guarantee fund, LGF, scheme.  When I raised the matter of Anglo Irish Bank's senior debt during Priority Questions more than one week ago and asked whether it would form part of the new guarantee, the Minister assured me he would examine it.  Between Anglo Irish Bank's senior debt and subordinated debt, there is €5.5 billion in taxpayers' money.  The bank referred to a figure of €8 billion, €2.5 billion of which will go towards setting up the new bank.  The European Commission has significant concerns in this regard.  Will the Minister comment briefly on this matter, update me on his review and correspond with me on whatever reviews have occurred?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	230	The Labour Party moved an amendment to extend the terms of reference to include the Government and the Department of Finance.  Unfortunately, the Ceann Comhairle ruled our amendment out of order.  Down the road, the Minister and Fianna Fáil will come to regret that, for reasons of political expediency, they have sought to exclude from the commission of inquiry's terms the roles of the Department, successive Ministers for Finance and the Government.  This is a mistake of historical proportions.Ours is a parliamentary system with a Cabinet Government.  Under the Constitution, the Minister for Finance is the Cabinet member with responsibility for financial decisions.  He should bear in mind that this is no ordinary crisis.  This is a crisis of such proportions as the country has not experienced before, unless one considers the period between the Easter Rising and the foundation of the State.  Therefore the notion that Fianna Fáil would seek to exclude the institutions of governance, namely, the Minister and Department of Finance and the actions of Government, in effect, from the terms of the inquiry is ludicrous.  The Minister and the Government are excluded entirely from the inquiry, and the Department of Finance has a very small role to play.I do not believe that Fianna Fáil will emerge well from the historical decision in the greatest economic crisis the country has ever faced to exclude its role and actions and those of the Department of Finance.  That is a fundamental historical error on the Minister's part.  It is a bad choice and bad authority in terms of his proposal for the terms of reference of the commission.I tabled a series of amendments on behalf of the Labour Party, one of which included extending the date to 15 January 2009.  I thank the Minister for the spirit in which he examined the Labour Party's proposal and accepted it.  I believe the Minister accepted that this would make the commission of inquiry much more sensible in terms of its scope and operation.  The events that led up to the crisis and the fatal blanket guarantee the Government adopted are included in the terms of reference as is strange decisions we never understood regarding Anglo Irish Bank, including the collapse in its share price.The property market capped itself towards the end of 2006 and was on the slide thereafter.  The House will recall the various television programmes such as "Future Shock" by RTE in the spring of 2007 involving Richard Curran and the "Prime Time" team and articles by people such as Professor Morgan Kelly in UCD.  Large numbers of people in business, politics and I presume the Civil Service, were concerned.  Nobody doubts the dedication to the public interest of the people in the Department of Finance, who are very smart.  A legitimate question is whether those smart intelligent people who operate in the Department of Finance in the public interest said, at any stage, from 2003 onwards, in effect, to the incumbent Ministers, "This policy is inadvisable.  It will create a bubble in the property market.  Bubbles in property markets internationally eventually burst, history shows, and cause economic ruin for the people involved".As Regling-Watson and Honohan said, our enormous crisis is home-made and is a plain vanilla property burst.  It is inconceivable to me that the people in the Department of Finance — as the key Department — were not, at the very least, nervous and concerned, and did not express their opinions to the governing Minister of the day.  During this period I had repeated debates with the former Minister for Finance, Deputy Cowen, now Taoiseach, when I pointed out to him the folly of the property based tax reliefs, and the cost of those.  I received information from the Revenue Commissioners to the effect that millionaires paid no tax.  The then Taoiseach, Deputy Bertie Ahern and then Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Harney agreed that this was a scandal that had to be brought to an end.  Please do not tell me that people in the Department of Finance were not aware of this and did not offer advice.One must pay all due respect to the Minister as a lawyer.  In a lawyer's way he seeks to avoid that aspect.  The terms of reference include the need to get the advices or communications from the Department of Finance to the Regulator and the Central Bank but there is nothing about what was said to the Minister or what the Department of Finance officials might have considered among themselves, as public servants.  This is a very clever confinement of the supposed role of the Department of Finance in this investigation to a very specific point.We are spending €1.8 million on this to the end of the year, which appears adequate for the type of inquiry into the banks the Minister has in mind.  Many taxpayers might believe that it is even on the high side.  However, it is extraordinary the way the Minister has sought to draw a line of exclusion around Fianna Fáil and the various Ministers of Finance.  On the Minister's part that may be a political desire to protect his boss, the Taoiseach, from any inquiry into the conduct of his role as Minister for Finance and how he steered the ship onto the rocks.I want to refer to the Labour Party's proposal to widen the terms of examination of the commission into the role of auditors.  I have great respect for the Attorney General and know he is exceptionally hard working.  The problem is the terms of reference and whether the auditors actually advised the banks as regards policies which were wrong.  That is not the role of an auditor, however.  If Michael O'Leary, for example, decides to make Shannon Airport the hub of his operations and chooses to have all his flights out of there, it is not the role of an auditor to tell the businessman that his fundamental idea is wrong.  That is a business decision.  It is the role of the auditor to decide whether such a decision is within the powers of the company, not to tell the business person that this or that is what he or she may or may not do — or to suggest an idea about lowering prices is crazy, or that basing Ryanair at Shannon Airport is unwise.  That is not the point of an audit, yet I fear that the response the Minister's investigator will come up with is predetermined.The former Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Purcell, is undertaking some inquiries, I believe, for the Institute of Chartered Accountants in Ireland.  God only knows when we are going to see them.  I do not believe the terms of reference will give the quality of answer and insight into the role of auditors that is needed.  Despite this I believe there is agreement in this House in regard to what we want to find out.Turning to the issue of confining the date in regard to the Central bank, the Regulator and the small reference to the Department of Finance to 28 September-----

This Finnish Wallander would have to approach it in an opposite direction from the banks, and work back from the period starting 29 September, into the banks, the Central Bank and the Regulator.  I do not know whether Mr. Nyberg is Wallander, but he will need to be when it comes to dealing with the terms of reference.  It is good that the Minister accepts this.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	238	The most extraordinary aspect of the revised NAMA business plan is the board's admission of a deterioration in its original estimates with losses of €5 billion now predicted.  The House has got so used to talking in billions that the value of money has lost its meaning.  The outcome, however, of these decisions has left people with an extraordinary debt overhang.  While I never contested the banking problem would cost much money, if the Labour Party's proposals — even variations of them — had been accepted, we would have some functioning banks now with only half of what the Government spent.NAMA's revised business plan contained one line stating derivatives worth €14 billion were being taken off the banks' balance sheets and taken on by the taxpayer.  During the crisis, we were repeatedly given the Lehman Brothers defence which Regling, Watson and Honohan blew out of the water by pointing out that the Lehman collapse was irrelevant as the crisis was homemade.  We were also told constantly that there was no problem with complex financial instruments affecting our banks.Yet, now in the revised NAMA business plan up pops €14 billion of derivatives with a note saying a considerable amount of these have no value.  The business plan states:Derivative transactions with a nominal value of €14bn (principally interest rate swaps) will also be transferred. A substantial number of these derivatives are nonperforming and NAMA will pay nil consideration to acquire them.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	240	The problem is we are taking on the contingent liability that goes with these derivatives.  They are interest-rate swaps — the very products that did for Lehman Brothers and many other financial institutions.Economic governance is so poor in this country that this revised business plan does not even set out the likely level of the liability that may arise.  When the State guarantee was introduced, the Government said over and over again the banks did not have fancy financial instruments.  In the last days before the empire went down, did someone in Anglo Irish Bank buy and sell interest-rate swaps?  How much of these €14 billion derivatives and their contingent liability stem from Anglo Irish Bank?For ten days before they were published, the Minister for Finance and the Government had the Regling, Watson and Honohan reports in their hands, during which they could analyse them and prepare their rebuttal.  Will the Minister for Finance give a commitment that when Mr. Peter Nyberg, the Finnish Wallander, completes his report it will come directly to the House and not be offered to Fianna Fáil to do a scissors-and-paste job to suck anything out of it that defends its position?  Holding the first banking reports for ten days was an abuse.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	243	I welcome the Minister's recent substantial move at the Oireachtas finance committee on the terms of reference for the banking crisis commission of inquiry and the investigation into what can be best termed regulatory governance, including auditing.  I also welcome the hearings into the macroeconomic aspect of this.  This has instilled some confidence that this could be a constructive exercise, avoiding some of the squabbling that has gone on.It is critical the role of auditors is examined in this whole mess because they have a public function, whether it is in the banks or corporate entities, and they are self-governing.  I agree with Deputy Burton on their role as not to be giving advice to companies but to report to the regulators and the public as to the viability, or otherwise, of companies.  It is beyond me how the auditors missed so much of the goings-on in the banks.  Why did they look the other way?  Were they taking their nod from the regulators in the Central Bank or the Cabinet?  I would love to know why they thought they could do what they wanted.Will Ministers of the time in question give evidence, if invited to do so, at the committee's deliberations on the political management of the macroeconomic issues?  The committee's capacity would be diminished without this input.The review of the Department of Finance will be interesting and necessary.  I look forward to that report when it is published.  I cannot wait to read Mr. Nyberg's CV to see how he has preformed in his career to date.I welcome the extension of the time to be examined to 15 January 2009.  This was necessary as it will now include the decision to nationalise Anglo Irish Bank.  It would have been easy for the Minister for Finance to seek to avoid such an extension, so I am glad he came clean on it.One of our jobs is to examine economic policy.  Since 2003 to the banking crisis it was misjudged, to put it mildly.  Current government economic policy is equally misjudged in that it does not recognise the need for a State bank.  The chief executive officer of NAMA, Mr. Brendan McDonagh, told the Oireachtas committee on finance three weeks ago that the banks were not giving him the accurate information he required or co-operating as fully as he would have expected.  Although there is provision in legislation for NAMA to pursue institutions or bank executives, it is not happening.This is creating the perception among many that a golden circle of untouchables exists.  Mr. Frank Daly, chairman of the NAMA board, told the committee he was surprised at some of the atrocious findings made when examining toxic accounts in several banks.  Why Mr. Daly would be surprised is beyond me because he was chair of the auditing committee and a director of NAMA for some considerable time.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	244	Because it is a circle of incompetence rather than untouchability.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	245	Well, it has been untouchable up to now.  I agree that it has been a circle of incompetence, but perhaps to describe these people as incompetent is to let them off the hook.  Some would say they are particularly competent but have their eyes on something else — enriching themselves and their friends.  Let us hope some of this will come out in the inquiry.The bottom line is that if institutions are not co-operating with NAMA in the way they are expected to, why have prosecutions not arisen from this?  It is bizarre in the extreme.  A substantial in-depth investigation is needed.  The major surprise for me was that Mr. Daly was surprised at all.  I thought that having held a position in the most toxic bank of all, he would have had an insight into what was going on.  Thus, it is quite telling that he says he is surprised at the level of deceit that had continued up to recently with regard to the extent of toxic loans.The absence of specific and detailed figures, projections and so on leaves the business plan quite weak.  The principle of long-term economic value is still being applied by NAMA, and we do not know where it will stop.  One can calculate long-term economic value on the back of a cigarette packet and one's guess will be as good as anyone's.  Why are we not talking about current market value when discussing these toxic loans?  In that case we would all know what we were talking about.  It certainly will not be the 50% of the total value that NAMA has been paying to date; it is more likely to be of the order of 20% or 25%.  We know this from the Carroll High Court proceedings.  The business plan mentions a worst-case scenario of a loss of €800 million, but I am concerned that it may go well beyond that.If the Government's policy had been to create a State bank, the Minister and his colleagues at Cabinet would have had their hands on the levers of that bank.  They could have appointed people with credibility — decent, honest people — to run the State bank and ensure that the Government knew exactly where it stood.  Another major positive outcome would have been the safeguarding of credit for SMEs, which would have saved thousands of jobs across the land.At the meeting of the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service, we discussed in private the work of the committee.  In terms of expertise, we must make a difficult appointment.  I accept that we in the committee need expert guidance, advice and briefing on a host of matters that will arise along the way.  The selection of a person to do this is likely to be controversial, although I hope it is not.  I hope that somebody with an international reputation, whether he or she is Irish or otherwise, can be found, because Sinn Féin is not looking for a squabble on this; we want to get through the business at hand and make a report as quickly and efficiently as we can.  That is the objective of all parties in the committee.The timing will be difficult; the Minister will be even more conscious than us of the budget coming down the line just a few weeks after the report is due to be completed.  It is imperative that the report is done and dusted and discussed on the floor of this House well in advance of the budget, because we all know that will be a major challenge for the Government and, even more so, for those who will be at the sharp end of it.  It appears that this will again be a slash-and-burn budget, with more cutbacks, even though it does not need to be.  There are other options.  I am not talking about borrowing but about raising money in a fair and equitable way.  The Minister knows better than I the extent of the wealth that has been out there since long before the Celtic tiger.  There is still substantial wealth in the State and there are people who could afford to pay a wealth tax.  This would yield more than €1.5 billion; the minimum figure I am given by economists with regard to the yield from a 1% wealth tax is €1.6 billion.  They are the people who are able to bear that burden.The Minister said there were signs of life in the economy.  I am afraid that if he were listening to the news he would probably describe the economy as still critically ill.  We need to find a way to stimulate the economy to create jobs.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	247	No.  I have dealt with the wealth tax; that is a separate issue.  The Minister is taking money from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to support the banks.  Why will he not take a small amount from the fund to stimulate the economy, for example, through a schools building programme, which would create jobs and get some of the 452,000 people on the live register back to work?  That in itself will create activity in local areas to stimulate further economic activity, whether in the form of garage industries or entrepreneurs doing what entrepreneurs do, which is to create employment and make things happen.  However, it needs that stimulus from the Government, and this has been singularly absent to date.  I acknowledge that some measures have been introduced by the Government in an effort to retain and create jobs, but it has been minuscule in the context of what we are facing.  We need a substantial lift.  I am suggesting that €2 billion taken from the NPRF would be money well spent, and the pensioners of the future, who will rely on the fund, would be repaid many times over if such a stimulus package were introduced.I hope we can get through this investigation expeditiously, thoroughly and with substantial accuracy so that we can deal with these issues once and for all.  However the investigation ends, though, the current policy direction of the Government is wrong in the extreme.

I will deal with issues raised on all sides.Deputy Noonan raised the question of the information flow from the regulatory and central banking system to the Department.  The difficulty is that we are trenching upon the distinction I drew in the debate — which is the one point of difference between our position on the terms of reference and those of Fine Gael and the Labour Party — between areas of political accountability and those relating to the banking system itself.  The Government has decided to draw a distinction with regard to these inquiries.Deputy O'Donnell raised the question of why a different date was provided for the banking system as opposed to the regulators and supervisors, and Deputy Burton echoed that concern.  Deputies will appreciate that there was considerable telescoping of time in the preparation of these terms of reference because the committee kindly met on Monday evening and then I had to brief the Government on Tuesday, and I must admit the differentiation escaped my attention.  It is not really sustainable because if one is considering the banking system and regulation at the same time——

Clearly it is essential, since the regulatory system is inextricably linked with one of the transactions identified by Deputy Noonan in his contribution.  It is essential that aspect of the matter is part of the terms of reference and I do not have any difficulty with that.Deputy Noonan also asked whether the advice the committee will seek to obtain will delay the operations of the committee.  That is a matter for the committee itself.  I do not know, but if the advice was provided on a party rather than on a committee wide basis, it might enable the members to proceed without the necessity for procurement.  However, that is a matter the committee should examine and not a matter for me.  I am not trying to intervene in the business of the committee, but I am sure some way can be found to ensure that the necessary expertise is available to the committee to examine what can be difficult and complex matters.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	263	Deputy Noonan went on to make more general remarks on the question of the liquidity crisis, which was the main concern of the Government in late September 2008.  I recall saying in that debate that we were going in deep.  We were well aware that we were going into a system that required detailed examination and, therefore, the PricewaterhouseCoopers' examination of the bank assets then took place.  Deputy O'Donnell touched on that in his contribution.  A significant amount of information was assembled in that regard, some of which was put into the public domain.  However, much of it could not be put into the public domain because of its sensitive character.Deputy O'Donnell raised the issue in the context of the recent operations of NAMA and the business plan now approved by the board.  That is the business plan of NAMA.  The one advantage NAMA had as against its predecessors was that it was building on the work PricewaterhouseCoopers had done, on the work of the due diligence exercises which took place prior to the capitalisation of Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank and the abortive capitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  In effect the due diligence led to the nationalisation rather than the capitalisation of Anglo Irish Bank.  NAMA had the advantage of that work already being done and has been able to bore deeper as a result.  It has also, of course, had the advantage of a statutory mandate and of statutory provisions in respect of disclosure by the institutions themselves.

The draft business plan that was submitted to the House last autumn was just a draft, prepared by the interim NAMA executive.  At that stage, NAMA was far more dependent on information voluntarily supplied by financial institutions, including the PricewaterhouseCoopers' report, than it was in its more recent exercise.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	269	Deputy Burton raised the question of the terms of reference and asked why these did not extend to the Government and the Department of Finance.  I believe there are two distinct issues Deputy Burton is anxious to see examined.  One relates to the causes of the crisis and the fact that the response, the analysis, the assessment, the Department may have made and the advice it may have given to successive Ministers with regard to the causes of the crisis.  The other relates to the phase of crisis management and how the Department responded when the crisis became manifest and how decisions were informed in that regard.With regard to the causes of the crisis, Messrs Watson and Regling have said there is a fundamental distinction between issues which are susceptible to legal analysis and examination and determination of fact and wider political issues.  In my respectful view, this question of the causes of the crisis is a wider political issue and is not a matter into which a commission of inquiry should inquire.  It is a wider political issue and there is much information on it in the public domain.  Deputy Burton herself participated in much of it and in this House participated in questioning of successive Ministers.  There is a wealth of information in the public domain on these matters already.  Clearly, were the commission to be asked to look into that matter, it could continue its investigations for a very long time.  The request for a commission of inquiry into the causes of the crisis reminds me somewhat of the commission the late Éamon de Valera always wanted to see into the causes of the Civil War.  One cannot have a commission of that type, going on forever into a complex set of historical circumstances, where there is a wealth of information in the public domain already, all of which has been parsed and analysed by the partisans of different historical interpretations.The second aspect of the Deputy's concern relates to the crisis management aspect, once the problem came into the public domain.  The Deputy has always fastened on a date around St. Patrick's Day 2008 when the first signs of a disturbance in the share price of Anglo Irish Bank materialised.  Others fasten on September, where the lava that was building up in the subterranean caverns of the banks finally imploded and came to the surface.  Whatever date we fix upon, it is clear that the Department, and I as Minister, had to undertake the task of crisis management at that stage.  Many legitimate criticisms can be made, given the scale of management that had to be undertaken in such a crisis.  However, what is lacking in any suggestion that this should be referred to the commission is any foundation of any impropriety that has been laid.When we have had inquiries into Departments in the past, such as the inquiry we had presided over by the late Chief Justice, then the President of the High Court, Mr. Justice Hamilton, into the beef industry, we had concrete allegations with regard to the administration of the Department and its political head.  We do not have that here.  We have had plenty of political charges on the floor of the House, but at no stage has it been suggested with regard to the phase of crisis of management that there was any impropriety in the conduct of the Department.  Therefore, it is not a matter for a commission of inquiry.  Indeed, Messrs Watson and Regling gave the opinion to the committee that the crisis management had been excellent.  I might not subscribe to that point of view myself, but there is certainly no foundation for referring that aspect — the Department's management or myself — to a commission of inquiry.  I believe it is important that my Department is enabled to get on with the job of continuing the important job of economic management that must take place in the country here and now.  I am quite satisfied there is nothing that would immobilise my Department faster than the establishment of a commission of inquiry into it now.I have dealt with most of the points raised.  Deputy Morgan asked about the Taoiseach and asked who was prepared to go before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  The Taoiseach has made it clear he is prepared to go before it and I am also prepared to go before it.  I cannot speak for persons who are not Members of the House.

Various amendments have been proposed and, to be frank, I do not care whether the provisions are inserted in this Bill or in the Greyhound Industry Act 1958, so long as they are put through.  In the debate on a Private Members' motion last December, Fine Gael's Front Bench spokesman, Deputy Coveney, alluded to the issue of regulation thus:Light-handed regulation and cosy relationships between senior bankers, the Regulator's office, the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and, ultimately, Government has resulted in misinformation, market deception and deliberate concealment of vital information from shareholders, the markets and the public relating to the financial health of certain banks.The Taoiseach has acknowledged the regulatory failures that have occurred within the banking sector and the Office of the Financial Regulator.  That is why new measures have been introduced in those areas.  However, when it comes to the legislation before us today, it seems we have learned absolutely nothing.Thus far in the debate in this House and in the media we have had the alarming spectacle of some Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael Deputies speaking about the dangers of over-regulation of the greyhound racing sector.  There seems to be an arrogance in the higher echelons of the greyhound sector, no more than in the banking sector, that seeks to tell others to butt out because they know nothing about it.  That is that attitude which led to the systematic failure of the banking system.  The Minister, Deputy Gormley, in proposing this legislation, which deals primarily with puppy farming, is seeking to ensure that dog breeding is properly regulated and monitored and that shoddy practice is no longer given the nod and the wink.As far as animal welfare is concerned, both Bord na gCon and the Irish Coursing Club, ICC, seem to be untouchable enclaves.  There is no regulation other than self-regulation, and that is a dangerous thing as events in the Catholic Church and in the banking sector have shown.  If people are doing good work within the sector, they should have no fear of regulation.  The genuine concerns of Members have been recognised by the Minister in his amendments.  I am pleased there seems to be a consensus emerging that those amendments are satisfactory.  As I said, I do not care whether it is through this Bill or through legislation that is the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food that regulation is introduced.My colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, tabled the same parliamentary question earlier this year to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister at what was then the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism, asking, in each case, whether that particular Department was responsible for overseeing the welfare of greyhounds.  Her question requested the number of kennel inspections carried out by Bord na gCon in the last five years, the number of licences revoked and so on.  This information should be readily on record under the 1958 Act.  However, the question was disallowed on the basis that the inspection of kennels is part of the functions of Bord na gCon and is not an issue for which any of the Ministers concerned is responsible to Dáil Éireann.  In other words, nobody is responsible.The 1958 Act, as it currently stands, does not regulate.  Whether through an amendment to that Act or the measures in this Bill, provision must be made for the regulation of the industry.  All dogs have a right to a basic quality of life.  There are no kennel inspections of the greyhound breeding industry, and that must be rectified.  I hope that through the amendment of the 1958 Act, as proposed by the Minister, proper regulation will be instated.  I particularly welcome the legislation in terms of preventing and monitoring the inhumane treatment of puppies that has given this country a bad reputation throughout Europe.
#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	276	I welcome this Bill.  For us in the Green Party it is a legacy issue from a former Fianna Fáil Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Dick Roche, who tried to introduce the Bill some years ago.  It is an extremely important measure to protect animals and to regulate an industry that contains sinister and shady elements.  As a frequent hill walker in the Blackstairs Mountains and along the River Barrow, I have often come across sacks of dumped puppies, many of them greyhounds.  It is an appalling practice.  I hope this legislation will curtail the incidence of abuse and maltreatment of dogs.It is important that the greyhound industry be regulated.  The proposed amendment is acceptable because it ensures the regulation of the industry will not be simple self-regulation.  We all know from the revelations in the banking industry in recent years that where there is no significant external regulation of an industry, malpractice and abuse will set in.  Perhaps that is human nature.  The proposed amendment regarding the inspection of greyhounds allows for local authority inspectors to inspect and enforce standards, and that is vital.I propose to highlight to the House the continuing hypocrisy of the Labour Party on current animal welfare issues and its total fear of taking a brave stance on any difficult issue.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	278	The party has completed a three-point turn on the issue of stag hunting.  It first indicated implicit support for the measure and a demand for it to be published, before deciding to vote against it because of a fear of unpopularity in rural Ireland, and then, finally, came the announcement that it would not repeal the ban in government.  It went further last weekend when it signalled conditional support for the Bill, with Deputy Ciarán Lynch announcing that the Labour Party would vote for the Bill provided those changes his party had been calling for since it was first introduced are made.

#MaryWhite	unknown-#MaryWhite-party	unknown-#MaryWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	280	Let us look at the party's record in the Seanad on this legislation. On the fundamental issue of the definition of a breeding bitch, the Labour Party voted with Fine Gael on the proposal to amend the definition to include animals over two years of age.  Such an amendment would have been anathema to the objectives of the Bill, as the Labour Party knows, yet its Senators voted for such an amendment.  On other substantive amendments, the Labour Party voted against the advice of the Dogs Trust and the ISPCA on what is best to ensure welfare for dogs.  This all points to one reality: the party is like a dog with its tail spinning in all directions.  It does not know which way to turn.  However, I am pleased that at the final hour it has followed the conscience of Deputy Broughan in supporting animal welfare legislation.This Bill provides for strong protection for dogs in dog breeding establishments.  It is supportive of rural Ireland.  It protects animals and does nothing to threaten rural pursuits or industries.  It will ensure animals in these domains are treated well and help to ensure a positive reputation for our greyhound and dog breeding industries abroad.  As a complete non sequitur, I refer to Sir Robert Falcon Scott who tried to get to the South Pole but was beaten by the Norwegians, Amundsen and others.  It is now said in historical footnotes that if he had remembered to bring worming tablets for his dogs, the entire history of polar exploration would be different.

It is instructive in this respect for the House and the people of this country to recall the father of Irish pluralism, a man described by one historian as "an Irishman who strolled across the pages of European history as a colossus".  Daniel O'Connell was in love with hunting and once said, speaking of hares and beagles: "The hares are strong and numerous and I hunt every day with nine couples and a half of the first and best beagles in the world, beyond the reach of politics."O'Connell's pluralism is quite different to the self-styled mutterings of so-called pluralists which emanate from the cappuccino bars of Dublin 4.

We should distinguish between pluralists and tut-tuters; between pluralism and tut-tutism.  There is no greater illustration of tut-tuters and tut-tutism emanating from the establishment at Donnybrook than the pictures shown on our screens last week of the most unfortunate greyhound in the whole world; they must have searched the earth for it.  There it was on screen with ten saplings suffering.All that was missing from the screen was the indignant voice-over of Seán O'Rourke.  One must make the observation that RTE was doing what RTE does best, that is, present the exception and pretend that exception is the rule.Naturally, this is a feature of tut-tuters and tut-tutism in Irish society.  I regret to say it is not confined to the cappuccino bars in Dublin 4, which McCreevy described correctly as a state of mind, not a geographic place, for fear anyone should take offence, or to the hallowed halls of Donnybrook.  Unfortunately, tut-tuters and tut-tutism have also emerged in this House of late.I regret to state that it has emanated from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle's political party.  We have seen Deputy Gilmore, a scion of Sinn Féin, Official Sinn Féin, Sinn Féin The Workers Party, The Workers Party, New Agenda, Democratic Left, which was involved in the reverse takeover of the Labour Party, speak out against blood sports.  Then we witnessed the voice of Deputy Penrose strongly defending the rights of rural Ireland.  Then we heard the calmer voice of Deputy Ciarán Lynch putting what I can only describe in Corkonian terms as "a bob each way".  Naturally, this should come as no surprise to anyone in the House.  The truth is we do not know where the Labour Party stands on banking, education, job creation, transport, rural issues, water charges or even on the Croke Park deal, not to mention health.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13728	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	289	The Labour Party seeks, by way of amendment, to ensure the Act does not apply to any matter regulated by the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.  We believe strongly that if we are to support the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill, it must be on the basis that there is a clear and unambiguous attempt by the stakeholders in the greyhound industry in conjunction with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to ensure the code of practice put in place to ensure the welfare of the greyhounds is maintained.I speak on behalf of the smaller breeders; these are the people I represent.  The situation at present is such that when one visits a stud dog with a bitch with the intention of breeding a litter, the fact is publicised in the sporting press immediately.  When pups are born one notifies the ICC, Irish Coursing Club, within 14 days.  Details of date of birth and size of litter are published in the sporting press.  The bitch can be inspected anytime during this period.  The control steward inspects the pups and takes a DNA sample.  At 12 weeks old, the control steward tattoos the full litter on both ears; the left ear with a personal identification number and the right ear with the litter number.  Before they are 12 months old, the pups are officially named and their markings entered into their identity cards.  These are the current procedures as they stand.I am in favour of field sports and coursing and I have been at greyhound meetings.  The people I represent are those who rear pups.  They do not consider that the establishments or kennels they have are dog breeding establishments.  They are genuine people who have a genuine regard for field sports and for the welfare of the animals they keep.  For the most part, they are not in it for the primary motivation of profit, in the sense of developing breeding establishments.  The gain for such people is a potential win at such a venue as Clonmel or Youghal and for the love of the sport.  There is no fiduciary gain for the most part.  Most of these people have been involved in the sport at an intergenerational level.  If a book were kept of their expenses, one could be guaranteed that they have made a loss during the years they have been involved in the sport.  The primary motivation is not profit but a love of the pursuit of the sport.  It is genuine and integral for these people.  It is an affront to insult these people with some of the language I have heard from various sides of the House and we must speak for them.  We wish to speak for them in a modest and reasonable way.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	290	I thank all Deputies for their varied, interesting and, for the most part, positive contributions to the debate in the House.  It is clear many Deputies have experience of greyhound ownership.  Some, such as Deputy Joe Carey, have had more success than others.  I am confident the Bill, as amended, will safeguard the welfare of dogs in all dog breeding establishments.  It will ensure a thriving greyhound industry over time and create employment by enhancing the standards and reputation of dog breeding in Ireland.Every Member will be aware by now that I have proactively engaged with stakeholders and Members with a view to addressing any fears the proposed legislation might raise for various interest groups.  More than 650 submissions were received after the publication of the report of the working group.  The working group was established by my predecessor, Deputy Dick Roche, in 2005, a point that has been overlooked by many in the course of this debate.  Its terms of reference were to examine the current positions regarding the management of kennels and to make recommendations for such improvements.  Therefore, greyhounds were always considered to come within the remit of the terms of reference.  To underline this fact, the Irish Greyhound Board was represented on the working group and has been consulted extensively since then.  Senior officials from my Department have met the Irish Greyhound Board and the Irish Coursing Club on several occasions recently and have met the Dogs Trust and the Irish Kennel Club.In particular, the Irish Coursing Club has played a constructive role in the development of greyhound welfare and has engaged positively and openly during the course of the debate.  As a result of these engagements, I will detail amendments to address concerns relating to inspections, finance, the powers of authorised persons, breeding limitations, micro chipping and the effects of implementation.  I believe these amendments will allay successfully the concerns of the stakeholders involved.  I welcome the expressions of support for the Bill made in this House last Friday.  In particular, I thank Deputy Ned O'Keeffe for his forthright views.  His support for the Bill and the coalition are welcome.  His observations regarding the conduct of State agencies during the debate are astute and merit further consideration.The definition of a dog breeding establishment was specified by the working group appointed by the former Minister, Deputy Roche, as being based on the number of female dogs on the premises with breeding potential.  The working group included veterinary representation from Veterinary Ireland, the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Louth County Council and the ISPCA, and the Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.  There was no shortage of veterinary expertise in the group, which developed the definition of a dog breeding establishment which is, I believe, clear, unambiguous and, as such, will aid enforcement.The group noted the difficulties experienced in the United Kingdom with definitions based on breed which have become unenforceable.  I acknowledge that the estrous cycle ranges from six to 18 months depending on the breed of dog, but a working group definition was required to ensure that all bitches capable of breeding were included.  Therefore, they set "four months old and capable of breeding" as a definition of a bitch.  I have indicated that I will modify this to "six months old and capable of breeding".  However, I reiterate that this is not a marker for when to start breeding.I highlight that the Bill allows three litters in any three years, thereby providing a dog breeder with the flexibility to determine a bitch's potential prior to commencing breeding.  Concern has been expressed regarding the impact the Bill might have on the casual breeder with only a few pups.  Establishments with less than six bitches of six months old and capable of breeding will not be affected by the Bill.  If a bitch produces a litter of female pups, the breeder has six months to consider what to do with them before they become reckonable for the purposes of the Bill.  Sterilised or spayed bitches are not capable of breeding and are not reckonable for the purposes of defining a "dog breeding establishment".I have extended the fee bands in order that an establishment with up to 18 bitches aged over six months and capable of breeding will only pay €400 registration.  That is not a high fee when one thinks of the production that can be achieved from 18 bitches and the market value of a good pup.Inspection by a local authority veterinary officer will be a prerequisite for the issuing of an improvement notice.  A dog warden will not be authorised to issue such a notice.  This will reassure those who question the objectives of certain dog wardens.  Dog wardens, in turn, will be reassured by the provision that they be accompanied by a member of An Garda Síochána as necessary.We will shortly commence Committee Stage, on which I will outline the full set of amendments that will strengthen the Bill in terms of its general acceptance and address the concerns of stakeholders, including the Irish Coursing Club, the Hunting Association of Ireland and the Dogs Trust while ensuring local authority veterinary and dog control staff have workable legislation to safeguard the welfare of dogs.  The legislation is about the welfare of dogs.  I thank the Members who contributed and I very much thank my civil servants for all their work.  I look forward to a good debate on Committee and Report Stages.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	292	Section 1(3) states: "This Act shall come into operation on such day or days as the Minister may appoint by order or orders either generally or with reference to any particular purpose or provision and different days may be so appointed for different purposes or provisions."  This is something the Minister did not deal with in his speech on Second Stage.  Perhaps he will clarify that he missed a paragraph of his speech on that occasion dealing with a commencement order in respect of this legislation on 1 January 2011.  What he is saying effectively is that, notwithstanding what is agreed or disagreed in the House, the Act will come into operation after such time as the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will have an opportunity to amend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 in the autumn.  Will the Minister clarify if this means he can implement regulations on 1 January 2011, irrespective of what is agreed with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food or new animal welfare regulations or legislation brought forward by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the autumn, or can he supersede those powers by introducing his own regulations?  Clarity is required on that issue.

I will engage not just with the stakeholders, but also, in this instance, with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  He intends to amend the 1958 Act accordingly.  This is being done because it is recognised now that the main purpose of the 1958 Act is to regulate the greyhound industry.  It has been successful in doing that but its primary focus is not welfare and this Bill, after all, is a welfare piece of legislation.  We want to ensure there is agreement among the people on the greyhound board that this is necessary.  They are anxious to co-operate fully with us and I acknowledged this in my summing up on Second Stage.  The Irish Coursing Club, in particular, has been most constructive in its proposals.  I want to see this done.  The Deputy asked about a time line.  I would hope we can do this as quickly as possible in the autumn and, therefore, I will be in a position then, at the start of 2011, to bring forward a commencement order.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	298	There is a level of ambiguity which Members thought was resolved last Friday when the Minister said it was proposed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would amend the 1958 Greyhound Industry Act to legislate for welfare provisions for members of the Irish Greyhound Board.  Once amended, the welfare of the IGB registered greyhounds will be addressed through the amended 1958 Act and would then replace for IGB registered greyhounds, breeders and trainers only, the provisions of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009.I am not too sure where the Minister is going and whether he is creating a legislative difficulty.  He does not cite the 1958 Act in this Bill.  By his reference of last week he is stating that this will be dealt with through separate legislation on the greyhound industry.  What is the Minister's position?  More important, where is he in a legislative sense?  He seems to have a foot in both pieces of legislation but he is not stating where it stands in either.

I think I was quite explicit in my contribution on Friday when I said, in so far as greyhounds are concerned, the welfare provisions will be inserted into the 1958 Act. This is very clear.  I am not citing — why would I cite — the 1958 Act in this legislation when it is a separate piece of legislation——

We will ensure the welfare of greyhounds is looked after under the amended 1958 Act.  However, the people in Bord na gCon have agreed that in so far as inspections are concerned, we will have people from the local authorities conducting them.  As was stated by a previous speaker, we are not going to have self-regulation as such.  We have to have objective criteria.  Most people recognise that this has to be part of the legislation.  I wish to be very clear.  As I said earlier, Deputy Hogan's understanding is correct.  The Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food will undertake to make those amendments as quickly as possible.  For everybody's sake, and for the welfare of animals, it is important that we proceed as quickly as possible.I reiterate a point made in my contributions that there are some differences, one of which is that Bord na gCon has a tattooing system, which was alluded to by Deputy Sherlock and which has been in place for quite some time.  I regard microchipping as being far more effective.  I have had discussions with experts.  I refer Deputies to the Australian example and the fact that the Australian greyhound board and the UK greyhound board all use microchipping at this stage.  There is no difference in the dogs' performance and it presents no difficulties.  It is cheaper, more efficient and I hope we can have ongoing discussions on this issue.  This seems to be the way to go, in my view, but I am not laying down any markers as I have left that open for the Bord na gCon people to consider.  I want to consult widely.  This is not a case of imposing anything but rather it is about consulting and seeing what is best for the industry and what is best for the welfare of animals.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	304	I know he has had various meetings in recent times but he certainly caused a lot of angst to his Government backbenchers by his lack of interest in all sorts of dialogue until the gun was put to his head, effectively, in the last week or two.  All of us are interested in the animal welfare issues.  We are asking the House to agree in this section, without any reference to the details of what will come forward in the 1958 amended greyhound Act.  We do not know what has happened in the smoke-filled rooms as to the details of what the Minister has in mind to be proposed in the autumn by the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We do not know whether the Minister, Deputy Gormley, agrees or disagrees with any proposals being made, if there are any, yet he is asking the House to finish dealing with this Bill without that detail.I do not know what has been going on in rooms around the House over the past couple of weeks and perhaps the Minister might tell the House what he has agreed but I am certainly not impressed by the fact that he knows exactly what he wants to do.  He has had a number of meetings with various stakeholders.  I presume he has had a meeting with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We do not have any piece of paper before us today nor any note from the Minister to be read to the House about what agreement he has reached in respect of animal welfare regulations that would be introduced to amend the 1958 Act and yet he expects us to buy a pig in a poke.  That is our problem.In my view, in section 1, the Minister is waving the big stick over the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with regard to the amending of the 1958 greyhound Act.  He is asking him to bring in animal welfare regulations and put them on a statutory basis and at the same time he is saying that he gives himself powers for a commencement order on animal welfare to be brought in on 1 January 2011 in the event that he does not reach agreement with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  We want this to be quite explicit.  This is legislation and there are further amendments from Deputy Ciarán Lynch and myself on section 2 which will reflect this.  We want to see an exemption, which is what the Minister promised the Fianna Fáil backbenchers.  He should not have any difficulty about exempting his own role in animal welfare issues, in respect of this Bill, if he trusts the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, to bring in an amendment to the 1958 greyhound Act.  That is my point and I ask the Minister to take it on board.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13728	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	305	We are being asked to pass legislation on the basis of a leap of faith.  In essence, a greyhound owner looking at the legislation who had not been in touch with the ICC or Bord na gCon in the past number of weeks would not be aware of what negotiations had taken place.  Therefore, there is still a lack of clarity as to the exact nature of the proposals.  If Members are being asked to pass this legislation, I would like to know more about the substantive nature of those negotiations, the qualitative and quantitative outcomes of those deliberations, and if we are to have regard and to have trust in the Minister or the Government of the day to deliver the right kind of amendments to the 1958 Act.

I welcome his engagement now as this is a step forward.  What does the Minister want the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to do with the 1958 Act?What amendments does he see as acceptable?  We must see the colour of the Minister's money.  I would love to believe the Minister but I simply cannot.  I have seen what he has said in this House on other issues.  He said he would protect the frontline but he is not doing so in respect of other issues.  I want to see this in black and white.  That is not here today.  What does the Minister want the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to do?  What is acceptable to the Minister as the Green Party Minister pushing this agenda?

We are being asked to support or oppose something that is ambiguous to say the least.  We do not know what it will contain or what influence the Department will have on the welfare side of the 1958 Act.  This matter needs more clarity.  Sinn Féin wants to be crystal clear on the detail of this.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	308	I will simplify the problem.  From the outset, the difficulty was the inclusion of the greyhound industry in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill because another Act covers the greyhound industry.  That is a recognised difficulty with the Bill.  Last week the Minister indicated he would try to tidy up this but no material change has been made to the Bill.  If greyhounds were included in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill last week and there has been no material change, the greyhound industry will be included in the Bill next week.  However, last week the Minister stated, "As part of this proposal, until such time as the provisions listed above are incorporated into the 1958 Act [the greyhound act] the regulation of dog breeding establishments containing greyhounds will continue under my Department as provided for in the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009".  Will we reintroduce the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill on 2 January after the Minister has made amendments to extrapolate this legislation?  This is the sort of nonsense brought before us by the Minister.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	309	In February 2009 I asked the Minister if the proposed dog breeding establishments regulations would be incorporated or superseded by the soon-to-be published animal welfare Bill.  The essence of the response was that the process included discussions with various interest groups and that it was the intention of the Minister to introduce amending legislation on dog breeding establishments.  The Minister said his proposals in this regard would be published as soon as possible and would compliment measures being prepared by his colleague, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the area of animal welfare and health.Regarding the comment of Deputy Ciarán Lynch, will the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill continue to have an animal welfare remit or will this be removed or superseded by the animal welfare Bill?  What agreements have the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food come to?  I asked if the Minister had been in consultation with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food but he did not answer.

Commentators have also used confusing terms.  Reference has been made to the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill, the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill and the animal welfare Bill, which has yet to come before this House.  The animal welfare Bill is a separate item of legislation under the remit of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  It is substantial legislation, overhauling legislation that is more than 100 years old.  I hope the Bill will be before the House in the autumn.  It has nothing to do with what we are discussing today.  Deputies should be crystal clear on that point.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	314	On a point of order, when it was initially on the Order Paper the animal welfare Bill referred to all farm animals and non-farm animals.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13728	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	343	We are trying to clear the way in respect of the body of animal welfare legislation.  I am sure the Minister agrees with our line of questioning in that we are merely seeking clarification.  We seek clarification on the negotiations with the ICC and Bord na gCon regarding the role of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food vis-à-vis the amended 1958 legislation.  The second point concerns how specifically that Act will be amended.The animal welfare Bill is under the auspices of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  On no fewer than ten occasions, the Labour Party has asked the Taoiseach when that legislation will be published.  We do not have a Bill before us even though we are told it will be published in the autumn.  If this is on the C list of the Government's legislative programme, where is the balance of priorities and how does the Minister envisage its implementation?  Will legislation enacted now be superseded by that legislation or is it separate?  It is very confusing.  I am relatively new to this game but I am trying to speak with common sense.  With respect to the Minister, all I seek from him are some clear unambiguous answers to which Members are entitled.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	344	The job of Members on the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin benches this afternoon is to test the robustness of this legislation.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Ultimately, Dáil Éireann has two hours in which to discuss all Stages of this Bill.  Members have very little time for scrutiny as a result of the decision by the Green Party and Fianna Fáil to guillotine the legislation.  This Bill spent a great deal of time in the Seanad without being much amended by the Minister.  However, he has introduced a whole raft of amendments this evening to which he has given little time.Consequently, I call on the Minister to focus his comments and contributions to the content and context of his amendments and to what Members on this side of the House are saying.  He should move away from the divisive approach he has taken on this legislation since he inherited it from previous Ministers.  This comes down to producing simple legislation and the Minister has not answered the query I raised initially.  Where stands the greyhound industry on 2 January, if the conditions to which the Minister referred last Friday are implemented?  Does the greyhound industry still remain within the remit of the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill 2009 and if not, because it is not specified in the Bill, by what means will it be incorporated into the 1958 Act?  These measures will result in an outcome that no one wants, which is that the Irish greyhound industry will be governed by two legislative items, namely, the amended 1958 Act and the Bill before Members today.

He should indicate to Members what he intends to do with the greyhound industry.  I refer to his remarks to the effect that he considers microchipping to be better than tattooing.  Were the greyhound industry to be taken out of this, as the Minister has stated it will be, he would not have a view on the greyhound industry.  Consequently, he should inform Members what would be acceptable to him in respect of the greyhound industry.  What material differences will he agree to have incorporated into the 1958 Act?

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	394	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 3, before section 2, to insert the following new section:"2.—This Act does not apply to any matter regulated by the Greyhound Industry Acts 1958 and 1993.".The commentary and contributions of the past 15 to 20 minutes constitutes the opening chapter on why I tabled this amendment.  The amendment is self-explanatory.  It is highly disingenuous for the Minister to state this stuff is being introduced by Members on this side of the House.  The reason this debate is taking place is because last Friday, during the Second Stage debate, the Minister was at pains to talk about the greyhound industry, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and amendments to the 1958 Act.  The interpretation that arose from that debate was that the Minister had made a wise decision, having got himself into a bundle of knots in recent months on what should have been a simple Bill.  In fact, this legislation should simply have coasted under the radar through the House to deal with the scandal of puppy farming in Ireland.  However, in his wisdom, the Minister decided to broaden the scope of the Bill.  Moreover, he sent signals to the greyhound industry and to the Hunting Association of Ireland.  I refer to a letter he sent to Deputy Dermot Ahern in 2008.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	395	Did Deputy Mattie McGrath get that one?
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	396	Perhaps the Minister can correct me, because his signature appears at the end of this letter.  He stated:Given that the primary objective of the proposed regulations is to regulate commercial dog breeding, and in view of the stricter standards which apply to the members of the Hunting Association of Ireland, it is my intention that groups affiliated to the HAI be granted an exemption from the requirements of the regulations.I note that Deputy Mattie McGrath is sitting behind the Minister.  He put it more eloquently than me when he construed the Minister's words to mean that if one was not part of the problem, one should not be part of the solution.Consequently, my amendment proposes to get the Minister out of the quagmire he has created for himself by taking legislation that had cross-party unanimous support in this House to deal with the issue of puppy farming.  It proposes to leave issues relating to the greyhound industry and greyhound breeding within the remit of the 1958 Act.  At this late stage, I hope the Minister will accept this amendment and will support this proposal.  This amendment constitutes an effort by the Opposition to assist this Bill by making it more robust.  It does not create a scenario whereby the greyhound industry will be regulated under two Acts and this clarifies this debate, in order that Members can move forward and deal with the more substantive issues, which are the intent of this Bill, namely, those pertaining to puppy farming.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	397	The amendment tabled by Deputy Ciarán Lynch is similar to amendments Nos. 16 and 17 that I tabled in a different section.  I agree with the sentiments expressed by my colleague, Deputy Ciarán Lynch, about the misinformation being given by the Minister, Deputy Gormley, to try to convey the impression that he did not wish to do anything except the honourable thing in respect of animal welfare.  The Minister introduced a form of misinformation to various Deputies, including a Cabinet Minister, which is remarkable, as far back as 2008.  Deputy Lynch correctly referred to that.  The Minister brought the greyhound industry, the Hunting Association of Ireland and their affiliated clubs into the equation in terms of the Bill.  He generated the controversy and he has spent the past couple of weeks trying to extricate himself from it——

The trust of the Fianna Fáil backbenchers has been damaged to such an extent that nobody trusts the Minister to have the powers——

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	401	It is clear that the Minister is not disagreeing with me.  In these amendments we seek to have the greyhound industry removed completely from the Bill, which is what, in effect, the Minister has postponed until 1 January 2011 by giving himself an enabling provision to go ahead with his own animal welfare regulations for all dogs, including greyhounds, if he does not reach agreement on the amendment of the 1958 Greyhound Industry Act with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the autumn.  In effect, that is what the Minister is doing.We seek to give certainty to the greyhound industry that we will remove all references to animal welfare from the dog breeding establishments legislation and let the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food deal with it as stand-alone legislation in the autumn.  Fianna Fáil backbenchers believe they had an agreement with the Minister and the Taoiseach to that effect, namely, that the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would deal with animal welfare issues surrounding the greyhound industry, but that is not the case.  Under the Bill the Minister would still be able to introduce his own regulations through a commencement order in 2011 if he does not agree with the proposals of the Minister, Deputy Smith, in the autumn.Politically speaking, the Minister is waving a big stick over the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  He is saying that if the Minister, Deputy Smith, does not agree with him he will do his own thing on 1 January 2011.  The Minister has given himself the necessary power and provisions in the Bill to do exactly that on 1 January without reference to the Dáil.  He does not have to come back to the Dáil.  He is giving himself substantial powers at a time when he is not trusted on the matter by his backbencher colleagues in Government.  If the Minister wants to be genuine with the people he has been negotiating with, not just stakeholders but Government backbenchers, he should say he will remove all references to matters relating to the Greyhound Industry Act and the greyhound industry and leave it to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, to deal with it in the amendment to the 1958 Act.  The Minister will have an input at Cabinet level and the Dáil will have an opportunity on the floor of the House.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	403	That is the way it works.  The Minister cannot have it every way.  Trust is very important.  We are taking what the Minister has said on trust, that he will reach agreement with the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food on those issues in the autumn.  In effect, the Minister is saying to him and to all of the people who have an interest in the matter such as the greyhound industry and Government backbenchers as well as Members of the Opposition that he will still have the whip hand over anyone and everyone who wishes to have matters relating to animal welfare and the greyhound industry included in the legislation.  We wish to remove all references to the greyhound industry and if the Minister trusts the House and his colleagues he will agree to do that.  He has given his word on the matter in various meetings in the past two weeks.  If that is his position he will have no difficulty whatsoever in removing references to the greyhound industry from the Bill and leaving it to the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in the autumn.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13728	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I wish to refer to the Minister's Second Stage speech where he stated:I have also stated that I understand the legitimate concerns of certain industry sectors, such as the Irish Greyhound Board, and I am prepared to accommodate them as best I can.  For that reason it is proposed that the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food would amend the Greyhound Industry Act 1958 to legislate for welfare provisions for members of the Irish Greyhound Board.We note the words "welfare provisions".  Given that the Minister has stated that it is not possible to give an indication today of what will be in the amended legislation, which we accept to a certain extent, in order to ensure that there is no ambiguity and so that the greyhound industry is not placed in a position where it is taking a giant leap of faith in terms of what the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food might offer by way of the amended legislation, we propose an amendment that would make it clear and unambiguous as to where the Minister's intentions lie.  If he were to support the amendment that would give great solace to the Irish Greyhound Board, the Irish Coursing Club and to every single dog owner throughout the country who courses hares or races greyhounds in such places as Curraheen Park and Youghal.
#TomHayes	unknown-#TomHayes-party	unknown-#TomHayes-dob	unknown-#TomHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	405	The Minister does not understand the greyhound industry.  I have been listening in recent weeks to the Fianna Fáil backbenchers from Tipperary who are sitting behind the Minister.  I refer to Deputies Hoctor and Mattie McGrath and others.  The Minister does not understand the concerns of the greyhound industry, which is represented in abundance in our county.  He does not understand the commitment of those people to animal welfare.  They have built their livelihoods and created employment in our county and they are worried about the Bill which is why they are lobbying us on a constant basis.  The Minister has failed to recognise the contribution that the industry makes to the economy.  I am very concerned about the matter.If one takes any parish in any part of County Tipperary, from Golden to Lorrha, or down to Newcastle, people there are involved in the greyhound industry.  Every one of the people I met at the show in Clonmel last Sunday is very angry with the Minister because he does not understand their commitment to animal welfare.  The Minister is insulting their commitment.  He should consider the amendment because it is the view of the majority of Members of Parliament and it is what the people want.  I urge the Minister to rescind his current position and leave the greyhound industry alone.  It is committed to animal welfare.  The people involved in it like what they are doing and they want to continue with their business.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	406	I agree with my colleagues across the Chamber.  I appeal at this late stage to the Minister to consider the amendments.  We have had many meetings, and they were not in smoke-filled rooms.  I assure Deputy Hogan that I attended all the meetings up to last week.  The meetings are ongoing.  I concur with my south Tipperary colleague.  The greyhound industry is a vital one.  The Government took severe austerity measures to try to stabilise the economy and get people back to work yet in this case we have an industry but we are putting people out of work.  That is why I cannot support the Bill.  At this late stage I urge the Minister to listen to the sensible requests from the Opposition.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	407	I concur with previous speakers.  The greyhound industry is important in rural areas, especially in my constituency in north Kerry, and contributes substantially to the local economy.  Those involved are most concerned about what the Minister has proposed in the Bill.  It would alleviate many difficulties if we had clarification on the Minister's input on the amendment of the 1958 Act.I support Deputy Lynch's amendment.  It reflects the views of those associated with the industry, good decent people who contribute substantially to the rural economy.  It is probably one of the most successful aspects of the rural economy at the moment.  The fear is that the Minister is trying to destroy it.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I fully support the amendment.  It is a fundamental one which would remove the greyhound industry from the provisions of the Bill.  The Minister has said he would remove the greyhound industry to give comfort to Fianna Fáil backbenchers who have put pressure on him.  That is what he has been telling them.  We are giving the Minister an opportunity to take their concerns and those of the Opposition on board.  There should not be any fighting or wrangling.  The 1958 Act is good legislation.  The amendment has been tabled in good faith to protect the greyhound industry.  I appeal to the Minister, at this late stage, to take it on board and listen to the views of the people, including those in the Government benches who used to support him.  He has lost their support because of his actions on this issue and others.

Our advice is that the Greyhound Industry Acts from 1958 to 1993 do not make provisions for animal welfare.  As I indicated on Second Stage, I will be happy to delay the commencement order of the Bill until 1 January 2011.  This is to allow the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to amend the Greyhound Industry Act to include the welfare provisions of this Bill for the greyhound industry.

However, all dogs, including hunt dogs and greyhounds, are to be subject to the general provisions of this Bill.When referring to exemptions, I stated repeatedly I was referring to exemptions from fees.  I do not know how many times I have had to clarify that in the House.  Unfortunately, Deputies are deliberately stoking up fears.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	420	When I entered the House as a newly elected Deputy in 2007, I was quite surprised by the amount of adversarial politics in the Chamber, even when a common sense approach is taken to a matter.  I once tabled an amendment to a housing (miscellaneous provisions) Bill to correct a technical error.  An incorrect year was referred to in the Bill.  My amendment was to insert the correct year but the Minister voted against it.  I called the vote just to test the matter.  This shows how ridiculous circumstances can be in the Chamber on foot of the adversarial politics that obtain.The Minister will not accept any amendment from this side of the House this evening.  It does not matter what we propose, such is his intransigence on this issue.  This is regrettable because he has not been able to explain how the greyhound industry will be exempted from the Dog Breeding Establishments Bill when the commencement order is made.  On that basis, I will press my amendment.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	421	I thank the Deputy for the lecture on the nature of adversarial politics.  I listened to his colleague, Deputy Rabbitte, speak last weekend.  He informed us on the radio that the only reason the Labour Party voted against the Wildlife (Amendment) Bill was because it wanted to see whether doing so would topple the Government, and that it did not believe in what it was doing.  I found that amazing.  This is a typical example of adversarial politics.  It is regrettable and no principle was involved.

I have consulted a wide body of people as best I can.  The legislation is consensual and tries to move away from adversarial politics in so far as possible.  I was heartened that, at least on Second Stage, the Labour Party voted with the Government.  However, I hope it will do so during Committee and Remaining Stages.  I hope it is not trying to appease certain people in rural areas while also trying to appeal to urban voters.  This is what has happened.  The divisiveness to date has pitted rural people against urban people.  It is a totally false divide.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	452	I do not propose to accept this amendment as it would exclude the provision for appointing as authorised officer a person connected with animal welfare, with whom an arrangement has been entered into under section 15(3) of the Control of Dogs Act 1986.  Many local authorities have sub-contracted dog control services and such arrangements have worked very successfully.  There are numerous safeguards in the Bill as regards authorised persons, the first being that the local authority has to appoint the person.  Local authorities have proven very responsible in this regard and I have no reason to believe they will not act responsibly in the future.The second safeguard is that an improvement order can only be issued by a veterinary officer employed by the local authority.  Therefore I do not propose to accept this amendment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	453	I acknowledge that the Minister has made efforts in amendments to safeguard the concerns of people in relation to authorised persons.  The concern related to the type of people entering premises in an unstructured disorganised manner, without proper notice, perhaps with a hidden agenda.  Such people had sufficient powers of access to property without necessarily evincing the type of concern they should have in relation to welfare issues.I acknowledge the Minister has gone a considerable distance in allaying fears.  Nevertheless, he should understand the fears that people have, with perhaps animal rights people under the auspices of official positions being allowed under this legislation on the basis of working for a charity, as defined, to enter a property and  engage in activities that go beyond the scope of the legislation.  Those are the concerns people have.  I shall withdraw the amendment on the basis that the Minister has made certain provisions later on in the legislation.

In page 4, to delete from "at which" in line 16 down to and including "purposes," in line 19 and substitute the following:"or any number of premises owned by the same proprietor where 5 or more litters of pups are produced in a calendar year.".A division along those lines would be fair to all.  It would be very difficult to hide clutches of pups.  Kennel clubs would also be used by the authorities to establish how many clutches were registered.As matters stand, without this amendment, if less than six breeding bitches, say five, are kept in a number of different premises the proposed legislation will not apply to them.  It means that a person either hunting or shooting with seven bitches in use for the particular sport can have one clutch every three or four years and will be classified as running a puppy farm when the legislation is enacted.  I suggest that the Minister take this on board and accept the amendment as written. The situation is wide open to abuse as matters stand.  Anyone could ride a coach and four through it as it stands and exploit it for selfish benefits, so I hope the Minister will accept the amendment.
#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I speak to this amendment because it is similar to one that was proposed by our local club in Monaghan which questioned the fact that one person could have a number of farms, with five bitches on each of the units.  Very clearly, if it is a question of the number of clutches or batches of pups being reared, such an amendment is vital.  I have a neighbour who has 20 bitches.  He might only have two litters of pups per year, maximum, and yet he will be included under the Act.  However, if he were to spey those annual bitches they would be no use for hunting.  It is as simple as that.He is only interested in hunting and whatever pups he has he shares with his friends in the business.  All he wants is to be allowed to carry on and care for his animals in a proper manner.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	459	I remind Deputies that the working group agreed on the definition as being based on the number of female dogs on a premises with breeding potential.  The working group included a representative from Veterinary Ireland, the senior superintendent veterinary inspector of the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, the Louth County veterinary inspector and the ISPCA inspectorate supervisor.  There was, therefore, no shortage of veterinary expertise in the group.The definition which the working group has come up with is clear and unambiguous and as such will aid enforcement.  The group noted the difficulties experienced in the UK with definitions based on breed, which became unenforceable.  The working group's report noted that it was agreed that the number of litters produced on a premises would not provide a suitable basis for defining a dog breeding establishment as constant supervision would be required to ensure compliance.  I cannot accept the Opposition amendments.Amendment No. 5 refers to the definition of a dog breeding establishment.  The Bill currently defines it as a premises at which bitches are kept, not less than six of which are four months old and capable of being used for breeding purposes.  The stipulation of "four months" was to ensure that any bitch which fell pregnant, regardless of how young, would be reckonable when defining a breeding establishment.  I am willing to substitute the "four months" with "six months" in response to calls for same in the Seanad although this does not invalidate the rationale for specifying an age threshold, which was to ensure that any dog with breeding potential was included.  As I have stated already, this should not be considered as setting down a marker for when to start breeding.It would not be wise, as some have proposed, to have a threshold at 12 months or even two years, an issue debated in the Seanad.  Everyone will acknowledge that most breeds of bitch could breed in the first 12 months of life and as such a 12 month threshold would discount litters born before a bitch reached 12 months of age, possibly leading to an increase in the overall number of litters per bitch to the detriment of her welfare.An amendment stipulating a term of two years was tabled in the Seanad and supported by the Labour Party Senators.  I could not make out why they did this.  It is hoped that on this occasion Members will understand this does not make sense from a welfare point of view.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	460	I cannot fathom the Minister's approach in this regard, in particular in respect of the greyhound industry.  It is not realistic to determine that a greyhound bitch could be potentially useful for breeding at six months.  While in general terms, a bitch, once finished racing and if part of a good litter could be used for breeding purposes she would never be so considered at six months of age.  While this measure has relevance in regard to thigh breeds and puppy farming regulation, it has no relevance in respect of the greyhound industry.I will give an example.  A great bitch won the Irish Oaks in Shelbourne Park a few weeks ago.  She is owned by a Clare man, Father Jack Meade.  Her dam, Dalcash Diva, has had three litters.  In her first litter to Droopys Scholes she gave birth to ten pups, six bitches and four dogs.  Under this provision the establishment at which these bitch pups are kept will be, on their reaching the age of six months, regarded as a breeding establishment.  This will be the case in respect of only one litter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	461	That is not true.
#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	462	One has to rear greyhounds and generally does so up to 12 to 14 months.  The six months provided for has no relevance to the greyhound industry and will create huge damage therein.  Under this provision an establishment, following the birth of one litter of pups,  will become a breeding establishment.  The Minister stated that all breeds will be subject to the provisions of this Bill.  He is trying to legislate for thigh breeds of dogs and intensive puppy farming and will as a result badly damage the greyhound industry.  The fundamental problem I have with this legislation is that we will have duplication because of the determination in this provision of a bitch as being useful for breeding purposes at six months old, which is crazy.  That does not happen.

#JoeCarey	unknown-#JoeCarey-party	unknown-#JoeCarey-dob	unknown-#JoeCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The legislation provides that six bitches over the age of six months constitutes a breeding establishment, which is rubbish.  This will hurt the greyhound industry and put in jeopardy 11,000 jobs and €550 million.  There are 17 greyhound stadiums in this country at which people enjoy greyhound racing every night of the week.  Ireland is a world leader in this area.  The Minister in trying to legislate for puppy farming is drawing in the greyhound industry, which is wrong.  I appeal to him to take another look at this to ensure it does not impinge on the greyhound industry.
#TomSheahan	unknown-#TomSheahan-party	unknown-#TomSheahan-dob	unknown-#TomSheahan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	465	I will be brief and to the point.

An establishment which keeps five breeding bitches, fewer than six, on any number of premises will not come under the Act.  The point I am making is that where five or more clutches of pups are produced in a calendar year in all premises, they will come under the Act.  I think the Minister is missing the point.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	469	Amendment No. 6 in my name deals with the same issue in terms of the definition whereby a particular number of bitches constitute a litter and a breeding establishment.  The points made by Deputies Ferris and Carey are worthy of consideration.  In practical terms, there is an onerous responsibility, including a financial responsibility, on individual greyhound breeders in whose interest it is to ensure a high level of animal welfare as their pups will be for sale.  These people are not involved in breeding bitches on their premises for the purpose of cruelty to animals.  They are involved in so doing for the purpose of economic value and of assisting an industry which has been going through a difficult time recently, as is the case in respect of most rural pursuit industries.  They are involved not alone for disposable income reasons but in respect of the economic value of the animals they have for sale.  There must be practical implementation in respect of this measure.The Minister was not fully up to speed in the Seanad debate on the implications of the Greyhound Act 1958 in regard to the registration and marking of animals.  I am aware that the Minister has since then had several meetings with members of the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish greyhound industry.  I am sure he is now more familiar with the activities of people involved in breeding and offering pups for sale.  Animal welfare issues are important to these people.  They have a vested interest in ensuring the highest standards of animal welfare.  I noted that at the time.  I know the Minister has had several meetings with people involved in the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish greyhound industry since then and I am sure he is more familiar with the activities of people who are involved in breeding and also offering pups for sale.  He knows that animal welfare issues are very important to those people.  They have a vested interest in ensuring they have the highest standards of animal welfare.  I ask the Minister to look again at the amendments to see how we can implement them in a practical way with a view to achieving the objective.  I do not think anybody is going out on a limb or displaying the level of zealousness that the Minister has shown in animal welfare issue.  The Minister is trying to create a perception that nobody else is interested in animal welfare.  That is not the position.  We have argued the case.  We want to ban puppy farms where animals are being exploited but we want to ensure the implementation of rules and standards in dog breeding establishments, that are not only in compliance with the law but can be implemented in practice so that dog owners and breeders are able to get on with their business as they have done for many years, without a poor record being cited.The transportation of animals, particularly greyhounds, to places outside the jurisdiction caused me to worry about animal welfare issues.  People who are involved in the breeding of these animals in this jurisdiction do an excellent job.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	470	The issues now being debated result from the Minister not accepting the previous amendment.  As a consequence, we are now looking at all canine matters in the broadest context.  Instead of examining the issue of puppy farming this afternoon, we must look at every single item in the Bill not only in the context of puppy farms but hunting clubs, greyhounds, as Deputies Hogan, Ferris and others have mentioned.  We will spend the remainder of the afternoon debating issue in the wider context, which is regretful and a missed opportunity.   The context in which we are debating these issues was never intended and distorts the rest of the debate.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	471	Puppy farms can send animals in the back of vans to England, without a requirement for tagging, identification, or passport.  The guesstimate for dogs leaving our ports ranges from 25,000 to 45,000 and the reason it is so wide is that nobody has a clue.  There is evidence, although I have not seen it, of establishments with hundreds of bitches kept in unfit conditions and that is what we were trying to regulate.  Since 2007 I have been asking the Minister to bring forward legislation to deal with this segment of the sector.  There are simple ways of dealing with the issue.  We need a common sense definition of a breeding dog, a bitch.  I accept it is much too complicated to define the onset of the ability of the bitch to go in pup by age groups or by breed.  Defining in legislation the age of four or six months as the age of breeding is not relevant to certain animals but it is relevant to others.  I suggest it should be worded in a manner similar to that of amendment No. 6 which states "have already had one litter in their lifetime.".  That means the bitch is definitely a breeding animal.  Deputy Carey instances a case of a bitch that has had a litter of pups, five of which are female, when the pups are six months old, the owner has a dog breeding establishment, under this Bill, even if he or she has only one breeding animal.  I appeal to the Minister to adopt common sense and support the sensible amendment tabled by Deputy Hogan.  We are not trying to paint him into a corner.

The then Minister, Deputy Dick Roche, initiated the Bill.  Abusive practices must be stopped and people must be prosecuted for shameful practices.  There is no sense or meaning in trying to define a breeding bitch by her age in months.  I have had many cordial debates with the Minister on this, but we have not reached a position that makes sense.  As Deputy Sheehan states when they breed, they are then a breeding animal.

In page 4, line 20, after "pound" to insert "or hunt club".This amendment has to deal with the exemptions for hunt clubs.  I know the Minister has an amendment later that reflects the same sentiment.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	494	I do not propose to accept this amendment as it would have the effect of excluding hunt clubs from registration and inspection.  The Hunting Association of Ireland publicly welcomed the regulation of dog-breeding establishments.  I am willing to give hunt clubs the fee exemption in response to their financial concerns on the basis they are not commercial operations.  However, it is important for the effectiveness of the legislation that all dogs in breeding establishments are included.  I, therefore, do not propose to accept this amendment.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	495	I am disappointed by the Minister's response.  I was led to believe he was going to treat hunt clubs in which pups are bred for replenishing packs but not for sale differently from breeding establishments.  Accordingly, hunt clubs would be treated in the same way as the greyhound industry in this legislation.  I accept the Minister's amendment No. 41 goes some distance in allaying the fears of hunt clubs in this regard.  However, I believe the exemption should be based on them not selling pups.  I accept there is a need for regulation and inspection of establishments.The Hunting Association of Ireland subscribes to ensuring proper animal welfare standards in the same way as laid down in the 1958 Greyhound Act.  At the Oireachtas committee on the environment, the association outlined very cogently and to the satisfaction of all committee members that it was operating to strict animal welfare standards.  This Bill is about ensuring good animal welfare standards.  The hunt clubs already have high standards with their own registration system.  Will the Minister re-examine this amendment, particularly in the context of how he treats the greyhound industry?

I accept tattooing is the traditional method for traceability in this sector and I believe there should be no undermining of such measures.  I hope all Members will agree that having in place a method for tracing pups is essential in ensuring high standards of animal welfare are maintained.  However, in the long term, microchipping is far more effective.  I am happy to listen to what the Opposition has to say on these issues.  We do have a certain amount of time — up to 4.10 p.m.To return to the point made by Deputy Ferris, in the conversations we have had with stakeholders we have taken many of their concerns into consideration.  From the Deputies' point of view, it is important to remember that Bord na gCon is now, for the most part, in agreement with what is in the legislation and with the amendments I am tabling.  Similarly, the hunt clubs had a meeting yesterday with representatives from the Government side, and they appear to be happy with the way things are going.  I ask Deputies to bear that in mind.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	499	Is there any evidence that packs of hounds are being mistreated in any way?  There is no need for regulation if people are going about their normal business in a sensible and reasonable manner.  There is no need to be passing laws unless legislators are forced into implementing them to ensure that dogs, hounds or whatever are treated properly.  I have never heard of any packs of hounds being mistreated, and therefore I fail to see why the Legislature needs to impose regulations that are unnecessary.  If puppy farms are abusing dogs, I can fully understand why regulations are introduced, but where people are going about their daily business, doing their jobs properly and not interfering with anybody, why do we need to pass laws telling them they must do X, Y and Z?  If the Minister came in here and said he had evidence that packs of hounds were being mistreated and that we needed to impose regulations to ensure this mistreatment ceased, I would fully understand it, but I have no evidence that this is occurring, and I ask the Minister whether he has any.The Minister mentioned agreements with bodies outside this House.  This is the Legislature; it is where laws are passed.  It is right and proper that the Minister listen to sound amendments from Opposition parties rather than talking to people on the outside.  Have we any role or function in the introduction of legislation, or are we just a rubber stamp, walking through the Níl lobby while the Minister's troops walk through the Tá lobby?  I feel strongly about imposing legislation on people who are carrying out their day-to-day duties in a reasonable fashion, and I do not see why we should be asked to pass a law which imposes obligations on them that are totally unnecessary.

The people concerned have made it very clear that they are complying with the highest animal welfare standards.  These inspections will not be on a regular basis, as some have said.  According to the Bill, if an establishment is well run, inspections may be on an annual basis.  The Dogs Trust has said it is aware of welfare issues; one need only watch the RTE report that was shown the other night, to which Deputy O'Donoghue alluded, in which a greyhound was brought in with a tattoo that was not traceable.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	523	Before the debate on this amendment is concluded, perhaps the Minster could provide some clarification.  I agree an inspection regime is required, but we must consider enforcement.  To move for a second to a different arena, there are about 220,000 private households in this country in which human beings are living and the Government has an inspection rate of 5.5% or 6% in this area, so I would not be too hopeful about the inspection regime for dogs.The inspection regime needs to be clarified, not in terms of methodology and standards but in terms of who is carrying out the inspections.  The regime has an entry point and an exit point.  We are pressed for time here as a result of the Government's decision to guillotine this Bill, which is a missed opportunity, because substantive amendments have been tabled by the Opposition parties which would have added to the quality and robustness of the Bill and improved animal welfare.  It is regrettable that we do not have time to go through these.  Could the Minister clarify whether the inspection regime is a function that remains within local authorities or one that can be subcontracted out?  That is a concern.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	524	The Minister said there would be annual inspections.  I ask the Minister to be more clear on this.  We know that farmers are being intimidated by officials from the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food by being made to undergo three or four inspections per year for the rural environment protection scheme.  I am one of those farmers who had four inspections last year — one every three months.  An act of God blew a tree down over an electric fence and I was denied part of my REPS payment because an inspector saw it in an image taken by satellite or aeroplane.  I feel I was intimidated because I was denied my grant.  Can we have guarantees in the legislation that the inspections will be annual?  There is nothing in the Bill to say that inspections will not take place every two, three, four or five months.  That could be the case.  The Minister has not clarified this sufficiently.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	525	The legislation is absolutely clear, and I suggest that the Deputy read it.  Inspections are a function of the local authority or an authorised person nominated by the local authority.  That is the best way forward.  There are individuals from the ISPCA who are interested in animal welfare.  That is a point I wanted to make earlier but neglected to do so.  Deputy Hogan mentioned animal rights.  We must distinguish between animal welfare and animal rights.  This is an animal welfare Bill and the people nominated to carry out inspections are those who are interested in animal welfare.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	526	Good man.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	528	We have already made the arguments in regard to this amendment, so I will not press it.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	529	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 4, between lines 41 and 42, to insert the following:""public trainer's licence" means a public trainer's licence granted by Bord na gCon under the Regulations of 1961;".The reference to "public trainer's licence" is used to facilitate the exemption from registration fees to which the public greyhound trainer will be entitled.  This will eliminate the costs associated with registration for trainers.  The regulations of 1961 state that a public trainer means a person holding a licence from the Irish Greyhound Board, authorising him or her to train or manage greyhounds for reward.  The public trainer differs from a private trainer in that the latter is authorised to have no more than four greyhounds and therefore does not fall within the scope of this Bill.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	530	I move amendment No. 10:
In page 5, between lines 2 and 3, to insert the following:""Regulations of 1961" means the Greyhound Trainers' Regulations 1961 (S.I. No. 58 of 1961);".This amendment refers to the regulations of 1961 which define a "stipendiary steward" as a steward appointed by the board to fulfil the duties of an authorised officer under the 1958 Act.  I propose that a stipendiary steward or veterinary practitioner may accompany a local authority veterinary inspector for the inspection of premises containing registered greyhounds under the amendment to section 17.  The purpose of this amendment is to give the Irish Coursing Club and the Irish Greyhound Board oversight of the inspection and improvement order process.  It will become apparent that well run dog breeding establishments, with or without greyhounds, will have nothing to fear from these inspections.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	531	My party colleagues and I came into the House today with the intention of supporting this Bill in principle.  However, the Minister's responses to amendments Nos. 1 and 2 have eroded any confidence we had in the Bill such that we cannot support it at this point in time.  I am very concerned about the powers given to certain people to carry out inspections without any training or qualification whatever and the provision that the only means of redress is through the courts, with no grounds of appeal to the local authority regarding inspections carried out.  As I said, my party colleagues and I had agreed to support this Bill in principle, depending on the answers we received from the Minister.  I have asked the Minister whether he has accepted any of the amendments put forward by the Opposition but have received no reply.  It is almost time to vote on the Bill in its entirety.  We are being treated with contempt by the Minister and by the Government.  Sinn Féin's position is that we cannot support the Bill as it stands.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I support Deputy Ferris's comments.  Members may not be aware of the severity of the fines that will be imposed on people arising from offences under this legislation.  For example, subsection (12) of section 8 states: "The operator of a dog breeding establishment registered under this section shall display the registration certificate issued to him or her in respect thereof in a prominent position at that establishment."  The Minister is proposing to increase the fine for a failure to meet this requirement to €5,000.  That is completely out of proportion to what we are trying to achieve.The Minister is using a sledgehammer to deal with the problems that exist.  Instead of dealing with those problems effectively, he has included extraneous material to deal with aspects of industry that have regulated themselves quite well heretofore.  He is introducing provision for draconian criminal prosecution that is entirely out of kilter with the types of measures required.  A fine of €5,000 for failure to display a registration certificate correctly says it all in terms of the Minister's missionary zeal to implement a regime that is completely out of sync with reasonableness.  He has utterly ignored the practical suggestions we on this side of the House have offered in the course of this debate.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	533	If this legislation were ice cream the Minister would not be able to give it to children.  We have a situation where a legislative proposal that attracted a broad consensus across the House has regrettably become a very divisive issue because the Minister has managed it so poorly.  Its core intent remains to deal with the abhorrent and scandalous circumstances of puppy farming in this country, an industry generating approximately €29 million per year and affecting some 90,000 pups.There is a need for legislation in this area and it is important that it is tackled and dealt with.  However, the Minister's handling of the legislation this afternoon has created a situation whereby a more robust, measured and detailed approach could have been taken.There will be shortcomings, although one could argue there are shortcomings in all legislation.  I refer to some ideas not included such as examining the area of granting cheaper licences to elderly people.  Another simple suggestion was that the Bill could have been future-proofed.  The Minister could have regulated rather than proscribed the identification measures to be used for different breeds of dog.  DNA sampling may well become the methodology of the future and, if that takes place, the Minister will have to write a whole new Bill.There is a great deal of insufficiency in this legislation.  The approach to puppy farming must be challenged.

First, however, in the context of the horrendous gun crime and loss of life we have seen in this city and the ongoing problem we have with drug gangs, I wish to acknowledge at least one good news story today dealing with criminal matters.  I congratulate the Garda Síochána on recovering the penguin stolen from Dublin Zoo earlier today.  Store Street gardaí apparently recovered the penguin and returned it to Dublin Zoo.  I hope it has recovered from its ordeal.  It is important that we note occasions of good news as well as some of the more serious issues in the criminal area.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	570	It will be difficult for the media to notice the difference between the two of them.I will turn to more serious matters relating to the Bill.  The amendments that have been tabled are all to do with the treatment of victims of crime.  The provisions in the Bill seek to extend the use of victim impact statements to some victims of crime but not to all of those to whom it should be extended.  The provisions contained in the Bill relating to victims of crime have taken three years to reach the point of being enacted by the House.  Their origin was stimulated by the Victims' Rights Bill, which I published on behalf of Fine Gael in 2007 and which was voted down in the House at about this time of the year in 2007.  That is almost three years ago.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform promised at the time that he would, within six months, bring reforming legislation before the House to give greater protection to victims.  It has taken three years to get to the point we are at now.  That is indicative of a gross failure on the Minister's behalf to give to the victims of crime the priority to which they are entitled.  Indeed, this Bill does not address many of the issues that needed to be addressed.  The amendments we have tabled seek to address some of those.I will read the amendments into the record of the House.  We are seeking to insert a new Part 2 of the Bill, entitled "Treatment of Victims".  The amendment states:"4.—(1) Any person who deals with a victim (for example, a member of the judiciary, lawyer, member of court staff, member of an Garda Síochána or other official) shall—(a) treat the victim with courtesy and compassion, and(b) respect the victim’s dignity and privacy, save that nothing contained herein shall in any way infringe the constitutional rights of an alleged offender or of an offender.(2) A victim has the right to be informed as fully as possible—(a) of his or her rights and of the remedies available to the victim,(b) of his or her role in the criminal justice process and with regard to criminal proceedings and of the progress made in investigating his or her complaint and in the processing of any criminal prosecution arising from such complaint,(c) of the availability of health services and social services or other appropriate assistance or prevention services through which he or she may obtain such medical, psychological, social care or help as he or she may require.(3) A victim has the right, insofar as resources are available—(a) to such medical, psychological and social care or help as he or she may require and to such other assistance or services capable of meeting his or her needs for shelter and support or for referral to other services better suited to provide him or her with assistance,(b) to protection against intimidation and retaliation.(4) A victim has a duty to cooperate, to such extent as is possible, with an Garda Síochána and any other relevant law enforcement authority."The second amendment would insert a new section 5 which would provide: "A victim or member of a victim's immediate family who has welfare, counselling, medical or legal needs arising from the commission of an offence or as a result of anti-social behaviour shall have access to services that are responsive to those needs insofar as resources are available."  One of the difficulties that victims of crime constantly experience is that they feel they are not kept informed.  After they have reported a crime to the Garda Síochána, they do not always know if their complaint is being taken seriously.  There is a deficit or a failure on occasions in providing information.  If an investigation is proving fruitful, they are not so informed, even in a manner that could not in any way impede or prejudice the investigation.Ultimately, when court prosecutions take place, all too frequently victims of crime turn up at the court not knowing what to expect.  There can be continuous adjournment of criminal proceedings without the possibility of such adjournments being first explained to them.  For a victim of crime, going to court is always a traumatic experience.  What occurs in the courts is not always fully explained to them and, on occasions, there are technical exchanges between lawyers and all a victim understands is that for some reason a case is being adjourned or a judgment is being reserved.  The consequences and how matters will proceed in the future are not adequately explained to them.There are also instances of there being a total failure to refer victims to essential social services or, indeed, of the HSE providing the assistance required.  I am aware of a case that has received substantial publicity in recent days and which has been referred to the Ombudsman for Children.  It is the case of a young girl who, between the age of nine and ten years, allegedly was the victim of sexual assaults.  Her mother has complained that the HSE failed to provide her with the type of medical assessment required urgently or with the psychiatric assessment and counselling required.  This young girl is now 14 years of age, allegedly suicidal and the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, has on two occasions declined to prosecute because the book of evidence has not been adequate.  There was a failure on the part of the Garda in that case and of the HSE to adequately co-ordinate between themselves.  The failure to prosecute has, of itself, had a detrimental impact on the psychological well-being of this young person.There are far more reports to the Dublin Rape Crisis Centre, for example, by victims of alleged rape than ever find their way into the Garda station or through the courts by way of prosecutions, because victims are reluctant to come forward and they do not always get the supports they require.  This amendment is designed to ensure that victims are kept informed, are properly respected, that the State addresses their needs in a reasonable way within the capacity of the State and that those working in State services, be it members of the Garda or people in the health or social services, are sensitive to the needs and requirements of victims and also immediate family members, who might be just as traumatised by an event that results in a criminal prosecution.This is a provision that Fine Gael originally proposed in the Victims' Rights Bill.  I had hoped to see a similar provision in this legislation but it is not there.  I am hoping this is an amendment the Minister will be willing to take on board.  The other amendments that are linked to this are in a similar vein, to protect victims and ensure they are kept properly informed.  The new section 6 we wish to insert states:"(1) A victim shall, as soon as practicable after the victim comes in contact with a State agency, be given information by the personnel of the agency about services or remedies available to the victim by such agency and by any other State agency and by any local accessible voluntary agency.(2) In this section, "State agency" means—(a) an Garda Síochána,(b) the Courts Service Board,(c) the Criminal Injuries Compensation Tribunal,(d) Department of Health and Children,(e) Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform,(f) the Health Service Executive.(3) Nothing in this section prevents information required to be given under this section from being given otherwise than is required under this section."Then there is a proposed section 7 which addresses the issue of ensuring victims can be kept informed and have access to a member of the Garda Síochána who is the person directly responsible for investigating their case.The new subsection (7)(1) states:A victim shall as soon as practicable, be given information by an Garda Síochána or, as the case requires, by the Courts Service Board or the Director of Public Prosecutions about the following matters:(a) the name of the member of an Garda Síochána who has the primary responsibility to investigate the reported offence and/or anti-social behaviour and relevant Garda station;(b) the telephone number where the Garda referred to in paragraph (a) may be contacted for information relating to the investigation or resulting prosecution;(c) an outline of the investigation and prosecution process;(d) the progress of the investigation of the offence;(e) the charges (if any) laid together with an explanation of the nature of the charges or any final decision made not to charge an alleged offender;(f) the progress of the prosecution, if any, taken against any alleged offender or alleged offenders and, in particular, the date, time and location of each event listed in subsection (2);(g) whether or not the accused or offender is granted bail and the terms and conditions of any bail granted;[This is a particularly important provision in the context of those who have been the victims of physical or sexual violence.](h) the victim’s role as a witness in the prosecution of the offence;(i) the victim’s entitlement to make a Victim Impact Statement and the role of such Statement;(j) every final disposition of all proceedings at first instance or on appeal (if any) relating to the offence, to include—(i) any convictions or pleas of guilty entered and sentences imposed, in relation to the offence,It then details the various possible outcomes of proceedings as between convictions or pleas of guilty, acquittals or deemed acquittals and any decision of the prosecution to modify or not to proceed with charges laid, including any decisions to accept pleas of guilty.All too frequently, in the criminal justice system, a plea to a lesser charge than that originally levied, is accepted by the Garda Síochána and the courts, resulting in the person who has pleaded guilty being subject to a lesser penalty, be that a financial penalty or sentence.  All too frequently, the reason for those sort of agreements is not explained to the victims of crime.  On occasion, there may be a conviction and judicial review applications are made to the High Court which may in the end result in the High Court setting aside a conviction.  I am aware of instances where the victims of crime have learned of the outcome of such judicial reviews from news broadcasts on radio or television or when they pick up a morning newspaper. That is not appropriate and it is not showing the respect to the victim that the victim should receive when he or she has given information to the Garda, co-operated with the Garda, given evidence as a witness in a case, when they learn from a newspaper report of the outcome of a High Court action which may result in a conviction, having been obtained, being set aside.The other information that is important to be given to victims is that where applicable, the possibility of obtaining protection by use of the domestic violence legislation and the court's jurisdiction to order that information identifying the address of the place where the victim lives or works not be given to an accused or an offender.In the original Bill as published, we included detailed provisions to try to protect the anonymity of a victim where that was necessary and where the individual was under threat.  In my view, it is desirable that in certain circumstances, the court should be able to make such orders.I will not read through the entirety of the provisions contained in this section of the Bill because it will occupy the rest of what is a limited and guillotined session.  However, I wish to draw attention to the fact that victims need to be informed of the circumstances in which they can preserve their anonymity where proceedings are brought in respect of rape or sexual offences and the general jurisdiction granted to the courts to make protection of persons orders.  These are all important issues.Amendment No. 5 relates to limitations on duties to give information.  Essentially, those limitations are to ensure that the information given cannot impede an investigation or prejudice a prosecution.Amendment No. 6 allows that where a victim has a support person, someone who has been appointed to provide him or her with assistance and support to come to terms with the ordeal he or she has suffered and to assist the victim through the court process, that person can be given information which he or she can then explain it to the victim who may be upset and distraught.It has long been my belief that our criminal justice system and criminal law does not give adequate respect to the rights of victims.  Victims are seen in some ways as ancillary to the criminal justice process and not central to it.  On occasions they are seen as individuals who will give evidence but who are not really entitled to information.  We do not always treat them in human and considerate terms and in the manner that they should be treated.  In saying that, I wish to make very particular the point that we have within our social services and within the Garda Síochána a large number of people who go out of their way to be of assistance to victims.  It would be wrong not to say that.  I am well aware of members of the Garda Síochána who have gone way beyond the bounds of duty to provide help and assistance to individuals who have suffered trauma as a consequence of crime.  I would not want to give the wrong impression in that context.All too frequently, because of the pressures of work, the fire brigade nature of services provided within our health services on occasion, the pressures of events, the needs of victims get lost.  We should reflect these needs in our legislation by means of statutory provisions and not just in victims' charters.  There should be statutory recognition of the position of the needs of the victim.  We need to have in place provisions in legislation such as the Criminal Procedure Bill, specific identifiable procedures and standards that should be adhered to in the interests of victims of crime.In that context, making such provision and the statutory agencies complying with it, will encourage people who are the victims of crime to come forward.  There is a lot of crime committed which is never reported to the Garda.  On occasions it is not reported because people feel too stressed; on occasions it is not reported because they fear intimidation; on occasions it is not reported because they have had the experience in the past of being a victim of crime who has made a report to a Garda station and who has received no feedback of any nature thereafter, as to what was done to investigate the complaint made by him or her.  Some individuals have, on occasion, sought that information and not received it.  An added difficulty has been where files go to the Director of Public Prosecutions and it is believed a prosecution will take place and for reasons that until relatively recently were never the subject of explanation, the DPP concludes that no prosecution can take place.There are a variety of reasons this can occur.  The evidence may not be strong enough, some mistake may have been made in the investigative process, there may be some difficulty in the context of the manner in which an alleged offender was interviewed.  There can be myriad reasons a prosecution does not occur.  For people who have been the victims of crime, for far too long no explanations were ever given by the DPP where that did not occur.  We now know that in a discrete number of areas, the DPP has made provision to give information to alleged victims and I hope he will extend this in the future.I hope the Government will be willing to accept these amendments.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	574	I support the thrust of this group of amendments tabled by Deputy Shatter.  We live in a society where violent crime, unfortunately, is the order of the day.  This group of amendments seeks to address the issue where the victim interacts with the criminal justice system.  All Deputies have been engaged with persons who have been victims of crime and are bewildered by their experience.  They are often traumatised by their experience and intimidated by the court environment.  The Minister will say that some of what Deputy Shatter is advocating is already the practice.  The point is that the opportunity to give expression to these provisions in statute should not be overlooked.  That is the thinking behind these amendments.The current DPP departed from the age-old tradition since the office was established to communicate, in limited circumstances, with the victim in respect of the tragedy that has befallen them.  The Garda Síochána has measures that were unheard of 20 years ago in terms of staying in touch with the victim of crime and advising him or her on the progress or lack of progress in an investigation.  Some members of the Garda Síochána are very good at it, others are not especially gifted in that area.  It is important for someone who has had the experience of being a victim of violent crime.  Frequently, such people do not understand how the criminal procedure operates and are bewildered by the twists and turns that can happen in a case that seems open and shut to them.  There are many reasons, and Deputy Shatter alluded to some, a decision is made not to prosecute.  It is exceptionally difficult for someone who was the victim of a serious crime to accept why that is the case.  The calculation may be no more than that the file will not stand up in court or due to other defects.  A judgment is made and it is very important in such circumstances that every effort is made to relay the information to the person who was the victim of the crime.  I do not want to intrude on this debate again but I acknowledge that changes have been made in recent times that go some of the way to what is envisaged, albeit not in statute.The DPP attended a recent meeting of the Joint Committee on Justice, Equality, Defence and Women's Rights and talked about his office.  He touched on this area and his comments were welcomed by members of the committee across the board.  Certain tentative steps, albeit in a restricted area, have been taken by his office.  From my minimal involvement with persons who find themselves the victims of serious crime, I know they appreciate this.  I have dealt with serious unsolved crimes, as have other Members of the House.  The dogs in the street allegedly know who pulled the trigger or who caused the trigger to be pulled in some dreadfully sad instances.  It is very difficult to explain to the parents or relatives in such circumstances what is happening in the investigation and where it is likely to lead.  It is greatly appreciated by those people when members of the Garda Síochána go out of their way to try to keep the family in touch and provide feedback.  In the restrictive rubric of cases I have mentioned, a person in the office of the DPP is allocated to maintain contact when the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions is involved.Seeing as we are taking this opportunity to revise the law on criminal procedure and address double jeopardy, it is appropriate to take the opportunity to express these civilised requirements, that the victim be treated with respect and dignity and that information and communication should be given priority, in statute rather than having these measures in codes of practice or victims' charters.

This group of amendments deals with two broad areas, namely, the treatment of victims in amendments Nos. 1 and 2 and information to be given to victims in Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive.  I acknowledge the Deputies' concern for victims of crime and the need to improve the manner in which their needs and concerns are addressed by the criminal justice system.  I listened carefully to the argument put forward.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has made it one of his major objectives to improve the standing of victims of crime and sought to do this in ways that meet their needs and by using flexible and easily accessible means.  This Bill is one of the ways the Minister has addressed the status of victims, through the greatly expanded provisions of victim impact statements and also in permitting the re-trial of acquitted persons where the DPP and the courts are satisfied there is sufficient reason to do so.  The Bill protects victims against the abuse of the rules on character evidence by an accused who wishes to take advantage of situations where the victim is unable to respond.  The Minister has provided a new structure for better communication between victims, their representatives and his Department.  I refer to the victims of crime office in his Department and the Commission for the Support of Victims of Crime.Later this month the Minister will launch a substantially revised version of the victims' charter.  Despite the well-known pressure on public finances, the Minister has succeeded in maintaining the allocation from his Department to a wide range of groups working with victims.  His approach has been to meet the needs of victims in a variety of ways, including legislation and administrative action.  The Minister has made it clear it is not necessary to address all issues through legislation.  Apart from other considerations, legislation can be inflexible, can give rise to lengthy and costly disputes and interpretation and it lacks the capacity to deal quickly with a range of circumstances that arise in particular cases or as a result of evolving social attitudes and patterns of crime.This difference of approach informs the Government's attitude to the proposed amendments.  However, I will state clearly the position of the Minister and the Government.  Victims must be given greater recognition and their status must be improved.  However, it is not necessary to legislate to ensure better services and support for victims and this is borne out by experience.I, like the Minister, accept that legislation has a role to play but in many instances, people's needs can be met more quickly and just as effectively by adopting administrative arrangements and by making firm commitments on what one is in a position to offer them.  The new victim's charter is an example of such publicly-declared commitments.  I therefore oppose these amendments for reasons of policy and because, as will be seen, they are not necessary in view of the arrangements already in place.However, I wish to comment on the individual amendments.  Amendments Nos. 1 and 2, which pertain to the proposed Part on the treatment of victims, are strong in aspiration but appear to offer little concrete assistance.  It would be disappointing to think that it might be necessary to provide in legislation that individual gardaí should be courteous to victims.  As for giving victims' rights to access medical and other services, the proposed sections 4(3) and 5 make it clear that such rights can be availed of, but only in so far as resources permit.  The Deputy should be careful not to mislead victims into thinking he is doing something when it is all so highly qualified and contingent.  Moreover, many of the services mentioned, such as medical, psychological and social care, already are available to every citizen under the public health system.When considering the Part entitled, Information To Be Given To Victims, my first thought was that almost everything suggested therein already is being addressed.  All the agencies in the criminal justice sector, eight in total, are contributing to the victim's charter by setting out clearly what they can offer the victim.  The provision in the proposed section 7(1)(m) caught my attention.  It refers to the giving of evidence via television links or intermediaries.  I ask Members to note sections 5 and 6 of the Bill before them, where they will see the Minister already has gone further than has Deputy Shatter.  He is providing for this facility to apply not only in the giving of evidence but in the delivery of a victim impact statement.  On this question of the information given to victims, I strongly recommend to Members that they should read the address given by no less an authority than the Director of Public Prosecutions at the annual conference of the Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights in UCC on 11 June 2010.  He speaks with authority and full independence.  His address confirms the central role of the Garda Síochána in keeping victims informed and he gives a detailed account of how the victim is kept informed and, when appropriate, is asked for his or her views on developments in a case when it reaches the court.This brief analysis of this set of amendments supports the position that while one should legislate when necessary, one should not forget that one also can meet one's objectives in other ways.  My preference, which I share with the Minister, is for a mixed approach and therefore I will not accept this group of amendments.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	578	I must take with a grain of salt the Minister's comment about how one can deal with matters pertaining to protecting victims more quickly through administrative arrangements.  Fine Gael introduced a Bill in this House three years ago that would have addressed all the issues in respect of victims and would have addressed those matters that fall outside the victim's charter at present and which I now expect to be included therein.  In the context of speed, it is the speed of a tortoise competing with the snail.  I am unsure in which category I would put the Minister in addressing these issues.I agree the victim's charter is a highly positive development and I am pleased to hear that it is to be updated.  However, to ensure that the State provides services to victims to which they are entitled, these matters should be incorporated into statute.  There is a real benefit in so incorporating them.  It was interesting to hear the Minister talking about the need for flexibility and not doing it by way of statute.  He then criticised the extent to which the amendment is flexible.  Clearly, one must draft something like this with a degree of flexibility built into it but in a manner that recognises the needs and rights of victims and which addresses the issue well put by Deputy Rabbitte in the context of the Garda Síochána. As I stated, some members of the force do extraordinarily good work in keeping victims informed and in being of assistance to victims.  However, there are others who are not so good at that and victims fall through the cracks.  This provision is designed to ensure this does not occur.The critique the Minister made of the proposed section 7(1)(m) is not worth taking seriously because it is about advising people of their entitlement, in specified discrete circumstances, to give evidence by video link, particularly in the area of sexual offences.  This is not always understood in the context of young children and this is something about which victims and their parents need to be informed at a very early stage in the process to relieve them of some of the added worry and trauma they fear in the context of a court hearing.I will conclude by noting that I am disappointed by the Minister's response and intend to put the amendment.

The balance the Minister has struck is correct and it is important to know the limitations of legislation in some circumstances and that tools like charters can work more flexibly and effectively.  Ultimately, it is very important that people are protected.  As Deputy Shatter stated, the best way to provide a good service is for those who provide such services to put their hearts and souls into so doing.  I was slightly amused by the Deputy's zoological references today, which have included penguins, snails and tortoises.  However, I remind Deputy Shatter about the race between the hare and the tortoise.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	587	I move amendment No. 7:
In page 6, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:"10.—(1) This section applies to a victim of a sexual offence after a person accused of such offence has been convicted of the offence.(2) No court shall order that the anonymity of the person convicted of a sexual offence shall be protected where a victim to whom this section applies informs the court that it is the victim's wish that the identity of the offender be publicly disclosed, even where disclosing the identity of the offender may result in the identity of the victim also being publicly disclosed and where the victim confirms to the court an awareness of such risk.".There have been occasions where there have been convictions for serious sexual offences and where the courts have preserved the anonymity of the offender in circumstances where it is the view of the victim that the offender's name should be disclosed.  This can arise for family reasons.  There is a broad range of circumstances where that could arise.  As a matter of public policy, where the victim wishes the offender to be named, there should be no inhibition or difficulty in the offender being named.  This is particularly important in circumstances of violent offences or sexual offences such as those to which this amendment applies.  It means that, where someone has been convicted, their name becomes known.  If they serve a sentence and they are on the register of convicted sexual offenders, I believe the general public is entitled to know.  People are entitled to know if there is a sexual offender living near to them.The recent court case got a great deal of publicity in which a convicted sex offender released from prison sought to prevent the media from publishing their address.  The courts stated quite clearly there is a need to balance the rights of the offender with those of the public and the right to know the offender's identity.  We need to do more to provide protection in this area.  Where a victim has no difficulty with the name of somebody being published, that name should be published.The importance of this point has been demonstrated by the very great public concern expressed about the pending release, on 13 August next, of Mr. Larry Murphy, who on 11 February 2000 subjected a Carlow businesswoman to a shocking and prolonged sexual assault.  He was sentenced ultimately to ten years imprisonment.  When the man is released, he will be on the register of sexual offenders but there is a great concern as to where he is going to live.  There is a concern within the local community that he be monitored.  He is an individual reported during his period in prison to have undertaken no treatments or counselling of any description to come to terms with the vile assault in which he violated an innocent young person.  The assault had a dreadful impact on that person's life.  There is a public need to know in this area.I am familiar that in some parts of the United States the local state authorities have an obligation twice a year to circulate within communities the addresses of convicted sexual offenders who are living within those communities.  That has not resulted in former offenders being subjected to assault or even being driven out of where they are living, but it has resulted in there being a general awareness on the part of individuals in the neighbourhood that there is a need to be careful and cautious.  It is also to ensure that the police force keeps an eye on individuals who have committed heinous sexual crimes.  The police keep an eye on them in the interest of the community to prevent reoffending.Unfortunately, in this area, particularly in the context of individuals who have no sense of self-awareness or grief and who have gone through no treatment processes or therapy when in prison, there is a very strong likelihood that they will reoffend.  In dealing with such offenders, we all know there is no guarantee, no matter what services are provided within a prison, that they will not reoffend.  However, all the studies in this area have established that where there are appropriate therapeutic counselling and psychiatric-psychological services within a prison service, those who have committed sexual crimes and who avail of those services are substantially less likely to offend than those who have avoided engaging in such services.  This amendment deals with one particular issue but it is an important issue.  I hope the Minister will take the amendment on board.

At the time the Minister urged caution as the issue required careful consideration.  He stated his view that issues of anonymity for persons convicted of sexual offences should be considered in the context of legislation governing those offences.  This remains his view.The Minister also stated that anonymity and related issues were being examined in his Department as part of a review of sexual offences legislation.  I can now tell the House of progress in this regard.  The Minister of State with responsibility for children will be laying the draft general scheme of a sexual offences Bill before the Government for its approval in the near future.  The Bill will include provisions that will reform aspects of the law on anonymity.The Deputy's amendment refers to a conviction for a "sexual offence", but does not define this term and is too widely drawn.  It seems to suppose that all those charged with a sexual offence have anonymity at present, but this is not the case.  Under the law, anonymity applies to an accused in two circumstances, those being, where the accused is charged with a rape offence under section 8 of the Criminal Law (Rape) Act 1981 or with an incest offence under the Criminal Law (Incest Proceedings) Act 1995.  Anonymity is not available to a person charged with a sexual offence other than rape or incest.  Moreover, in the case of a rape offence, the protection is lifted if the accused is found guilty.  The accused in incest cases retain anonymity even where the charges are withdrawn or the persons are convicted.I began by referring to the complexity of legislating in this regard, but I will highlight one scenario that will clearly demonstrate how complex the issue is and how change must be well thought out.  As we know, many sexual abuse cases involve multiple victims.  This is especially true where the abuse occurs in a family setting.  If only one of the victims in such a case was to avail of the possibility presented by this amendment to have the perpetrator named, that person could cause a distress to other victims who might be his or her siblings second only to the distress caused by the offender and deepen the rifts in the family.  If the court refused an application from such a person in order to respect the others' wishes, great distress might be caused to the applicant.  No one would win.  I doubt that the Deputy wishes to bring this situation about.  In light of the information provided to me by the Minister of State on the general scheme of the sexual offences Bill, I am compelled to reject the amendment.  Accepting it without greater consideration would be unwise.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	591	The Minister was right to point out that my colleague, Senator Regan, raised this matter in the Seanad.  The amendment was first contained in Fine Gael's Victims' Rights Bill 2008.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has had more than three years in which to consider this issue, but the thought process does not appear to have advanced far in that time.The Minister stated that the draft general scheme of a sexual offences Bill is to be laid before the Government by the Minister of State with responsibility for children next autumn.  This is interesting.  As we know, a draft general scheme is not a Bill.  When such a scheme is produced, a minimum of two years pass before any detailed legislation emerges from the Attorney General's office.The promised legislation on this matter originated from a report published in November 2006 by a joint Oireachtas committee examining the question of sexual offences, but it is only now, some four years later, that a draft general scheme, not even a draft Bill, might be tabled before the Cabinet in the autumn.  The report on child sexual offences and the issue of strict liability was published by the joint committee on the rights of the child in February 2009.  It was supposed to produce a Bill, but we were told the Government was opposed to amending the Constitution to re-instate an offence of strict liability to protect children from sexual predators, particularly older people who prey on them for sexual pleasure.  Instead, the Government favoured statutory changes, which were allegedly being worked on because this issue had been the subject of a 2006 report.  We are now being told that legislation will be introduced in 2012 at the earliest, after the Government has left office.  This is not treating the matter of sexual offences or the necessary reforms with seriousness.The Minister cited a particular problem with the amendment.  In some incest cases, only one or two family members are victims while other family members deny the allegations.  The latter group wants the name of the alleged perpetrator, more usually the father than the mother, kept confidential.  When someone has committed a sexual offence within a family, he or she is equally likely to commit one outside the family after being released from prison, having been convicted.  The general public has a right to know, so this amendment should be accepted.

As the Deputy is aware, a great deal of legislation is being prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel and this must be done properly and comprehensively.  These issues are always dealt with as speedily as possible, but I cannot give a date for publication.  The Deputy seems to know, given the number of dates he was listing off a few minutes ago, but legislation has not been taking the kinds of timescale he mentioned.Complex issues must be addressed.  Making proposals is one matter, but we must ensure they have the desired effect once enacted.  We must also consider every possible repercussion.  The Deputy always refers to the importance of teasing out legislation, which is what the drafting process is about.  It is examining all of the issues that might arise.  We want the legislation we introduce in the House to be comprehensive and good.  I have outlined the process in this instance clearly.  I have also outlined the issues with the amendment.  For this reason, I will be opposing it.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	595	It is extraordinary that, given the revelations about child sexual abuse, institutional abuse, abuse within the church and the number of alleged rapes that do not produce prosecutions, the difficulties that have arisen with regard to children, particularly young teenagers, who are preyed upon by older people — usually men — and the publication of a report by an all-party committee ably chaired by the now Minister of State, Deputy Peter Power, that produced a plethora of detailed recommendations, there is still no chance of legislation four years later.  At best, we are being promised a scheme and the Minister, who represents the Government, is unable to tell the House the date on which a Bill will be published.  This is unsatisfactory.  Despite the verbal sympathy expressed for the victims of sexual abuse, the truth is that the Government has failed to provide the new modern scheme of legislation that is required.  It will fail to do so all the way up to the next general election.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 7, line 32, after "by" to insert "the prosecution or".This is a straightforward amendment which seeks to clarify the practice where an application is made for a victim impact report.  The practice is that it is usually made by counsel for the DPP, and therefore it is necessary to make plain in the legislation that given that it is not customarily the victim directly who makes the application, but rather counsel for the DPP, it should be plain in the legislation that the words "the prosecution or" ought to be inserted.  I should like to hear the Minister's views on this.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	597	I do not propose to accept this amendment for two reasons.  First, a legislative provision which gives a person a right to make an application to a court is normally understood as permitting another person to make that application on his or her behalf.  Subsection (3)(a) follows this approach by simply providing that upon application by the person in respect of whom the offence was committed, the court shall hear the evidence of the victim.  This formulation facilitates the continuation of the current practice whereby it is the prosecuting counsel who generally makes the application on behalf of the victim.  The Deputy’s objective in tabling this amendment is already achieved and so it is unnecessary. Second, there is a concern that Deputy Rabbitte's amendment, if accepted, could give, or might appear to give, the prosecution the right to make an application to the court on its own behalf, without establishing the wishes of the victim.  I say this because the amendment presents the prosecution as an alternative to the victim.  As the Minister stated at the select committee, the right to make a victim impact statement belongs to the victim, and the decision whether to exercise that right must be left to him or her.  We must remember that not all victims wish to go through the ordeal of giving evidence at the sentencing hearing.  Indeed, this is recognised in subsection (4), which provides that the absence of a victim impact statement shall not give rise to an inference on the part of the sentencing court that the offence had little or no effect on the victim.  While I accept it is unlikely that the prosecution would proceed without consulting the victim, Deputy Rabbitte's amendment would leave open that possibility.  On that basis, since I do not believe this would be in the interest of victims, I will be opposing the amendment.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	598	Clearly the Minister is not going to change that opinion.  I accept that and withdraw the amendment.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I move amendment No. 9:
In page 8, after line 53, to insert the following:"(5) Where a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed, or a family member of that person, proposes to give evidence under subsection (3) orally rather than in writing, it shall not be necessary for the court to give any particular direction or warning to that person in respect of his or her evidence.".This amendment seeks to enshrine a new section in the Bill.  That new section would stipulate: "Where a person in respect of whom an offence has been committed, or a family member of that person, proposes to give evidence under subsection (3) orally rather than in writing, it shall not be necessary for the court to give any particular direction or warning to that person in respect of his or her evidence."It is fair to say that everybody in the House knows the origin of this particular amendment, and that it refers to remarks made in the course of a ruling in the Court of Criminal Appeal on the Wayne O'Donoghue case.  I believe those remarks by Ms Justice Macken may have been obiter dictum and I do not particularly want to go into the case.  The point is, however, that there generally is not a problem in terms of the written statement and parties are usually on notice.  However, where a person goes beyond what was in the written statement, and adds material orally, there can be a difficulty.  Members of the House who are familiar with what happened in the Wayne O’Donoghue case will be aware of that.Having said that, the question arises whether it is necessary for a mandatory warning to be given in such circumstances in terms of the delivery of the statement.  On balance, I argue it is not desirable that it should become the mandatory practice.  That is not to say I would want what happened in that particular case to occur again.  The Minister, in subsection (5) of the same section has inserted a clause that  would disbar publication of part or all of a statement added on in the circumstances I have described.  I accept that this goes some of the way towards meeting the situation I am seeking to highlight.  It is important, however, that we clarify this.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	600	I draw Deputy Rabbitte's attention to subsection (5), which he has referred to.  It gives a sentencing court the power to prohibit the broadcasting or publication of all or part of a victim impact statement in the interests of justice.  This mechanism provides the court with an alternative solution to that advocated by the Court of Criminal Appeal, albeit in obiter dictum remarks in the Wayne O’Donoghue case.  In that case, as the Deputy has indicated, the mother of the victim referred to matters when making her impact statement, which had not been given in evidence in court, that made serious allegations against a convicted person.  The additional material attracted extensive media coverage, which was, undoubtedly, very damaging to the reputation of the convicted person. As the Director of Public Prosecutions noted in his address to the annual conference at the UCC Centre for Criminal Justice and Human Rights on 11 June, had subsection (5) been enforced at the time of the O'Donoghue sentencing hearing, the trial judge would have been entitled to make an order prohibiting publication of the matters which were alleged, but which had not, in fact, been presented, never mind proved in the course of the trial.I believe the House will agree that the solution provided by subsection (5) is more in tune with the need to treat victims with a degree of sensitivity, and is preferable by far to a trial judge, warning a victim that he or she risks being held in contempt of court, with the potential consequences that might flow from that.  It is in that spirt that I suggest subsection (5) provides a good solution, and I suggest the Deputy considers withdrawing the amendment.  As I believe subsection (5) is a better solution, I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.   Since I believe the existing provision is the best solution, I cannot accept the amendment as proposed.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	601	I do not see how they are mutually incompatible.  One can have subsection 5 and the proper disbarment of the publication of matter that wanders outside of what is contained in the written statement.  One can also have the new section I have proposed.  It is a belt-and-braces provision which makes clear the practice and the rights of the victim in such circumstances.The Minister is arguing that subsection 5 allows the judge to require the media not to proceed with publication.  He did not give, however, the downside argument in respect of accepting my proposal.  Why should it not be clear that it is not necessary for the court to give any particular direction or warning in the circumstances described?  My amendment may be considered a belt-and-braces approach but it does make clear the practices and procedures that ought to be followed when a family member or relative decides to exercise this right.

A better solution is to leave it to the judge if he or she feels it necessary to ensure the non-publication of matters that strayed from the written submission and resulted in damaging allegations against a person.  The existing provision in subsection 5 is comprehensive enough and gives discretion to the judge.

It seeks to bring about a provision that already exists in the legislation.  It is, therefore, not necessary.  Section 5 of the Criminal Justice Act 1993, which will be substituted by section 4, sets out the circumstances in which a sentencing judge is required to take into account victim impact evidence and the circumstances in which a victim has the right to make a victim impact statement.These circumstances relate to whether the offence for which a person has been convicted comes within the categories specified in section 5.  Those categories are a sexual offence within the meaning of the Criminal Evidence Act 1992, an offence involving violence or the threat of violence, an offence under the Non-Fatal Offences Against the Person Act and an offence consisting of attempting or conspiring to commit such offences.  These are the categories of offences in which such a mandatory regime is most acceptable.  This statutory obligation does not prevent a judge from taking account of victim impact evidence in other types of cases if he or she considered such evidence would be helpful to determining the appropriate sentence.  Judges have always had this discretion.  The creation of a mandatory obligation in certain categories of cases does not alter that.  The Deputy's amendment is, therefore, unnecessary.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	607	I move amendment No. 12:
In page 11, between lines 18 and 19, to insert the following:"PART 3*NOTICE OF CERTAIN MATTERS TO BE GIVEN TO VICTIMS OF CERTAIN OFFENCES7.—(1) An Garda Síochána shall give a victim to whom this section applies notice, as soon as practicable of—(a) every release on bail (if any) of the person accused of the offence or, as the case requires, the offender, and(b) any terms or conditions of a release of that kind—(i) that relate to the safety and security of the victim or of one or more members of his or her immediate family or of both, or(ii) that require the accused or offender not to associate or not to contact the victim or one or more members of his or her immediate family, or both.(2) In this section, release on bail includes a release on bail—(a) until the hearing of proceedings,(b) during an adjournment of proceedings,(c) until sentencing, and(d) until determination of an appeal against conviction or sentence.”.This amendment intends to ensure a victim knows whether an offender has or has not been released on bail and whether they are likely, in the case of the offence being committed in their local community, to meet the alleged offender on the street.  Too frequently, victims who believe their offenders are being held in jail pending prosecution or sentencing discover that is not the case.  It is important matters of this nature are communicated to victims.The other amendments deal with similar and important issues.  One in particular concerns the manner in which the Parole Board currently operates and the circumstances in which it can grant early release to prisoners.  As matters stand, the victim plays no meaningful role in that process, is not necessarily informed of an early release of the offender and is not given the opportunity to make an oral presentation to the board on the reasons a prisoner should not be released.The parole system, I believe, is fundamentally flawed and requires radical change.  We need to move away from a system in which prisoners apply for parole, make a special pleading but the position of the victim is not properly represented.  On occasions, persons are released far too early and re-offend.  Victims often discover an offender's early release when they meet them on the street.We also operate a system in which early release is given regardless of the extent to which a prisoner has co-operated in taking essential treatment to address an issue which would ensure the prevention of him or her re-offending in so far as is possible.  I am sorry for reverting to the case of Larry Murphy but it is a stark illustration of the problems in this area.Earlier this afternoon I referred to the pending release of the convicted rapist Larry Murphy on 13 August 2010.  My understanding is, that as a consequence of a decision made, this man will be the beneficiary of early release, having been convicted of a brutal sexual crime.This early release is despite the fact that, as I understand it — although I am open to correction — he has undergone no treatment in prison.  He will be released from prison with all the same tendencies and difficulties that gave rise to the commission of the offence of which he has been convicted.  This needs to be radically changed.  I do not believe any sexual offender should be released from prison early unless he or she has gone through a treatment process provided by the State.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	609	Part of the problem in this regard has been that the State, in the guise of the current Minister for Justice and Law Reform and his predecessors over recent years, has utterly failed to provide the type of service necessary to ensure that those who have been convicted of sexual offences and wish to undergo treatment are provided with treatment.  Services have been made available for too few convicted sexual offenders.  That is a real problem.We need to ensure that when a sexual offender is sentenced to a term of imprisonment, action is taken by the State, as far as possible — because there are no guarantees in this area — to substantially reduce the possibility of his or her reoffending.  In no circumstances should a sexual offender who refuses treatment be granted early release.  That is a form of contempt for the judicial process in circumstances in which judges, as an independent arm of the State, have passed a sentence.  It is a failure to ensure that the full weight of the law and the impact of a sentence imposed for a horrendous act is experienced by the offender.  Frankly, it shows contempt for the circumstances of the victim and the trauma experienced by him or her due to both the crime itself and the necessity of going through a trial.The amendments tabled here seek, in the context of dealing with the Parole Board, to address this issue.  There is a need for substantial reform in this area.  This is an issue I raised in a draft Bill as long ago as 2002 and again in an updated version of that Bill dealing with victims' rights, which was voted down in June 2007, at which time the Minister told the House that the Government would address all of these issues.  There has been no legislation on the manner in which the Parole Board deals with applications for early release of prisoners.  There is no transparency to the system — which is necessary in the public interest, so the general public can understand how the system works — and no proper role for victims of crime.  We should not maintain a system under which those who have been convicted of predatory offences, who have a real risk of reoffending, and where the public may be at serious risk upon their release, may be considered for early release if they have not accepted treatment.In the context of convicted sexual offenders, there is a strong case to be made that upon their release they should be electronically tagged for a period of time and not simply be names on a register to which the Garda has access but the general public do not.  The general public are then left in a position of not knowing who these offenders are because of the issue of anonymity, which we have discussed previously; and where the offenders' names are known, there is no reasonable way of monitoring the way in which they are conducting themselves in the early period following their release.  At the very minimum there should be electronic tagging for a period after release, particularly for those offenders who have not undergone a treatment programme.

This applies also to the current set of amendments.  I will not labour the point but will make a few observations on the proposals included in this group.At first sight these amendments seem worthwhile, with much to recommend them.  If implemented, they would provide for a complete and comprehensive flow of information to the victim about developments at all stages of the case, including the outcome of bail applications; parole, temporary release or escape of the offender; hospital stays by the offender; or deportation, if applicable.  In addition to the proposals on information to be supplied about progress in the case and other matters, there are a number of sections dealing with the appointment of a victim's representative and, in amendment No. 20, a representative of the representative.While elaborate and seemingly comprehensive, the whole edifice is deeply flawed and built on weak foundations.  There are two major difficulties.  First, the same arrangements are to apply regardless of the nature or seriousness of the offence.  Second, the services are to be made available irrespective of whether the victim in question has requested or feels any need for them.  Surely we should differentiate between types of offences with greater emphasis on particular types.  We should also establish whether the victim actually wants to receive the information and show sensitivity and respect for his or her views.This group of amendments lacks focus and the Deputy has not established that they serve an actual need.  It, therefore, would be wasteful of time and resources if the proposed arrangements were to be put in place.  I must point out that the Garda Síochána has developed systems for keeping those who need information informed, including family liaison officers.  In addition, the prison service regularly supplies information to victims about the movements and release of prisoners.  The critical point about that service is that it is driven by the victim.  It is the victim who initiates the process and asks for the information.  That is how it should be.By way of confirmation, I will quote Article 4.2 of the European Council framework decision on the standing of victims in criminal proceedings, which states in clear and simple terms that member states shall ensure that "victims who have expressed a wish to this effect are kept informed" of developments.  I have already mentioned a useful address delivered recently in Cork by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  His independent and clear statement of the actual position set the record straight on the level and nature of information services available to victims.I note that these amendments are taken from the Victims' Rights Bill 2008, a Private Members' Bill introduced by Deputy Shatter and rejected by the House.  The amendments may have had context in that Bill but now they are at large without, for instance, the necessary definitions for terms used.  I will give an example.  In amendments Nos. 13 and 14 there are references to "a victim to whom this section applies", but we are given no help in discovering who that might be.  Terms such as "parole" and "temporary release" are used interchangeably, although they have precise meanings and are defined in statute.  They should be used with care and in their proper context.  I also point out with regret, and to underline the unsuitability of these amendments, that the recent change in the Department's name is not reflected in them.

#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	616	On behalf of my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Law Reform, I would like to thank the Deputies who participated in the debate on the Criminal Procedure Bill.  It is an important Bill, and although some of its effects may take some time to be seen, they will, nevertheless, be significant.  By opening the possibility of retrials in the event of undeserved acquittal, the Bill ensures a means of dealing with cases whose outcome represents an unacceptable affront to the legal process and to the concept of justice as understood by the population at large.  Deputies will be aware that the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, attaches great importance to the passage of the Bill and sees it as an integral part of his justice for victims initiative.  His commitment has been demonstrated by the time he has devoted in this House and in the Seanad to debating and explaining the Bill's provision.  He regrets he is unable to be here now.As this is the last day of the session, I take this opportunity to wish all of my colleagues a peaceful and enjoyable summer break.  I know it will be a very busy summer break, because I fully recognise that the Deputies who leave this House will be extremely busy over the summer period, except probably for a very short break, working for the people who elected them.
#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	617	It has been an interesting experience for the past ten days or so to be back again as Fine Gael spokesperson on justice.  I am pleased we have completed the Criminal Procedure Bill today as it contains some desirable measures.  However, I regret that specific reforms necessary in statute to protect the victims of crime have been rejected.  I regret that we still have a parole system which results in people who have committed barbaric and heinous crimes being the beneficiaries of early release, without the victims having a say of any description of which the parole board takes any notice.The Minister's praise for his ministerial colleague was a piece of political back-slapping, but I take it less than seriously because a great deal more could have been done and a great deal more reform would have been implemented a lot quicker if the victims rights Bill — a 2007 rather than 2008 Bill — had been adopted by Government.  If it had, we would be three years into providing reforms, some of which the Minister has rejected today.  I would not describe my experience as Fine Gael justice spokesperson over the past ten days as indicating any constructive engagement by Government with the Opposition.  Deputy Rabbitte has laboured hard as justice spokesperson in his brief on behalf of the Labour Party and my colleague, Deputy Charles Flanagan, did the same for Fine Gael.  We have gone through two pieces of important legislation in this House without a single amendment from any Opposition Deputy being completed in the past week.  That casts serious doubts on the validity of the manner in which we do our business in the House and on the capacity of the Government, which has been in office for far too long.  It is far too arrogant to take seriously any proposals that come from this side of the House.I acknowledge, as the Minister has done, that Deputies who will finish their work in the House this evening will be very busy over the recess and that there will be committees of the House sitting during the month of July in which many of us will be engaged.  Nevertheless, in the midst of the economic crisis we are suffering, there is no excuse of any description for closing down the House until the end of September.  We should have sat two weeks longer into July and should be back by the first week in September.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	618	I thank the Minister for his courtesy in seeing the Criminal Procedure Bill through to finality.  It is by no means the most significant piece of legislation we have put through in this area.  The Minister for Justice and Law Reform claims that his Department has enacted some 60% of the legislation put through the House in the past couple of years.  I do not know if the percentage is as high as that, but the legislative burden in the justice area is very high.  While this Bill would not rank at the top, it is, nonetheless, important, given the progress that has been made in the area of forensic science, DNA evidence and so on in recent times.  It is right that the law comes into kilter with those developments.It is regrettable that at the midnight hour of this session we are completing important Bills — we move from here onto the important Multi-Unit Developments Bill — and that inadequate time is given to these.  At other times of year the Government did not manage its legislative schedule very well.  There were times in the year just finished when the Government could not field legislation.  Now, we are guillotining legislation, almost by rote.I agree with my colleagues, Minister Ó Cuív and Deputy Shatter, with regard to the workload of Deputies.  It is fair enough for there to be comment and criticism about whether we should be doing all of the things we do, but the proposition that people will disappear for three months holds no validity.  Ministers will function and will look forward to the break from the Dáil to tackle work that needs to be done.  Similarly, there is an enormous amount of work to be done by Deputies on this side of the House, particularly by those with front bench responsibilities.  The Dáil is not a factory for making widgets or producing concrete blocks.  Time is required for reflection on some of the material that must be processed through the House.It is dispiriting for most Deputies to read articles such as those in the Evening Herald this evening, which has devoted a page to the alleged three months summer break of Deputies.  The article is accompanied with a photograph which was, apparently and lamentably, supplied to it by a Member of this House.  The photograph was taken in the Visitors’ Bar and is described as TDs making jolly at the break.  There is no Deputy in the photograph and there was no Deputy in the Visitors’ bar on the night in question, except the one who took the photograph and one junior Minister who was perfectly entitled to be there.  This kind of trivialisation and misrepresentation of what goes on in here is all too often accepted by Members on the basis that we are expected to bend the knee to this type of denigratory reference to Parliament.  It does not serve to help tackle any of the problems that confront this Parliament that we should acquiesce in that kind of denigration of the work that goes on here.  I am sorry it was aided and abetted by a Member of the House who ought to have more sense.

#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	620	I welcome the opportunity to continue my contribution on this important legislation.  I would like to mention other difficulties faced by apartment owners with regard to the Bill.  For example, on the issue of satisfactory completion of a development, there is no legal means of ensuring that a development is satisfactorily completed.  The meaning attached to "satisfactory completion" is open to interpretation and is quite vague.  The Minister needs to look at this.  The key issue is to ensure the developer completes the individual phases of the development properly and within the terms and conditions set down under the planning permission he was granted.  I am interested in the Minister of State's view on that issue.Both the Law Reform Commission and the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland have recommended in regard to the completion of common areas that 5% of the purchase price should be retained and ring-fenced for the completion of unfinished developments.  Fine Gael will table an amendment on Committee Stage to include this provision in the Bill.The Bill points to the courts as arbiters in disputes between owners and management companies.  This is the wrong approach to take.  The National Property Services Regulatory Authority was set up in 2005, more than five years ago, and has thus far been nothing more than a toothless quango.  More than €3 million has been spent by that office to date, but it has not had any statutory work to complete.  That authority should be the first port of call in terms of providing mediation services in cases of dispute or where owners have concerns in regard to the calculation of management fees.  Recourse to the courts is inconsistent with Government policy in this area and contrary to best practice, and we propose to bring forward an amendment to address this issue.  Moreover, consideration should be given to merging the National Property Services Regulatory Authority and the Private Residential Tenancies Board to ensure greater economies of scale.In regard to management companies' records, there should be random audits by the regulator to ensure proper records are being kept and that companies are complying with the legislation.  Such inspections should be variously announced and unannounced.  There is evidence that a number of management companies currently in operation are not keeping proper records.In regard to voting rights, the Bill indicates that there will be one vote per unit owner, but this will apply only to new developments.  What about residents of existing apartment complexes where there are major difficulties, with owners suffering because the developer has dominated the running of the management company?  Those people are trapped and the legislation will be of little help to them.  Will the Minister of State comment on that?We must address the issue of management companies that are too large and become insolvent.  In Clongriffin, in my own constituency, there are mixed management companies dealing with both apartment complexes and houses.  These companies have grown too large and massive arrears have built up.  Law abiding citizens who pay their fees are suffering because more than 60% of management fees is outstanding.  It should have been the case that one management company was set up for each block of apartments rather than one large entity that is not in a position to deal effectively with the affairs of so many owners.We welcome the introduction of monetary sinking funds.  However, the €200 charge seems very low when one considers the situation in existing complexes where there are problems with elevators and deterioration of exteriors.  Significant sums will have to be collected to fix buildings that are in disrepair.Property management agents are currently unregulated and unlicensed, leaving many owners exposed and vulnerable.  The Minister must bring the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, which was recently passed by the Seanad, before the Dáil as soon as possible.  The regulation of property agents must go hand in hand with the regulation of property management companies.Fine Gael supports much of what is proposed in the Bill, including the name change from management companies to owners' management companies.  This change emphasises that the unit owners are the real owners and that it is they, rather than developers and others, who should be in full control of management companies.  As I said, the establishment of sinking funds is welcome, as is the setting and collection of service charges and the provision that there will be one vote per householder.  We also support the obligation on developers to hand over the ownership of common areas of completed developments to the owners' management company within six months.  In regard to the calling of the annual general meeting, the provision that 21 days' notice must be given to all owners and that owners' management companies will be in a position to make house rules is welcome.The Bill fails, however, to address an issue that has been highlighted in correspondence from Fine Gael and other organisations, namely, the position in regard to single-owner management companies where there are both houses and apartments which require differing levels of maintenance and services.  Owners of houses in such developments currently feel they are getting a raw deal in having to contribute to costs that are not relevant to them since they do not share common areas to the same extent as do apartment complex dwellers.  They are aggrieved at having to pay the same management fees as apartment owners when all they generally require in the way of communal maintenance is grass cutting and landscaping.  This issue must be reviewed.  They should be made fully responsible for ensuring there are fire extinguishers on all floors and that they are working.  Local authorities should grant fire certificates only if equipment is present and fully operational.  The practice of issuing fire certificates without inspecting buildings must no longer continue.  This is another example of light touch or absence of regulation in this country.  Developers could produce the most perfect of drawings and be granted fire certificates without a fire officer from a local authority stepping foot in a given apartment complex to ensure everything is up to the proper standards and that owners could have full confidence that there is no threat to their safety while living in apartment complexes.I refer to service fees.  Certain apartment dwellers pay a service fee on a yearly basis.  The legislation should state that the companies must use the fees collected for fire safety equipment and to ensure it is present on all floors and in apartments.  This should be tied into the legislation as well.I welcome the introduction of the legislation, although there are many holes in it.  It has been watered down a good deal since its initial introduction in the Seanad.  In this regard, a new explanatory memorandum should be produced because the Government has effectively produced a new Bill.  Apartment owners are not pleased that the legislation is a good deal looser than when it was initially introduced.  The Minister should provide the House with a proper explanation of why it has taken so long, almost a decade, since the regulation of management companies was first mooted.  Why has the Minister taken so long to get it to this stage?  Meanwhile, apartment owners are being fleeced as a result of continuous rises in annual service fees.  Many are aggrieved that they have not been receiving a proper service and that there has been no one to turn to for dispute resolution or for any grievances they hold with regard to the maintenance of their complex.Some 500,000 people, including many young people, who live in apartment complexes suffer on a continuous or daily basis.  This legislation is unlikely to make much difference to these people in the short term, but hopefully it will do so in the longer term.  Many home owners have paid exorbitant money to purchase apartments in complexes and, at a minimum, tight legislation should be in place to protect them, to secure their rights and such that there is someone who can help them with any relevant difficulties.We know there are many insolvent management companies at present and that fees have not been collected consistently by management agents because certain companies are not functioning correctly.  Will the Minister advise on what will happen in cases of extreme difficulty or dire financial situations which arise in an apartment complexes?  Who will put things right?  Will the State intervene or what will happen ultimately?  Hundreds of unfinished housing estates throughout the country are made up of mixed developments and contain unfinished apartment blocks.  What will happen to these and what is the future of these unfinished apartment blocks.  We envisage this legislation as a first step.  However, Fine Gael will table many amendments on Committee Stage.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	621	With the agreement of the House I wish to share time with my colleagues Deputies Jack Wall and Emmet Stagg.  I thank the Government for agreeing to complete Second Stage of the Bill tonight because of the unconscionably long time we have waited for it.  Tens of thousands of people are waiting for this Bill to become law and in this regard I am grateful to the Minister and the Government for rostering it this evening, even if it has proved inconvenient for several colleagues on all sides of the House who wished to contribute to the debate.Multi-unit developments are a new model of accommodation in Ireland.  These developments comprise apartment complexes but also commercial units, usually retail outlets on the ground floor, and duplexes or town houses.  These have proliferated in urban Ireland in particular during the past decade, sometimes driven by tax incentives.  For example, it is claimed that in the Dublin area these developments accounted for 56% of all housing units built in 2006 rising to 62% in 2007.  Nationally, these complexes amounted to 25% of all dwellings completed nationally in 2007.  If these figures are correct they are hugely significant.For more than five years the Labour Party has been persistently campaigning for regulation and for statutory powers to address some of the very serious problems that have been encountered by often unsuspecting buyers.  It is true that the issues are complex but it is indefensible that it has taken until 2010 to bring this Bill into Dáil Éireann.  Acute difficulties are being experienced by many owner-occupiers at present.  Some complexes are badly in need of refurbishment where no sinking fund has been provided and all of this has been exacerbated by the number of developers who have gone bust or who are simply unamenable.The difficulties facing many owner-occupiers are very serious.  Some of these complexes are of poor quality construction and were never approved by building control inspectors but were self-certified at the height of the boom by developers or their architects.  In many cases, the management agent is connected to the builder and the builder controls the management company.  In some cases, annual service charges are excessive and lack transparency and, in a number of cases, are exploitative.  Services for which fees are levied are not being delivered in some cases.  Often, there are no sinking funds.  For example, I am aware of a survey of 27 management companies which found that after ten years half of these have no sinking fund.  Often, there is no disputes resolution machinery.  What happens where the developer has walked away leaving the complex unfinished?  What happens in cases where complexes are only partially occupied?  Many young purchasers were unaware, and appear not to have been apprised by their solicitors, that their contract of purchase effectively wedded them to the management company.  As the law stands, a dissatisfied lessee has no practical redress.In summary, an extraordinary list of problems is being encountered by the predominantly young population who are the owners in these multi-unit developments.  Many struggle to repay the mortgage but find themselves obliged to shoulder hefty annual charges as well.  During the past decade, the Government has been very relaxed about the accumulating difficulties.  While the Celtic tiger roared, the Government focused on the developer and the taxes coming in rather than the difficulties confronting the consumers, that is to say, the young owners.  In the worst cases of abuse, it may be too late now to rescue those worst affected.  In 2005, the Labour Party published its own guidelines for young dwellers in these complexes.  However, the existing law is not up to the challenge and the residents of every development are dependent on the willingness and co-operation of their management company, and often the developer, to ameliorate the difficulties being encountered.  In some cases, this was forthcoming up to a point; in others, it was not.  Since the crash, this position has worsened.Having said that, I am bound to acknowledge that there are some positive measures in the Bill.  I compliment the Minister and his officials for taking on board many of the changes advocated by the Labour Party, home owners in multi-unit developments, the National Consumer Agency and, most especially, the Law Reform Commission.  Further changes require to be made and I hope the Minister will be open to taking these on board as the Bill progresses.  It would be a pity, as is said, "to spoil the ship for a ha'p'orth of tar".The LRC noted that completion of developments was an issue and highlighted that the current enforcement provisions under the Planning Acts are not sufficient.  Subject to scrutiny on Committee Stage, it appears section 5 addresses this defect.  However, a further defect under the planning laws relating to the taking in charge provision is not addressed in the Bill.  The LRC advocates a development bond that would indemnify the planning authority and hold the developer accountable.  The Apartment Owners Network endorses this approach, which incentivises the developer to complete the development to standard.  The commission notes that development bonds are usually an enforcement mechanism of last resort.  The 2008 circular from the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government stipulates:It is a matter for the planning authority to determine both the level of security and the type of security that will be required for each residential development.  The amount of the security, and the terms on which it is required to be given, must enable the planning authority, without cost to itself, to complete the necessary services to a satisfactory standard in the event of default by the developer.Unfinished estates have been a running sore in this country for years.  The straightforward requirement that developers finish estates to specification before getting planning permission to move onto a new estate has consistently and repeatedly been resisted by Fianna Fáil because of that party's unique link to the builders.  The Minister should agree to a bond, at least in the case of these complexes.I refer the Minister to exchanges between the Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, RIAI, and his Department.  I received a letter from a prominent officer of the RIAI, in which he states:On 17 June, architects' and engineers' representatives met for the first time with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government (DEHLG) about the Bill. The DEHLG has now adopted a proactive stance on foot of the referral to the DEHLG by the Department of Justice of the issues of compliance and completion of developments: see the DoJ letter to the RIAI which is the last attachment herewith.The tone of our meeting (and of several ‘phone contacts) with the DEHLG has been very positive. But so far as the Bill itself is concerned, there appears to be no Government move towards putting into the Bill [either of the propositions his body advanced]. [For example, he gives priority to the following:]1. The 5% retention recommended by the Law Reform Commission:- this draft LRC provision is supported by architects and engineers with experience of apartment developments; both those working in local authorities (who know at first hand the problems with social and affordable housing units) and those working for housing developers. This 5% retention would provide for privately managed areas of MUDs a parallel to the bonds already provided for in the Planning Acts to guarantee completion of publicly managed ... areas of MUDs;The officer makes a number of other points but I cannot understand the Minister's resistance to the notion of the bond.  Never has a bond been more badly needed than in this crisis created by the difficulties in multi-unit developments?In one development in my constituency, Hunterswood, the residents' association made no progress dealing directly with the developer appointed management company board of directors regarding serious structural concerns they had.  I made representations to staff of the building control section of the local authority and their attitude was to encourage "residents to engage with the service agent and their management company" and that "as time goes on, increasingly maintenance matters arising will be dealt with whatever Management Company is in place".  This reply indicates an attitude pervading local government that owner management companies should act in lieu of the local authority in ensuring builders complete managed developments to a satisfactory standard.Against this background, the proposal by the Law Reform Commission for a development bond to hold the developer accountable is vital and I ask the Minister to have a rethink.  Existing enforcement provisions are inadequate.  In addition to the difficulties faced by home owners in unfinished developments, small contractors are also suffering where they have carried out work for developers but, in some cases, have not been paid.  The bond could arguably serve the dual purpose of protecting both apartment owners and subcontractors.The LRC also recommended that there should be a statutory prohibition on developers seeking payment of more than one year's service charges in advance.  I cannot see where this is addressed in the Bill.  I would like to hear the Minister on this point since, in my experience, most owner-occupiers find it difficult to pay one year's charges up front.The LRC recommended that there be a statutory obligation on a developer to set up a management company by completion of the sale of the first unit at the latest.  A purchaser should become automatically a member of the company at that stage.  The Minister might confirm that this recommendation is adequately provided for.Section 14 provides in respect of voting rights that "one vote shall attach to each unit in a multi-unit development".  I accept this is in line with the recommendation of the LRC.  However, I am not persuaded of the one vote, per unit system and, like the Apartment Owners Network, I advocate the one member, one vote system favoured in an earlier edition of the Bill.  Where, for example, an investor owns multiple units, he will enjoy disproportionate influence and he could combine with other investors to take control of the management company.  At the outset of the life of a complex, the developer will own the majority of the units and, therefore, will have effective control or, at a minimum, greater influence than the average owner-occupier.  This could defeat a main objective of the Bill.   They are not trading companies or for-profit entities but a vehicle to manage and maintain the living space of its members.Developments with substantial unsold units pose a particular challenge to those dwellers who reside there.  In such circumstances, if the Minister persists with his "one vote, one member"' system, the developer will have the majority of votes and thus will control the management company.  Residents are naturally apprehensive about whether the receiver or perhaps NAMA may decide to sell unsold units to institutional investors in bulk rather than to individual home owners.  What will happen in developments where the housing Minister has authorised long-term leasing, a most expensive and inappropriate solution for everyone except the developer and-or the bank?The bigger long-term deficiency in the Minister's proposal is that it will impede the establishment of an adequate sinking fund for the type of maintenance and upkeep not envisaged in the annual service charge.  Some of these complexes, unless maintained and repaired regularly, will deteriorate into unpleasant living environments.  Again, the individual owner-occupier will be most concerned to maintain a congenial environment.  The Law Reform Commission, LRC, recommended that no long-term contracts with management agents be made by management companies at the start of the development.  This recommendation is not addressed in the Bill, nor is the recommendation for the creation of a regulatory body to keep records of the developments and units held over.  Will the Minister set out why he chose not to provide for the LRC recommendation that breach of obligations should constitute a criminal offence?  It was envisaged that the regulatory authority would be the prosecuting body.  Any unit owner would be in a position to seek an order for enforcement of the developer's statutory duties from the Circuit Court and an award of damages to cover any loss suffered as a consequence of breach of statutory obligations.The regulation of annual service charges is badly needed and section 16 appears to fairly provide for this.  However, the requirement that the annual budget be approved by a general meeting each year could, in practice, be too onerous and too restrictive.  There already will be a need for an annual general meeting and therefore an additional general meeting could be difficult in practice and not the most suitable for the detail involved in the preparation of the annual service charge.  If the members do not approve of the performance of the directors in this or other regards, they can dismiss them.In conclusion, I return briefly to the anti-social behaviour that is torturing so many communities and from the scourge of which multi-unit developments are not immune.  Section 20 attempts to address this modern scourge and makes provision for house rules with the objective of "enhancing the quiet and peaceable occupation" of units generally.  However, it is not evident how such house rules can be enforced.  Section 20 (10), for example, enables a management company to "recover the reasonable costs" of a breach, but how does the management company deal with nuisance, all-night parties, obstructive parking, unsightly littering or dumping?  The Apartment Owners Network argues for a monetary sanction and I can anticipate the difficulty associated with that proposal under our Constitution.  However, I ask the Minister to seek the assistance of the Attorney General's office before Committee Stage in devising some meaningful sanction.  Otherwise, application and enforcement of the powers in section 20 will be meaningless.The Bill shows no awareness of the environment in which we now live following the economic crash and the collapse of the construction industry.  As developers go bust or AWOL and developments are left half finished or half occupied, will we have to fall back on the local authorities in some instances?  Is it not likely that in some cases NAMA will have to do business with the housing authorities?  In such circumstances, why should the common areas and public facilities not be provided by the local authority?  Should the Bill not anticipate such eventualities?In the Belfry Hall development in my own constituency the local authority required in the planning permission the construction of a playground in the development for the wider community, not merely the residents of Belfry Hall, and that it be the responsibility of the Belfry Hall management company to maintain and insure this public facility.  The developer at Belfry Hall went into receivership and the first the home-owners who were elected to the board of the management company knew about this was when the local authority advised them to purchase public liability insurance for the playground.  This is another example of what is happening at present.I had hoped to make a number of other points on this but I wish to let my colleagues contribute.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	622	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing time with me to discuss this very important legislation.  Obviously, multi-unit developments are not as common in a rural constituency such as Kildare South as in cities and larger towns.  In our case the management structures are in place for smaller developments.  The retrospective aspect of this Bill regarding existing developments is more pertinent to my position than with regard to any future developments.Bad habits and procedures have taken hold and one can see the effect of that on a small development.  In one case of which I am aware there are four apartments.  Investors own three of them while the fourth is owner-occupied.  That person is a director of the company but she cannot get any sense or logic from the other people.  One of the apartments is now without electricity and is being used for all sorts of anti-social behaviour and, as such, is a deterrent to having any type of organisation.  What could be a very nice apartment block is now marked as a centre for anti-social behaviour.I believe the county manager in such instances.  There were only four apartments.  Where was the logic or sense in putting a management committee in place?  One of the investors is from Cork, one is from Dublin and the other is unknown.  The fourth apartment is owned by a local woman whose husband had a stroke.  She is now the only director in place and she is trying to organise everything.  All the refuse bins, including hers, are full as a result of the anti-social behaviour of others.  What can she do?I hope the Minister and all the spokespeople will not just focus on the big developments, which might be common in their constituencies and where there is such demand for action.  There is also a need to focus on small developments.  The Bill identifies areas in that regard.  How can this single person try to get some aspect of normality to her apartment block?  One has the investor versus the home owner and it just does not work in such small numbers.  Consider the cost factor and the sinking fund for getting repairs and so forth carried out.  This woman arranges to have the grass cut and gets everything else done.  She has asked everyone else to deal with it but they will not.  Why should they?  They are getting their money into the bank, probably from social welfare, on foot of leasing the property.  They feel there is no need for them to be involved in anything else.  It is a disaster zone.I blame solicitors for many aspects of the property bubble.  They allowed people to buy properties from plans and drawings, without knowing what would happen with them.  Of course, the developments were not carried out according to plan.  The next move was to approach the public representative to find out why the roads, lights and so forth were not completed.  It is the same with these management structures.  It is a disaster.  I hope that in considering this issue we will not just look at the big developments and resolve to do something about them.  It is vital to consider the two to four unit developments.  That is where, in many instances, families, and especially senior citizens, have tried to set up home for their final days and tried to create a family atmosphere.I hope the Minister will ensure that the retrospective problems created by bad management and bad habits, the investor versus the home owner, will be rectified and that action will be taken to overcome the problems suffered by the people to whom I have referred.
#EmmetStagg	unknown-#EmmetStagg-party	unknown-#EmmetStagg-dob	unknown-#EmmetStagg-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	623	I thank Deputy Rabbitte for sharing time with me.I welcome this Bill and the fact that the Minister agreed to bring it back to the House to complete Second Stage which will allow the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Women's Rights to deal with Committee Stage during the recess.I accept the drafting of this legislation was complex and while the gestation period of some six years was extraordinarily lengthy, the Bill is an honest attempt to deal with the problems for families arising from unregulated management companies.  The Bill has shortcomings that have been pointed out by our spokesperson, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, and the Labour Party's own legislative proposals took the co-operative route rather than the legislation now before us.  There will be an opportunity on Committee Stage to examine these matters in detail and to amend and improve the Bill where required.While this Bill deals with multi-unit house complexes, the main problem I have encountered is where management companies have been imposed on single-house housing estates.  That is not to say that the management companies in multi-unit developments are satisfactory; none that I came across in this category was satisfactory and the worst of them all was in the Abbeylands in Clane.  In this development, the company and the agent were directly under the control of the developer and the residents were effectively excluded from the decisions that affected them.  In the case of single-house housing estates, the first to start the rot in Kildare was way back in the early 1990s when Seán Dunne's company, Mountbrook, imposed a condition on purchase that all householders were required to be under the aegis of a management company.  St. Raphael's Manor in Celbridge is still under the yoke of that decision, with a charge against the property for non-payment of fees that are far less than reasonable.  The only service provided is cutting of grass in the common areas, the maintenance of which is the responsibility of the developer in any case.  Mr. Dunne's example was subsequently followed by the Kildare county manager.  Managers got the authority from section 34 in the Planning and Development Act 2000, subsection 1(a) and subsection 4(i), which state:conditions for the maintenance or management of the proposed development (including the establishment of a company or the appointment of a person or body of persons to carry out such maintenance or management);Shortly after this Act was enacted, a rush of decisions were made in Kildare that included single-house estate and mixed developments or single and multi-units that had a requirement for a management company.  In the case of a single-house estate development in Straffan, the condition states:Each individual property owner shall be a party to the management company agreement and this agreement shall be registered as a burden on the individual property folios in the Land Registry upon the sale of each unit.In an unregulated market, this gave developers the power and force of law to impose whatever charges they wished for whatever service they wished.  In nearly all cases I have come across, the power was abused and young families with heavy mortgage requirements were given no option but to pay up.  I do not think this was the intention of this section 34 of the 2000 Act but it was used by county managers to hive off their responsibilities for maintaining housing estates and to privatise that part of their duties.  The effect of their decisions was to create a new form of ground rent with young, debt-burdened families left to the tender mercies of the developers, with, in some cases, fees of up to €2,000 per annum being charged to get the grass cut and a burden on the house title in default.The Minister should now amend that section of the Planning and Development Act to prevent a continuation by county managers of this practice.  It never ceases to amaze me that senior public service personnel never miss an opportunity to privatise part of the service for which they are responsible.  Is it that they have no confidence in their ability to do the job?There is absolutely no need for management companies in single unit housing estates.  It is much more preferable that the residents organise a residents' association, charge a modest fee and get the job done.  This also has the benefit of developing a community in new estates by neighbours working together and getting to know one another.  This loose form of co-operative can also tackle other common issues which individuals are unable to tackle alone.One might ask what is the urgency in getting this Bill into law.  A number of factors create the urgency.  Mostly young families are being ripped off for excessive fees for poor services without any choice or say in the matter.  Second, because of the close relationship between developers, management companies and their agents — they are regularly one and the same — a situation has arisen in a number of cases where the developer has gone belly-up and where the management company and agent have disappeared along with the developer.  In that situation there is no way to pay the fee and the burden of the unpaid fee is registered as a burden on the title of the house.  As a result, the householder cannot get clear title and cannot sell the property.  This needs to be addressed for those affected.I thank the Minister for agreeing to bring the Bill forward at this time, thereby allowing it to progress during the summer.  I hope this Bill, when completed, will give authority to residents over their own affairs and remove the current power of the developer and his agents, even where the developer has retained ownership of a number of units.
#MichaelKennedy	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-party	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-dob	unknown-#MichaelKennedy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	624	I wish to share time with Deputy Cyprian Brady.I welcome the opportunity to speak on Second Stage of the Bill.  This legislation will be welcome in many parts of the country, particularly in the urban areas represented by Deputy Brady and myself.  Much confusion has arisen about the role of managing agents and management companies.  This Bill is particularly important and I look forward to its progression to Committee Stage during the summer recess and to being voted upon in the autumn session.It is also imperative that the Property Services (Regulation) Bill is enacted at the earliest opportunity.  The regulation of managing agents is particularly important.  No more than management companies and developers who have not been either honest or forthright in their dealings with apartment owners, the same could apply with regard to some inefficient managing agents.Confusion arises from people not understanding the terms of purchase of an apartment in a complex.  This confusion is also fuelled by politicians, most of whom are outside this House and who are doing it for politically motivated reasons.  They are exhorting apartment owners not to pay management fees and people do not understand when services are not provided.This Bill has been debated in the Seanad and many useful suggestions have been made in the other House.  In all parts of my constituency there are thousands of apartment complexes.  The issue has to be addressed.  With regard to public roads, footpaths, lighting and the landscaping of open areas in housing estates, the local county council should take control of those roads, lighting and open spaces.  I ask the Minister to bring forward proposals on Committee Stage.  Nothing causes more confusion than when a common charge is applied to both house owner and apartment owner.  Many householders see no justification for paying the same charges as apartment owners.I have noted in my constituency there can be a problem in mixed developments of houses and apartments with regard to the landscaped areas which are owned by the management company.  In many cases, the landscape maintenance is not carried out by the people engaged by the managing agents to do this work.  People are paying for a service from which they do not benefit.  We must address this through some legal mechanism so that the ownership of that small strip of land passes back to the houseowner rather than being retained by the management company.I also have experience of strike-offs.  The Bill refers to reinstating management companies that have been struck off within a six-year period.  In essence, this will be allowed once all annual returns are completed.  This is a reasonable but the issue of money arises.  Where the management company has gone into liquidation or has been struck off because of non-payment of fees, the residents must pay fees they do not have in order to reconstruct the company.  Can the Minister examine the situation so the residents are not forced to pay fees to reinstate a struck-off company?  We should come up with a flexible manner of dealing with this.I am glad the measures included in the Bill provide for each owner having a vote.  We all have experience of a developer owning a substantial portion of the apartments and retaining control.  We need equity so that each owner feels part of the arrangement.  It is important the membership transfers to the new owner in a totally transparent way when selling apartments.  Developers should not be able to get away from completing their obligations and completing developments.  This Bill must put the onus on developers in bringing forward the management company speedily, as provided for in the Bill.  Equally, they must deal with unsold apartments or incomplete apartments.  The Bill goes a long way to deal with this issue, which causes confusion to those who have made representations to me.Service charges are important and it is vital we make sure management companies provide a budget upfront for all apartment owners.  People should clearly understand, in a transparent way, what they are paying for.  People are confused when they are sent out a bill for €1,000 or €1,500 and they have no idea what they are paying for.  In many cases, they are not provided with a breakdown of the bill when they request it.  That must change and this Bill will ensure all service charges are transparent.  An annual meeting is paramount, with the budget being agreed in advance by members.  The Bill endeavours to deal with this aspect of the problem.Sinking funds have caused problems for all of us who have dealings with apartment blocks.  In many cases, there are no sinking funds for older developments, a matter to which Deputy Cyprian Brady will refer.  Maintenance has been ignored and buildings are deteriorating.  It is vital we ensure a proper sinking fund.  The Bill suggests a minimum of €200.  This may be enough in some cases but may not be for larger developments.  This is particularly true when one considers roof repairs, painting, decorating and replacement of carpets.I am glad to see the question of disputes and house rules addressed in the Bill.  This particularly applies to apartments rented out to undesirable people who carry on in an antisocial manner with loud music and parties.  I am glad this Bill addresses aspects of the problem.  In my experience, it irritates people when their neighbours ignore them and the owner of the apartments makes no effort to control the tenants.In many cases, annual general meetings are held without proper notice to the members.  New committees may be elected in this situation.  It is vital to ensure new regulations make it mandatory that everyone participating in a block of apartments receives a registered letter to ensure they are given notice of the annual general meetings so they have the opportunity of discussing the accounts, agreeing the budget and being clear about the services provided.  I welcome this Bill and I hope we bring forward the Property Services (Regulation) Bill in the autumn so that these Bills can be enacted very soon.
#CyprianBrady	unknown-#CyprianBrady-party	unknown-#CyprianBrady-dob	unknown-#CyprianBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	625	I thank Deputy Kennedy for sharing his time with me.  I have called for this legislation for some time.  I welcome the introduction of this Bill because since the late 1980s, when some of the first apartment complexes were constructed in my constituency of Dublin Central, there have been numerous issues concerning some of the aspects of living in an apartment complex addressed in this legislation.  I recall a discussion with a senior local authority official a number of years ago.  He expressed concern that many of these apartment complexes would be a return to the old slums in Dublin in the 1930s and 1940s.  In the vast majority of cases, that has not happened.  In many cases the complexes are well-managed and many of the residents are organised and have an input into the day-to-day running of the complex.  However, a number of complexes are suffering badly.  The local authority provides accommodation on a social basis to the population in Dublin and a mixture of social and private housing exists in many of these complexes.  That brings its own problems.  Some of the measures in this Bill will deal with those issues.  I support Deputy Kennedy in his call for the introduction of the Property Services (Regulation) Bill, which is crucial to supplementing the changes proposed in this Bill.This Bill legally defines the difference between ownership and management.  It solidifies the rights of owners and tenants and specifies their obligations.  My experience of voting rights is such that owner occupiers are not aware they are part of the management structure of the apartment complex in which they own apartments.  The vast majority in Dublin Central, and particularly in the centre of the city, are tenants and the properties are owned by landlords.  That is changing very slowly and we now have a number of owner occupiers who are not aware of their rights as regards voting at annual general meetings.  In this context, I welcome the introduction in this Bill of a requirement to produce an annual report that is agreed by all the members of the management company and which is discussed in detail at the annual general meeting.The issue of service charges has always been an ongoing problem and recently, when times were good, service charges increased phenomenally.  However, people, particularly those who find themselves in negative equity, who have experienced a reduction in their working hours or who have lost their employment, are now under severe pressure to maintain the service charges and to keep up their payment.  Moreover, there now is quite a number of vacant units that are causing serious problems, particularly in some of the more recent developments.Deputy Kennedy referred to sinking funds, which are crucial to the proper management and running of an apartment complex.  In some apartment complexes, albeit in a small number of cases, no sinking fund exists.  However, this legislation will ensure that a sinking fund is put in place.  I presume the requirement of €200 per unit specified in the Bill is a minimum contribution, as I imagine that it will be adequate in some complexes but not in others.  Many such complexes have been in place since the mid to late-1980s and I know of one particular complex in Gardiner Street in my constituency, which is extremely well-managed and which has the co-operation and involvement of the vast majority of residents, both owner occupiers and tenants, in its management.  They work closely with the management company in maintaining an upmarket and high-quality development in the centre of the city.  However, they pay very dearly for this and the service charges and contributions towards their sinking fund are highly onerous on some tenants and owners.  Nevertheless, a sinking fund is crucial to the proper management and maintenance of many complexes.A number of speakers have mentioned the issue of antisocial behaviour.  It ranges from a barking dog right through to noise and disturbance from parties at all hours of the morning.  Moreover, until recently, some developments did not have noise abatement measures built into them during their construction.  Consequently, developers are now being obliged to go back at the behest of the tenants and owners to try to resolve such issues.  I refer to noises such as those from people walking across the floor and make the point that people must be able to walk across their apartment or to have a radio or television turned on.  One can have house rules, which will be fine if everyone obeys them.  However, it only takes a very small minority to cause major disruption for quite a lot of people.  There must be some kind of regulation and an imposition on people to appreciate this, particularly in apartment complexes in which one lives in close proximity to one's neighbour, notwithstanding the fact that people have told me they may not see their neighbour from one end of the year to the other.  However, this is the modern way of life and the introduction of some form of rules and regulations, particularly in respect of noise, is very much be welcomed.The division between the rights and obligations of tenants and landlords also is to be welcomed.  As for the mediation of disputes, there have been a number of disputes around the city which have never been resolved.  Tenants and owner-occupiers find themselves in a very difficult position because the developer had complete control of the management company and chose the management agent.  Consequently, such people have absolutely no input or have not even been informed by the developer of the identity of those to whom they should speak in the event of a dispute.  In some places, there has been a complete lack of co-operation or exchange of information.I also welcome the fact that the Bill also covers existing complexes.  As I noted, while there have been elements of antisocial behaviour in some complexes, this happens in every housing estate, be it private or public, around the country and is a law and order issue.  I have also often noticed recently that many residents of apartment complexes have become involved in their local communities.  For example, in one case the tenants and owner-occupiers in a particular complex joined the local community policing forum.  They were dealing with issues pertaining to antisocial behaviour and this is greatly to be welcomed.  Finally, I note that many such complexes were never designed or built to house families.  In future, a major effort must be made to ensure that any future developments take account of a family units which may grow over time.  There are no facilities for children in many complexes and this leads to tension within the complexes themselves.  However, I greatly welcome the introduction of this legislation and I wish it a speedy passage through the Dáil.

#AlanShatter	unknown-#AlanShatter-party	unknown-#AlanShatter-dob	unknown-#AlanShatter-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	628	At the outset, I welcome the fact that we are having a debate on this Bill.  This is legislation that probably should have been passed a decade ago and it is quite extraordinary that, having been published last year, it is only being debated in the dying hours of this session of the Dáil.  Indeed, it would not have been taken if not for the pleas from both Fine Gael and the Labour Party that we complete Second Stage tonight in the hope that we can take Committee Stage during the vacation.I have heard the very eloquent speeches delivered by my colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, and by Deputies from the Labour Party, including Deputy Rabbitte, and I have heard nothing said from this side of the House with which I disagree.  I wish to touch on one or two issues that have not yet been raised.  If I repeat something to which the other Deputies have referred, I apologise but there are one or two issues that are worth addressing.In the context of the subject under discussion, which essentially is the apartments built across this country, we should have had legislation put in place a long time ago delineating the rights of those who purchased the apartments, how management companies operating the apartments should function, how the apartment owners should control them and rules to ensure these companies were not controlled by developers in their interests and to the exclusion often of people who acquired apartments.  Far too frequently, management fees have been used to complete work that the developer was required to complete but failed to complete under the planning permissions and conditions granted.  That occurred in circumstances in which those who owned apartments could not control what was occurring and the developer essentially appointed his own agent to control the way in which the apartment management company was being run.Like other speakers, I recognise there are a number of very good things in this Bill, but I think though that it requires some further development and I think there are areas that have not been addressed.  In the context of dealing with the payment of the annual management charges, one of the huge difficulties for existing apartment owners is that within every major apartment block of which I am aware in my constituency, there always is a number of individuals who fail to pay their annual charges.  Furthermore, depending on the efficiency of the management company or agent who has been appointed, these often run into substantial arrears that are to the detriment of other dwellers in that block and they can create a huge difficulty in the context both of the meeting of the real annual charges and expenditure surrounding the apartment but in the establishment of a sinking fund to ensure that future funds are available if difficulties arise simply in the general maintenance area.  I regret that this Bill does not implement a particular recommendation that I think was made by the Law Reform Commission, which is that it should be possible to recoup management charges arrears through the small claims court.  There should be no necessity to do this through the ordinary courts structure which will make it more long-drawn out and expensive.There should be easy access to the small claims court, an application that can be made without the necessity for lawyers to be recruited by management companies or agents appointed.  In circumstances in which someone has not paid their annual charge it should be possible within three months of arrears accumulating to make that application.  The legislation should be amended to deal with that.In the context of apartments generally, we are regularly critical of developers.  There have been some very well constructed apartments in the city and county of Dublin and there have been appallingly poorly constructed apartments which are little short of boxes that have been sold at exorbitant prices to people.  Part of the blame for that lies at the feet of the Government for failing to ensure that our planning laws prevented the construction of the poor type of structures we have, but part of it rests with the local authorities.  The local authorities have been far too ready to grant inappropriate planning permissions for the construction of apartments that provide no reasonable living space for young couples or families.  They seem to believe that all apartments when rented, even when they are two-bedroom or three-bedroom apartments, will be inhabited by two adults who will never conceive children.  I am familiar with myriad apartment blocks around the city and county of Dublin which are not children-friendly or family-friendly.  Now because we have thousands of young people with young children trapped in negative equity in these apartments they have no way out.  They have no alternative to move anywhere.  That will create a huge problem if we do not address it.  I appreciate it cannot be addressed in the Bill but it is a major problem.The other problem is the ideological issue which we have had, particularly in the area administered by Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council in part of my constituency where planners seem to be of the belief ideologically that when one constructs apartments one does not provide adequate space for car parking.  The ideological view was that everyone should travel by public transport even where public transport was grossly inadequate.  I am aware of apartment blocks in my constituency in Sandyford where if one has a two-bedroom apartment one might have been sold one parking space or one parking space came with it.  In circumstances where a couple or two individuals are living in an apartment who both have to work and have to go in completely different directions to work, who have to work just to pay the damn mortgage on the overpriced apartment that they have purchased, and they need cars to get to their work as there is no possibility of using public transport to get to work because it is so poor, there is not even basic car parking spaces.  There are not car parking spaces for visitors or family to visit young couples who feel isolated.I am talking about the Sandyford-Stepaside area in my constituency.  It is a complete disgrace that we had a local authority so ideologically committed to public transport that it did not allow for the very basic facility of visitor car parking.  If someone has a birthday party for a child and relations are coming from outside Dublin or other parts of Dublin there is nowhere to leave cars.  There are double yellow lines everywhere.  It is quite outrageous.In the context of this particular Bill there are areas of difficulty that need to be addressed.  One of the problems is where one has large numbers of vacant apartments and developers have got into difficulties and apartments are being sold now by way of fire sales, either by estate agents or by liquidators or receivers.  There is a real difficulty with regard to the completion of outstanding works within the apartment complex.  That is an issue that needs to be dealt with.  It will become an even greater problem in the context of NAMA.  When NAMA starts getting vesting orders for multi-unit blocks to be transferred to it and it gets involved in the sale of apartments and fire sales — NAMA is the body that may initially be involved in the organisation of the companies as provided for in this Bill to run the apartments — we need specific provisions relating to how NAMA will interact with certain functions in regard to the Bill when it takes over from developers.  The Bill makes provision in particular with regard to developers but it does not deal with receivers, liquidators or NAMA where those individuals have taken possession of apartment blocks or they are involved in the sale.The final point I wish to make is one other Members have raised but it really needs to be said.  I just cannot understand why the Bill is confined to multi-unit developments with the definition given.  Again, in my constituency and in other parts of Dublin there are developments which incorporate apartment blocks and individual houses, all being looked after by a management company.  The units remain private.  They are not taken in charge by the local authority and services have to be paid for in the context of cutting the grass and other matters.  Under this Bill, those who own single unit houses within a complex are excluded and their situation is not addressed because the house is not a multi-unit.  People own individual houses next door to apartments within the same development and subject to charges levied by a management company but they are not properly addressed in the Bill.  This is something which should be considered and dealt with.

At a rough count there are approximately 600,000 people in management company developments, there are 4,600 management companies altogether and 400 different management agents.  In my constituency of Dublin West at least 7,000 of the 32,000 housing units are covered by management companies.  I include areas such as Tyrrelstown, Ongar, Hollystown, the former Phoenix Park racecourse, Diswellstown, Farmleigh, the Waterville area around Blanchardstown hospital and some of the apartments around the Blanchardstown centre.I know a little bit about the subject myself as I live in a management company development and pay management fees.  Management companies can apply to many different types of development.  There are apartments, gated housing, un-gated housing and mixed developments, not just in terms of a mix of houses and apartments but in terms of developments that are partially commercial and partially residential.The legislation is overdue.  There was a commitment to it in the programme for  Government of the first Fianna Fáil Government in 1997 but it was not done.  Much work has been done by the Fine Gael party, the Labour Party and the Law Reform Commission, the National Consumer Agency, the Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement and also the Apartment Owners Network.  The legislation is very much needed for a number of reasons.  There has not been a clear law up until now.  In many cases developers controlled developments through golden shares or through provisions which allowed them not to have a proper AGM until all the units were sold.  There is also the fact that many charges are unfair.  AGMs are often held improperly.  In many cases there are not sinking funds or, as in the case of my development, the issue of unpaid fees for the past ten years arises.  There is also the fact that there are still concerns over the completion and transfer of developments.I am not convinced that the Bill as drafted is adequate.  It has been watered down and amended in the Seanad.  Reading through the Seanad debate I found it difficult to understand exactly what the amendments were about and their significance.  I very much endorse Deputy Terence Flanagan's call for a new explanatory memorandum to the Bill.I organised a public meeting which was an interesting thing to do where I presented to people who live in management company developments in my area what was in the Bill and asked them what they thought of it and what should be in it.  My contribution is based on that.  There are many good things in the Bill.  As I am time constrained I will not mention them but there are some areas about which I have concerns and would like clarification in the Minister's response, or if not then at least at some stage.  The first issue relates to the one unit, one vote provision.  That seems to have been slightly changed in the Seanad but I do not fully understand what happened in that regard.  Perhaps someone might explain how that has been changed.  I would like to know in particular whether the provision will apply retrospectively and if it will apply to existing management companies.  Will it apply to them or if it will only apply to new developments that have yet to be built?  That is crucial for everyone who currently lives in an apartment development.  I would also be interested to know how it affects the master lease rules in existing developments.Deputy Rabbitte proposed that it should be one member, one vote.  I can see problems with that as well.  If someone owns, for example, three apartments in a development he or she is paying three times as much in fees and therefore to a certain extent that would give him or her greater voting rights but there might be a mechanism to prevent any one owner or developer having a controlling interest of greater than 50%.  That can be done in a different way.  What should be in the Bill, but which is not, is a proper system for the dissolution of management companies.  Management companies have been dissolved in Castlecurragh in my constituency but this involves a very difficult process.  There should be a proper system for achieving this.There should be a proper system for the separation of management companies.  In mixed developments, management companies for the apartments should be separate from those for the houses, if there should be one for the Houses at all.  There is no proper system of separation.  Separation can be achieved but it is extremely complicated.  It involves splitting the folio and title, closing one company and establishing two or three new ones in its place.  There needs to be a better system to achieve this.  From reading the transcript of proceedings in the Seanad, I believe the legislation now applies to mixed developments.  Perhaps this can be clarified.What is the position on agents?  There are a number of cases in Dublin 15 in which management companies have not filed annual accounts or, in some cases, have been struck off or are close to being struck off, yet their agents are still sending bills on their behalf.  Will this be addressed in the Bill?I agree with Deputy Shatter's proposal that we should allow owners of management companies to use the small claims court procedure to pursue debts.  It is very hard and expensive to pursue debts.  There should be a specific provision on solicitors' obligations, including the obligation to inform buyers of houses or apartments in management company developments as to what they are doing.  Many people tell me they did not understand what they were buying into and that their solicitor did not explain it.  When I heard this on the first few occasions, I did not really believe it, but now I have heard it too many times not to believe it.  This needs to be addressed in the legislation.Solicitors should be obliged to inform the management company of a change of ownership.  There have been a number of cases where management companies have not been informed when apartments have been sold, resulting in the sending of bills to people who are no longer the owners.The completion of developments comprises a difficult area.  In the case of a traditional housing estate, the council determines at the time of taking charge whether the development has been built in accordance with the plans.  If it has been, a bond is paid.  This system does not work because the bonds are so small.  They are trivial in Ireland by comparison with those in the United Kingdom.  There are many developers who are happy enough to forego their bond knowing full well that completing the development properly would cost a lot more.  I hope the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government will consider this in his reforms and increase significantly the bonds developers must pay so they will not be worth losing, thus incentivising them to finish their jobs.The system is complicated in multi-unit developments because they are not taken in charge.  Who determines whether the development has been completed according to the plans?  In theory, the local authority should do so but this does not really happen because the developers do not request the refund of the bonds because they are so small.  What happens is that the developer transfers ownership of the common areas to the management company, which it then controls.  Nobody ever checks before the transfer that the development has been completed in accordance with the plan.  Consequently, management companies comprising residents often find out they are the owners of common areas transferred to them by developers without having had a say in ensuring those areas were checked for snags and completed.  This is not covered in the legislation in so far as I interpret it.If a management company is struck off, a six-year period must elapse before it can return to the register.  This is good.  It is not clear where the sinking fund goes when a company is struck off, nor is the fate of the common areas clear.  Does a sinking fund that has accumulated transfer to the Minister for Finance if a company is struck off and cannot be recovered?Provisions are required on charging interest.  Management companies or their agents should have to give notice before charging interest.According to the first draft of the Bill, a €200 sinking fund was to be imposed on everyone.  This would be difficult in some cases.  It would be very appropriate in some cases but not necessarily in all cases.  I know of some developments — in the Waterville area of Dublin 15, for example — in respect of which the developers left behind very large sinking funds worth from €40,000 to €100,000.  There is no reason to charge people €200 on top of their existing management fee in such circumstances.The owners of houses in mixed developments often pay a small management fee of only €150 or €200.  To add an extra €200 to this would be unreasonable.  A sinking fund is for long-term repairs that may be required to apartment buildings, not houses.  I am not clear whether this was addressed in the amendments in the Seanad.Will there be provisions for the bonding of sinking funds?  I am very concerned about management companies and agents collecting huge sums in sinking funds that are not regulated at all.  I am concerned that such funds, where they exist, could be dipped into or invested inappropriately.  There should be a system in which sinking funds would be bonds.  I look forward to hearing the Minister of State's response to my queries and requests for improvements.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	630	Tá mé ag roinnt mo chuid ama leis an Teachta Chris Andews.  Cuirim fáilte roimh an deis labhairt ar an mBille um Fhorbairtí Ilaonad 2009.  I ndáiríre, tá sé thar am go mbeadh an dlí seo againn.  Tá sé thar a bheith deacair ar a lán daoine atá ag déanamh iarrachta íoc as na hárasáin, srl., atá acu go dtagann billí uafásacha móra anuas orthu gan aon fhreagracht, i ndáiríre, uathu siúd a ghearrann na costais sin orthu.As the newly appointed spokesperson on justice for the Green Party, I welcome the opportunity to engage on this legislation from the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  I have had hundreds of representations from people in my constituency, Dublin North, who have had problems, often intractable and frustrating, with management companies.  While one may say a buyer-beware caveat should have been adhered to when making a purchase and receiving legal advice, that is not very comforting for anybody.  Legislation in this area has been lacking and it is high time we had it.  I hope that when this legislation is passed, many people will have a say in and an ability to influence their own destinies, more so than heretofore.As a consequence of the exploitation of apartment dwellers and the unjustifiable fees demanded, many of us in the Green Party, when negotiating the programme for Government, were determined to ensure this legislation would be rigorous and that it would be forthcoming as quickly as possible.  It is important that we consider Second Stage before the recess so we can deal with Committee Stage.Let me give a flavour of correspondence I received from a certain individual.  He states he purchased a duplex unit under the shared ownership scheme with Fingal County Council.  He was told by the council the management fee would be €550 per year and that this would include insurance and bin charges.  He says that others were told different things.  He was told the charge was for the year.  He lives in a courtyard where there is no street lighting.  There were lights but they were not switched on until late October or the start of November, thus creating a danger for pedestrians in the area.  The manager of the management company resigned and the director was a developer.  A new management company was introduced and again the developer appeared as a director.  This is bizarre but unfortunately not unique or unusual.  My constituent has not been able to make contact with the individuals concerned, never mind have a say in his destiny.  He was landed with a bill of €940 in service charges for his duplex apartment, including an additional €250 fee for refuse services.  This differed considerably from what he was told to expect.  When he was given a breakdown of the charges, they included such services as external window cleaning, but there is no record and certainly no evidence of window cleaning ever having been carried out.Unfortunately, this type of carry-on has been rife and many people have rightly complained.  It is no wonder that so many of us have been approached by people who have become fed up and frustrated by this level of exploitation.  As other Deputies stated, some of this exploitation has also been visited upon householders in estates that include apartments and are caught up in management company structures.  We need to clarify the matter, as amendments may be necessary to ensure we do not create a blind spot in respect of those who, while not living in multi-unit developments, are affected by the same issues.Some Deputies referred to refusals to pay management fees.  I have encountered such incidents, but I hope they constitute the end of this type of stand-off.  As Deputy Terence Flanagan stated while discussing fire safety, a genuine risk is created when a stand-off leads to fees not being paid, in that stair-wells might not be cleaned and rubbish might accumulate.  Before people know it, they will have created the conditions that can become the subject of an inquiry as to why rubbish was left to accumulate and a fire was caused, although hopefully one without tragic consequences.  I share the Deputy's concerns about fire safety and inspections, but I hope we will see an end to the type of militant stand-off that could end in a fire disaster.I hope the Minister for Justice and Law Reform will provide clarification on a number of issues before we consider amendments.  Local authorities must be involved in the drafting of this legislation.  In some instances, a management company has been established as an easy way for a local authority not to take charge of a development.  During the time of the so-called building boom, the perception might have been that taking charge of further developments would have stretched local authorities' staffing resources to an unmanageable degree.  Therefore, management companies were an attractive interim or longer term arrangement.  The system has become fixed and we are left with a legacy of places with management companies that should not have them.  For all intents and purposes, they are straightforward housing estates, not multi-unit developments.This matter must be revisited and clarified, given the level of confusion affecting the residents of estates in my constituency.  With residents from one estate, I met the Minister of State, Deputy Cuffe, to try to iron out where building regulation law was inadequate.  While it might be inadequate in some respects, it might also be the case that local authorities have not provided sufficient levels of inspection or followed up on complaints and have instead off-loaded those complaints to a management company that is not qualified or in a position to take on what the local authority should have been doing.  I hope the legislation can iron out this grey area.  If additional legislation is required to upgrade our building control regulations, let us have it quickly because people are suffering for want of robust legislation.This Bill is essential, but building regulation law must be tightened.  The responsibilities of management companies need to be defined and responsibility for building control needs to be clarified.  There should be no confusion.  Local authorities need to be involved, as it is their responsibility to ensure proper building regulation is in place.  Residents should expect no less.
#ChrisAndrews	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-party	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-dob	unknown-#ChrisAndrews-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on the Bill.  The term "multi-unit development" is used to describe a building comprising multiple residential properties that share certain physical areas, such as car parks, halls and gardens, and certain services, including security and waste disposal.  Notwithstanding Deputy Sargent's comments, the Bill will give home owners who live in multi-unit developments like apartment blocks or small housing estates much greater and long awaited legal protection when enacted.  I am pleased to note that the legislation will cover not only new developments, but those that have already been completed.As a public representative for Dublin South-East, I am all too familiar with the considerable problems people have experienced with developers who have been reluctant to hand over developments' common areas after their completion.  I regularly receive correspondence from constituents who have experienced difficulties with the property management companies assigned to manage a particular set of apartment blocks.  The most common problem seems to be a lack of transparency as to who is responsible for what and little is seen in return for the money being paid.The Minister for Justice and Law Reform has touched on how current legislation does not meet the needs of people living in these new types of development, which only became popular in the early 1990s.  There has been a significant growth in apartment living in recent years, with areas such as the docklands being developed into prime residential locations.  However, many people were anxious to purchase and did not inspect to any great level of detail the ownership arrangements into which they were entering, namely, their responsibilities and those of the developers, the fees and other rules.  Adjusting to apartment living takes people a while.The first and most welcome aspect of the legislation is that ownership of the common areas will be transferred to the property management company before any apartment is sold.  This will ensure that the practice of developers holding onto a few apartments or units in order to retain control of the management company will be stopped.  It will also ensure that developers cannot return and make changes at will.  In cases where the common areas have not already been transferred to the property management company, the Bill provides that they must be transferred within six months of its enactment.  This is an important provision.Another important feature in the legislation is the new court-based dispute resolution mechanism, which will apply to new and existing multi-unit developments with a strong emphasis on mediation, which is the desired route.  If mediation fails, the court may make an order where it is satisfied that a right has been infringed upon or an obligation has not been discharged.This is critical in ensuring that people have somewhere to turn if a developer or management company is not discharging their duties correctly.  Another new requirement will be a minimum contribution of €200 per unit for a sinking fund to meet any large and non-regular costs.  The sinking fund makes the financial aspects of maintaining an estate smoother and easier.  We are all familiar with stories of half finished hallways, gardens and recreational areas that are not maintained despite people paying in some cases exorbitant maintenance fees.This leads me on to how management fees are arrived at and justified.  Apportionment refers to the method in which the percentage of the overall service charge for the development is attributed to individual owners.  The calculation may be based on a number of factors, for example the size or type of unit, the services availed of or the total number of units in the development.  In the future an owners' management company must establish and maintain a scheme of annual service charges and this must be approved by a general meeting of the company's members.The annual charge must be calculated on a transparent basis and be fairly apportioned between apartment owners.  The service charge may not be used to defray expenses on matters which are the responsibility of the developer or builder.  Service charges in respect of any unsold units must be paid by the developer, and will not be fobbed off to those people already in situ in a particular development.  That is an important aspect to the Bill and very welcome.The Director of Corporate Enforcement has, in the past, made reference to the growth of management companies being struck off the Companies Register for failure to file annual returns.  The consequences of this for property owners is often more serious than they realise.  For example, it may be difficult to get an insurer to cover the structure of the building, mortgage lenders may invalidate the mortgage on an uninsured property and no one can issue share certificates, so it will be difficult to sell the property, in the event.  Under this new legislation struck off property management may be restored to the Companies Register within a six-year period provided all outstanding annual returns are submitted.  The Department and the Minister have engaged very actively with the public on this piece of legislation, which is most welcome and has been positively received.One aspect of it that has been brought to my attention recently concerns an individual being allocated an apartment from the social housing list, where the landlord is a member of a voluntary housing group, perhaps.  There is a sense among people allocated such social housing apartments that they are not being consulted as regards the management of the particular apartment block, and voluntary housing management should be engaging with social housing tenants within the various apartment blocks.  If this were to be done, it would make a positive difference.  Obviously the service charge is at a reduced rate for people allocated social housing units, but there is still a strong case for their being involved in management decisions that affect the whole apartment block.  Some 20% of the apartments in the Dublin docklands have been let as social housing, and this has been very positive.  However, that in itself brings difficulties because the individuals living in these units believe they are being excluded in a way that affordable or private tenants are not, and this is something the legislation could examine in more detail.During the property boom people were often so anxious to purchase, critical details may have been overlooked in their desire to secure a home.  Eventually, people realised they were liable for unexpected fees and had few or no rights, only after they had made a purchase.  This legislation, when enacted, will ensure that the entire process is clarified and that people will have a much greater say in how their development is run.  That is why I welcome the Bill and look forward to its speedy enactment.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	632	I am delighted to at last have an opportunity to speak on this long-promised Bill.  It must be about seven years since it was first mooted.  Several promises were made as regards when it would come into the House.  I do not know what the reluctance was.  It looked as if it could give rise to an embarrassing situation and nobody wanted to bring the Bill before the House when we could debate it.  It is here now, and I am not so sure that it will work, but I hope it does.  It is like much of the legislation we have passed over the years to address particular issues that Members will readily recall.  Four or five years later we find they have not addressed the issues at all.No pun intended, there is a multiplicity of issues in this particular situation.  For instance, there was then and now.  As we hear so regularly, "that was then, and this is now".  The situation that arose with most of the developments which are the subject matter of this legislation was prevalent in the boom time.  Developers could not get out of their estates quickly enough.  It was a question, in many cases, of a management company being set up to complete the development and take on responsibility for the planning permission conditions imposed in the first place.  That, of course, resulted in very serious problems.In the greater Dublin area, certainly, there are numerous cases of residents who are deeply dissatisfied and object strongly to the operation of some management companies.  Some management companies have worked well and shown consideration, where responsible people were in charge who tried to do their work in accordance with company law and everything else.  I have to pay tribute to them.  Others were apparently set up by developers to allow them to abdicate their responsibilities and move away to more lucrative pastures.  People say that there is a reluctance on the part of some residents to pay the charges.  Such assertions must be measured against the current climate.For example, in most new housing situations, the charges and costs imposed on residents are massive when one considers that the unfortunate people concerned bought their dwellings when the Celtic tiger was roaming the land and they were in fear of never getting a foot on the housing ladder or having a home of their own.  They went in fear of having to rent for the rest of their lives, and they were scared.  They queued up all night in many situations to have the privilege and honour of putting a deposit down on an apartment or house.   Having waited all night, they could be told the following morning that the particular apartment type they wanted had gone up overnight by a further €25,000 or €30,000.  In one particular block in the Lucan area, the price of the houses increased by €80,000 over a weekend, which was absolutely crazy.  I can well understand that we now have a situation whereby unfortunate home owners are in difficulty.  Usually they will have to meet substantial mortgage repayments, in the region of €2,000 a month, or certainly €1,800 or €1,900 a month for a very modest type of house.  On top of that if both partners are working they might have to pay for child care facilities, which comes to another €2,000 a month, which now means €4,000 a month overall.   On top of that they have ordinary day-to-day household expenses.  If they do not live near a rail station or other public transport mode, they could face at least €1,000 a month for motoring costs.  To fund such activity a person must be on at least €80,000 a year.  How can one expect people to afford such charges?When first introduced, the building control legislation was perceived to be a panacea for all building difficulties.  However, even a superficial inspection of some developments around the country would shock one.  Many of them would not pass any building regulation tests because nothing was complied with.  They were thrown up in a hurry without, for example, proper insulation.  The developer could not care less as they were handed over to the unfortunate purchaser and management company.Some have referred to the architectural flair of many of these new developments.  Architectural flair, how are ya.  While I accept there are some exceptional developments, others would remind one of a Mediterranean resort in which the developer had gone bust, leaving behind buildings of appalling quality.An earlier speaker referred to duplex apartments.  I do not know how anyone gave planning permission for this type of apartment.  They have an open stairwell on the outside on which mothers with children must drag their prams.  Did we learn anything from experience?  At a public meeting recently I heard someone describe this type of apartment as a much sought after development.  These are where one house is planted on another with a stairs outside like on a grain loft in the old days.The Government claimed the country was awash with money in the boom times.  I recall the then Tánaiste and Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform claimed the Government did not need the revenue from stamp duty on house sales.  During that time, house builds were woeful.  It is sad to see what has happened now in the downturn.I can well understand why we have Mexican stand-offs with residents in particular areas feeling aggrieved at having to pay for what they regard as an inferior product.  For example, there is the wood effect put on the exterior of many apartment blocks.  While it looked great for the first year, it began to fade in the second year and then turned a really nasty colour in the third.  These effects do not weather well in this country's climate which is very different from those where such effects are used successfully on exteriors.All Members have been inundated over the past eight years with requests from residents concerned with the operation of their management companies, particularly where the companies are not well disposed towards their residents and attempts made to extort exceptionally high charges with little or nothing in return.The need for a management company in estates of single houses is not obvious to me.  In fact, services provided by the local authority in the past are now provided by the management company in return for a fee.  There are so many charges to be paid by the unfortunate resident that he or she will not know where to start or finish.  This is at a time when incomes have come down due to the various income levies imposed and some households have lost one if not both incomes.It is fine to say they should not have entered into those contracts during the Celtic tiger and should have known what they were doing.  It must be remembered, however, back then people were told if they did not get on the property ladder they would be renting for the rest of their lives.  This was also the time when people were paying up to €2,500 a month in rent for fairly modest properties.  If regulations had been applied more rigidly during the course of the building boom, we would not have so many of the problems we have now.There used to be a house-builders guarantee scheme which was replaced by the Home Bond scheme, the answer to everyone's prayers.  The scheme is scarcely able to exist now.  In most cases where a householder or apartment owner seeks the bond to cover some external repairs, they are informed they are not the scheme's responsibility.  In the case of pyrites present in cement in some housing developments in north Dublin, the maximum payment from the scheme will be €30,000 when the entire house will need to be levelled and rebuilt.In future developments in which management companies will be involved after completion, I suggest consideration is given to low-maintenance grounds and facilities — in other words, trees and grass, for example, that would not have to be cut regularly.  These would be more suited to multi-unit developments than ordinary housing estates.  The more cost burdens are put on the heads of the unfortunate residents, the less the chance they will actually be able to meet their commitments leading to the management company collapsing.  I accept companies have to collect fees and charges from those residents who refuse to pay.  However, when those residents explain their circumstances, the whole matter suddenly is brought into perspective.  This is on top of developments not completed in accordance with planning permission conditions and not functioning properly with ongoing maintenance problems which should be the responsibility of the developer in the first place.I hope we can learn from the experience of the past ten years to good effect.  I recall speaking on this very subject in the House nine years ago.  The media was very helpful to me, giving me a full picture on the back of the following day's newspapers.  They were not really applauding me for what I said, but I had predicted all the issues that are now facing the general public — the possibility of a collapse in the housing market, the quality of developments and maintenance costs, which will increase as time goes by.  For a poor development that is poorly finished and requires ongoing maintenance, these costs will increase with every passing year.  We can have all the management companies we like; it will not change anything.  There are builders who will now tell one openly that some of the developments built over the last ten years will fall down.  They cannot see how they will last for 30 or 50 years.  There are major issues facing us in this regard.I must point out that there are distinctions: as well as those responsible for problems, there are some builders and developers who have been very conscientious, and it shows.  When one drives into the estate, one can tell straight away that they have done a good job.  There are others  — God help them — who just rushed in and then rushed out as quickly as possible.  Development levies were not paid to local authorities and still have not been paid.  For some developments, the conveyancing was not done properly.  Where there was the option of estates being taken in charge by local authorities, some of them were never completed in accordance with requirements and, as a result, the taking in charge will drag on for years.I hope that some of what is contained in the Bill will address the issues that have arisen.  Every Member of this House has personal information about what the requirements are and have been over the last number of years.  We should try not to allow a repetition of the problems we have seen.  We should try to ensure that certain standards apply — that, like the guarantee scheme, it does work.  It is an insurance scheme; it is supposed to work.  Thirty years ago, under the house building guarantee scheme, local authorities were able to strip the roofs off houses, take them down to the foundations if necessary and rebuild them — and they did so, leaving them fit houses.  We cannot do anything like that any more.I could go on but you will be glad to know, a Leas-Cheann Comhairle, that I will not.  We hope this Bill does something to address the issues faced by people living in such units.  For the sake of the unfortunate householder who has the responsibility of paying a mortgage on a monthly basis, along with a whole lot of other charges, we must ensure the management company charges do not become larger than the mortgage itself.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	638	Like other Deputies, I have been raising this issue for the last seven years.  Given that my constituency of Dublin West has one of the highest concentrations of management companies in the country, it is an enormous issue.  Despite this, we do not even have an audit of all of the housing units — apartments and ordinary houses — that are under the control of management companies.  However, I estimate that there are between 7,000 and 10,000 such units.The principal of a management company is very often the developer of the estate or one of his children or relatives, or the foreman — or one of his relatives — from when the estate was a building site.  Some of these people have now deserted the developments, although they are not necessarily bankrupt.  In one particularly outrageous case, the developer is cooling his heels in sunny Spain, and has been for some time, while the residents of the estate are facing serious difficulties.  That is replicated elsewhere.  We have another charming developer, also well known in Deputy Upton's constituency through being involved in the case of a building that was knocked down despite various court orders, who has put the people in the management company of an estate in Castleknock through enormous difficulties.There are developers whose behaviour with regard to management companies is appalling.  They are holding people, particularly young people, to ransom.  Many of those caught up in the management company trap are young people in their late twenties and early thirties who bought, because they were advised to do so, at the top of the market.  Apartment management charges range from around €1,400 per year, which is quite cheap, to well over €2,500 per year.  In the case of apartment blocks with lifts, when something goes wrong it is a case of "think of a number".I welcome the fact that this Bill is at last before the House.  I will not suggest it is perfect, but the process of discussion in both the Seanad and the Dáil has resulted in an improved Bill.  At this point, I am desperate to see legislation of some kind for management companies, even if it is not perfect, although that is not something I would normally acknowledge.Management companies are another element of the general housing crisis.  What is happening increasingly is that people in estates can no longer meet their mortgage payments and are not paying the management company service charges, which means that the management companies themselves are becoming insolvent, if they are not already.  The knock-on effect is that residents face being locked into the developments, unable to sell their properties if and when the property market ever revives.In addition — this may be something in which NAMA will become involved — there are unsold apartments or houses in many developments which the developer has held on to with the aim of selling himself.  However, this means that the developer has kept control of the management company because the development is not complete.  It may well be that the units are now no longer saleable.  People have bought into developments where, in some cases, fewer than 25% of the units have been sold, and they are now trapped.  The rest of the units are not being sold and those living in the sold units are in a kind of no-man's land.  I hope this legislation will provide a way out for people who have been left marooned as one of a small number of purchasers in an unfinished development.This is not happening only in my constituency but all around the country.  It is particularly notable in areas such as the upper River Shannon, where there was much overdevelopment.  Some of the newly built houses in Leitrim village are, from a Dublin perspective, beautiful houses but they are in what are basically unfinished estates.  Unless some solution is devised, after two or three years of unoccupancy and hard Irish winters, many of those estates — particularly those subject to the NAMA process — will end up having to be knocked down.  To people living in Dublin city, these appear to be high-quality three and four-bedroom houses, but they have no future.All of these developments are under management companies.  County managers and planners, along with developers, must take responsibility for slipping the requirement for a management company into almost all planning permissions over the past eight years as a way of forestalling costs relating to taking in charge and passing the costs of the estate or the apartment unit on to the new owners.  They seemed to believe that as property prices were constantly rising, owners, particularly young people, would accept management companies as a kind of afterthought because they were so glad to get any property that would let them into the property market.I recall being in a queue one day in the old TSB, now Irish Life and Permanent, in Blanchardstown.  A man in the queue turned to me and told me he was queuing for his son.  When I asked why, he told me his son was buying an apartment just over the boundary of Dublin 15 in County Meath and that he had sent him down to get the money as the son was about to sign for the apartment.  He mentioned that the only concern was that there was a clause in the contract about a management company.  I said that just meant that his son would have to pay charges.  He asked if I thought the charges would be significant.  The apartment was close to Dunboyne, in Clonee in County Meath.  The man had not a clue that the likely cost would be €1,000 plus.  His son was borrowing up to the hilt to get into the market.  I told him I thought he should discuss those issues with his son, but I have no idea what happened.  I often pass the block of apartments and notice that they do not seem fully occupied.I congratulate the lawyers and all other people who manage residents' associations, like the Apartment Owners' Network and people in my constituency in residents' groups in Ongar, Tyrellstown, Clonee and parts of Castleknock, including places like College Wood which has a difficult developer — whom I share with Deputy Upton — on all the work they have done in the area of management companies.  Many young people in these apartments, despite the fact they are in financial difficulties, are highly resourceful and have a community spirit.  If the Government puts in place a fair  management company structure and establishes owner managed companies, OMCs, that will give a framework of hope to these young people that will allow them take control of the situation.I have relatives in the United States and am familiar with condominium control there.  The system there works.  It costs money, but as a result the places in which people live are kept clean and tidy and are well looked after.  A sinking fund is established and general jobs in the apartment complex, like painting of exteriors, are done.  These are positive measures and I welcome them in this Bill.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	639	Like my colleagues, I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Bill.  I have raised this issue on a number of occasions, both on the Order of Business and through parliamentary questions.  I have a practical reason for raising the issue, the fact that I represent a constituency where there has been an explosion of apartment developments of one kind or another, the quality of many of which leaves much to be desired.  At the time planning applications were submitted for many of these apartment blocks, I felt I was turning into a serial objector because of the number of objections I felt obliged to put before the planners.  I have been vindicated in many cases.  I do not take particular pleasure in that because of the unfortunate effect of that bad planning on victims, due to bad planning, design and quality and the number of unfinished apartments.  Young couples are particular victims.  At the time they bought into the concept of the apartment, what they were being offered by way of services and facilities was of a very poor standard.  We cannot turn back the clock with regard to many of these developments, but we have seen the effect of the bad decisions on young couples, many of whom are in negative equity and have no chance of being in a position to sell those apartments.I represent the constituency of Dublin South-Central and have received numerous complaints from constituents who live in apartments.  Often they are desperate to discover their rights with regard to the complexities of the management agencies and the ever present spectre of a developer who seems to hold extraordinary control but seldom seems to take any responsibility for the many shoddy and incomplete apartment blocks that exist.  This situation was created as a result of Government policy which provided tax breaks to developers.  A number of developers in my constituency availed of these tax breaks.  Government policy allowed the increase in density and brought on planning legislation that encouraged a systematic shift from the traditional Irish home towards apartment ownership.  Not to be totally negative, some apartment blocks are good, high quality, well finished and well managed.  However, the quality of many leaves a lot to be desired.The legislation to enshrine the rights of the owners was never enacted and this is at the heart of the problem.  This leaves apartment owners and some householders in a very weak position vis-à-vis the developers.  Deputy Burton mentioned what we might call our shared developer.  I have had many tussles with the same developer.  Unfortunately, he won, a situation I found quite extraordinary.  These issues need to be examined and addressed.  Hopefully, they will not occur in the future.While I welcome the legislation, there is an element of it being too little, too late, particularly for the people I have mentioned such as young couples who bought into these apartments and now cannot afford the mortgages.  In many cases the management of the apartments is appallingly bad and there is little chance of being able to sell them.  A number of issues will need to be addressed on Committee Stage and I hope that will happen.  I understand that much of this legislation will not apply retroactively.  In other words, it cannot apply to existing apartment blocks.  What are the people in these apartments expected to do?  This issue needs to be teased out carefully on Committee Stage to ensure that as many rights as possible can be applied to current apartment dwellers.For the most part, the legislation looks to the future.  That is good and positive.  However, what about people who are in a situation where the improvements in conditions will not apply?  These people will remain victims.  We have still got tens of thousands of vacant or unfinished apartments and houses throughout the country.  Some of them are in ludicrous locations and there is little chance of them becoming anything other than derelict buildings shortly.  Some of the sections of the Bill refer only to developments that are completed after the Bill is enacted.  Given the state of the Irish property market, it is unlikely there will be a significant amount of development over the next decade.  In contrast, we had a glut of unparalleled and exponential growth in apartment complexes and other housing developments over the past decade.  Very often, these were instituted under the guise of the management company.Most of those who have spoken in this debate have mentioned the problems surrounding the handing over of, or failure to hand over, the common areas to the management company.  Mention has been also made of situations where developers hold weighted voting rights in a way that allows them retain control of the management company.  I am aware of a number of cases in my constituency where an unfair management company structure has been established, which effectively discriminates against the rights of the owners to the benefit of the developers.  There are hundreds of similar cases wherever we see a glut of these apartment blocks.  Even with regard to developments that will come under the legislation, the voting system has been set as one unit, one vote.  I understand there may be valid reasons for that and that people will have some rights, in that people who have a unit pay a management fee and, therefore, have some rights.  However, this leaves this area open to abuse such as abuse of power by developers or landlords who have several properties.  As such, they will have several votes which will allow them to control the voting rights and thus effectively control the management company.  It would be a much fairer system to have one member, one vote rather than one unit, one vote.  In an owners' management company where the company is limited by guarantee, not for profit and established for the benefit of members equally, it is normal to have one member, one vote, according to the report published by the Apartment Owners Network.  The Minister must examine this carefully with a view to safeguarding the rights of each individual who purchases an apartment rather than the developer who will more than likely control a number of apartments and will therefore be entitled to the same number of votes.Section 22 provides for unit owners to pursue developers in the courts in order to force them to complete the development under the terms of section 21 which deals with planning permissions.  Section 23 provides that the Circuit Court shall have "exclusive jurisdiction".  That in itself sounds fine, but the maximum fine a Circuit Court can levy is just over €38,000.  Given that some developments are left unfinished and may require hundreds of thousands of euro in investment to be completed to the planning permission requirements, this does not offer adequate sanction.  This is relevant to the case referred to by Deputy Burton, where a paltry fine was imposed for what seemed a very serious breach of planning.The provision for a mandatory sinking fund is important but is not required to come into effect until three years after the first transfer of ownership of a unit in a multi-unit development.  This seems to be something of a sop to developers who are likely to remain owners of apartment complexes for several years but will not be required to contribute to the sinking fund even though depreciation begins almost immediately from the time of completion of the apartments.There are many aspects of the Bill to be welcomed.  However, at a practical level, it is vital that apartment owners are fully aware of both their rights and their responsibilities.  This information must be available in a user friendly fashion and there must be provision for that in the Bill.  I acknowledge that when people sign a contract it is the responsibility presumably of their solicitor to inform them of what exactly is involved.  However, ordinary people signing up to these types of arrangements are often overwhelmed by legalese and need some clarity.  Anybody who has had any interaction with apartment owners knows there is widespread confusion about the structure of management companies and that people often do not realise that they themselves are part of the company.  This is the type of detail that must be explained carefully to prospective apartment owners so that they know exactly what they are taking on.  It seems all the cards are held by the developers who, even when they default on their responsibilities, are able to escape any serious penalties.Recent developments in regard to an apartment complex in my own constituency highlighted the vulnerability of apartment owners relative to the sleight of hand of developers.  This particular developer controlled the management company because of the number of units he held, either occupied by him or a member of his family or leased out to tenants.  He has now run off with the management fees and the apartment owners are left high and dry.  They have been advised to cut their losses because it will cost far more to pursue the developer through the courts.  These are the types of practical issues that must be addressed.  Overall, however, I welcome the Bill as a positive initiative.

The Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 seeks to introduce regulation of multi-unit developments by addressing issues relating to the obligations of developers and the governance of owners' management companies.  It aims to protect the owners of units in both new and existing multi-unit developments.  It also provides for the transfer of common areas to the owners' management company prior to the sale of any units, which I strongly support.  It makes provision for voting rights and makes the establishment and maintenance of schemes of service charges and sinking funds mandatory.  Both mediation and court-based resolution systems are set out for resolving disputes.  This Bill, along with the Property Services (Regulation) Bill 2009, will, if enacted, provide new regulation in the area of property management.I noted that Deputy Burton mentioned almost every district in Blanchardstown, so I assume I can mention every estate in my area which, as some Members may know, is Tallaght.

#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	642	I represent Tallaght, Brittas, Bohernabreena, Greenhills, Templeogue and Firhouse.  As a political activist, something I have always found difficult about these types of residential developments is that it is often difficult to access them in order to visit constituents.  Luckily enough, many of my constituents look up my telephone number, contact my full-time office or come to one of my nine weekly advice clinics, one of which I missed tonight because I had to be here.  They find me, talk to me and I deal with the issues.I take this opportunity to thank the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, who was kind enough to come to Tallaght recently for a happy event in Old Bawn community school where he met the school's participants in the BT Young Scientist exhibition who had done an excellent project on depression.  I am always pleased to welcome Ministers to my constituency.  I would also be happy to meet any Opposition spokespersons who would like to visit me.Like other colleagues, I have always had difficulty with the concept of management companies.  I can only talk about my own constituency but there was a time when there were few or none of these types of developments.  Tallaght was developed following the publication of the Myles Wright report in 1967 which recommended that new towns be built in Lucan, Blanchardstown, Clondalkin and Tallaght.  Most of the early development in Tallaght was housing rather than apartments and it is only in recent years that the phenomenon of apartment blocks has been prevalent.  One of the down sides of the recession in recent years can be seen when one visits The Square in Tallaght, which is on the Luas line and is a good place to visit.  There are many vacant apartments there which is a problem for the local community.  Likewise, in Tallaght village — an historic site marked by St. Maelruain's church and graveyard and the priory — an issue that upsets locals and visitors alike is the huge number of apartments that were perhaps constructed with good intentions in the good times but are now unoccupied.  These vacant dwellings create environmental and social issues and put great pressure on local services.  It is very upsetting for the people who have made their lives in the community.  Somebody has to grasp that particular problem.If one suggests that vacant apartments should be brought under social housing schemes, one is likely to meet some resistance.  However, the reality is that the volume of apartment accommodation in my constituency that remains unoccupied is a significant problem that will have to be tackled.  Meanwhile, the number of planning applications lodged with South Dublin County Council for the construction of even more apartments in the area is striking.  For example, there is a huge site in the middle of the village which used to have an Esso garage.  It is now in a terribly derelict state.  There are signs around it and the hoarding is poor.  It appears an absolute mess and it looks terrible to people who come to the village.Suggestions have been made about other developments.  Along the Tallaght road there is a fine little development.  Discussions have been held with the local community.  I am pleased those responsible for it are reaching out to the community but they are discussing the possibility of even more apartments.  This is an issue in my community and people have raised it as a difficulty.  They have no wish for more vacant apartments.  This is a challenge for the public representatives and communities.I refer to the difficulties for people in apartments who are subject to charges from management companies.  I have no wish to demonise management companies, save to say problems have arisen for people who have bought apartments and made a commitment.  Other colleagues have made this point which I am pleased to repeat.  There is a very significant financial burden on many couples, including the young and not so young.  They realise additional charges apply.  As other colleagues have stated, in some cases the common areas are not kept, the grass is not cut and the green space cannot be sorted out.  I spend a good deal of time dealing with constituents in such places as the Belfry in Citywest, and Marlfield and Deerpark in the general Tallaght area, not too far from the Square.  The difficulty is the council maintains it is not its business because the area has not been handed over and difficulties remain as far as the management company is concerned.I attended a meeting with other colleagues some weeks ago in Kiltipper Gate.  This is a lovely development where many people have gone to the trouble of making their home and are perfectly pleased except for these issues which are not being dealt with.In the context of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill it is fair to say to the Minister of State that these are the issues we have been discussing for some time.  Like other colleagues, I have corresponded with the Minister of State, tabled questions and raised matters through other business.  These are real issues.  Many of those involved were from my community to begin with but there are others who have come into my community as well.  They are fully entitled to have everything properly organised.  It is time for legislation to deal with these issues, to give people confidence and to help them to get these issues sorted out.  Only tonight I received correspondence in respect of Carrigmore near Citywest, where people want their children to play in the open space, especially during the good weather, but this is a problem.  There is a conflict between the management company and the council.I have no wish to upset the Leas-Cheann Comhairle by straying too much but I have mentioned Citywest several times.  It would be remiss of me to let the occasion go without mentioning that in recent days myself and other colleagues have been upset about what is taking place in the Citywest Hotel.  It is not in my constituency but that of the Minister of State, Deputy John Curran, Deputy Paul Gogarty, the Minister, Deputy Mary Harney, and Deputy Joanna Tuffy.  Many of the 400 workers who live under the threat of losing their jobs this week because of the difficulties with the company are from my constituency.  As other colleagues have done, I express solidarity with them and I hope the issues will be dealt with.

It is critical this is done.  I trust the issues that all of us are bringing to the attention of the Minister of State in respect of this Bill will be dealt with.  I trust the provisions will be implemented as quickly as possible and that the various issues that people have asked us to deal with which are upsetting people in their new homes can be addressed.I do not suggest that we should be less than secure in these places.  I have always enjoyed the ability to knock on doors, talk to constituents and offer assistance regardless of whether they like me.  I have heard from other colleagues that they have exactly the same problem in apartment blocks in their constituencies and I am aware the postman often has the same difficulty.I could discuss this Bill for a long time and there are many other issues of concern to me but because of the time of night and because I have other duties I will conclude presently.  I listened carefully to the debate this morning about the Dáil recess.  I was impressed by the comments of the Tánaiste, Deputy Mary Coughlan.  She pointed out that whatever about what unfolded this morning, much of which was for television, everyone in the House needs that little break.  Like everyone else, I will continue to work.  I will work tomorrow and at the weekend, although I will go to see Dublin play on Saturday and Shamrock Rovers on Sunday.  However, I will be dealing with the issues and continuing my work and all my colleagues will do the same.  I realise those in the media may not be listening now but I hope they pick up on this and understand that simply because we are not in the Dáil Chamber does not mean we are not dealing with the issues.  I guarantee the Leas-Cheann Comhairle that people will contact me over the weekend about the issues related to this Bill and I will continue to represent them on these issues.  I will all colleagues a happy summer and I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for his courtesy.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	646	I thank Deputies for their contribution to the debate.  It is clear the Government's objective of ensuring fair, efficient and effective management of bodies responsible for the management of common areas in multi-unit developments which the proposals in the Bill are designed to achieve are broadly shared on all sides of the House.  While Deputies were broadly supportive of the Bill's objectives, several detailed issues were also raised.  These can be considered in the required detail on Committee Stage in due course.Some references were made to the delay in bringing forward the Bill.  However, this is a complex Bill including aspects of property, company and planning law and, as such, it required extensive consultation between various Departments and stakeholders.  The Government's objective has always been to bring forward the most comprehensive legislation possible which would benefit owners of apartments in new and existing developments.  I believe this objective is being met through the Bill.Deputies Terence Flanagan, Pat Rabbitte, Michael Kennedy and Leo Varadkar raised issues of completion.  One of the issues discussed at some length in the Seanad was completion of common areas of multi-unit developments.  This arises under three headings: compliance with planning permission under the Planning and Development Acts; compliance with building control standards under the Building Control Acts; and the snagging of internal and external common areas.It is fair to say snagging is a complex issue.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	648	There is no provision under the Planning and Development Acts or the Building Control Acts to allow planning authorities to require performance bonds to ensure snagging of multi-unit developments.  The question of whether planning authorities should be given such added responsibilities could only be considered following an assessment by the Minister and Department as to whether the adopting of such additional roles would be appropriate for planning authorities and, if so, whether they would have the necessary resources to undertake this important work.  Proper advance consultation with local authorities and adequate preparation for any such role would be essential.  The Department of Justice and Law Reform has been in ongoing contact with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in view of its responsibility for the Planning and Development Acts and the Building Control Acts.I understand that a review of the enforcement procedures under both codes will be undertaken with the idea of ensuring improved enforcement of statutory requirements.  I understand the building review advisory board, which advises the Minister in this area, has established a working group to examine the building control enforcement system.  I further understand it will report shortly to the Minister on this issue.The Bill seeks to deal with completions in the following way.  Under section 3(1)(c) the developer will in future be required to enter into a written contract with the owners of the management company setting out the rights and obligations of each party in respect of the other.It is envisaged that this contract will set out commitments by the developer regarding completion of the common areas and the overall development.  If the terms of the contract are not honoured, the apartment owner will have recourse to the dispute resolution mechanisms under section 21.  Section 21(4) contains specific provision for the Circuit Court to make an order directing a developer to complete a development in compliance with planning permission, building control standards and the terms of any contract.The annual service charge issue was raised by Deputies Terence Flanagan, Johnny Brady, Chris Andrews, Rabbitte, Stagg and Kennedy, which is not surprising given the current lack of transparency surrounding the calculation and the apportionment of the annual charge.  In many cases, the owners are unsure about what services are provided or are dissatisfied with the services provided.  The Government's approach is to provide that each owners' management company must establish a scheme for the annual service charge, which must be approved by a general meeting of the unit owners.  Complaints from unit owners that they do not know what the service charge is used for are common.  The Bill addresses this issue by providing that all owners in multi-unit developments must be made aware of the proposed charge and the basis of calculation of the charge must be clear and transparent.  The Bill goes as far as indicating the categories of expenditure, for instance, insurance, repairs, waste management and so on, which should be covered by the charge.  I would also like to stress that the legislation places an obligation on unit owners to pay the agreed charge.  The Bill also provides that for the purposes of the charge a developer or building contractor is deemed to be the owner of any unsold unit in a development from the date of the sale of the first unit in that development.  This means he or she will be liable for the payment of service charges of all unsold units from that date.Deputies Flanagan, Brady and Kennedy also raised the issue of sinking funds.  The establishment of a sinking fund is also an issue of concern.  Many existing developments have no such fund or the fund that has been established is inadequate for its purpose.  The Government is concerned about the potentially serious consequences of this and this is why we have provided in the Bill that an owners' management company must establish such a fund for spending on refurbishment, improvement or maintenance of a non-recurring nature of a multi-unit development.  Unit owners will be obliged to pay the sinking fund contribution and developers or building contractors will be liable to pay a sinking fund contribution from the date of the sale of the first unit in the development.  The Bill also ensures that the requirements to have such a fund will apply not only to new developments but also to existing developments and it is important that the fund would be adequate to cover potential costs of refurbishment or improvement of a development.  At the same time, the Government does not consider it should be too prescriptive.  The Bill, therefore, provides for an indicative contribution of €200.  There is also no longer a minimum of €200 per year and the company can set its own charge.Deputies Kennedy, Sargent, Durkan and Flanagan referred to the taking in charge of estates.  I understand that in February 2008 the Department issued revised guidelines on taking in charge of estates by local authorities.  They require that planning permission must address the taking in charge issue at pre-application stage.  This is a matter for the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.The Bill forms the centrepiece of the Government's strategy to deal with multi-unit developments and owners' management companies.  I thank everyone who contributed so constructively to the debate.  The issues raised will be considered in detail in advance of Committee Stage in the context of possible amendment.

The foreshore application for the Poolbeg waste to energy project is one of 700 applications which now fall to be dealt with by my Department.  The relevant file for the Poolbeg project was forwarded to my Department on 25 January 2010.  The foreshore licence element of the Poolbeg project relates to the cooling water intake and discharge pipe.  An application for the licence was originally made by Dublin City Council in December 2008.  A preliminary assessment of the application for a foreshore licence has been carried out and a valuation of the site to be occupied by the applicant has been also completed.As this is the first ever case under which the terms of both sections 226 and 227 of the Planning Acts were being used, which disapply certain provisions of the Foreshore Acts, the then consent authority, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, sought legal advice as to the relationship between planning legislation and the consent process under the Foreshore Acts.  The initial advice has since been forwarded to my Department, and further advices have been more recently provided on this complex issue.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	650	What is the average time for dealing with a foreshore licence application in the Department, given this application was lodged originally with the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food in 2008?The Minister mentioned recently in an RTE interview that he had a quasi-judicial role in the foreshore licence application and stated, "The Poolbeg plant is entirely incompatible with my national waste policy".  Is it compatible with Government policy?  Does he think it is fair or appropriate that a Minister would exercise a quasi-judicial function in a fair manner when he has stated publicly that if he approved the project, it would undermine Government policy?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	651	It is not compatible with Government policy.  I cannot give the Deputy the average time, as only two applications have come in and been completed in my Department.  This is unprecedented in that it is the first ever case we dealt with under which the terms of both sections 226 and 227 of the Planning Acts were used to disapply certain provisions of the Foreshore Acts and that is why the then consent authority, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, sought legal advice.The Deputy referred to an interview I gave to RTE.  This slick public relations campaign is regrettable.  It has been conducted in public and references have been made to the American ambassador to Ireland, which he would find quite embarrassing.   I do not believe this is about the foreshore licence, which is a red herring.  This is about the change in Government policy and this is why it is not compatible with it.The issues include my proposal to ensure we have new waste levies in place and the harshness of the McKechnie judgment, which is being appealed to the Supreme Court.  That has severe implications for this project.  Likewise, the fact that Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown County Council pulled out of the waste market in Dublin has profound implications for this project.I refer to the information that has been put in the public domain that somehow we will face fines.  I will ensure that we comply with the landfill directive.  That is a priority for me.  It is interesting that people do not appear to have the same issue with fines when we are dealing with, for example, habitat and the protection of our raised bogs.  That does not appear to be a problem.  In this case, however, when there are vested interests involved, there appears to be a problem.  As Deputy Hogan knows, my priority is to ensure we have a shift of policy towards mechanical biological treatment, MBT, and I will shortly open another MBT plant.  I am also anxious to have a market develop in this country for solid recovered fuel, SRF.Finally, it is astounding how the Deputy is playing it both ways.  Deputies from his party are going around my constituency saying they are opposing this plant tooth and nail and making all sorts of allegations that I have not done enough and so forth on this matter.  Yet, it is clear from the Deputy's stance tonight that he is absolutely in favour of the construction of a 600,000 tonne incinerator.

It will not take long to respond.  First, Fine Gael is opposed to incineration and always has been.  The question is about the Minister's centralised role as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and how he has accepted a quasi-judicial function with regard to his responsibilities.  He sees nothing wrong in his role as Minister in adjudicating in a quasi-judicial way on an application before him.  Will he reflect on that and on whether it is appropriate in his role as Minister to adjudicate on this matter in view of his blatant conflict of interest?Will the Minister again clarify Government waste policy?  The Minister has his personal view, which I respect.  However, what is Government policy?  He said in his response that in his view what he stated is Government policy.  There is no change in Government policy, and this project is based on Government policy.  It has gone through all the processes.  Will the Minister step aside from his position as Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government to have this matter adjudicated by another Minister, in view of his clear and unambiguous statement in an RTE interview that he has a quasi-judicial function with regard to this foreshore licence application?

Of these, some 1,830 have been issued with funding approval, of which 175 are private lease units to be provided by either a local authority or an approved housing body, AHB.  Of the private lease units approved under the initiative, 47 have lease agreements signed and commenced in 2010.  The average monthly cost of these units is €612 per unit and the full year cost is €7,342 per unit.The discount levels achieved in these agreements has varied; 40 units have achieved 20% below market value, two have achieved 18% below market and a further five have achieved 16% below market value.  The variation in the levels of discount achieved arises because in some circumstances the property owner has retained responsibility for maintenance and management.  In addition, a wider discount range may also apply in cases where the owner has retained responsibility for service charges.With regard to the inclusion of an option to buy clause within the lease agreements, of the 47 units leased from private landlords this year 30 have an option to purchase clause included in the lease agreement.  The provision of an option to purchase clause is a matter most appropriately dealt with by the authority or approved body on the basis of individual negotiations.  It is considered that restricting the negotiating flexibility of authorities or approved bodies could lead to increased leasing costs and may in certain circumstances reduce otherwise available supply.  To assist authorities in circumstances where it is appropriate to include an option to purchase my Department has provided template option to purchase clauses, as part of a suite of framework legal documents, which can be inserted into agreements as required.

#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	674	It is interesting that when the Minister announced this programme in the Chamber two years ago, he said he would spend €20 million per annum and with that would acquire 2,000 properties in the private sector.  The figures the Minister has given this evening are well off those targets.  At that time he was also adamant that there would be no option to buy as part of the package.  Why has he been unable to fulfil the target of 2,000?  Leaving aside the fact that I consider this to be bad social housing policy, these were his targets and he does not appear to have reached them.  Could he also explain the change in his position with regard to the option of a purchase being facilitated?  Can he explain how that purchase is put aside?  Is it the situation that pertains with most long-term leases, where there is what is called a peppercorn purchase, which is a very small sum of money at the end of the lease, or is it a more proportional sum?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	675	The Deputy raised two questions, the first regarding the number of units leased from private landlords.  The target I set for this year and last year was 2,000 units each year.  We achieved our target.  There were 1,993 units for 2009 and I am confident that we will reach our target this year.  The reason for the private units being at that level is that local authorities obviously decided, and rightly so, that they would offload many of their unsold affordable units into the leasing area for the very good reason that they were costing them a great deal of money and were not being sold.  It made sense to me and to them that they would deal with that area of their responsibility first.  Indeed, in 2010 the swing is going the other way towards the private side.With regard to the right to purchase, the Deputy asked that we insert a mandatory right to purchase.  I do not agree with that.  The property owner as part of the negotiation process may decide to put a value on account of the house not having such a clause.  I am of the opinion that the charge for having this option being made available should be left as a negotiating opportunity by either the approved bodies or the local authority with the developer.  An alternative to the inclusion of an option purchase clause could perhaps be the right to have a first refusal.  I am not prepared to have a mandatory purchase but if a developer wants to have such a clause, we have set out a template for him or her to enter such an agreement with the local authority or the approved body.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	676	As I have stated in the House previously, there is no long term security of tenure for a social housing applicant in this programme and neither is there an exit policy.  The Minister of State is on record in this regard in reply to a parliamentary question.  Even though he is shepherding local authorities into this approach by saying it is the only show in town, he is not giving them any direction as to how they will get out of the difficulty he is creating for them in ten to 20 years' time when these leases expire.My final supplementary remark is that the Minister of State is being somewhat disingenuous when he states he has met the target of 2,000 last year as approximately three quarters of those were affordable homes and social housing.  What he has done is to convert social housing and affordable programmes into a leasing programme and he did not meet his target in the private sector, which was 2,000.Is the option to purchase only available on those social and affordable homes or is there an option to purchase on the private properties being leased?  The sum of money which is an income for the local authority is based on the rent differential where a tenant pays a rent equivalent to a standard social housing house which would run to several hundred euro a month.  Will the Minister of State confirm that this money is ring-fenced specifically for the maintenance of these properties leased from developers and cannot be spent by the local authority other than to reinstate these properties at the end of the lease?
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	677	Deputy Lynch asked about the options at the end of a lease period of ten or 20 years.  There are a number of options for the local authorities to meet their social housing needs and these include renewing the lease, the purchase of the unit if the option to purchase clause has been included in the lease agreement, or if the owner is willing, or there is the other option of taking the house into the social housing stock, providing the householder has alternatives suitable to the needs of supporting households to purchase another dwelling under the incremental purchase scheme.  The Deputy will be aware I introduced the incremental purchase scheme and I signed the ministerial order only last week and it is available now for people to buy houses from the social housing stock.I have included the option of purchase with regard to private houses.  Under the affordable scheme there is an option to buy and after five years they will revert back and it may be a different market.  I am leaving the door open for people who wish to purchase a home for themselves, both in the private leasing and in the affordable sector.

This will mean that the DDDA will become subject to audit by the Comptroller and Auditor General and may also be subject to the preparation of specific reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General on the efficient use of resources and value for money.The Attorney General has advised that the authority can be brought within the Comptroller and Auditor General's remit by means of an order to be made by the Minister for Finance.  This will move the authority from the Second Schedule of the Comptroller and Auditor General Act 1993 to the First Schedule, alongside the other State bodies that are audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I understand that this matter will shortly be addressed by the Minister for Finance.Thereafter, the nature and timing of action or investigation by the Comptroller and Auditor General will clearly be a matter for the Comptroller and Auditor General himself to determine, having regard to his constitutionally independent role.

I am surprised the Minister for Finance has taken so long, in view of the fact it was a Government decision about six weeks ago to make the order to allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to investigate these matters.  What additional powers does the Comptroller and Auditor General require to fully investigate all of the decisions that were made having the potential to lead to all of those decisions being responsible for a significant sum of money being borne by the taxpayer?  When will the annual report for 2009 be available from the Dublin Docklands Development Authority for publication?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	680	To answer the Deputy's last question, I hope the annual accounts will be available fairly shortly.  I hope to have it signed off at Cabinet next week so that it will be available for inspection.  This is the type of corporate governance we have come to expect now from the new chairperson, Professor Niamh Brennan and I believe she has done a very good job.  It is important to remember that the authority's own analysis, the two independent reports by Brassil and King, were commissioned to assess all of those issues, the planning and financial procedures.  I acknowledge that it was six weeks ago but it is a matter for the Minister for Finance.  I understand he wants to act promptly and that it will then go to the committee.  The committee can then decide on what it wants to do with that issue.  I have always said that we want to ensure we have the very highest standards in the Dublin docklands.  I know the people who are interested in developing the area and those who have benefited, want to see the Dublin docklands continue.  It would be a mistake were we to go down the road of simply abolishing the Dublin docklands authority as has been proposed in some quarters.  I want to ensure we get all the answers to the relevant questions.

The Deputy should check the record of the House.  I said I was keeping open the option of widening the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  However, I felt it would have been premature to do it before I had received the reports which I had commissioned.  I received those reports, the two independent consultants' reports, Brassil and King, and I acted on foot of those reports.Deputy Hogan decided to leak the reports.  He had copies of them.

I then published the reports in full.  As I predicted, they were not the sort of explosive reports that others had warned about.

These proposals will give effect to the commitment in the renewed programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. I expect to bring these proposals to the Government in the coming weeks.  The installation of water meters in households connected to public supplies will encourage householders to conserve water and will result in savings in the significant operational costs faced by local authorities in providing water and waste water services.  This will complement the significant increases in investment on water conservation measures in the Water Services Investment Programme 2010-12 that I announced earlier this year.The primary objectives of the proposed investment are to promote more sustainable water consumption by households, to reduce water loss in the distribution networks to an economic level and to address unacceptably high levels of unaccounted for water in some locations.  I expect the metering programme to be under way next year.  I will provide further detail on these matters following their consideration and approval by Government.

I can confirm that to the House, and I have said so on a number of occasions.  Quite simply, a flat charge would defeat the purpose.  Installing meters means people see it as fair.  We can get greater political buy-in and if it is done on a free allocation basis, people will see it as a means of conserving water.  It works and this is the whole point of it.  We can quickly determine if there are leaks, many of which occur from the footpath to the household.  We have discussed this matter at length.The issue is that I have not yet gone to Government.  It would be premature to provide timelines and costs.  This can be done and will be labour-intensive.  It can be done within two years.  Having not gone to Government, I am not in a position to give further details.

I have since announced a 2010 regeneration programme allocation of €126.795 million, compared to expenditure of €107.134 million in 2009, €126.479 million in 2008 and €94.129 million in 2007.  The 2010 regeneration allocation represents an increase of almost €20 million on 2009.Significant progress has since been made on a range of regeneration projects.  In particular, the Government has launched the phase 1 implementation plan of the Limerick regeneration programme, involving the delivery of 26 new projects worth €337 million over the next four and a half years.  I have committed to providing an additional €160 million for the housing projects alone, including an extra €10 million on top of the initial allocation of €25 million for works in 2010.Approvals were issued for the acceptance of tenders for Shangan 5A, 5B and Coultry 6 projects in Ballymun, valued at €21 million, and for construction of the Glen, phase 2, in Cork city, valued at €15 million.  In addition, pre-tender approvals have issued for the Mitchel's regeneration project in Tralee, valued at €10.6 million.  Against a backdrop of pressure on public expenditure generally, these significant commitments demonstrate the Government's determination to proceed as rapidly as possible with the overall regeneration programme.

On 25 May, the Irish Human Rights Commission and the media heard evidence from the residents of Dolphin House flats on the deplorable living conditions the residents must endure.  Dr. Maurice Manning stated the rights of the residents under the UN Declaration of Human Rights, to which Ireland is a signatory, are infringed.  What will the Minister of State do about Dolphin House to sort out the problems of the complex?

It is initially a matter for Dublin City Council but I will contact the council for an update on the situation at Dolphin House and I will provide it to Deputy Flanagan.  If I had notice of this matter, I would have more information for him.

Two weeks ago, the Taoiseach and I attended the launch of the €337 million project.  The event received widespread coverage.  I also referred to the Glen in Cork.  I have not visited Dolphin House.  I have visited many of the regeneration project locations, including Ballymun, and I will visit Tralee next week.

I do not want to put something incorrect on the record.  I will provide a report to Deputy Terence Flanagan without the need for a further question.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	702	The introduction of a directly elected mayor for Dublin will deliver significantly strengthened leadership for the city and region, with enhanced accountability and a direct connection with the citizen.  The mayor will have a powerful role in setting out strategic policy across Dublin and oversight of operational implementation.  He or she will also have a strong mandate to integrate the activities of local government and the wider public service in and across Dublin.The mayor's powers will include the capacity to ensure activities across the Dublin region's local authorities are consistent with the regional strategic framework.  I have agreed with the Minister for Transport that the mayor will have a strong role on transport planning in Dublin.  The mayor will chair a greater Dublin area transport council within the National Transport Authority, responsible for approving and monitoring the implementation of the key transport plans for Dublin, the greater Dublin area transport strategy and the strategic traffic management plan.  In doing so the mayor will be well placed to ensure coherence between Dublin's spatial and transport planning.My aim is that the election of the mayor will take place this year.  My Department is engaging with the Dublin local authorities to make the necessary practical and operational preparations for the mayor's election and introduction.  The general scheme of the legislation to provide for the mayor was published on my Department's website in February, as an opportunity for further consultation before its finalisation and to facilitate early implementation of the Bill's provisions once enacted.  The Bill, which must provide for the mayoral electoral process as well as the powers of the mayor and regional authority, is a large and complex item of legislation.  I hope to publish it shortly following Government consideration.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	703	I am glad the Minister mentioned that this is a complex item of legislation in light of his efforts to reduce complexity in legislation by introducing 90 amendments to the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill without debate.  If the best he can do is to acknowledge the complexity of the legislation, while at the same time stating that an election will be held this year, which is likely to be in either October or November as he probably will not hold it on Christmas Eve, the Minister should be more specific.  He should state there is no intention of holding the election this year——

The latter will be an overarching person without a regional authority with autonomous elected members.  Does he plan to change the existing four authorities in light of the creation of the new position?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	706	When I published the framework on the website, I wanted feedback from Opposition parties because I am not doing this for political gain for the Green Party or our coalition partners.

If they consider that there are deficiencies or areas that need to be changed, I will listen to that.  I make this point genuinely.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	712	It would be the first time the Minister did that.

There is the question of the White Paper, the efficiency review and the boundary changes in Limerick, all of which are extremely important.  Many of these measures must be seen in context and they are interconnected.Deputy Hogan asked about the powers of local authorities and yes, the regional authority will work with the mayor, as outlined in the framework Bill but I believe that the role of the local authority itself must be strengthened and that is one of the objectives of the new White Paper.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	716	Deputy Hogan may respond briefly because two Labour Party colleagues also wish to contribute.  I will take all three together.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I have a brief question.  The Minister has mentioned many times that the election will take place in 2010.  Is he giving an absolute assurance in this regard and what date has he in mind?  Second, Members on this side of the House and certainly Fine Gael Members, wish to see proper devolution of government from the centre to the local.  However, they do not wish to see the creation of another quango in the form of a directly-elected mayor without properly thought-out processes.  Opposition Members had a meeting with the Minister at which they expressed some views.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	718	Yes.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	719	The Minister did not take them on board.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	721	That is so. Consequently, the Minister should not state that the Opposition did not give feedback.  When Opposition Members see the colour of the Minister's money, just as with all legislation, they will respond.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	722	When will the Minister publish the Bill?
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	723	The Minister should bank that question.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch, briefly if possible, unless he wishes to announce the opportunity.
#CiaranLynch	unknown-#CiaranLynch-party	unknown-#CiaranLynch-dob	unknown-#CiaranLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	724	The Minister indicated in previous comments on the White Paper that it would be launched concurrently with the announcement of the mayoralty.  Has the White Paper being brought before the Cabinet or has the Minister a date on which he envisages it will be brought before the Cabinet?Second, we are a million miles away from a mayoral election if one operates on the assumption that the legislation must be passed in this House first before such an election can take place.  Moreover, the Bill itself has not even been finalised.  There are a number of aspects to the Bill, particularly in respect of transport.  Has the Minister or his departmental officials been in contact with the Minister for Transport, his officials and the NRA to deal with aspects of the Bill that are not covered at present, such as the issue of transportation for the Dublin area?I am bewildered by the Minister's comments in respect of considering submissions.  Deputy Hogan is correct to state that Opposition Members had a meeting with the Minister earlier in the year.  However, I thought the purpose of the Labour Party, Fine Gael and Sinn Féin and everyone else was to deal with this legislation by amendment and debate in this House and not to participate in some sort of consultancy programme that the Minister might have in mind.  Moreover, when the Bill does come before this House, the Minister should allow ample time for it to be debated.  If such time is allocated, I do not know how the Minister will achieve the goal of holding the election this year.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	725	I intend to take some poetic licence and I hope the Minister will not mind, given the day that is in it.  This evening in the Seanad there was apparently a highly emotional conclusion to the debate on the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Bill.  It was an historic moment and I noted that points of view were aired in the Seanad that were not necessarily aired when the Bill was debated in the Dáil.  As someone who was a Member of the Seanad for five years, I believe it plays an important role in the Oireachtas.  In that context, I noticed that the Minister was mentioned in an article that appeared in The Irish Times today on the issue of Seanad reform.  The article gave the impression that the Minister was unable to achieve cross-party consensus in his sub-committee on the issue, of which I was a member.  However, that was not my impression from our final meeting, as I thought there was consensus that progress could be made in certain areas, including broadening the franchise of those who elect the university Senators to all third level graduates.  The Minister might outline what steps he has taken in this regard, because issues pertaining to the mayor and the Seanad are related.
#CharlieOConnorFF	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-party	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-dob	unknown-#CharlieOConnorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	726	Tenuously.  I ask the Minister to draw the questions together and complete his contribution.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	727	While the Seanad is not directly elected, I wish to facilitate the Deputy.  I did not read the article to which she referred and will take it on trust that it says something along the lines of her comments.  The Deputy and I discussed this issue recently and as for the issue she raised regarding the third level panel, I agree there was a certain consensus on that issue and I wish to implement that change.To revert to Deputy Ciarán Lynch's query, I believe one can get through legislation quicker if one tries to develop a consensus before one enters the Chamber.  I hope that Members could short-circuit many issues by meeting to talk through them, to ascertain where a level of agreement exists on those issues and where they wished to go with it.  Earlier today, the Deputy mentioned the idea of adversarial politics.  Sometimes it is necessary and sometimes it is a hindrance.  In this case, I believe it would be a total hindrance because after all, this is something to which the Labour Party aspires.  We want to get it right as best we can.  Therefore, I repeat that my door is open and I genuinely wish to meet people to discuss these issues and tease them out.  While one hears about the summer break, etc., I will be around here for a long time during the summer——
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	728	Me too.

It is an opportunity for the parties opposite to come forward with written submissions on which Members can then focus.  I can honestly state that I will devote as much time as is necessary over the summer months to deal with this issue.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	730	I am currently giving consideration to the approaches that are to be taken to implement the commitments in the programme for Government  regarding political donations.  I intend to bring my proposals to the Government later this year.  I believe there is widespread recognition that the manner in which the Irish political system is funded needs to be changed.I therefore will be addressing definitively the relationship between business and politics in Ireland.  In this regard, I note the recent comments of the Director of Public Prosecutions.  In a speech to the Burren Law School on 1 May 2010 entitled, Prosecuting Corruption in Ireland, he stated, inter alia:a continuing weakness of the regime to prevent corruption is that private donations to political parties are still not limited although they have to be declared above a certain amount [and] I do not believe that so long as the private financing of political parties is allowed in an unlimited way it will be possible to eliminate political corruption.In bringing forward legislative proposals, I will have regard to the recommendations of the Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption and of the Standards in Public Office Commission.  The Council of Europe's Group of States Against Corruption published its third evaluation report on Ireland in January 2010, Transparency of Party Funding.  The report acknowledges that Ireland has developed a thorough system of regulation of party finance and is quite positive about the proactive and independent role of the Standards in Public Office Commission.The report also states, however, that further action is required to increase transparency and enhance controls.  It makes a number of specific recommendations, and is a valuable independent contribution to policy development in regard to the whole area of political funding.In its annual reports for 2007 and 2008, the Standards in Public Office Commission was critical of the level of transparency in how political parties finance their election campaigns.  The commission repeated its view that there is a strong case to be made for a new approach to the general funding of political parties and for increased transparency in such funding.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The banning of corporate donations is one of the very serious matters the Minister regards as a high priority.  That is why he has taken three years to do something about it.  It was part of the programme for government for 2007 but nothing has happened in that regard.I am surprised that the Minister was quoting from the Director of Public Prosecutions.  Surely he is not agreeing with the fact that all corporate donations are corrupt or lead to corruption.  Limits are already in place.  We are all in favour of transparency.  There are issues involving corporate donations on which we would be pleased to engage with the Minister but my party is in favour of retaining them for people who wish to contribute to the political process on an individual or corporate basis.I put it to the Minister that given that he has done nothing on the matter in three years he is not serious about it and that his colleagues in government are not in favour of it and therefore it will not see the light of day before the next general election.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	732	I refute that absolutely.  First, I am serious.  My colleagues in government are serious.  It is in the programme for government——

As I recall, under the leadership of Deputy Noonan the position was that Fine Gael would not accept corporate donations but then the party reverted.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	739	We changed the policy which we are entitled to do.

#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	741	It is a perception.

We want to eliminate that and ensure we have the highest standards and levels of transparency and that influential groups cannot influence the political process.I also believe we must examine the activities of certain lobby groups.  We have seen the extensive and amazing campaign that was launched by a group called RISE! recently.
#PhilipHogan	unknown-#PhilipHogan-party	unknown-#PhilipHogan-dob	unknown-#PhilipHogan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	743	What about the animal rights activists?  They were waging a campaign too.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	745	I assure the Deputy that I am interested in animal welfare.  I made that point forcefully today.  There are elements who deliberately try to mislead people who are extremely well funded.  It is very difficult to compete with that.  In a sense it undermines the democratic process.  I will embark on and deliver this initiative in the autumn because it is necessary for a properly functioning democracy.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	746	On the one hand I am sympathetic to what the Minister has in mind.  Personally, I do my best not to take corporate donations.  I have returned cheques I received.  However, there might be the odd exception where one might get a donation from someone where there was a personal relationship and it was a small donation.  When one has a fundraising event such as a race night if a person buys an advertisement then one is getting into the area of corporate donations if the business is incorporated.I have a few difficulties with the proposal.  One is that when one limits who can donate to parties one could be putting the onus on the candidate to come up with the money and that might favour the rich or a person might mortgage his or her house and then there is the possibility that he or she might become bankrupt and the attendant dangers that go with that such as being ineligible for a position on various elected bodies.  That problem needs to be taken into account.  We need to think through the proposal.  If one says corporate donations are bad then the implication is that individual donations are good.  Then one could have a wealthy individual making donations.In addition, the Government parties have an advantage.  We have had the experience, such as prior to the 2007 election, where Ministers took out big advertising campaigns which put them to the forefront and a regular candidate cannot compete with that.  The issue is extremely complicated.  Donations should be limited.  Transparency is important.  We should also limit the amount that can be spent.  I am in favour of the proposal but the Minister needs to be careful about how he does it.

Those are questions that must be considered in detail.  A large measure of credit must go to Eithne FitzGerald for the existing legislation which has served us well.  We must learn lessons and we must enhance the legislation.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	749	My Department published Tree Preservation Guidelines for Planning Authorities in March 1994, setting out a range of options open to planning authorities to influence and control the contributions that trees can make to the environment and our general quality of life.The guidelines set out how the development plan can be used to ensure that general amenities of the planning authority's area are enhanced through policy measures aimed at protecting and preserving trees, including by identifying areas where trees are likely to be of amenity value or special interest.  Practical suggestions are included in the guidelines to assist planning authorities in reviewing their development plans.Part 11 of the guidelines deals with tree preservation orders, the statutory protection mechanism specifically aimed at tree preservation, which should be used when it is in the public interest.  This Part also gives some practical guidance on preparing and making a tree preservation order.The guidelines also deal with the role the planning application process can play in protecting trees and enhancing the amenity value of trees through a variety of measures, including pre-planning discussions, encouraging developers to carry out tree surveys, further information requests and specific conditions to be attached to planning permissions.  Such measures can both protect existing trees and encourage new planting.  In addition, the guidelines address enforcement issues and other measures that may be taken by planning authorities to ensure that the amenity value of trees is enhanced.  I will keep the issue of whether these guidelines need to be updated under review.

The Minister said he intends to keep the issue under review but 1994 is a long time ago and there has been a lot of development since then.  Someone raised the issue with me who has some connection with groups that want to do more to conserve trees.  The Minister could seek submissions about how the guidelines might be reformed.  I ask the Minister to let me know if he has any plans.

I would like to hear from councillors because given that it is a reserved function I was trying to recall from my time as a councillor how many times such a tree preservation order came before the council.  I could not recall a single instance.Many Members have served as councillors and they would agree with me on that issue.  Therefore, we must hear from councillors on the effectiveness of the existing guidelines and whether they are being used.  If Members feel the guidelines are not working effectively, I will keep them under review.  I do not have any immediate plans in this regard but if I am shown how to improve the guidelines, I will consider the matter.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	756	Since entering office, I have attached the highest priority to the transposition and implementation of EU planning and environmental legislation.  I have secured the closure of 30 infringement cases during the past three years and my Department is in discussions with the Commission with a view to further closures later this year.In areas for which my Department has responsibility, the European Commission is currently in correspondence in respect of 21 cases covering the transposition and implementation of EU planning and environmental legislation, two of which relate to the late transposition of EU directives.  These are the directive providing for public participation in respect of the drawing up of certain plans and programmes relating to the environment and the directive establishing an infrastructure for spatial information in the European Community.I expect that the proceedings on the public participation directive should be addressed to the satisfaction of the Commission very shortly following completion of a number of steps including the commencement of a relevant provision in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009 and the making of further regulations to address issues.  As regards the directive establishing an infrastructure for spatial information, I expect to sign regulations into law shortly that will transpose it.The transposition date for one further European Union directive, on ambient air quality and cleaner air for Europe, was 11 June 2010.  My Department is working to ensure that the transposition of this directive will be completed as soon as possible, thus avoiding the initiation of infringement proceedings.The Commission made a decision on 29 October 2009 to refer Ireland to the European Court of Justice for an imposition of fines in relation to the directive on the quality required of shellfish waters, while deferring such referral for three months.  Following comprehensive work by my Department to address the outstanding issues involved, the Commission closed the case in March 2010.Ireland has never been fined by the EU for an environmental infringement.  I have met Environment Commissioner Potocnik since his appointment to reassure him of my commitment to resolving outstanding cases and to ensuring that Ireland is fully compliant with EU environmental law.

The Minister is at least three years in office and has had ample time to transpose into Irish law the various directives affecting the environment, for which area he has specific responsibility.How long will it take to transpose into Irish law all the remaining directives relevant to the Department?  From the Minister's discussions with the Commissioner, will he indicate the seriousness with which the Commissioner will consider Irish compliance failures?  Has he assured the Minister that there will be no fines imposed on Ireland?
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	758	I have had extensive discussions with former Commissioner Dimas.  Commissioner Potocnik has taken over from him.  I made it a priority to speak to the Commissioners directly in the company of a number of officials.  I had similar conversations with them.  I discussed possible outstanding infringements and did so very comprehensively.  I was probably not the only Minister responsible for the environment seeking meetings on this issue because it must be a priority for all of them.When I took up this position, there was a very serious issue in respect of potential fines.  This is why I keep the matter under constant review.  I said to the former and current Commissioners that I take a very simple view on the matter; I say that we will do whatever it takes.EU directives have been very good for environmental protection.  Without them, there would be an inferior state of play in so far as the environment is concerned.  It is a matter of regret that we point to Brussels critically too often.I recently saw the "Prime Time" programme on the protection of habitats, including 32 raised bogs.

We are taking every precaution possible and doing the work necessary, although we are playing catch-up.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	766	The role of my Department during a severe weather event is to ensure that the local authorities are prepared to respond promptly to ameliorate the worst effects regarding those aspects of an emergency for which they have direct responsibility and that they act in co-operation with the other principal response agencies — An Garda Síochána and the Health Service Executive — and the voluntary agencies and Defence Forces to limit the effects on individuals whose lives may be put at risk or who may be exposed to serious hardship.  When effective emergency plans are in place, the management of the emergency response then falls to the local authorities and the other response agencies.Up to the Christmas 2009 period, local authorities acted to ensure that the national road network remained open for public transport and access for the private sector for the delivery and receipt of goods and services.  My Department monitored the emerging position and, in light of a deteriorating trend, I convened the national emergency response co-ordination committee.  The committee facilitated a whole-of-Government approach and provided a forum for different Departments and agencies to exchange information, agree priorities and ensure that any matter that required a national response would be dealt with expeditiously.  This complemented but did not replace the continued co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements at local level.Having attended meetings of the national emergency response co-ordination committee, and considering the interaction of the various Departments and statutory agencies, I am satisfied there was an active and sustained response to the severe weather conditions by the local authorities and the other principal response agencies, with the support of the Defence Forces and co-operation of other statutory and voluntary bodies.  At all times, the co-ordination and inter-agency arrangements set out in the framework for major emergency management were implemented at local and regional levels.These co-ordination structures can be used regardless of whether a major emergency is declared.  It is a principle of emergency management internationally that the response to emergencies builds from the basic organisational units with capability to respond.  In Ireland, the principal response agencies are based locally and, where necessary, regionally.The national steering group on the framework for major emergency management carried out a review of participation in the response to the severe weather event.  It established that the arrangements set out in the framework operated satisfactorily and made some suggestions on operational matters that are under consideration by the group.The Government task force on emergency planning considered reports from various Departments and the agencies under their aegis.  The Departments and agencies will implement the reports' recommendations that fall within their remit.  The interdepartmental working group on emergency planning is considering cross-departmental issues that have a legal implication, such as insurance, statutory responsibility of householders and businesses to clear footpaths and the liability of volunteers.  The group will meet on 13 July to advance these matters so that action can be taken on them at an early date.The Joint Committee on the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has carried out a review of the management of severe weather events and taken evidence from the main response agencies.  I await its report and will give consideration to any recommendations contained therein.

I have heard the same reply and, whenever an emergency arises, we get the same report, namely, that a study group will review the situation.  We are in July and heading towards the next winter snap.  It is a disgrace that, six months after the last event, there is still no co-ordinated and properly integrated plan in place.Unfortunate people throughout the length and breadth of this country, from Cork to Westmeath and from Kildare to Galway, were marooned for weeks.  Does the Minister not recognise that the time is long past for statements on what he will do next time?  What has been learned from the experience of recent years and how quickly can the Government put in place the emergency operation?  Who is in control?

What is the co-ordinating authority, who is the senior person in command, who gives the instructions and who takes responsibility?  The Minister took none.  In fact, the Garda went searching for him to find out where he was.

What has happened to those reports?  Has someone reviewed them and compiled the information they contain?  Have they found their way into a single document containing recommendations?  Listening to the Minister, it would seem like business as usual despite events last winter.  As has been suggested, it would appear that no learning has been derived.

There must be something.  The key concept of emergency planning is risk assessment.  One must make a determined risk assessment before drafting an emergency plan.  As we head into next winter, is the Minister informing the House that last year's risk assessments are the same as those currently in place?

Where visibility is concerned, crucial during each event, be it the flooding or the cold snap, was the fact that we managed to communicate with local communities.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	802	I propose to take Questions Nos. 11, 22 and 40 together.Reports by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, have identified septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems as a potential source of water pollution, particularly of ground water sources, which are an important source of drinking water for many people.  This is particularly the case in areas with sensitive environments or high densities of on-site systems.  The renewed programme for Government includes a commitment to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.In October 2009, the European Court of Justice, ECJ, found that Ireland had failed to make adequate legislation for dealing with domestic waste water from septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.  Ireland's defence in the proceedings sought recognition for a range of monitoring and inspection powers under the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, the Local Government (Water Pollution) Acts 1977 and 1990, the Building Control Acts 1990 to 2007, the Planning and Development Acts 2000 to 2006 and the Water Services Act 2007.  However, the ECJ found that these provisions only partially implemented procedures to ensure the objectives of the waste directive.  In order to comply with the ECJ ruling, legislation is required to give effect to a new inspection and monitoring system for septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.On the publication of the joint Oireachtas committee's report, I wrote to the Chairman to note that its recommendations were both timely and welcome and to assure the committee that its report was being carefully considered.  I expect that the issues raised in it will be addressed comprehensively in the proposals that I will be introducing to give effect to the commitment in the renewed programme for Government and to ensure compliance with the court ruling.  My Department is considering how this monitoring and inspection system should operate and has been consulting extensively with the EPA, local authorities and other key stakeholders on the matter.  It is also intended to undertake consultations with wider stakeholders on the matter.  I intend to table proposals to the Government to address these matters later this year.The programme for Government, agreed in June 2007, included a commitment to introduce a scheme of support for the replacement and upgrade of septic tanks older than 15 years with newer systems.  The feasibility for introducing such a scheme will remain under ongoing review by my Department in light of budgetary constraints.Under my Department's rural water programme, grants are available to provide groups of households with the opportunity of connecting to public sewerage networks through communal sewage collection systems that are, in turn, connected to local authority sewers.  Alternatively, the communal sewage collection system may be connected to sewage treatment facilities provided by the groups themselves.  A grant of 75% of the approved cost, subject to a limit of €2,031.58 per domestic connection, whichever is the lesser, is available for eligible works.  Details of these grants may be obtained from the local authorities, to which the administration of the rural water programme has been devolved since 1997.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	803	What steps has the Minister taken to ensure the septic tank standards are raised to an acceptable level?  In terms of local authorities and the several sewage treatment works engaged in to date, of which one in particular comes to mind, what steps has he taken to ensure the matter is attended to urgently?  For example, the domestic water supply in a large lake in the west has suffered substantially from pollution originating in the municipal sewerage system.

I expect that the issues raised in the report will be addressed comprehensively in the proposals that I will be bringing forward to give effect to the commitment in the renewed programme for Government, and to ensure compliance with the court ruling.  My Department is considering how this monitoring and inspection system should operate, and has been consulting extensively with the Environmental Protection Agency, the local authorities and other key stakeholders on the matter.  It is also intended to undertake consultations with wider stakeholders on the matter and I intend bringing proposals to Government to address these matters later on this year.The programme for Government agreed in June 2007 included a commitment to introduce a scheme of support for the replacement and upgrade of septic tanks older than 15 years.  The feasibility for introducing such a scheme will remain under ongoing review by the Department in the light of the obvious budgetary constraints.Written Answers follow Adjournment Debate.

#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	807	This is my first opportunity to raise these issues as regards the development of the mental health services.  Some people will say this will not be noticed but at least I take every opportunity I can to raise the matter.The independent monitoring group report on the blueprint for improving the psychiatric service is a severe indictment of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government.  It is not acceptable that little substantial progress was made in 2009 in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  The lack of clarity around the new assistant director for mental health, the lack of authority around this post and the emerging clinical management and administrative structures within the health services is totally unacceptable.  The monitoring group expressed frustration and confusion about constantly changing management structures.  The assistant director for mental health that has been appointed, incidentally, is an excellent first-class public servant and this has nothing to do with either his ability or potential.It is difficult for the newly appointed executive clinical directors to carry out their task when there is an absence of detail in their precise roles, the relationship with clinical directors and the management structure of the HSE.  It is another damning indictment that the monitoring group found an absence of mental health leadership.The revenue allocation envisaged in A Vision for Change was not delivered in 2009 as promised.  In the absence of new capital and revenue resources, it is difficult to see how the HSE and the Government can achieve their objective to implement A Vision for Change.There is a continuing drop in the expenditure on mental health.  In 2009, expenditure was at 5.3% of total health care which reflects a continual decrease in the last number of years.  The Government must immediately introduce an overall national strategy to ensure the service user and family involvement is an integral part in the mental health care service development.The independent monitoring group report on the blueprint for improving the psychiatric service is a severe indictment of the Minister for Health and Children and the Government.  I call on the Minister to account for this neglect and to honour the Government commitment to develop the mental health services.There is a continuing drop in the expenditure on mental health.  In 2009, expenditure was at 5.3% of total health care.  It is extremely disappointing and unacceptable that little progress has been made in establishing fully developed and staffed community mental teams, both in adult and specialist mental health services.  In the absence of developed resources and staff, it is difficult to see how a vision of a community based mental service can be implemented.The Minister and the Government must immediately explain why there was a lack of significant progress during 2009 in the development of appropriate specialist mental health services such as rehabilitation, in recovery for older people, people with intellectual disability, forensic psychiatry, the homeless, co-morbid severe mental health, substance abuse problems and eating disorders.  I met Ms Jacinta Hayes from Bodywise today to discuss the problems to do with eating disorders.  There is also liaison, neuropsychiatry and borderline development disorder to be addressed.  No progress has been made on those issues.There was some progress as regards child and adolescent mental health services, but nonetheless these services have not received the priority and urgent attention they require.  In the absence of any child and adolescent psychiatry anything would be seen as progress, but nonetheless I welcome whatever tentative steps have been made in this regard.Ireland deserves a 21st century community-based person-centred mental health service grounded on the principles of recovery.  People recover from mental illness.  One in four will suffer a mental health problem at some stage of his or her life.  Early intervention means complete cure while delayed intervention presents difficulties.  Finally, the Government and the HSE must immediately renew their commitment to the full implementation of A Vision for Change.

It is an issue close to my heart.  I have been chairman of the Roscommon Mental Health Association for many years and hold that position at the moment.When A Vision for Change was published in 2006, it was universally welcomed as a progressive, evidence based and realistic document which proposed a new model of service delivery that would be patient-centred, flexible and community based.  The Government accepted A Vision for Change as the basis for the development of our mental health services over a seven to ten- year period.  Much has happened and much has changed economically in the four years since the report was launched, but it remains a progressive document and our roadmap, charting the way forward for our mental health services.Deputy John Moloney, Minister of State with special responsibility for mental health, published the 2009 annual report of the independent monitoring group for A Vision for Change on 1 July last.  The report acknowledges progress in relation to the development of child and adolescent services, the appointment of an assistant national director for mental health, executive clinical directors, and the gradual movement towards the creation of catchment areas as outlined in A Vision for Change.However, overall the monitoring group was disappointed with the progress achieved since the launch of A Vision for Change over four years ago.  I know that the Minister of State, Deputy Moloney, shares that disappointment and accepts progress on implementation in some areas is too slow.  It is important to recognise and acknowledge, however, that in many parts of the country, services are pressing ahead with the implementation of A Vision for Change.    Some significant steps have been taken over the past several years, including an increase in the number of inpatient beds for children under 18 and the doubling of bed numbers since 2007.  In addition we now have 55 child and adolescent mental health teams in place.  Additional beds have been provided in the Central Mental Hospital and a six-bed, high support step-down facility was opened in west Dublin to cater for patients on temporary release from the hospital.We are now providing in-reach services to prisons in Dublin and the midlands.  A court liaison service has been introduced to try, where appropriate, to divert persons from the criminal justice system to local psychiatric services.  We now have fewer involuntary admissions and shorter episodes of inpatient care have been achieved.  Up to 50% of discharges occur within two weeks of admission.  We have established a national service users executive which works on a partnership basis with the HSE and the Mental Health Commission on the planning, delivering, evaluating and monitoring of mental health services.The results of a recent survey of service users were very encouraging with satisfaction levels very high for some local services.  Within the HSE, a national lead on mental health has been appointed to ensure the delivery of mental health services in line with legislation and the Government's policy.  Executive clinical directors in psychiatry have also been appointed to lead reform in catchment areas serving populations of 350,000 to 400,000.A significant amount of work on the ground and preparatory planning has taken place within the HSE which will, I am confident, show tangible progress in 2010 and 2011.  This coupled with the provision in budget 2010 for a multi-annual programme of capital investment in high priority mental health projects, which will be funded from the proceeds of the disposal of psychiatric assets, will allow further progress to be made in the implementation of A Vision for Change.  In 2010 the HSE will proceed to dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €50 million in the mental health capital programme.  Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year's programme of asset sales.Major initiatives for 2010 include the completion of two 20-bed child and adolescent inpatient units in Cork and Galway.  Construction has commenced for a new acute psychiatric unit in Donegal, a new child and adolescent mental health facility in Cherry Orchard, Dublin, a new community nursing unit in Mullingar and Clonmel and a new acute unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the acute unit in St. Ita's Hospital, Portrane.  Acute admissions to St. Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman, will transfer to Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.  Investment of over €18 million will be made in County Wexford for the development of a modern mental health infrastructure to replace St. Senan's.A Vision for Change is a work in progress.  I accept progress has been somewhat slower than anticipated.  I am confident, however, the pace of implementation will improve now that the funding for the modernisation of our infrastructure has been secured and a care lead for mental health has been appointed in the HSE to drive the reform programme.I want on behalf of the Minister of State, Deputy John Moloney, to assure the House of the Government's unwavering commitment to the implementation of A Vision for Change.
#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	809	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this issue.It is an issue concerning a voluntary housing association in Kildare that could have wider implications for others across the country.  While I have no evidence to suggest anything untoward has happened, I am a little uneasy with a recent discussion with the local authority in respect of this association and similar housing associations.Voluntary housing associations are financially supported by the State under the capital allowance programme with free sites made available to them.  After completion of the estate, the association is required to establish a company to run the association, have an AGM, publish an annual report and liaise with its tenants regularly.  Up to 10,000 houses are held under such schemes.In the scheme in question, several tenants have become uneasy.  In the beginning everything went to plan with all instructions carried out in accordance with the rules and articles of association.  In the meantime a reluctance seems to have emerged on the part of the company to meet with the tenants and the local authority.  I have insisted on such a meeting and called for an audit to be carried out on the association's activities to protect the Department, the local authority, the company and the tenants.Will the Minister of State arrange for the association in question to meet with the relevant officials in the local authority and the tenants to address various questions that have emerged?  These include the possibility of an audit of the association's activities in the past seven years, when it last held an AGM, whether it has responded to tenants properly, whether it has reviewed rents annually and maintained the properties to the required level.  While I accept all of these may have been already addressed, it must be remembered that as associations receive funding from the Exchequer, it is incumbent on them to be transparent in answering such questions.There are arrears in the case of some tenants which one would expect if there were no rent reviews in the good times and then unanticipated rent increases in the downturn.  I hope the Minister of State will be able to get the association to address the tenants' concerns and ensure the sector does not fall into disrepute when there is a reluctance to give information when requested.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	810	I thank Deputy Durkan for raising this item as it allows me the opportunity to acknowledge the very good work done by the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.The sector has a proud record of achievement in the provision of rental accommodation to substantial numbers of vulnerable households over the past 20 years or so.  Since the 1980s, more than 23,000 homes have been delivered through the capital assistance scheme and the capital loan and subsidy scheme.  These capital funding schemes provide 100% funding for the provision of accommodation for people with special housing needs and low-income families respectively.  Both schemes are administered by housing authorities and it is a matter for each authority to ensure compliance with the terms and conditions of the schemes.The detailed requirements and relevant guidance are set out in the Department's memorandum, capital funding schemes for the provision of rental accommodation by approved housing bodies.  As outlined in the memorandum, housing bodies seeking funding under the schemes must have approved status under section 6 of the Housing Act 1992.  Such a body must have as its primary objectives the provision of accommodation for low-income families or persons with special needs and must have in its memorandum of association or registered rules, as the case may be, provisions prohibiting the distribution of any surplus, profit, bonus or dividend to members and requiring that the assets of the body be applied solely towards its objectives.In order to ensure that the voluntary and co-operative housing programme is best positioned to deliver on housing need, my Department commissioned an independent report by outside consultants on the future policy and direction of the programme.  The report, which I launched late last year, contains recommendations to identify strengths and weaknesses in corporate governance practices, including the examination of current practice with regard to monitoring and regulation of the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.Stakeholder consultation on the implementation of the principal recommendations of the Grant Thornton report is now well under way and is being done through the working group on voluntary and co-operative housing, which is representative of the Irish Council for Social Housing, the National Association of Building Co-operatives, the County and City Managers' Association and my Department.This brings me to the housing association specifically raised by Deputy Durkan.  Léim an Bhradáin Housing Association was granted approved status by my Department in 1997.  This housing body was properly established, is still effective and has submitted up-to-date returns to the Companies Registration Office.  In 2000, my Department approved funding of over €3 million under the capital loan and subsidy scheme for the provision of 32 houses by this approved housing body.I am sure Deputy Durkan will appreciate that my Department's primary role in voluntary and co-operative housing is to ensure sufficient funding is provided to meet ongoing demand for new projects.  Approved housing bodies are the owners of the accommodation financed under my Department's capital funding schemes and are responsible for the proper management and maintenance of dwellings, the fixing of rent and compliance with all relevant statutory requirements.  It is the responsibility of the body to ensure that proper procedures and governance arrangements are in place to achieve compliance with the terms of the capital funding schemes.I understand officials from Kildare County Council have been engaging closely with this approved body.  I draw the Deputy's attention to my earlier comment that it is a matter for the housing authority to confirm compliance with the terms and conditions of the scheme and to have suitable liaison arrangements in place to oversee the administration of the schemes.I understand an AGM was held recently.  Kildare County Council is in discussions with the body and is seeking the information to which it is entitled.  I hope there will always be a co-operative approach among tenants, bodies and local authorities in such situations.  I am supportive of this type of scheme and I would not like to see anything untoward happening in any area, although I am not saying that is the case here.  I have confirmation from Kildare County Council that it is in discussions with the association.  If anything further comes to the attention of my Department, I will be only too willing to pass it on to the Deputy.

We are playing for the Tipperary team tonight.  I apologise for not being here earlier as I was not expecting to be called so soon.Since we joined the EEC in 1973, the farming pillar has had two seats at the European Economic and Social Committee, one held by the IFA and one by the Irish Creamery Milk Suppliers' Association.  I was only a schoolboy in Cahir at that time.  The ICMSA is an 18,000-strong farm organisation that particularly represents dairy farmers, while the IFA concentrates more on sheep, beef, tillage and mixed farming.As the name implies, the EESC is a forum for representatives of the economic and social sectors in the member states to discuss common problems and submit recommendations to the European Commission.  Last week, it was announced that there will no longer be two seats at the EESC for the farming pillar.  One seat will be kept for the IFA, but the other seat — strangely enough, the dairy farmers' seat — is to be reallocated to BirdWatch Ireland.I emphasise that I have no problem with BirdWatch Ireland; its members in my own constituency do much good work with regard to nature reserves and so on.  However, this decision is totally cuckoo.  We had the cuckoo in my area in April, and he is still giving the odd chirp, but what is happening here is bordering on lunacy.  The only sector in Ireland that has the potential to build the export business that every economist agrees is the sole hope for rebuilding our economy has been unceremoniously dumped off a vital EU economic forum and replaced with an organisation that represents bird watchers.  Goodness gracious.Is it really wise to remove an expert dairy representative from the EESC and replace that voice with one from BirdWatch Ireland?  Is it in the national interest?  I say "No".  Will economic recovery be helped more by the presence of a representative of the Irish dairy sector — the biggest indigenous exporter we have — or a representative of Ireland's bird-watching community?  I do not think many people would have a problem giving the answer to that.Who exactly does BirdWatch Ireland represent and what is its capacity for economic and social research and analysis?  Is this move politically motivated?  I believe it is.  Is the Green Party putting in place sleepers to maintain their influence in key positions?  I believe it is.  I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is here.  Where was BirdWatch Ireland, and other people, when we were trying to get the Lisbon treaty passed in two referendums?  The ICMSA stood steadfast with us.  It should be obvious to any reasonable person that this is a ludicrous decision.  It must be reversed, or, at least, another seat must be provided to allow for the very important work of the ICMSA to be represented at the committee.
#MarieHoctorFF	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-party	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-dob	unknown-#MarieHoctorFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	815	I add my strong voice in support of my colleague, Deputy Mattie McGrath, on this difficult issue for the farming sector and particularly the dairy sector.  Like my colleague, I emphasise that I have absolutely no difficulty with BirdWatch Ireland; I acknowledge the good work of this organisation not only in Tipperary but across the country.  However, I wish to resolve this issue if at all possible.According to the EESC:The EESC has currently 344 Members who are appointed for a term of four years.  The current mandate (2006-2010) ends in October 2010.  Following the new Lisbon Treaty, from October 2010 onwards, the mandate will be five years.  The number of EESC members will remain 344, but the Lisbon Treaty permits the number to grow up to 350 Members with the next EU enlargements.This area needs to be examined.  An extra seat could be provided to meet the needs of the extra environment pillar which has been created in the social partnership structure, to be allocated as appropriate to the sector.  I believe the Government should enter into negotiations with EU to secure this extra environmental pillar seat.In the meantime, I propose that traditional allocation of two seats for the farming sector — that is, the IFA and the ICMSA — be restored.  It is important that the ICMSA as well as the IFA be represented on the committee in view of the upcoming reform of CAP, which is crucial for our dairy sector.  I acknowledge the work of all the groups that have been mentioned in our speeches tonight.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	816	I thank Deputies McGrath and Hoctor for their contributions.  The European Economic and Social Committee, EESC, plays an important role in the European policy making process and I am delighted with the opportunity to speak on the matter this evening.The EESC is a consultative body of the European Union and is the prime forum for the representation of organised civil society within the European decision making process.  The committee has 344 members, broken down into three groups — employers; employees; and various interests.  The various interests group represents a wide variety of organisations, including non-governmental organisations, farmers' organisations, co-operatives, non-profit associations and environmental organisations.  Ireland has nine places on the committee and membership is divided equally between the three constituent groups of the committee, with three places for employers, three places for employees and three places for various interests.  The Government sought nominations from the social partners in line with long established practice and these were then conveyed by the Government to the Secretariat of the European Council.  The business and employers' pillar and trade union pillar both provide three nominees, including one trade union representative from Northern Ireland.  For the first time, the various interests group of the committee now includes a representative from the environmental pillar.  This change reflects the decision which was taken by Government last year to create a fifth pillar of social partnership to represent environmental concerns.  The community and voluntary pillar and the farming pillar each provide one nominee.The environmental pillar consists of 27 organisations with a diverse range of interests.  The Irish Environmental Network provides a secretariat for the pillar.  This is the first time that environmental interests have been represented in Ireland's nominations.  The EESC is mandated to consider environmental issues.  Other countries have long had environmental organisation representatives among their nominees and environmental sustainability is a key focus of European policy.  The environmental pillar selected an employee of BirdWatch Ireland as its nominee on the committee.  She was selected to represent the pillar as a whole and represents the interests of the 27 organisations in the environmental pillar and environmental interests more generally.  It is therefore not accurate to characterise her appointment as a BirdWatch Ireland appointment.This change to the composition of the Irish representation on the committee does not reflect any diminution of the Government's commitment to the agricultural industry.  The farming sector is an extremely important part of the Irish economy and the Government continues to strongly support its development at national and EU level.  The prosperity of many rural areas is heavily dependent on the performance of the agri-food sector and we all, Government, farming organisations and the wider agri-business community, need to continue to work together to meet the continued and ongoing challenges ahead.  It is also important to note that the farming pillar of social partnership and farming interests continue to be represented on the committee through a representative of the Irish Farmers' Association.  I would, however, like to take this opportunity to acknowledge the work of representatives of the Irish Creamery and Milk Suppliers Association, ICMSA, on the EESC, including the most recent ICMSA representative, Mr. Frank Allen who has been an active member since his appointment.The EESC plays an important role in formulating policy at European level and I would like to wish all of Ireland's nominees the very best for the forthcoming term of the EESC.

Under the Acts, the primary management and enforcement response to littering must come from the local authorities.  Therefore, it is a matter for each local authority to decide on the most appropriate enforcement actions in their areas, taking account of local circumstances and priorities.During 2009, 22,830 on-the-spot litter fines were issued, 3,074 prosecutions were initiated and 692 convictions were secured by local authorities under the Litter Pollution Acts.  I believe this demonstrates a commitment by local authorities to enforcing the legislation in a pro-active way.Penalties for littering offences are already substantial, ranging from an on-the-spot fine of €150, to a maximum fine of €3,000 on summary conviction and a maximum fine of €130,000 on conviction on indictment.  Therefore, I have no plans to increase the level of fines for litter related offences at this time.In relation to specific recent measures designed to assist local authorities in dealing with litter pollution, I have allocated €1.5 million over a three year period in support of a new initiative, the Tourist Season Anti Litter Support Grant Scheme, and I am also establishing an Action Group to address the problem of rural and roadside litter.

The main effect of these changes is that persons who are six months in private rented accommodation and whose circumstances have changed such that they can no longer afford the rent do not require to have an assessment of housing need carried out by a local authority in order to be considered for rent supplement.For other applicants for rent supplement, including those leaving the family home for the first time, a full assessment of their housing needs carried out by the relevant local authority is required.  It is a matter for individual local authorities to manage the assessment process.  However, my Department has asked authorities to put in place special arrangements for dealing with persons leaving institutions or who are homeless.The changes referred to were brought about following discussions between my Department and the Department of Social Protection and in consultation with the Community Welfare Service and local authorities.  The operation of the arrangements is monitored by a group representative of the two Departments.

Data on social housing commencements are published in the quarterly housing statistics bulletin, the most recent of which is Q3 2009. The full range of data compiled and bulletins issued can be viewed on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.Under the social housing investment programme, local authorities traditionally met social housing needs mainly through the construction of housing in local authority estates and the funding of similar projects through the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.  To date in 2010, I have allocated a total of €457.18 million in capital funding to individual local authorities to cover the costs of new construction, Part V and other acquisitions, ongoing projects and final accounts, not including regeneration and remedial works allocations.  To ensure that this investment programme is delivered in a coherent and coordinated manner, each housing authority was required to prepare 2010 Housing Action Plans, having regard to their notified funding allocations, and the prioritisation of projects and new proposals, including those involving direct construction.  Under these plans, particular emphasis was placed on achieving best value for money while responding to local housing needs.In addition to construction projects and acquisitions, social housing supply channels have been expanded to include new arrangements with private landlords under the Rental Accommodation Scheme and the long-term leasing initiative.  Where housing authorities continue to use direct construction as a component part of their supply programmes, the emphasis has changed from larger new-build construction projects to those with regeneration benefits and smaller infill combined construction and remedial works projects, to expand and improve the existing stock of local authority owned dwellings so as to maximise availability and use.

In the absence of an occupancy condition attaching to the allocation of an affordable house the very principle for providing that house could be undermined and call into question the use of Exchequer funding for purposes other than those for which they were intended.As indicated in the reply to Question No. 490 of 29 June 2010, the terms and conditions of the various affordable housing schemes and the regulations governing local authority loans do not prohibit an affordable home owner from renting a spare room in his/her home, though a local authority may, for good reason, attach conditions to the contract with the purchaser pertaining to subletting of the unit and its use by the purchaser as his/her normal place of residence.If it were the case that an affordable house was to be fully sublet it would be difficult to put in place adequate controls to prevent those persons who could afford to purchase a house from their own resources taking advantage of the situation to purchase an affordable house with the express intention to rent it out. The abandonment of a condition that an affordable house be used as the normal place of residence of an affordable purchaser could be detrimental to the objectives of the schemes.A range of supports are available where a household is facing difficulties in meeting mortgage repayments, whether from a local authority or private lender.

It also includes a provision to address the position of practically trained persons in that it includes a category for those who have been assessed as eligible for registration by the Technical Assessment Board in accordance with the practical experience assessment procedure, that is practising architecture for a minimum period of 10 years in the State.The Royal Institute of the Architects of Ireland, which is designated as registration body for Architects under the Building Control Act 2007, has established an Admissions Board and a Technical Assessment Board so that the registration process may commence in the near future.  The RIAI has appointed architects to the boards and I have appointed the Chairpersons and non-architect majority to both boards.  Section 22 of the Act sets out the procedures for the operation of the Technical Assessment Board.The Act provides for an appeal against a decision of the Technical Assessment Board to an Appeals Board which will be appointed shortly.  The Appeals Board will also have an independent Chairperson and a majority of lay members.  An appeal to the High Court can also ultimately be made against a decision of the Appeals Board or any other Board or Committee.

The review will consider what measures may be required to ensure a consistent approach to these issues across all planning authorities, and to improve the delivery of planning services generally.To assist the review, my Department wrote to the following six planning authorities — Carlow, Cork, Galway and Meath County Councils, and Cork and Dublin City Councils — on 23 June, asking them to examine a range of submissions made to me by stakeholder groups and individuals covering different planning issues and to provide a detailed response to the issues raised by 16 July.  I have also included Donegal County Council as part of this review on the basis of previously having requested and received a comprehensive report from the Council on a range of planning matters highlighted to my Department.  These planning authorities represent a broad geographical spread of both urban and rural areas as well as both large and small authorities.My Department will be establishing a panel of experts as soon as possible to undertake these reviews.

Implementation of the homelessness strategy at local and regional level will be carried out through the framework of statutory homelessness action plans adopted by housing authorities under the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009.  This legislation further reinforces the role of the housing authorities, working with relevant statutory and non-statutory agencies, in the planning, implementation and oversight of homeless services and action to address homelessness as effectively as possible at local and regional level, in accordance with the objectives of the homelessness strategy.My Department's role in relation to homelessness involves the provision of a national framework of policy, legislation and funding to underpin action to address homelessness at local or regional level.  Substantial work has been carried out in this regard during the past two years.Total funding for homeless accommodation and related services was increased in 2009 by 5% and in monetary terms to €62m, which represented a higher increase in real terms.  Notwithstanding unavoidable retrenchment in State funding generally, this higher level of funding is being maintained in 2010, which is indicative of the priority that I and the Government attach to addressing homelessness.A comprehensive range of measures has been put in place to underpin the role of housing authorities and approved housing bodies in addressing homelessness at local level.  This includes an enhanced programme for procurement of accommodation, which was announced just before Easter, to advance the core strategic objective of eliminating long term homelessness and help housing authorities to meet their targets for accommodating homeless households.  While the objectives in the homelessness strategy are challenging, I believe they are achievable.  Delivery on this programme will be determined primarily by action on the part of housing authorities and approved housing bodies and the response of market interests, including property owners and financial institutions.  My Department is continuing to engage closely with the housing authorities to ensure that delivery of accommodation is maximised.

This was followed by an extensive programme of national consultation, for purposes of informing the preparation of the White Paper on Local Government.A dedicated Cabinet Committee has been engaged in finalising the policy decisions for inclusion in the White Paper on Local Government.  I intend to publish the White Paper as soon as possible following completion of the Government's deliberations.I established the Local Government Efficiency Review Group to review the cost base, expenditure of and numbers employed in local authorities with a view to reporting on:Specific recommendations to reduce costs;The effectiveness of particular programmes;Optimal efficiency in the way programmes are delivered; and,Any other proposals to enhance value for money in the delivery of services at local level.I asked the Local Government Efficiency Review Group to complete its work by mid year and expect it to report to me very shortly.  The Group's findings and recommendations will then be brought to Government and will be considered in the appropriate policy and financial contexts.  I intend that the Group's report will be published as soon as possible following presentation to Government.

Regulations are now in preparation in my Department which will give detailed effect to the new needs assessment process.  It is envisaged that these Regulations will be made, and section 20 of the Act will be commenced, in September 2010.It is intended that, under these Regulations, a more standardised and consistent approach to income assessment by housing authorities will be adopted.  Section 20 in particular provides that the Minister may, by regulation, set an income threshold for access to social housing support.  The income threshold will define the boundary between what a household can be expected to provide for from its own resources through renting/purchasing in the private market and what cannot reasonably be afforded.  Thresholds set in relation to income eligibility will also take account of varying levels of affordability between authorities.

Of these, 9 have been approved, with 4 of these now drawn down.  Of the 9 approved applications, 5 were for second hand properties and 4 for new build properties.  The 4 loans drawn down refer to new build properties.The total cost of administering the scheme is approximately €290,000.  These costs include the setting up of the central processing unit (CPU) within the Affordable Homes Partnership (AHP).  These costs were met fully from within existing resources within the AHP.  It should be noted that a significant element of the staffing costs was incurred in the development of the loan processing model which applies to the Home Choice Loan but which has also now been used in the development of revised systems for processing and credit checking of standard local authority house purchase loan applications under other schemes such as affordable housing, shared ownership etc.The scheme is intended to be a temporary one which will be withdrawn once conditions in credit markets return to normal patterns.

Those recommendations relating to planning and to physical aspects of multi-unit developments were addressed in 2007-08 through the Planning Guidelines issued by my Department addressing design standards, sustainable residential development and the taking in charge of residential developments/management arrangements.The Law Reform Commission's Report also recommended that legislation be introduced to address a range of other key issues, relating to management companies, common areas, service charges, sinking funds and dispute resolution.  These recommendations were then considered by an interdepartmental group which included representatives from my Department, the Department of Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, the Department of Justice and Law Reform, the Department of the Taoiseach and the National Consumer Agency.  The deliberations of this group led to the preparation of the Multi-Unit Developments Bill 2009 by the Department of Justice and Law Reform.  Matters relating to this Bill, including the timing of enactment, are the responsibility of the Minister for Justice and Law Reform.

This scheme will replace the current tenant purchase scheme introduced in 1995.The intention to replace the existing tenant purchase scheme was signalled in the housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, which was the subject of consultation with interested parties.  The decision to begin the wind-down of the scheme was the subject of consultation with the County and City Managers' Association.To ensure an orderly wind-down of the existing scheme, my Department has requested housing authorities to inform all existing tenants of houses as soon as possible (and new tenants on allocation of a house) of the decision to end the scheme so that they have sufficient time to apply to purchase their home under the existing scheme if they so wish.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	833	Since 1994, an integrated pollution control (IPC) licensing system has been administered by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).  This system anticipated the provisions of the 1996 Integrated Pollution Prevention and Control (IPPC) Directive and delivered substantial compliance with the Directive.  A number of legislative changes were, however, necessary to complete Ireland's transposition of the Directive and these were introduced in 2003, to provide for implementation of the IPPC licensing system.The EPA is the competent authority for the implementation of the IPPC Directive in Ireland. There are currently approximately 585 active IPPC licensed installations covering a range of large scale industrial and agricultural activities that have the potential to cause significant environmental pollution.I am aware that the EPA had encountered difficulties in bringing the intensive pig and poultry sectors fully into the IPPC licensing system by the 30 October 2007 implementation deadline.  The Office of Environmental Enforcement within the EPA has been investigating the installations in question and a number of successful prosecutions have been taken following site inspections.I am satisfied that the EPA has sufficient powers to continue to take such action as is necessary to bring any installation operating above the IPPC licensing threshold into compliance with the Directive.

This is now being examined and my Department will respond to the Council's proposals as soon as possible with a view to progressing the scheme.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	836	I propose to take Questions Nos. 32 and 527 together.Following the Government decision not to proceed with implementation of electronic voting in Ireland, an Interdepartmental Task Force, chaired by my Department, was established to bring the project to an orderly conclusion and to oversee disposal of the equipment and termination of storage arrangements.  To date, the Task Force has met five times, with its most recent meeting taking place in June 2010.  Between meetings, my Department maintains ongoing contact with members of the Task Force, in order to progress work on the cessation arrangements for the project.  While proposals have not at this stage been invited in respect of the equipment, some expressions of interest have been received.  The Task Force aims to complete its work as soon as possible.In considering options for disposal of the equipment, the priority is to pursue the most economically advantageous approach, with a view to achieving the maximum recovery of cost possible in the circumstances, consistent with environmental and other obligations.In 2007, over 60% of the machines (4,762 in total) were moved from 12 local storage locations to a central facility at Gormanston Army Camp.  There are no ongoing rental costs in respect of the use of this property.  The remaining machines are stored at 13 local premises that were originally identified by Returning Officers for this purpose. It is intended that all machines will be removed from their present locations when arrangements for disposal are implemented.  Work on termination of local lease arrangements is proceeding in this context.Pending completion of arrangements for the disposal of the machines, costs are being incurred for their storage.  The following table, which is based on information received in my Department from Returning Officers, provides details of the annual costs for storage of the electronic voting equipment for 2009, and of the lease arrangements at each property.City/CountyStorage Costs 2009 (incl.

A Preliminary Report is required for the further advancement of the Castleblayney Sewerage Scheme and my Department is awaiting the submission of this report.The scope and format of the Programme for 2010 to 2012, is designed to better reflect ongoing environmental and economic priorities, to maximise the return on public funds being invested in the sector and to ensure that the Programme is realistic in its level of ambition.  The total value of contracts underway and those proposed for commencement during the period of the programme in County Monaghan is just under €42 million.A key input to the development of the Programme was the assessment of needs prepared by local authorities, including Monaghan County Council, in response to my Department's request to the authorities in 2009 to review and prioritise their proposals for new capital works in their areas.  These were subsequently appraised in my Department in the context of the funds available and key criteria that complemented those used by the authorities. The upgrading of sewerage services in Clones and Ballybay was not proposed by Monaghan County Council in its Assessment of Needs submitted to my Department.

It is their duty to ensure, as far as possible and with the cooperation of the public, the accuracy and comprehensiveness of the Register.The Programme for Government, agreed in 2007, contains a commitment to establish an independent Electoral Commission. The renewed Programme for Government, agreed in October 2009, reaffirms this commitment and identifies a range of responsibilities which the Commission will be mandated to fulfil. The Commission's responsibilities will include taking charge of the compilation of a new national rolling electoral register.I expect to progress the establishment of an Independent Electoral Commission this year.

The Programme comprises just over 130 contracts and water conservation projects in progress with a value of about €1 billion, some 340 contracts to be progressed to construction over the period 2010-2012 with a value of €1.8 billion and some 190 schemes and water conservation projects on which planning work will continue.Investment under the Water Services Investment Programme is complemented by investment annually under the Rural Water Programme — a largely devolved programme of investment on relatively smaller water services schemes and the group water sector.  Of the total of €93 million available under the Rural Water Programme in 2010, block allocations amounting to some €85 million were made to County Councils.  The remaining funds are targeted at small public water supplies, which, based on Environmental Protection Agency reports, require remedial action.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	840	At my request, the Dublin Docklands Development Authority has undertaken a comprehensive review of its corporate governance procedures, commissioning two reports in relation to its planning and financial management processes.  In an associated summary overview report, the Authority's Executive Board has outlined the extensive programme of actions to address specific recommendations made in these reports, and it is confident that its current planning administration and financial management practices are robust.  All of the reports concerned are available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.Arising from the comprehensive analysis and conclusions of the Authority's corporate governance review and acknowledging, in particular, the view of the Authority's Board regarding the need for a further investigation to deal with certain matters, the Government has decided to bring the Authority within the remit of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  The making of an Order giving effect to this decision is a matter for the Minister for Finance.In relation to the Authority's financial situation, while the Authority remained in deficit in 2009, it has instigated a major series of reforms and cost-cutting measures, including a re-examination and prioritisation of all expenditure and a significant reduction in staff numbers and associated payroll costs, with a view to moving toward a financial break even position over the next two years.  The Authority is in ongoing discussion with my Department and the Department of Finance in relation to its financial position.In relation to the Authority's participation in the Becbay Joint Venture, established to purchase the Irish Glass Bottle Site, I understand that the loans taken out in the context of financing this transaction have now been transferred to the National Assets Management Agency and that NAMA has requested Becbay Ltd to submit a detailed business plan in relation to its outstanding debts by the end of July.

Given the considerable changes in economic and social development since the current Retail Planning Guidelines were published in 2001 and updated in 2005, particularly in relation to population and settlement patterns, it is important that the forward planning context for future retail development remains robust and realistic.In this context, my Department published a Retail Planning Issues Paper for public consultation on 28 June, with a closing date for submissions of 30 July.  This Paper sets out high-level and strategic issues for retail planning and provides an opportunity for stakeholders and interested parties to assist in identifying key issues to be considered in the context of preparing and drafting revised retail planning guidelines.  It is intended that the revised guidelines will be drafted before the end of the year, and will then be subject to a full public consultation process before their finalisation.

I am a member of the Cabinet Committee on Transforming Public Services which oversaw the negotiations on the Agreement. In particular, I participated in a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance on 11 March 2010 with the Officers of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions to explore the potential and appropriate conditions for a renewed engagement between the Public Service unions and management on the development of a comprehensive agenda for the transformation of public services and on a framework for Public Service pay determination. Both sides agreed at that meeting to invite Mr Kieran Mulvey and Mr Kevin Foley of the Labour Relations Commission as facilitators to undertake initial discussion with Public Service management and unions.

The Directive establishes the dates by which such treatment is to be provided, which varies depending on the size of the agglomeration concerned.Compliance with the requirements of the Directive has been a particular focus of investment under the Water Services Investment Programme over the past decade.  Some €2.7 billion or 73% of total Exchequer spending on the Programme over the period 2000 to 2009 has been related to waste water infrastructure.  In 2000, 25% of urban waste water discharges were in compliance with the end of 2005 requirement to subject discharges from agglomerations of a population equivalent of 2,000 (in the case of fresh or estuarial waters) or 10,000 (in the case of coastal waters), as appropriate, to secondary treatment prior to discharge. Compliance has now risen to some 92%, with all remaining non-compliant agglomerations included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.Section 16 of the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act 1977 provides for licensing by each local authority of trade effluent discharges to sewers in its functional area.  Discharges to waters are licensed under Section 4 of that Act.  The attachment of conditions to trade effluent licences is a matter for each local authority on a case by case basis, having due regard to protection of public health and practical operational requirements.  Discharges from local authority waste water treatment plants are in turn subject to authorisation by the Environmental Protection Agency under the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	844	Groundwater is a valuable natural resource in Ireland, used in food and industrial processing, as well as being an important source of drinking water.  The original Groundwater Directive (80/68/EEC) was transposed into national legislation through:the Local Government (Water Pollution) Act, 1977 to 1990;the Local Government (Water Pollution) Regulations, 1978;the Protection of Groundwater Regulations, 1999 (these regulations are due to be repealed and replaced by the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations 2007 in 2013); andthe Local Government (Water Pollution) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999.The effect of this legislation is that discharges to groundwater are permitted only under prior authorisation by way of a licence from the relevant local authority. The only exception to the authorisation requirement is for on-site waste water treatment for dwellings and these require planning permission under the Planning and Development Act 2000. Further measures will be introduced to manage discharges from on-site waste water treatment systems in light of the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce a scheme for the licensing and inspection of these systems and in response to a European Court of Justice finding that Ireland failed to make adequate legislation for dealing with these systems.The original Groundwater Directive will be repealed by 2013. It will be replaced by the requirements of the Water Framework Directive (2000/60/EC) and new Groundwater Directive (2006/118/EC) which are given legal effect by the European Communities Environmental Objectives (Surface Waters) Regulations 2009 and European Communities Environmental Objectives (Groundwater) Regulations 2010.  Under the Groundwater Regulations 2010 local authorities, under the general supervision of the EPA, are the responsible authority in respect of enforcement of the stringent standards required by this legislation.

Of these, 614 of the units have lease agreements signed and in place with approved housing bodies.While the cost of the lease agreement is a matter for the relevant local authority, in general, in most lease agreements the approved housing body pay the local authority a nominal fee for the property and the body collect and retain the differential rent from the tenant to support the cost of managing and maintaining the dwelling.  My Department recoups to the local authority the interest payments liable in respect of the loans taken by the authority to fund the affordable properties in the first instance.  The average monthly cost for the units approved to date is €511 per unit, which equates to a yearly cost per unit of €6,132.

After due consideration of these submissions, the General Scheme of a Noise Nuisance Bill was prepared and approved by the Government in May 2009.  At the time the Scheme was approved, a number of issues were identified which would have to be addressed during the drafting of the Bill.  My Department, in conjunction with the Office of the Attorney General, is progressing matters in this regard and the Bill is scheduled for publication later this year.While there are already a wide range of measures in place to deal with noise from a variety of sources, the aim of the new legislation will be to take a more integrated approach to noise nuisance, including through codes of practice for construction, commercial and domestic situations. There will, in addition, be measures to increase awareness of how noise nuisance can be addressed and I am currently examining options to strengthen existing local authority powers, including the possible introduction of a system of fixed payment notices in relation to noise nuisance offences.

Reflecting the ambition of the Programme commitment, I have made it clear that I want to see a sustainable, resource-based approach to waste management.  This will involve a shift in focus, from residual waste management options such as landfill and incineration, to technologies such as Mechanical Biological Treatment which can maximise the value to be extracted from what should be viewed as a resource rather than as a waste.The Programme's objectives to implement this policy change included a commitment to carry out an international review of waste management plans, practices and procedures and to act on the conclusions. The report, by a group of Irish and international consultants engaged to carry out a major study to underpin the conclusion of the review, was published in November 2009.In the coming weeks I will be publishing a consultation document which will set out the various elements being considered as part of the development of a new national waste management policy for the coming decade and beyond.  Its core objective will be to set Ireland on an ambitious trajectory towards high value, high quality resource and waste management, using leading edge technology with significant potential to add value and create jobs in the economy.

These proposals will give effect to the commitment in the renewed Programme for Government to introduce charging for domestic water in a way that is fair, significantly reduces waste and is easily applied. I expect to bring these proposals to Government in the coming weeks.I refer also to the replies to Questions Nos. 346, 347, 348, 349, 350, 351, 352, 353, 354, 358, 359 and 360 of 7 July 2010.

However, these Regulations will apply to new rent schemes, which housing authorities will be required to put in place in 2011 under the Housing Act, 2009, and represent a reasonable provision that where a tenant of a housing authority has not paid the appropriate rent to the authority interest can be applied to the amount outstanding.Notwithstanding this, there are explicit powers in the 2009 Act to allow housing authorities to take other actions where a household genuinely experiences financial hardship.  Housing authorities, under these provisions, can develop reasonable repayment agreements including, if appropriate, an adjustment to rent due to assist households in such circumstances.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I wish to advise the Deputy that on the basis of valid claims entered in the Redundancy Payments System in my Department, there is no record of a redundancy claim having been received in respect of the individual in question.  Application should be submitted to my Department on an RP50 form completed and signed as appropriate by the employer and the employee.  This form can be completed online or downloaded from the Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  In the case of forms submitted online, it is necessary also to submit a signed hard copy of the form. Claims are not imported onto the Redundancy Payments System until a signed copy is received.It is also my Department's practice not to enter incomplete claims on the system as these claims cannot be processed until the necessary documentation is submitted.  Forms are returned to allow missing details and/or supporting documentation to be submitted.  The documentation required in support of lump sum claims, is set out on my Department's website at www.entemp.ie.  Submission of correctly completed Redundancy claim forms (RP50’s) with all of the required documentation greatly facilitates the processing of claims.The documentation required in support of lump sum claims is evidence of the employer's inability to pay the redundancy entitlements to the employees.  This involves requesting a statement from the company's Accountant or Solicitor attesting to the inadequacy of assets to make the redundancy payments and, the latest set of financial accounts for the company.  The employer is also asked to admit liability for the 40% liability attaching to the company arising from the redundancy payments.If this information is provided to the Department, the employees are paid their redundancy entitlement from the Social Insurance Fund.  Upon payment, the Department pursues the company for the 40% share that the company would ordinarily have been expected to pay to the employees.If the necessary supporting documentation required from the employer is not provided to my Department, the employee will be advised by my Department to take a case to the Employment Appeals Tribunal (EAT) against the employer to seek a determination establishing the employee's right and entitlement to redundancy.  Once such a determination is available, the Department is then in a position to make the payment to the employee concerned.  Should the outstanding documentation be provided by the employer during the period while the case is pending a hearing before the EAT, this would allow the claim to be processed by my Department in the usual way.

The only exemption in relation to fees is in the case of applicants having established charitable status with the Revenue Commissioners or, if the application is in respect of an unlimited permit.  An unlimited permit refers to a situation where an individual has been with the same employer for a period of 5 years.The fee for an employment permit for any period of 6 months or less is €500 and I regret to advise the Deputy that no exemption is possible in this instance.

In addition, the CEBs deliver a range of non-financial supports to improve management capability development within micro-enterprises designed to help new and existing enterprises to operate effectively and efficiently so as to last and grow.Statistical information in relation to CEBs is collated annually.  Information for the years 2005, 2006, 2007, 2008 and 2009 is set out in the following tables for each of the CEBs.  In relation to the numbers employed by each CEB it should be noted that the basic staff complement in respect of each CEB is one Chief Executive Officer, one Assistant Chief Executive Officer, one Business Advisor and one Clerical/Administrative Officer (although some of the larger CEBs have more than one Clerical/Administrative Officer).  Prior to the moratorium on public sector recruitment/promotion some CEBs would have employed additional staff on a contract basis to deliver specific time bound Programmes to the micro-enterprise sector.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	860	One aspect of the changes in responsibilities announced by the Taoiseach last March concerning my Department and the Department of Education and Skills was to streamline under one Department of State support for those who are seeking to re-skill and ready themselves to re-enter the jobs market.   The overarching aims of all the changes made in March at Department level, as the Taoiseach told the House, were to:group functions whose combination is more appropriate to current priorities than the present arrangements;ensure greater coherence and produce more efficient delivery; andunderline the priority issues for this Government in a way that mobilises a broad response.With regard to ensuring that our people have the skills and competences to fill jobs, especially those with a high value-added content, the Taoiseach decided that responsibility for skills and training policy was to be re-allocated to the Department of Education and Skills.  The clear aim of this element of the change of responsibilities was to better align the work of FÁS, which formerly came within my Department's remit, more closely with the further education and training activities of the VECs, the Institutes of Technology and programmes such as Youthreach.  As a consequence of this realignment, superintendence of FÁS and its skills training activities is now the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills lead by An Tánaiste.In the new arrangements, my Department continues to work closely with the Department of Education and Skills to support the capacity of the education and training sectors to meet the needs of enterprise.  One practical example in this regard is the continued collaboration of both Departments on the Expert Group on Future Skills Needs (EGFSN) which advises the Government on current and future skills needs of the economy and on other labour market issues that impact on Ireland's enterprise and employment growth.  The EGFSN continues to have a central role in ensuring that labour market needs for skilled workers are anticipated and met and will continue to report to the Minister for Education and Skills as well as to me as to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation.

These indicators serve as a measure of the outcomes of investment in the Programme Areas in question and of progress in achieving key Government objectives, such as increasing international competitiveness, driving export-led growth, attracting high value-added and well-paid jobs to Ireland through the IDA, increasing investment in research and development, maintaining a stable industrial relations environment, and making it easier to do business in Ireland.By their nature, the Strategic Impact Indicators referred to by the Deputy are intended to measure outcomes over the medium-to-long term.  In this context, and to address the final parts of the Deputy's question, the following table shows the basis of measurement for each of the Strategic Impact Indicators in question, together with the 2005 outturn, the 2009 outturn and the 2012 target, where appropriate.

Expenditure Review of Science & Technology spending (completed in 2006),2. Expenditure Review of Science Foundation Ireland (completed in 2008), and3. Expenditure Review of the FÁS Competency Development Programme (Completed in July 2010).In addition, two Reviews are planned to commence this year:1. NERA / HSA inspections, and2. Enterprise Stabilisation Fund.In respect of the three Reviews completed during this period, the following is the information in relation to the value of the programme(s) involved and the financial outcomes consequent the respective Review recommendations:(1) Expenditure Review of Science & Technology Spending:
An Expenditure Review of spending on Science & Technology was undertaken in 2004 and the schemes under review accounted for €79.5million activity in 2004.  The Review focussed on the principal Science and Technology measure in place covering Research Technological Development and Innovation in Industry, in particularThe "R & D" Capability Grants Scheme;The Research Technology & Innovation Competitive Grants Scheme;The Enterprise Ireland Collaboration Programme.The Expenditure Review assessed the effectiveness of the Schemes reviewed and made targeted recommendations on the overall usefulness of the agency supports for research and innovation in the business sector and whether they constituted value for money and efficient use of public funds.  The findings made a strong case for the continuation of State support for the agency RTDI Competitive, Collaboration and Capability schemes in a more focussed and co-ordinated format.  The review also contained comprehensive recommendations aimed at enhancing the quality and quantity of research supported by the enterprise agencies.  Many of the recommendations were put into effect by the Strategy for Science Technology and Innovation 2006–2013 and the majority have now been implemented by the relevant agencies, thereby ensuring better value for money(2) Expenditure Review of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI):The Expenditure Review comprehended €681.2million of grant commitments over the period 2001-2006.  The purpose of the review of SFI was to examine its major funding programmes and make targeted comments and recommendations on the overall effectiveness of the agency supports in building a world-class research system in Ireland, with a focus on whether the programmes, as operated, constituted value for money (VfM) and efficient use of public funds.The VfM report made 10 recommendations relating to maintaining the focus of existing SFI operations, which were designed to improve the ongoing implementation and management of the Foundation's programmes and to maximise the future impact and value for money from SFI investments.  Many of the recommendations contained in the Report did not lend themselves to the identification of quantifiable savings.  However, since publication of the Review, significant progress has been made in implementation of the recommendations and in maximising the impact of SFI's investments.(3) VfM Review of the FÁS Competency Development Programme (FÁS CDP)The VfM Review of the FÁS Competency Development Programme (CDP) was completed recently and formally published this week.  This Programme served as the primary mechanism within FÁS for supporting the provision of training / upskilling of people in employment and began in 2003.  The VFM Review examined programme activity relating to 2006, the budget for which was €33.6 million.  The review makes various recommendations on how the CDP could be improved, particularly in relation to monitoring and measurement of outputs.While no new contracts for CDP activity were entered into since early 2009, as resources had been increasingly allocated to training for unemployed persons, it will primarily be a matter for my colleague the Minister for Education and Skills to consider the findings of the review and their implications for future CDP-type activity by FÁS now that supervision of FÁS and of skills training policies generally have been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills as of May this year.

The Minister for Finance presents the Estimates for Public Services each year in conjunction with his annual Budget.  As far as 2011 is concerned, the Minister for Finance has previously indicated that a €3 billion adjustment in public expenditure will be required next year to continue the process of stabilising the public finances.I am currently reviewing all programme areas under my Department's remit to identify any potential expenditure reductions that might contribute to the Minister for Finance's target.  The outcome of this review will be a matter for consideration by the Government and will feed in to the finalisation of the 2011 Estimates.

The information is currently being compiled by my Department in relation to the Department itself and also in relation to the Offices of the Department and I will be in contact with the Deputy again when that exercise has been completed.I will not be in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy in relation to the State Agencies that come under the aegis of my Department as the provision of that information would be a day to day administrative matter for the agencies concerned.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	868	I understand from Enterprise Ireland that the agency does not capture projected employment on each individual project in each individual year of the project's duration.  The agency has informed me that overall its client companies have created over 52,600 jobs since 2006, with 7443 jobs in 2009, 13975 in 2008, 15969 in 2007 and 15234 in 2006.However, Enterprise Ireland has also informed me of details of support for High Potential Start-up companies, 73 of which were supported in 2009.  These companies are expected to create over 900 new jobs over the next three years, bringing total employment in these businesses to almost 1,500.  In 2008, Enterprise Ireland supported the business plans of 71 High Potential Start-up companies.  These companies currently employ 517 people and are expected to create additional jobs in the future.  In 2007, Enterprise Ireland supported 70 High Potential Start-up companies, which currently employ over 570 people.  In 2006 Enterprise Ireland supported 76 new High Potential Start-up companies, which currently employ over 550 people.  In summary, those High Potential Start-up companies established since 2006 currently employ almost 2,240 people, and this figure is expected to increase as these companies grow their businesses and increase their export sales.Enterprise Ireland also provides support to Community Enterprise Centres.  From 1989 to date, the Community Enterprise Centres have been approved funding towards 177 projects, including new buildings or expansions of existing centres.  The schemes have aided the capital investment and management development of 134 centres, of which 105 have been completed.  Of the 105 centres completed, a 2009 survey shows that they house over 900 companies providing employment for over 4,800 people.  A further 760 companies employing approximately 2,900 people have graduated from the Community Enterprise Centres due to company expansion.  The term graduated refers to companies that have grown to a capacity that they do not require the guidance of their local community enterprise centre and are financially strong enough to lease private space.I understand from IDA Ireland that in the time available it has not been possible to provide accurate information on the number of actual agreements signed between the agency and its client companies since the beginning of 2006.

There are two types of payment made from the SIF — rebates to those employers who have paid statutory redundancy to eligible employees, and statutory lump sums to employees whose employers are insolvent and/or in receivership/liquidation.I can advise the Deputy that the latest figures available to end June 2010 indicate that the number of redundancy claims spanning both rebate and lump sum claims awaiting processing stands at 33,713.  Unfortunately, I am unable to provide the Deputy with the specific breakdown requested as regards numbers of redundancy rebate and redundancy lump sum claims awaiting processing for South Tipperary as the Department does not collate statistics for redundancy payment claims on the basis of local authority boundaries.  I am sure the Deputy will appreciate that at this time my focus and that of my Department is on ensuring that redundancy payments are processed as quickly as possible.The Redundancy Payments Section of my Department is currently processing rebate applications submitted from December 2009 and lump sum claims from November 2009, so that the waiting time is approximately 7/8 months.In relation to Redundancy claims, the scale of the challenge is evident from the statistics that show incoming redundancy claims in 2009 amounted to 77,001 which represents a threefold increase over the level of claims lodged in 2007 and earlier years.  In 2007, claims received were of the order of 25,000.Efforts continue to be made by my Department to deliver more acceptable turnaround processing times for Redundancy payments given the difficulties that this gives rise to for both individual employees and the business community.  Measures already taken in the Department in 2009 to alleviate the pressures on the Payments area include: Almost doubling the number of staff through reassignment to a current level of 52 full time equivalents; Prioritisation of the Department's overtime budget towards staff in the Section to tackle the backlog outside normal hours; Establishment of a special call handling facility in NERA to deal with the huge volume of telephone calls from people and businesses concerned about their payments.  Better quality information relating to current processing times on the Department's website; Engagement with the Revenue Commissioners to facilitate the offset of redundancy rebate payments by employers against existing outstanding tax liabilities which those employers owe to the Revenue Commissioners.The backlog and waiting times remain at unacceptable levels.  However, improvements are evident.  I should point out that my Department has, in 2009, processed 50,664 claims, up 70% on 2008.  In the period 1 January 2010 to 30 June 2010 new claims amounted to 33,876 — a fall off of 20% on the corresponding 6 month period in 2009 when 42,323 new claims were lodged.  The reduction in incoming claims is most welcome.  Inroads are being made in the backlog of claims reducing from 42,591 in December 2009 to a level of 33,713 at end June 2010.  In the first six months of 2010, 40,527 claims were processed, up 115% on the same period last year.Responsibility for the payment functions arising under the Redundancy and Insolvency payment schemes is due to be transferred to the Department of Social Protection with effect from 1 January 2011.  In transferring the functions between Departments, it is the intention that this will operate seamlessly and without any adverse impact on the service levels being experienced by individuals or the business community awaiting payment of redundancy claims.

This increased allocation for Capital Works will allow OPW to extend the number of flood relief schemes already underway throughout the country.  Within the overall allocation, I also announced an increase for Minor Flood and Coastal Protection Works to be undertaken by Local Authorities in 2010.  OPW has already allocated €10.6 million to Local Authorities this year under the Programme, and it is still open to Local Authorities to make further submissions, which can be considered, having regard to available resources.Since the November 2009 floods, OPW has undertaken a rigorous collection of data and information, and has already agreed with relevant local authorities measures which can be implemented in the coming months.  This has led to a Feasibility Study to be undertaken in Bandon, Co Cork, and with works at various locations being progressed in County Galway. Further consideration is being given to other areas which may also lead to works being undertaken by OPW, in addition to the major schemes already under construction in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Mallow, Co Cork, Fermoy, Co Cork, Ennis, Co Clare, Mornington, Co Meath and the River Dodder in Dublin, and the schemes at various stages of development, which include Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Templemore, Co. Tipperary, Bray and Arklow, Co. Wicklow.  As indicated in my reply to Deputy on 22 April, 2010, regarding his own constituency, OPW and Kildare County Council agreed a programme of flood relief works in the Johnstown area of County Kildare, and work has now commenced there.The Office of Public Works' strategy for the management of flood risks is based on the recommendations of the 2004 review of flood policy.  Under the European Communities (Assessment and Management of Flood Risks) Regulations, 2010, the OPW has been appointed the national competent authority with lead responsibility for flood risk assessment and management in the State.  OPW has commenced a national programme of Catchment Flood Risk Assessment and Management studies, which will lead to the development of comprehensive Flood Risk Assessment and Management plans for areas of significant flood risk.  At present, the OPW is in the process of procuring consultants to undertake Catchment-based Flood Risk Assessment and Management Studies for all national catchments including the Shannon.The first pilot study on the river Lee was brought to public consultation phase in February 2010.  OPW intend to appoint a consultant in the coming months to bring a scheme forward to public exhibition for the Lower Lee in Cork.  Further pilots on the Rivers Dodder and Suir and in the Fingal East Meath (FEM) area are underway.  The objective is to complete the programme nationally to meet the requirements set out in the EU Floods Directive.

This increased allocation has allowed OPW to continue with and expand its programmes for flood relief activities.  Approximately €16.8m will be spent by the OPW this year in discharging its statutory responsibility for maintaining those river channels that were drained by the Office as part of schemes carried out under Arterial Drainage legislation.  Maintenance of other waterways is the responsibility either of other public bodies, such as Local Authorities or Waterways Ireland, or of landowners adjoining the channels.Major OPW Flood Relief Schemes are already under construction in Clonmel, Co. Tipperary, Mallow, Co. Cork, Fermoy, Co. Cork, Ennis, Co. Clare, Mornington, Co. Meath and the River Dodder in Dublin.  Other schemes are at various stages of development, including Enniscorthy, Co. Wexford, Templemore, Co. Tipperary, Bray and Arklow, Co. Wicklow amongst others.  OPW is also in discussions with Dublin City Council with a view to undertaking its first major coastal flooding scheme in Clontarf.  The OPW has allocated funding totalling €10.6m to Local Authorities for minor flood mitigation measures that they are undertaking in 2010.The OPW is also continuing its Catchment Flood Risk Management Studies Programme, which will produce plans of mitigation measures for areas where there is significant flood risk, including channel works, where appropriate.  OPW has profiled expenditure of approximately €300m for flood risk management up to 2014, with expenditure in excess of €200m being profiled on capital works in this period.  I am confident that this expenditure under the current work programmes being undertaken by the Office of Public Works will significantly reduce the national level of risk to people, businesses, infrastructure and the environment.

Horseracing needs betting; indeed it would be hard to imagine it surviving otherwise.  While horseracing may be only one sport which punters bet on, it is still the main driver of sports betting, particularly for Irish punters, and were horseracing not to exist there would be a massive gap for the betting sector to fill.  I would also cite that one of the biggest sponsors of horse races is the betting sector; the betting sector lobbies for more night-time racing and for racing events to be more evenly spread out and not to clash — this is in order to enhance betting revenue. In addition, whenever events occur that prevent racing being held, such as bouts of bad weather, betting turnover falls substantially.My previous response to the Deputy noted that any extension of betting duty will be applied on a fair basis and should not be perceived as an attempt to threaten jobs.  Furthermore, any tax changes will be in tandem with ongoing work by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform on issues surrounding licensing and regulation.  I am not considering the linking of betting duty receipts to technology education or technology infrastructure.

However, in common with other jurisdictions, the Financial Regulator performed a stress test exercise in the first quarter of 2010 in respect of certain credit institutions covered by the Government guarantee. The results of this exercise were published as the Prudential Capital Assessment Review (PCAR) on 31 March 2010. PCAR set new target capital requirements and required this capital to be in place by the end of 2010.The Capital Requirements Directive, as originally implemented in Ireland by S.I. 660 and 661 of 2006, sets out the minimum capital requirements of all credit institutions authorised in Ireland, including the requirements for credit institutions to maintain minimum capital requirements on a consolidated basis. These have not changed.  I am not aware of the media reports referred to by the Deputy and am not in a position to comment on the claim in relation to special purpose vehicles in the absence of further information.

The Minister for Finance can, if appropriate, waive his interest in property under Section 28 of the Act.The Chief State Solicitor's Office have recently advised the Solicitor for Ailesbury Complex Management Company Limited that the property in Folio DN67464F had not been vested in the State, and accordingly it was not possible for the Minister for Finance to grant a waiver of the property under Section 31 of the State Property Act, 1954.

The Finance Act 2010 provides for an extension of the relief up to the end of 2017 for those whose entitlement to relief was due to end in 2010 or after. Those who took out mortgages in 2003 would have seen their entitlement end after 2009 so, accordingly, this measure does not apply to these individuals.  While circumstances and house prices differ, it is necessary to select a cut-off point in these matters.In addition, the Finance Act 2010 also provides that qualifying loans taken out on or before 31 December 2011 will continue to get relief at current levels.  Qualifying loans taken out in 2012 will receive the relief at a reduced rate of 15% for first-time buyers and 10% for non-first time buyers with ceilings of €6,000 per annum for married couples and €3,000 per annum for single individuals applying in both cases.  Loans taken out on or after 1 January 2013 will not qualify for mortgage interest relief and the relief will be abolished completely for the tax year 2018 and subsequent tax years.I would accept that many people are suffering financially in the current climate.  However, as the Deputy will be aware there are already a number of supports in place, such as the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears (CCMA), the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice and Budgeting Service. I have spoken about these extensively in this House over the past number of months.  In February this year, the moratorium on mortgage arrears was extended from 6 months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders.The Deputy will also be aware that, at the end of February, I announced the establishment of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney, an insolvency accountant, as a follow up to the Government's commitments towards Protecting the Family Home under the Renewed Programme for Government. The Expert Group has completed the first phase of its work and submitted an Interim Report to me last week. The Deputy will be aware that all of the recommendations contained in this report were agreed by Government on Tuesday 6 July 2010. I believe that these recommendations, when implemented, should result in (a)  improved communication; (b) a more consistent assessment process by lenders of options for borrowers in difficulty through the use of a Standard Financial Statement; and (c) the introduction of an industry-wide Mortgage Arrears Resolution Process (MARP) including a range of forbearance measures.  All of these will be of real help to those in difficulty.While the recommendations set out in this report are designed to address the more straightforward issues uncovered by the Expert Group during its data gathering phase, I understand that in the next phase of its work the Expert Group will be focusing on the more complex issues in the area of mortgage arrears and personal debt. I expect to receive their final report by the end of September.

The intention of the funding was to enable the public sector to manage the Public Private Partnership (PPP) process and the projects coming on-stream, to drive the process, and ensure that all the relevant players are effectively engaged, in a way that ensures the objectives of the PPP approach, including value for money and early delivery of the projects, are achieved.

The programmes are jointly funded by the EU, Ireland and Northern Ireland and operate within the terms of the relevant EU legislation.   Since 2004, a number of organisations involved in social partnership have received support under these programmes. The SEUPB has indicated that the following letters of offer have been made to bodies that are involved in social partnership in the south. Given the variety and diversity of projects funded by the SEUPB, it may be that other letters of offer to bodies that can be considered social partners have been made.

These recommendations address the more straight forward issues which were uncovered by the Expert Group during the first phase of its review. The key recommendations to be underpinned by amendments to the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears include improvements to communication between lender and borrower, and the standardisation of the assessment process by all lenders when their mortgage customers show signs of being in difficulty with their repayments. The Interim Report also includes recommendations supporting significant reforms of the Mortgage Interest Supplement Scheme which were also approved by Cabinet last Tuesday.The Expert Group is now commencing the next phase of its work and will be focusing on the more complex issues in the area of mortgage arrears and personal debt. I expect that the Expert Group will be in a position to complete its analysis and conclude its report to me by the end of September.

This followed QIL's decision to consent to the appointment made by the High Court on application made by the Financial Regulator (FR). The joint administrators have legal responsibility for putting the company on a sound commercial and financial footing. In this regard they are accountable to the High Court.One of the major concerns of the administrators has been to try and ensure that the value of the business is maintained in order to make it as attractive as possible to potential buyers. Several steps have been taken to date, including getting approval from the FR for reopening the profitable parts of the UK business i.e. the private motor insurance business. This was done in two stages (i) motor insurance cover for provisional driver license holders in the United Kingdom (including Northern Ireland) with effect from 21 April, and (ii) remainder of the private motor insurance business re-opened with effect from 30 April. In addition, proposals for re-opening of certain commercial lines of business in the UK were submitted to the FR and are currently being examined.  Furthermore, a major cost cutting programme was put in place by the joint administrators, including a voluntary redundancy programme.On 3 June the High Court granted the joint administrators of QIL permission to appoint merchant bankers Macquarie Capital Europe Ltd to advise on any prospective sale of QIL. In this regard an information memorandum is currently being prepared and will be circulated shortly to all companies interested in buying QIL.   The joint administrators are due before the High Court again on 29 July.

The following Terms of Reference have been set out:1. To consider the potential for asset disposals in the public sector, including commercial state bodies, to reduce the substantial and growing indebtedness of the State;2. To draw up a list of possible asset disposals;3. To assess how the use and disposition of such assets can best help restore growth and contribute to national investment priorities; and4. To review where appropriate, relevant investment and financing plans, commercial practices and regulatory requirements affecting the use of such assets in the national interest.The Group has been asked to report back to the Minister for Finance by end-year.

These supports include the Code of Conduct on Mortgage Arrears, the Mortgage Interest Subsidy Scheme and the services provided by the Money Advice Budgeting Services.  In addition at my request the Financial Regulator after consideration extended the moratorium on mortgage arrears from 6 months to 12 months for all mortgage lenders which came into effect 17 February 2010.The Deputy will be aware that in my Budget speech in December the Government refocused mortgage interest relief on those who bought their homes at the peak of the market, many of whom find themselves in negative equity.  Where a homeowner's entitlement to mortgage interest relief would expire in 2010 or after, they will now continue to receive it up to the end of 2017.The Deputy will also be aware that at the end of February, I announced the establishment of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group, under the chairmanship of Mr. Hugh Cooney an insolvency accountant, as a follow up to the Government's commitments towards Protecting the Family Home under the Renewed Programme for Government.

I expect to receive their final report by the end of September.  I am confident that the lenders will play their part in implementing the recommendations. The Irish Banking Federation (IBF) have stated that the banking sector are fully committed to working with Government and the relevant agencies to ensure that both mortgage and personal debt are dealt with in a sensible and fair way.I note from the latest statistics available from the Financial Regulator that while the number of mortgages in arrears had increased over the previous quarter there was a decrease in the number of arrears cases where court proceedings had been issued seeking repossession.  I am confident that the recent measures taken by the Government along with the ongoing work of the Mortgage Arrears and Personal Debt Expert Group and the existing supports I referred to, will assist those who are in difficulty with mortgage arrears as a result of unemployment and the economic downturn.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	900	Retirement lump sums for civil servants are calculated on the basis of 3/80ths of salary per year of service, subject to a maximum of 1½ times the salary on which superannuation benefits are based. Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement (PSA), pay reductions which took effect in January 2010 are currently disregarded for the purposes of calculating superannuation benefits. Accordingly, the salary on which benefits are based may currently exceed the actual salary payable at the time of retirement.  A Secretary General who reaches the end of his or her contract before age 60 may be allowed the option of early retirement with immediate payment of pension and enhanced terms. These consist of an award of up to 10 added years, subject to certain conditions, and a special severance gratuity of six months salary on the terms specified in sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963. These terms are subject to the application of special abatement provisions if the Secretary General concerned subsequently obtains employment in the public sector.Since 1 July 2005, 3 Secretaries General, 1 Second Secretary General and 4 Assistant Secretaries retired from my Department. A total of €2,092,755 was paid in lump sums and €386,478 was paid in special severance gratuities.  In one case, the person retired under the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement and his lump sum represented 10% of the salary on which the superannuation benefits were based. Under that scheme the balance of lump sum is payable when the officer reaches the age at which preserved benefits would normally be payable. In the remaining cases, retirement lump sums ranged from 137% to 150% of the salary on which superannuation benefits are based. This includes one retirement to which the PSA arrangements referred to above apply.

This tax credit is part of a scheme designed to address the issues covered by the Supreme Court judgment of 2008 that found against the risk equalisation scheme for the provision of private health insurance.The scheme is two-fold, an age-related tax credit to compensate for the higher cost of insurance for older persons, which is funded by a levy on health insurance companies based on the number of people covered by policies underwritten by them. This scheme is a temporary measure for three years from 1 January 2009 to 31 December 2011. It is intended that it will be revenue-neutral over its duration.  Part of the cost of contributions to permanent health benefit schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April, 2001.

The amounts of gross income from all sources returned by medical practitioners were €1,091 million for 2005, €1,218 million for 2006 and €1,341m for 2007.  The amounts of gross income from all sources returned by dental practitioners were €253 million for 2005, €284 million for 2006 and  €320m for 2007.  The sector identifier used on the tax records is based on the 4 digit "NACE code (Rev. 1)" which is an internationally recognised economic activity code system. The NACE codes are not essential for the assessment and collection of taxes and duties and the correct allocation and maintenance of these codes is subject to the limit of available resources. NACE code classifications on tax records are compiled by reference to the primary area of economic activity reported by individual and corporate taxpayers on their own behalf and the taxes collected are allocated to those codes without reference to the precise economic activity which generated them.While the accuracy of the NACE codes on tax records is sufficient to underpin broad sector-based analyses there will undoubtedly be some inaccuracies at individual level. This should be borne in mind when considering the information provided. The sectors identified for this reply represent the closest equivalents in the NACE code system to the sectors mentioned in the question.

The mental health capital programme will provide a range of facilities across the entire spectrum of mental health care facilities including acute psychiatric units, child and adolescent units, day hospitals, community nursing units and high support hostels. In 2010, the HSE will proceed to dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €50m in the mental health capital programme. Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year's programme of asset sales.

Funding under both schemes is calculated by reference to information supplied to the Childcare Directorate of my Office regarding the parents and children accessing both schemes, and covers the period 1 January 2010 to 31 August 2010.  This service completed a return of such information to the Childcare Directorate earlier this year.  As there are no outstanding issues in regard to the information provided in respect of the ECCE scheme, I understand that a final payment under that scheme was made to the service on 15 June 2010. However, the information supplied by the service in respect of the CCSS was incomplete and, pending receipt of further details from the service, it is not possible to issue a final payment to the service. The service has been contacted by the Childcare Directorate and requested to furnish the information required.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	912	The Adoption Bill, 2009, has completed its passage through both Houses of the Oireachtas and will be enacted shortly. It is my intention to lodge the papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention following enactment of the Bill. The Convention comes into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after the deposit of the instrument in accordance with Article 46(2)(a).The Government decided to suspend indefinitely negotiations on a new bilateral intercountry adoption agreement with the Socialist Republic of Vietnam. This will have the effect of suspending intercountry adoption from Vietnam until such time as the Adoption Bill 2009 has been enacted and Ireland and Vietnam have both ratified the provisions of the Hague Convention. This decision was taken in response to the serious findings and recommendations contained in the report on intercountry adoption commissioned by UNICEF and the Vietnamese Ministry of Justice and carried out by International Social Services (ISS).  An earlier report published last August by the Vietnamese Ministry of Labour, Invalids and Social Affairs (MOLISA) was also considered in making the decision.It is my understanding that the Vietnamese National Assembly has recently passed legislation which should allow for a move to ratification of the Hague Convention. In the event that both Ireland and Vietnam ratify the Convention there is every reason to expect that adoptions from Vietnam could re-commence subject to the provisions of the Convention being met in this regard. At the time of ratification Ireland and Vietnam will each designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Hague Convention. Administrative arrangements will be a matter for the Adoption Authority, as Ireland's designated Central Authority, to make with the designated Vietnamese Central Authority. As both countries will have ratified the Hague Convention there will be no need for a formal bilateral agreement with regard to inter-country adoption. My Department does not have information on the number of prospective adoptive parents interested in adopting from Vietnam.

The Health Service Executive (HSE) has introduced measures to contain DTSS expenditure at the 2008 level of approximately €63 million. There are no plans to reverse these changes.Under the new measures the range of treatments available are being prioritised. These measures have been introduced to protect access to emergency dental care for medical card holders and to safeguard services for children and special needs groups. Services for high-risk patients and those requiring exceptional care continue to be available. The remaining care provision is subject to prior approval, which will be required from a clinician in the HSE, who will prioritise for:High risk and exceptional patients,Those requiring emergency care, andPatients who are considered to have greater clinical urgency and/or necessity in receiving care.Where prior approval is required for the treatment, the HSE Principal Dental Surgeons will apply their professional judgment to determine, in the circumstances, whether or not there is a clinical emergency, and whether or not treatment should therefore be approved.I have given no direction to the HSE concerning what constitutes a clinical emergency. In the DTSS an emergency is determined by the treating clinician, the contracted General Dental Practitioner, in agreement with the local HSE Principal Dental Surgeon, or a delegate who is also a clinician. Where a patient requires dental treatment in advance of urgent medical treatment, this must be communicated to the HSE Principal Dental Surgeon. The manner in which this approval is sought has not changed and is a matter for those involved in the process.The staff of the Primary Care Reimbursement Service of the HSE are aware of the changes and are implementing them. The HSE will continue to engage with dental professionals to ensure clarity and consistency in implementing these changes. The HSE will also monitor the ongoing effect of these changes from a clinical and budgetary perspective. The dental and oral health services currently provided through the HSE Public Dental Service will not be affected by these changes to the DTSS.

It is intended that charges will be implemented from 1 September 2010, providing a yield of approximately €8m in the current year. The full year yield is expected to be approximately €24 million. My Department is presently working closely with the Health Service Executive on the detail of implementing the charges.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	920	I propose to take Questions Nos. 127, 128, 225 and 299, together.The Government has decided to introduce a system of reference pricing combined with generic substitution of medicines. This will promote price competition and deliver ongoing savings for both the State and for patients. Last month, I launched a report, prepared by a joint working group made up of officials and health care professionals from my Department and the HSE, which sets out a proposed model for the operation of generic substitution and reference pricing in Ireland. I expect to see significant progress on the implementation of this initiative, including the identification of legislative and administrative changes required to give it effect in 2011. My Department is currently preparing Draft Heads of a Bill for consideration by the Government. Once prepared, the Draft Heads will be submitted to Government for approval in the normal way.Reference pricing will deliver direct savings by limiting reimbursement to a common reference price for groups of interchangeable medicines. Indirect savings will also occur as a result of increased price competition. The level of savings will depend upon a range of factors. These include the number and type of products included in reference groups, the relative and absolute prices of products within reference groups and the market response for each reference group. It is anticipated that reference pricing will be initially targeted at high volume products that have the potential to achieve significant savings. It is also of strategic importance that this model is in place as a significant number of drugs are due to come off patent in the coming years. There is no available estimate of potential savings from generic substitution between 2005 to 2009 as requested by the Deputy.

My Department continues to promote the rational use of antibiotics and also their non-use in cases of viral infection.  The Guidelines for Antimicrobial Stewardship in Hospitals in Ireland aim to promote the sensible prescribing of antibiotics.  Data on antibiotic consumption collected by the Health Protection Surveillance Centre (HPSC), shows a welcome decrease in antibiotic consumption in hospitals in 2008 for the first time since 2000.  Data for 2009 shows a further drop in consumption over the 2008 rates.  Ireland participated in the first two European Antibiotic Awareness Days in 2008 and 2009; an education programme for healthcare staff and the general public launched the 2008 programme and the 2009 campaign built on that platform.

Phase 1 of the NPRO involves the development of new radiation oncology facilities with 4 linear accelerators on the sites of both St James's and Beaumont Hospitals.  The facilities will be under the governance of the National Cancer Control Programme (NCCP), rather than the respective host hospitals, as radiation oncology is an integral part of cancer care. It is clear from the Hollywood Report on the Development of Radiation Oncology Services in Ireland that best outcomes are achieved by closely co-ordinating radiation, surgical and medical oncology and palliative care services.  A sum of €4million in revenue costs and 54 WTEs have been assigned by the NCCP towards the running and staffing of the new centres in 2010.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	935	The Renewed Programme for Government re-affirms the Government's commitment to the current co-location programme.  Preferred bidders have been selected for the Beaumont, Cork University, Limerick Regional, St. James's, Sligo and Waterford Regional Hospital projects.  The total number of beds proposed in these six facilities, exclusive of critical care capacity, is in excess of 1,200. Project agreements have been signed and planning permission granted in respect of the first four of these developments.  Two other projects are at earlier stages of the procurement process.The co-location programme is a complex public procurement process.  It is a matter for each successful bidder to arrange its finance under the terms of the relevant Project Agreement.  The co-location initiative, like other major projects, has to deal with the changed funding environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with the successful bidders to provide whatever assistance it can to help them advance the projects.  There is a requirement on each of the successful bidders to pay a non-refundable deposit of €350,000 to the HSE on the signing of the project agreement.  The intention of this requirement is to allow the HSE to recoup the expenses that it has incurred in this context.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	937	As I explained in a previous reply to the Deputy, pharmaceutical companies must apply to the Health Service Executive (HSE), for their product(s) to be reimbursed under the General Medical Services (GMS) Scheme and the community drugs schemes.  Neither the HSE or my Department has a role in the decision by a company as to whether it makes such an application to the HSE.  In order for a medicinal product to be considered by the HSE for reimbursement it must meet specified criteria. These include the following:The product must be an ‘allopathic' medicinal product authorised by the Irish Medicines Board or the European Commission.The product must be such that it is ordinarily supplied to the public only on foot of a medical prescription.The product should not be advertised or promoted to the public.The medicine mentioned by the Deputy is not a licensed product and therefore is not eligible for reimbursement under the GMS or community drugs schemes.  Neither the HSE or my Department has a role in whether a company applies to the Irish Medicines Board to obtain such a licence.The HSE operates a protocol under which exempt medicinal products (unlicensed medicines), which satisfy specific criteria, are made available to patients.  A key part of the protocol is that the medicinal product concerned should be such that no authorised medicinal product of essential similarity is available for prescription or supply under the GMS or community drugs schemes. An alternative to the medicine mentioned by the Deputy is licensed in Ireland and is reimbursable under the GMS and community drugs schemes.

As stated to the Deputy in my previous reply, I understand that the HSE is currently reviewing its decision from earlier this year to reduce the service's funding in 2010.  I understand that the HSE is in contact with the service and that it will be advised of the outcome of this review in due course.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	958	I propose to take Questions Nos. 173 to 176, inclusive, together.I have asked the Institute of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists to prepare a report for me concerning the practice of symphysiotomy in Ireland. I have asked that the report would:provide the Institute's assessment of the circumstances in which symphysiotomy was carried out in Irish obstetric units;indicate what protocols or guidance existed over the years to guide professional practice; andspecify when the practice changed and why it changed at that time in Ireland.The Institute have given my  request detailed consideration with a view to addressing this issue comprehensively by using all the necessary independent expertise to take account of the concerns of those involved and in particular the women who have undergone this procedure.  I understand that the Institute are finalising a team who will be responsible for preparing this report and this will be made public when finalised.  Whilst the Institute have given no firm date for the completion of the report I am advised the report will take a number of months to finalise.I am also committed to ensuring that the greatest possible support and services are made available to women who continue to suffer effects of having undergone this procedure.  The women concerned continue to receive attention and care through a number of services which have been put in place including:the provision of medical cards to all Survivors of Symphysiotomy (SOS) patients who requested them,the nomination, since 2003, of a Liaison Officer for a patients' group comprised of women who underwent a symphysiotomy procedure,the availability of independent clinical advice for former patients by Liaison Officers who assist in co-ordinating the provision of services to those patients,the organisation of individual pathways of care and the arrangement of appropriate follow-up, including Medical Assessment, Gynaecology Assessment, Orthopaedic Assessment, Counselling, Physiotherapy, Reflexology, Home Help, Acupuncture, Osteopathy and fast tracked hospital appointments,the refund of medical expenses related to symphysiotomy in respect of medication/private treatments,the establishment of a triple assessment service for patients at Cappagh Hospital, Dublin in January 2005, anda Support Group facilitated by a counsellor which was set up in 2004 in Dundalk and Drogheda for women living in North East region.I have been assured by the HSE that it will continue to monitor and oversee the provision of necessary support services for women.  In doing so the HSE is committed to being proactive in seeking out and offering help to women who had symphysiotomies and who may wish to avail of the services offered by the HSE.

It is my intention to lodge the papers for the ratification of the Hague Convention following enactment of the Bill.  The Convention comes into force on the first day of the month following the expiration of three months after the deposit of the instrument in accordance with Article 46(2)(a).It is my understanding that the Vietnamese National Assembly has recently passed legislation which should allow for a move to ratification of the Hague Convention. In the event that both Ireland and Vietnam ratify the Convention there is every reason to expect that adoptions from Vietnam could re-commence subject to the provisions of the Convention being met in this regard.At the time of ratification Ireland and Vietnam will each designate a Central Authority to discharge the duties which are imposed by the Hague Convention. Administrative arrangements will be a matter for the Adoption Authority, as Ireland's designated Central Authority, to make with the designated Vietnamese Central Authority.  As both countries will have ratified the Hague Convention there will be no need for a formal bi-lateral agreement with regard to inter-country adoption.

Firstly, I wish to extend my sympathies to this lady's family.  I agree that the management of this case was unacceptable.  The Hospital, Galway University Hospital (GUH) has apologised for the distress that was caused to the patient and her family.GUH is a designated cancer centre and work continues to ensure that adequate capacity is available to manage patients who are referred to the hospital by other consultants for treatment.  A new oncology assessment unit will open in the near future in GUH. This will provide direct access for cancer patients and so will provide appropriate, timely treatment for cancer patients who are referred by other consultants to the hospital.  The Clinical Director is also drawing up a Memorandum of Understanding with private hospitals to ensure that the transfer of patients from those facilities to GUH  is dealt with in an appropriate manner, similar to the arrangements in place when patients transfer from one public hospital to another.

The HSE has advised my Department that they do not fund speech therapist posts in individual schools but rather provide speech and language therapy by way of regional service provision.I understand that my colleague, Mary Harney TD,  Minister for Health and Children recently invited Claddagh National School in Galway to apply for consideration of National Lottery funding for a speech and language post as part of  unique pilot project, in view of the particular circumstances in that school and the very strong potential for innovative approaches.  It is not proposed however, that Lottery funding would be utilised to fund such posts on a  more generalised basis.

In all areas, Disability Managers are working closely with agencies to ensure that those with the most urgent need for respite services are prioritised.I am fully aware of the challenges which the reduction in allocations will present to organisations in ensuring they meet the needs of service users and in planning for emergencies that arise throughout the year.  I also recognise that maintaining service levels within available resources will require significant levels of co-operation, change, flexibility and creativity, but I firmly believe that it can be done.I have met with the HSE Assistant National Director responsible for disability services on a number of occasions in recent weeks to discuss the emerging challenges in the voluntary intellectual disability sector.  I have asked the HSE to confirm that the reduction in financial allocations to the voluntary agencies in the disability sector has been applied consistently across all HSE regions and in line with the reductions applied elsewhere in the health services.  Furthermore, I have requested that the HSE validate, as a matter of urgency, the methodology used by it to calculate the reductions in allocations for the various agencies.  I have also noted that a majority of service providers are continuing to provide respite services, despite the reductions in their allocations.I wish to advise the House that Minister Harney and I met with the Brothers of Charity Services yesterday, together with senior officials from the HSE and the Department of Health and Children, to discuss the importance of maintaining frontline services for people with disabilities. The outcome of that meeting was a clear undertaking on all sides to work in partnership so that frontline services such as respite care can be maintained.With regard to the specific services mentioned by the Deputy, the overall budget for the Brothers of Charity services in the Limerick area is €25 million.  The Brothers have indicated that the respite service can be largely restored for €150,000 in the current year.  The Brothers of Charity indicated yesterday that they would work with the HSE to ensure this happens.

Any such product is considered to be an unauthorised medicinal product and, accordingly, the IMB has been taking action to have these products removed from the market.Additionally, the substances Fluorotropacocaine, which is contained in the product WHACK, and Dimethocaine, which is contained in the product AMPLIFIED, are considered to be medicinal products and as such they are enforced by the Irish Medicines Board. These substances are not listed in the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Regulations 2010 (S.I. No. 200 of 2010).The Irish Medicines Board has visited 30 Head Shops in relation to these products. Of these, one outlet was found to have the product WHACK and another was found to have the product AMPLIFIED.  Six outlets had products that were found or suspected to contain substances with anaesthetic effect. The products concerned include RAZ, Snowblow, Pure NRG, Ivory Wave, Sextacy and White Ice and are suspected to contain the active pharmaceutical substance, Lidocaine (also known as Lignocaine). 15 of the outlets have also been found to be supplying other medicinal products for abuse purposes. These mainly involved substances that are contained in prescription-only medicinal products for erectile dysfunction. These are unauthorised products.Under the Irish Medicines Board Act 1995, as amended, the sanctions available to the IMB are:A person who contravenes a regulation under section 32 of the Act shall be guilty of an offence and shall be liable(a) on summary conviction, to a fine not exceeding €2,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding one year or a combination of both,(b) on conviction on indictment(i) in the case of a first offence, to a fine not exceeding €120,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or a combination of both,(ii) in the case of any subsequent offence, to a fine not exceeding €300,000 or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 10 years or a combination of both.The Irish Medicines Board is currently finalising its investigations in these cases and will make a decision on further action. The Irish Medicines Board has initiated prosecutions against four companies and one individual.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	988	Although patients may be treated in public hospitals on a private basis, the core purpose of the public hospital system is to provide services for all patients under the statutory eligibility provisions.  All persons ordinarily resident in Ireland have full eligibility for hospital services, meaning that there is universal access to public hospital care. The fact that a person may have private health insurance does not take away from his/her eligibility for services as a public patient. Care is needed to ensure that a perceived need to generate income does not operate to the detriment of service provision to public patients. The primary objective must be to avoid an excessive ratio of private practice within public hospitals and, subject to that being achieved, to recover whatever income is due in respect of that level of private practice.The consultant contract 2008 includes new rules on the extent of private practice permitted and new measures to ensure these rules are complied with.  These contractual features complement existing bed designation rules as part of the overall framework to control the level of private activity in publicly funded hospitals. Under the Health (In-Patient) Regulations 1991, beds in public hospitals are categorised as public, private or non-designated. Under these regulations no private patient may be accommodated in a designated public bed, except in certain emergency cases. The regulations contain reciprocal provisions regarding the accommodation of public patients in beds designated as private.The national average number of acute hospital beds available in public hospitals in 2007, the latest year for which validated data has been compiled by the HSE was 13,688. The HSE data indicates that 10,279 were categorised as public, 2,471 were categorised as private and the remainder as non-designated.  My Department has requested the HSE to provide corresponding information in respect of 2008 and 2009 to the Deputy as soon as validated data is available.The HSE Performance Reports indicate that the percentage mix of activity in acute hospitals in 2007 was 75.1% public to 24.9% private and in 2008 was 74.1% public to 25.9% private. The corresponding figure for 2009, the latest year for which data is currently available, stood at 75.5% public to 24.5% private. The public/private acute hospital activity ratio target in the National Service Plan for 2010 is 80:20. The HSE is working to ensure that this target is achieved and the terms of the consultant contract are complied with at individual consultant level.

Every effort is made to avoid such occurrences.  It is important to note that the deferral of a person's admission to hospital may occur for a range of reasons, for example because of  hospital capacity issues, where a patient may not be deemed fit for surgery on a given day or where  for personal reasons a patient wishes to postpone having a procedure.  Unless there are clear clinical grounds for a period of postponement, arrangements are made for a new admission date to be assigned.Unfortunately, cancellations are a feature of hospital systems, in Ireland and internationally, because priority must be given to emergency cases and patients in urgent need. While data is not comprehensive, the experience in the Irish public system appears to be broadly in line with that in other hospital systems.  In 2009, for example, it is estimated that cancellations equated to about 1.4% of all inpatient and day case activity.As the detailed information requested is a matter for the HSE, the Deputy's query has been referred to the Executive for direct reply.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	995	Given the current fiscal position, I am strongly of the view that enhancing efficiency and value for money without impacting on service levels must be a key priority.  This is a message that I have consistently communicated to the HSE and other health agencies.  The following value for money adjustments were made in the HSE in the years 2007 to 2010.YearVFM Savings€m200763200828020091152010106The HSE National Service Plan 2010 commits to maintaining the value for money derived from previous years' base budgets and continuing to drive further value and efficiency through best practice benchmarking.  The Government made a series of decisions that will reduce HSE costs this year by some €1bn, made up of pay savings of €630m and non-pay savings of €394m.  The latter includes the target of €106m in non-pay economies to be saved by the HSE in 2010.  Achievement against this target is reported on in the monthly Performance Reports against the Service Plan.  In addition, other health agencies are subject to efficiency savings relative to their Budget for 2010.My Department is also currently undertaking two Value for Money and Policy Reviews in the areas of Disability Services and the Economic Cost of Private Treatment in Public Hospitals under the Government's Value for Money and Policy Review Initiative 2009-2011, which will further help to drive efficiencies and effectiveness.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	999	I propose to take Questions Nos. 221 and 222 together.In 2009 I made a number of regulations under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to reduce the fees and allowances payable to certain health professionals. These comprise general practitioners, pharmacists, dentists, ophthalmologists, optometrists and dispensing opticians who hold contracts with the HSE, persons providing smear taking services as part of the National Cervical Screening Programme and consultant psychiatrists who participate in the Mental Health Tribunal process.In the case of pharmacists, there was a reduction in the wholesale mark-up from 17.66% to 10% and a reduction in the retail mark-up from 50% to 20% paid on medicines supplied under the GMS and community drugs schemes. Full details of the revised payments are provided in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Community Pharmacy Contractors) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 246 of 2009). The revised payments to community pharmacy contractors came into effect on the 1 July 2009. It is estimated that savings in the region of €60 million were achieved from the reductions in payments to community pharmacy contractors during 2009; full year savings are estimated at €120 million.Payments to registered dentists under the Dental Treatment Services Scheme were reduced with effect from 1 May 2009. The reductions in these fees resulted in estimated savings of €1.7 million in 2009. The full year saving is estimated at €2.1m.  Full details of the revised payments are provided in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Registered Dentists) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 171 of 2009).Fees and allowances paid to general practitioners in respect of medical card and GP visit card holders, the Mother and Infant Care Scheme and the Primary Childhood Immunisation Scheme were reduced with effect from 7 July 2009. Full details of the revised payments are provided in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to General Practitioners) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 262 of 2009). It is estimated that savings in the region of €16 million were achieved during 2009; full year savings are estimated at €34m.The fees payable to clinicians and certain clinics as smear-takers under CervicalCheck, the national cervical screening programme, were reduced by 8%, with effect from 1st May 2009.  It is estimated that the reduction in fees has resulted in savings of €630,000 in 2009 and €1.4m in a full year. Full details of the changes in payments are available in the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments in respect of services under the National Cervical Screening Programme) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 173/2009).Under the terms of the Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Ophthalmologists, Optometrists and Dispensing Opticians) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 195/2009) the professional fees payable to opthalmologists, optometrists and dispensing opticians, in respect of services provided under the HSE Optometric Schemes, were reduced by 8% with effect from 18th May 2009.   This reduction resulted in a saving of around €440,000 in 2009 and an estimated annual saving of €1.320 million.The Health Professionals (Reduction of Payments to Consultant Psychiatrists) Regulations 2009 (S.I. No. 172/2009) provided for an 8% reduction in the fees paid to consultant psychiatrists for mental health tribunal work with effect from 1st May 2009.  The estimated saving in 2009 was €185,000 and the estimated full-year savings from this measure is €278,000.  Approximately 2700 general practitioners, 1,640 community pharmacy contractors, 1,630 dentists and 530 optometrists hold contracts with the HSE.  In addition, there are 2,069 contracted smear-takers.  Approximately 75 consultant psychiatrists participate in the Mental Health Tribunal process.As required by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009, I have reviewed the operation, effectiveness and impact of the revised fees and allowances. Following these reviews, I have decided to make no change in the fees payable to pharmacists and to examine the scope for further reductions in the fees payable to general practitioners, dentists and optometrists who hold contracts with the HSE, smear-takers contracted under the CervicalCheck programme and consultant psychiatrists who hold contracts with the Mental Health Commission. I have invited interested parties to provide written submissions to assist in my deliberations on these matters.

Their Service Plan for 2010 has, as a key result area, the reconfiguration of emergency services to ensure that they serve an appropriate population catchment, and are resourced to provide comprehensive emergency services and care for other urgent needs and minor injuries. Plans to meet that objective continue to be developed by the HSE.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1001	The project continues to be a priority for the Government and the HSE.Following work with the HSE's senior management, St. Vincent's Hospital and the Department of Finance, I announced in 2009 that the project would proceed to construction on the basis that the building will be paid for at the end of the construction phase.The site at the hospital is cleared and ready for construction to commence and the HSE's capital funding remains ring-fenced for the new development.In the normal course payments for construction of a project such as this would have been phased over the construction period.   However under the financing method being utilised for this project, the construction company will source bridging finance for the project until the construction is complete.Following receipt of tenders for construction, the procurement process  has been particularly difficult and protracted in this case, due to prevailing conditions in the Irish construction industry.  The Hospital has now issued a "letter of intent" to a preferred bidder in the tender process for the building of the new ward block.It is hoped to award the contract in the next few weeks after which construction of the new facility will take about 18 months. The process is under continuous review in order to ensure earliest possible delivery of the new ward block.  St Vincent's University Hospital and the HSE remain committed to this project, and are taking every possible step to expedite contract award and earliest commencement of construction on site.As the contract has not yet been awarded it is inappropriate to provide any further information on the specific points raised by the Deputy in the question.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1007	A wide range of measures have been implemented to reduce the cost of supplying medicines to patients under the GMS and community drugs schemes. These include off-patent price reductions, an increase in the rebate paid by manufacturers, the introduction of lower wholesale and retail mark-ups and price reviews of medicines accepted for reimbursement since September 2006.As provided for under the current agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers, price reductions of 35% are applied on a phased basis for all patent expired proprietary medicines with an available generic equivalent. The National Centre for Pharmacoeconomics estimated that savings of €175 million would be achieved between January 2009 and August 2010 as a result of these price cuts.In February this year further price reductions of 40% were agreed for a large number of medicines supplied by Irish Pharmaceutical Healthcare Association member companies.  In addition, the rebate paid to the HSE in respect of drugs supplied under the GMS scheme has been extended to include all community drugs schemes and increased from 3.53% to 4%. The combination of these measures plus consequent savings in wholesale and retail mark-ups are expected to result in savings of approximately €94m in a full year.In 2009 I made a number of regulations under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act 2009 to reduce the fees and allowances payable to health professionals. In the case of pharmacists, this included reductions in the wholesale and retail mark-ups paid on medicines supplied under the GMS and community drugs schemes. It is expected that savings in the region of €120 million will be achieved in 2010 from the reductions in payments to pharmacy contractors.The current agreements between the HSE and pharmaceutical manufacturers also provide for a price review in September 2010 of all products accepted for reimbursement between September 2006 and September 2009. The prices of these products will be realigned to the currency-adjusted average price in the nine reference countries. Discussions are also underway with manufacturers of generic medicines and lower prices for generics are expected to be introduced in September this year.

#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1018	I published the Report of the Independent Monitoring Group for A Vision for Change on 1 July 2010.  The Report acknowledges progress in relation to the development of child and adolescent services, the appointment of an Assistant National Director for Mental Health and Executive Clinical Directors, and the gradual movement towards the creation of catchment areas as outlined in A Vision for Change.  However overall the Monitoring Group was disappointed with the progress achieved since the launch of A Vision for Changeover four years ago.I acknowledge that progress on implementation in some areas is too slow; however in many parts of the country services are pressing ahead with the implementation of A Vision for Change.  A significant amount of preparatory work and planning has taken place which will show tangible progress in 2010 and 2011.  In addition, the provision in Budget 2010 for a multi-annual programme of capital investment in high priority mental health projects, which will be funded from the proceeds of the disposal of psychiatric assets, will allow progress to be made in relation to the closure of the old mental institutions.  In 2010 the HSE will proceed to dispose of surplus assets and reinvest an initial sum of €50m in the mental health capital programme.  Provision for continued funding of the programme will be made in the 2011 Estimates and subsequent years, in the light of the previous year’s programme of asset sales.Major initiatives for 2010 include: the completion of two 20-bed child and adolescent in-patient units in Cork and Galway; the development of a new acute psychiatric unit in Donegal — construction has commenced; the development of a child and adolescent mental health facility in Cherry Orchard, Dublin — construction has commenced; the development of a Community Nursing Unit in Mullingar — construction has commenced; the development of a Community Nursing Unit in  Clonmel — construction will commence shortly; the development of a new acute unit at Beaumont Hospital to replace the acute unit in St Ita's Hospital, Portrane — construction will commence shortly; acute admissions to St Brendan's Hospital, Grangegorman will transfer to Connolly Memorial Hospital, Blanchardstown.

I have, therefore, referred the Deputy's question to the Executive for direct reply.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1025	The Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 (FEMPI), provides for the application of a reduction in remuneration for all public servants.  For the purposes of the Act, a public servant includes a person who is employed by, or who holds any office or other position in a public service body.  The Health Service Executive and bodies funded under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 are public service bodies, as defined in the FEMPI legislation.Grant aided agencies (funded under Section 39 of the Health Act 2004) are not directly affected by the pay adjustments provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 2) Act 2009 because Section 39 agencies are not public service bodies as defined in that Act and their employees are not public servants. However, as the Deputy knows, the Government has decided to reduce its payroll costs in various ways — principally by reducing the salaries paid to public servants and reducing the numbers employed. It has also decided to seek further reductions in the fees paid for certain professional services under the provisions of the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest (No. 1) Act 2009.  These and other measures agreed in Budget 2010 are deliberately designed to protect the existing levels of public services and to provide a more sustainable payroll cost base into the future.In that context, the grant funding of Section 39 Agencies is subject to the general efficiency savings for the health sector provided for in the Budget.  Accordingly, it is entirely appropriate that Section 39 Agencies and other HSE funded voluntary providers take appropriate measures to ensure that they continue to provide the same level of service in 2010 as previously, notwithstanding the reductions in their funding.  It is the responsibility of each individual employer to decide exactly what mix of actions should be taken to achieve this goal, to take appropriate legal and other advice, to consult and inform its employees/trade unions as necessary and to manage the HR and industrial relations implications of its decisions.In relation to the pension related deduction, all employees, including full time and part time employees on the payroll of Section 38 agencies, who are, or are entitled to be, members of a public service occupational pension scheme or pension arrangement are subject to the deduction provided for under the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Act (No. 1) 2009.Agencies funded by the HSE under Section 38 of the Health Act 2004 are listed in the following table:Voluntary HospitalsAdelaide & Meath Inc.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1031	I propose to take Questions Nos. 261 and 262 together.The National Immunisation Advisory Committee (NIAC) undertook a scientific assessment of the public health value of HPV following a request from my Department.  NIAC and the National Cancer Screening Service (NCSS) agreed that this work needed to be complemented by a study of the cost effectiveness of the vaccine in the current Irish context.  Accordingly, both organisations requested the Health Information and Quality Authority (HIQA) to undertake a study into the cost effectiveness of HPV. HIQA undertook an assessment of the cost effectiveness of HPV vaccination and recommended it. NIAC reviewed the HIQA report and concluded that HPV vaccine does have the potential to play an important long term role in the prevention of cervical cancer and that a vaccination programme should be put in place to enable these long term benefits to be realised.In August 2008, the Health Service Executive (HSE) was requested by my Department to examine operational and procurement issues relating to the introduction of a HPV vaccination programme for 12 year old girls on a basis that would achieve maximum cost effectiveness and appropriate national uptake rates.In January of this year, I announced the commencement of a national public HPV vaccination programme for girls who are currently in first year in secondary school.  I asked the HSE to integrate this programme where possible into the existing school vaccination programme nationally.  The vaccination schedule requires three doses of the vaccination to be given over the course of a six month period.  Evidence from other countries (UK and Australia) has shown that the highest uptake rates are achieved when HPV vaccine is administered in schools (3rd dose uptakes of over 80% versus less than 65% for GP administration).  I am satisfied in the circumstances that the policy of delivering the vaccination programme mainly in school settings is the most appropriate one.The cost of staffing and location of HSE clinics for the 21 schools taking part in the commencement programme is a service matter for the HSE. I have asked the HSE to reply directly to this aspect of the Deputy's question.

This Review which is due to be completed by the end of the year will identify the core principles of service delivery and standards of practice that will guide national autism services going forward. The issues concerning services to children with autism spectrum disorders as well as those relating to services to adults with autism spectrum disorders are being examined.  I have arranged for the Deputy's questions regarding reviews of autism services to be referred to the Health Service Executive for direct reply to the Deputy.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1033	In 2007 the Health Service Executive (HSE) set up a Working Group on Congregated Settings to develop a national plan and change programme for transferring people with disabilities living in institutions into the community.  It is expected that the Report will develop a framework based on best international practice and up to date research to guide the transfer of identified individuals from congregated settings to a community based setting.The HSE has informed me that the Report of the Review Group on Congregated Settings is currently at an advanced stage of preparation. Among the issues under consideration by the Group is the setting up of a number of demonstration sites to validate the main recommendations on a proposed new model of service delivery. In addition to the Review on Congregated Settings, a HSE Review of the provision of Adult Day Services for people with disabilities has been completed.My Department is also engaging in a Value for Money and Policy Review of Disability Services as part of the Government's Value for Money Reviews for 2009-2011. This in-depth review of Disability Services will assess how well current services for people with disabilities are meeting their objectives and support the future planning and development of services within the appropriate policy framework.  The evaluation will focus on the current provision of disability services and explore the way forward for the development of services within a value for money context.Closure plans are currently being developed for large psychiatric hospitals in the context of the implementation of A Vision For Change and this will include arrangements for the transfer of individuals with an intellectual disability to appropriate community residential facilities.  All of these policy initiatives are being informed by principles of mainstreaming, community inclusion, independence and choice. A structured consultation process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families, will be an integral part of bringing these policy reviews and their recommendations to finality.
#JohnMoloney	unknown-#JohnMoloney-party	unknown-#JohnMoloney-dob	unknown-#JohnMoloney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1034	A Review of  the Efficiency and Effectiveness of Disability Services in Ireland is being undertaken as part of the Government’s Value for Money Reviews for 2009-2011. This in-depth review of disability services will assess how well current services for people with disabilities meet their objectives and support the future planning and development of services. The evaluation will focus on the current provision of disability services and explore the way forward for the development of services within a value for money and policy framework. The objectives of the review are to:Examine disability services in Ireland funded by the Health Service Executive, including the statutory and non-statutory sectors;Deliver a comprehensive analysis of data in relation to services and service providers; andReview current policy objectives and provide policy objectives for future service provision.A Steering Group has been established to oversee the VFMPR and has met six times, and attended a workshop on policy issues. The Steering Group is chaired by an independent chairperson, Mr. Laurence Crowley, and has two other independent members, as well as members drawn from the Disability Sector, Department of Health and Children, the Department of Finance and the HSE. A Project Team and a Policy Expert Reference Group reporting to the Steering Group meet on a regular basis to progress the work of the review. Steady progress is being made with the review, however some slippage in terms of the expected end date has occurred because of the breadth and complexities of the services under review. Difficulties have also been experienced in accessing data essential to the progress of the review due to industrial action affecting the Health Service Executive. I expect that substantial progress on completing the overall Review will have been made by the end of this year.A public consultation process was undertaken in late 2009 and attracted almost 200 responses from a wide variety of respondents including service users, family members and service providers. The Project Team has provided a report to the Steering Group on a statistical analysis of the responses. A thematic analysis of the responses is nearing completion and a final report on the consultation is being drafted. The National Disability Authority (NDA) also conducted 15 focus group consultations with people with disabilities, their families, advocates and frontline service providers in March 2010 to inform its advice to the review. I understand that the NDA is currently formulating an Advice Paper incorporating the results of the consultation, together with other relevant research.The Policy Expert Reference Group is nearing completion of a report to the Steering Group on a new policy framework for the provision of disability services and has taken cognisance of the findings of the public consultation process in developing this policy framework. A further structured consultation process with all stakeholders, including service users and their families, will be an integral part of bringing the policy review to finality. The draft report from the Policy Expert Group is expected in September.

Individuals who were resident in nursing homes on the 27th October 2009, as well as individuals who enter nursing homes after that date, can apply for the scheme.Under the scheme individuals undergo a financial assessment to work out their contribution to care.  A person's contribution is based on 80% of their assessable income and 5% of the value of their assets, if any, per annum.  The first €36,000 of a person's assets, or €72,000 in the case of a couple, is not included at all in the assessment.Furthermore, the legislation provides that applicants to the scheme who were in an approved nursing home on the date the scheme commenced shall have their State Support backdated to that date.Therefore, the individual referred to by the Deputy can apply for financial support under the scheme and is entitled to have her State support backdated, subject to her nursing home qualifying as an approved home.Applications for the scheme are made to the local Nursing Homes Support Office. In this case the local office can be contacted at:Nursing Homes Support OfficeCivic Office,Main Street,Ballymun,Dublin 9.Tel: 01 8467148The local office can also provide individuals with the Information Booklet and Application form for the scheme.

#BarryAndrewsFF	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-party	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-dob	unknown-#BarryAndrewsFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1055	I have responsibility for implementing the free Preschool Year in Early Childhood Care and Education (ECCE) scheme, which was introduced in January of this year.Children qualify for a free preschool year place when they are aged more than 3 years 2 months and less than 4 years 7 months at 1 September each year.  This means that children born between  2 February 2006 and 30 June 2007 will qualify in September 2010.  From the information provided by the Deputy, the child in question is not eligible for the scheme in September of this year but will be eligible in September 2011.In setting the minimum and maximum age limits, account was taken of a number of factors, including the fact that the majority of children commence primary school between the ages of 4 years 6 months and 5 years 6 months.  Notwithstanding this, the ECCE scheme provides for an eligibility range of almost 17 months.  The upper age limit does not apply where children are developmentally delayed and would benefit from participating in the preschool year at a later age.The objective of the ECCE scheme is to make early learning in a formal setting available to all children in the key developmental year before they commence primary school.  To achieve this, services participating in the preschool year will be expected to provide age-appropriate activities and programmes to children within a particular age cohort.  Targeting the preschool year at a particular age cohort is clearly fundamental to the scheme and it is necessary, therefore, to set minimum and maximum limits to the age range within which children will participate in the scheme each year.As in the case of any scheme introduced, cases will arise where individuals would rather that certain conditions did not apply.  However, it is necessary that the scheme is delivered within a structure which supports the best delivery of preschool education and it is considered therefore that the age range provided for is appropriate.Arrangements are already in place for the preschool year which is due to commence in September 2010 and these do not provide for any amendment or reduction in the lower age for eligibility.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1057	As I indicated in response to a question from the Deputy on 20 May last, Ireland has joined an EU wide consortium in relation to two human bio-monitoring (HBM) projects. The objective of this consortium is to develop a coherent approach to HBM in Europe. The consortium has applied to the European Commission for funding in respect of two projects. The first project will concentrate on developing harmonised protocols in order to ensure comparison of subsequent data. The second project will involve a pilot project using the protocols developed in the first project. There is no connection between the HBM initiative and the situation in Cork Harbour.With regard to the work of the group which has been convened by the Office of Public Works (OPW) to develop a structured and coherent approach to the further management and development of the site at Haulbowline, I have raised this with the OPW and have requested that they reply directly to the Deputy.Regarding ongoing health concerns, I would again like to draw attention to the outcome of the report commissioned by the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, which found that "there are no identified risks to the residential inhabitants of Cork Harbour associated with the presence of waste materials at the East Tip on Haulbowline Island".

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1060	The issue of charging the full economic cost for private hospital treatment is considered in the ‘Value for Money and Policy Review of the Economic Cost and Charges Associated with Private and Semi-Private Treatment Services in Public Hospitals' which is currently being undertaken by my Department.  The Review is being conducted under the auspices of the Government's Value for Money & Policy Review Initiative 2009-2011.The Interim Report of this Review was published in February of this year.  The key elements of the Report are a revised methodology for establishing the average cost of private and semi-private patients and the calculation of the gap that exists between current charges and the cost.  It also outlines a number of options for the level of inpatient charge for 2010, as well as the potential implications of increases.The  Report estimated that approximately €305.5 million would be generated in 2010 if the economic cost was charged.  This estimate was based on a revised calculation of the cost per bed day and applied the full cost charge to chargeable beds under the current bed designation policy.  This policy stipulates that charges can only be applied to private patients in designated private beds.  As a comparative figure, the Interim Report estimated that approximately €255 million was collected in 2009 under the current charging regime.The final report of the Review is currently being finalised.  The methodology for calculating the economic charge will be further reviewed in this Report and the estimate may be refined as a result.  It is anticipated that the final report of the Review will be submitted to Government in September, after which it will be published.

For 2009, the NVDF provided details on 170,712 vehicles. To date for 2010, the NVDF has provided details on 56,620 vehicles.It will be noted that not all vehicles for which details are provided may be subjected to recall because the manufacturer may determine that they are not affected. Also, there may be some recall events, particularly in the case of newer vehicles, where NVDF data is not requested from my Department because manufacturer's own records have up to date ownership particulars.

These groups are working towards maximising coverage in their operational areas having regard to local public transport service needs and the availability of resources.In addition, a number of pilot transport projects are continuing in the North East and North West to explore the potential for improved synergies between existing transport providers.  The outcome of these projects, together with those of the recently completed exercise to map all transport services in County Louth and a cross-border pilot rural community transport project under the auspices of the British/Irish Council, will feed into the process for developing rural transport policy into the future.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1075	Under Transport 21 Exchequer funding for transport infrastructure amounting to almost €9 billion has been provided as follows over the last four years:Expenditure in 2006 — €1.937 billion;Expenditure in 2007 — €2.357 billion;Expenditure in 2008 — €2.504 billion;Expenditure in 2009 — €2.124 billionIn addition to this, in excess of €2 billion of private investment in national roads has been secured.The Department's capital allocation for 2010 is €2.081 billion.  The Transport 21 investment framework runs until 2015.  However, because of the changed economic circumstances, it is now likely that not all of the projects originally identified in Transport 21 will be completed by 2015.  Therefore transport investment priorities have been reviewed.  These priorities, which are set out in the Renewed programme for Government, are as follows:Future national road priorities:the progression of the Atlantic Road Corridor, andthe improvement of other key strategic routes.Public transport priority—implementation of the associated electrification,signalling and rolling stock investments. It is also a priority to continue planning other projects for earliest possible delivery when the economic situation improves.No projects have been cancelled and Transport 21 continues to provide the strategic framework for capital spending on transport infrastructure into the future.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1078	The provision of a scheme of VAT and/or VRT relief for wheelchair accessible taxis (WATs) was considered by my Department and the Department of Finance late last year.  However, having regard to the EU prohibition on new schemes to refund VAT, it was considered that it would not be feasible to narrow the tax base by introducing a VRT relief scheme for WATs.The Commission for Taxi Regulation (CTR) has submitted a proposal for a grant scheme to incentivise the provision of wheelchair accessible taxis and hackneys, based on a target of 10% accessible taxi and hackney fleet. I have referred the CTR proposal to the National Transport Authority (NTA) for its consideration and decision.The NTA, which has responsibility for public transport investment in the Greater Dublin Area, will consider the proposal having regard to available funding (including its Exchequer capital allocation), priorities for investment and the enhancement of accessibility for transport services in the Greater Dublin Area.

Currently administration of the necessary SPSV drivers licence is the responsibility of the Garda Commissioner.Section 35 of the Taxi Regulation Act 2003 will be commenced when the functions on driver licensing are transferred from the Garda Commissioner to the Commission for Taxi Regulation. This will provide that persons, who are refused a licence by a licensing authority (i.e. the Commission or the Gardaí), may appeal to the District Court.  Appeals may also be made where licences are suspended or revoked.I have no plans to introduce additional legislation in this regard.

This policy document represents a new transport policy for Ireland for the period 2009-2020 and amongst other things, it sets out the necessary steps to ensure that people choose more sustainable transport modes.  One of the actions contained in the policy in relation to public transport is to provide park and ride facilities at the edge of major and intermediate urban centres and at important public transport nodes, with efficient transport connections to the urban centre.Since 1st December 2009, traffic management measures and park & ride facilities in the Greater Dublin Area (GDA) are matters which come under the remit of the National Transport Authority (NTA).  Outside of the GDA my Department is funding bus priority and park and ride measures in the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford under Transport 21.  It is a matter for the local authorities in each city to prioritise projects and apply for funding in each year.  In the current year funding of €900,000 is being provided for park & ride facilities.Public Transport Feasibility Studies in the regional cities of Cork, Galway, Limerick and Waterford which are being carried out by consultants appointed by the relevant local authorities, with funding from the Department, are examining the most appropriate and feasible public transport systems for these cities.  These studies, which have been completed or are nearing completion, will be considered by my Department in making future decisions on how best to enhance public transport in the four cities, including park and ride facilities.

My Department receives reports from time to time in relation to the delivery and operation of the service.  I understand that NCT has taken a number of steps to increase capacity to meet the substantial increase in demand in the early part of the year.  Additional staff have been employed, some test centres have increased opening hours to include evenings and weekends and two new test centres have opened in Carndonagh, Co Donegal and Greenhills in Tallaght.The RSA continues to monitor the position regarding demand for car testing and testing arrangements and I am satisfied that the RSA is taking action as appropriate.

The construction, improvement and maintenance of individual national road projects, including the Leinster Orbital Route, is a matter for the National Roads Authority under the Roads Acts 1993 to 2007 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.Neither Transport 21 nor the National Development Plan provides any funding for a Leinster Outer Orbital Route.  The Government has already made it clear that under Transport 21, its priorities for the national roads investment programme, after the completion of the major inter-urban network in 2010, will be the Atlantic Road Corridor as well as the improvement of other key national primary routes and the targeted improvement of certain national secondary routes.The Deputy will also be aware that, under the Renewed Programme for Government, a review of the national road programme is underway at present with completion of the review expected by late summer.  In addition to the above, progress on projects such as the Leinster Outer Orbital Route will only be possible as and when resources become available.

Penalties available under the Acts include a consequential disqualification or the endorsement of 5 penalty points on a driving licence record of a person convicted of such an offence.Under section 41 of the Road Traffic Act 1994 and associated regulations, a member of the Garda Síochána who is of the opinion that a vehicle is being used in a public place without motor insurance is authorised to take such steps, in accordance with the regulations, as s/he thinks fit, for the detention, removal and storage of the vehicle.I have no plans to provide for further offences in relation to motor insurance.  Enforcement of these existing offences is a matter for the Garda Síochána and the Courts Service.Motor Tax is a matter for the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.

While the Government mandated the DAA to develop Terminal 2 as part of a long term strategy for investing in the airport's capacity, airport operational issues such as whether an anchor tenant has been agreed for Terminal 2 are the responsibility of the Dublin Airport Authority.In relation to the costs of Terminal 2, DAA operates under a clear commercial mandate and its capital investment programme, including Terminal 2, is funded without Exchequer support.  I understand that Terminal 2 is being constructed as part of the DAA's €1.2 billion capital investment programme.  As well as the new terminal, the programme consists of an extension and other improvements to the existing terminal, Pier D and apron works.I have been informed by the DAA that it is planned to have Terminal (T2) open in November this year.

No. 477 of 2006) vehicle testing arrangements are a matter for the Road Safety Authority.I understand from the Road Safety Authority that because of an unprecedented demand for test dates, since the announcement of penalty points for non-display of a valid roadworthiness certificate, relatively few test notifications have issued.  The announcement was hugely effective in bringing large numbers of vehicles which had expired roadworthiness certificates back into the testing system.I understand that the advance notification of test dates will be fully back online in August and it is intended that this will continue for the future.  Nevertheless, there is a responsibility on vehicle owners to check their registration details to determine if their vehicle is due for testing.

The next step will be for Iarnród Eireann to undertake a detailed evaluation of Phases 2 and 3 with a view to arriving at precise costs to undertake the works.  As I have indicated previously, the current funding environment is very difficult and it will not be possible to progress all the projects in Transport 21 in accordance with the ambitious timescale envisioned at its launch.Despite this, I am seeking to progress planning of the Western Rail Corridor Phases 2 and 3, to ensure that Iarnród Eireann would be in a position to move speedily to construction at the earliest possible date.  In relation to the final section of the line, it is currently being preserved under the Clár Programme and Iarnród Eireann will look again at its reopening when Phases 2 and 3 are completed.

There is no agreed international framework dealing with the recognition of penalty points for driving offences and a very significant volume of work needs to be done, including the provision of an appropriate framework of law and international agreement.A proposal for a Directive on enforcement in the field of road safety was discussed at Council Working Group level in 2008. This proposal did not relate to the mutual recognition of penalty points across the EU.  The Council concluded, after having discussed the proposed Directive it was clear that "a significant number of Member States expressed doubts as to the appropriateness of the legal basis chosen by the Commission for its proposal".The Belgian Presidency of the EU recently published proposals to re-examine the draft Directive.  These proposals are under consideration in my Department.

The testing of the installed Integrated Communications System (ICS) and the training for MRCC staff is also well advanced. The ICS system is expected to be live in Dublin by the end of July. The dual operation of the new and old equipment will last for at least a four-week period, after which the refurbished Dublin MRCC will be fully functional.The equipment for Malin and Valentia Marine Rescue Coordination Sub Centres has been delivered. In order to quickly activate the new ICS equipment in Malin it will be installed in a nearby site on Crockalough in late 2010 and thereafter linked to the Malin station.When the new building on the Malin site is completed in 2014, subject to funding, the ICS equipment will be reinstalled there. It will be necessary to close Malin for three to four weeks in 2011 to facilitate swapping over the equipment and clearing out the Operations Room.In Valentia, the existing buildings will be adapted to accommodate the ICS equipment in 2011. The scale of the work needed is currently being scoped by the OPW.

At present, there are approximately 65,000 vetting applications in the course of being processed.The processing time for vetting applications fluctuates during the year due to seasonal demands when the volume of applications received from certain sectors can increase.  Additional time may be required to process an individual vetting application in cases where clarification is required as to the details provided or where other enquiries need to be made, for example, when the person in question has lived and worked abroad. There will always be a reasonably significant time period required to process a vetting application.  However, the Gardaí make every effort to reduce this to the minimum possible consistent with carrying out the necessary checks.  I am informed by the Garda Authorities that the current average processing time for vetting applications received at the GCVU is in the region of ten to 12 weeks, given that demand is particularly high at present.The allocation of Garda resources, including personnel, is a matter for the Garda Commissioner.  An additional ten persons have recently been recruited to the Vetting Unit on a temporary basis, bringing the total to 88 personnel currently assigned there, including six Gardaí and 82 Garda civilian personnel.  Overall, this represents a very significant increase in the level of personnel assigned to the unit, which stood at only 13 before the current process of development in Garda vetting began in 2005.

A copy of these rules and procedures is provided to all asylum seekers on arrival at their accommodation centre.  These house rules and procedures set out, inter alia, the obligations placed both on the centre manager and the resident. It explains how one party can seek to have breaches of the obligations by the other party resolved.  This document was only recently revised arising from a report from a Working Party, the membership of which included the Refugee Information Service and the Irish Refugee Council.It is the thrust of these procedures that issues which arise are solved quickly, locally and informally without the need for a matter to proceed formally.  In the main, this is how matters are resolved. With regard to formal complaints, these can reflect the complex and many facetted nature of the work of the RIA. Specific complaints can be made about food, the managerial aspects of running a particular centre, the availability of some statutory or voluntary service in an area or a combination of some or all of these factors. Such complaints are made to RIA in a variety of ways: for example, some are made by phone, letter or e-mail, others during inspection visits by RIA staff to accommodation centres, or by clinics run by RIA staff. Still others can be made by representatives of statutory or voluntary agencies working with asylum seekers. Complaints are received and dealt with by a number of sections within RIA and, as required, a coordinated approach is taken in responding to these.RIA does not compile statistics on the number of complaints or appeals received or actions taken following on from such complaints or appeals. If such statistics were to be compiled, they could not properly reflect the number and nature of such complaints and appeals or the resolutions reached because of the high level of informal activity enacted locally between centre staff, residents and others. However, RIA does monitor all centres and follows up where spikes in volumes or types of complaint or incident are noticeable.  In such cases, RIA will meet with management, residents and their representatives as appropriate in order to get an understanding of the issues and to assist in resolving such issues through consultation and appropriate action. Further, RIA conducts information clinics, centre inspections, formal and informal visits and attends meetings with residents groups, support groups, service providers and others who engage with the direct provision centres.IT developments in future will mean a greater coordination of  information between centres and RIA.  In that context, it would be RIA's intention to be able to provide details of complaints, including even informal complaints, along the lines sought in the question.

The day-to-day administration of this Scheme is carried out by Pobal on behalf of my Department. Substantive grants of up to €100,000 have been made available from my Department with the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs providing matching funding for successful applications from RAPID areas.  Pre-development grants of up to €5,000 have also been made available to assist local communities to develop substantive proposals in their areas.Two major rounds of the Scheme were advertised in 2005/2006 and 2007 with a total of 13 and 30 substantive Schemes respectively approved for funding. A further 2 Schemes under the Limerick Regeneration Programme were approved in 2008.  In addition, 54 Schemes were awarded pre-development grants over the same period.  To date, a total of 26 substantive Schemes has been installed. Installation of the remaining 19 Community CCTV Schemes is ongoing with Schemes at various stages of implementation.Community-based grant aided schemes and Garda CCTV systems are funded from a single budget provision within the  Garda Vote. The CCTV budget allocation for 2010 is €2,375,000.The Garda authorities are satisfied that these systems provide a valuable source of information to An Garda Síochána in the prevention and detection of criminal activity, while also increasing public safety and reducing the risk of anti-social and criminal activity.Any further plans for extending CCTV are dependent on a number of factors, including the availability of funding, progression of the Schemes already grant aided and overall policy considerations.

In his application form for that Scheme, and also renewal thereof in 2007, the person concerned stated that he was a citizen of Sierra Leone. Consequently he has been recorded as such by my Department.I am further informed that the permission to remain in the State granted to the person in question is currently valid until 27 September, 2010. Registration of permission to remain is a matter for the Garda National Immigration Bureau. Consideration is currently being given to representations received from the legal representatives of the person concerned in respect of issues pertaining to his entitlement to dual nationality. The person in question will be contacted directly and informed of any decisions made in this regard in due course.

The total amount of substances involved was in excess of 4.5 tonnes.As a result of the legislative measures introduced on 11 May a considerable number of headshops across the country have already closed down with Garda National Drug Unit records showing as on 14 June 2010 that a total of 44 headshops remain in operation nationwide.In addition to the initial Garda visits to all headshop outlets on 12 May 2010, the Garda National Drugs Unit and local Drug Units continue to visit the remaining outlets on an ongoing basis to conduct test purchasing of substances and to monitor their activities.No arrests have been made to date arising from this but prosecutions will be pursued in cases where any controlled drugs are detected in the products sent for analysis.In addition to this the Deputy will be aware of the Criminal Justice legislative measures which I have introduced which  outlaw the sale of psychotropic substances which were passed through the Oireachtas earlier this week.These measures will further enhance our response in tackling this problem.

Two devices were found which necessitated the attendance of an Army Explosive Ordnance Disposal team.  The matter is under active investigation by the Garda Síochána.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1146	The matter to which the Deputy refers concerns the alleged leaking of official material from Garda sources to the media relating to a deceased person. An investigation under section 98 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005 into the matter was carried out by the Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission and the full text of that report is available on its website.The Ombudsman Commission report recommends to the Garda Commissioner that supervisory ranks of An Garda Síochána should regularly monitor the use of PULSE to ensure that members adhere to their legal and disciplinary obligations with regard to its proper use. The report also recommends that suitable measures be put in place by the Garda authorities to ensure audit trails of the usage of PULSE and any other official information systems can always be accurate and verifiable.With regard to Pulse, An Garda Síochána have detailed procedures and instructions in place on the operation of the Pulse system. The Pulse system incorporates an accurate audit system which records all record creations and updates made on the system.  The audit record includes the date and time when the update on the system took place and contains details of the user signed onto the system at that time.  Audit-trails also record all inquires made on the core items of interest on the PULSE system including Person and Vehicle.  Audit records are written at the time the associated transaction took place.  These audit records can only be accessed centrally and are not available or visible to the users.In response to the report, a review to consider the matters raised and identify options for enhanced usage of the PULSE Audit data in respect of the monitoring of data access has been conducted by the Gardaí.   An 'Exceptional activity level report' and related business process have been developed which will highlight to Garda Management specific PULSE records which are subject to a high level of data access activity occurring within a defined period.  This new functionality will be deployed as part of PULSE Release 6 in July 2010.

The Board also had 40 cases awaiting a Tribunal hearing.  In accordance with Section 111 of the Garda Síochána Act 2005, 72 complaints were transferred to the newly established Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission.  The Board's remaining 427 complaints were processed to finality during 2007, 2008 and 2009.   During the same period the Board finalised, with the exception of one case, all Tribunal hearings including an additional 27 cases which were referred during 2007 and 2008 by the Board to Tribunal, in accordance with Section 7(5) of the Act.   The Board's final Tribunal hearing was finalised on 15 February 2010.In addition, in the period since 9 May 2007 the Garda Síochána Complaints Board has been involved in 25 court cases arising from various complaints which it has actively sought to have finalised/struck out or otherwise closed.  At present only two such cases involving the Garda Síochána Complaints Board remain outstanding in the Courts.  The Board must continue to exist while these cases are before the Courts

Figures for 2009 and up until the 27 June 2010 are set out in the table below.Prison/Place of DetentionNumber of Drug Seizures in 2009Number of Drug Seizures in 2010 (27/6/2010)Arbour Hill Prison00Castlerea Prison6543Cloverhill Prison9737Cork Prison3526Dóchas Centre1110Limerick Prison7587Loughan House1215Midlands Prison9346Mountjoy Prison (male)547409Portlaoise Prison2014Shelton Abbey1913St. Patrick’s Institution9256Training Unit6014Wheatfield Prison16752Total1,293822Prisons do not have the facilities to test for the type of substances or the quantity found. Gardaí are contacted once suspected drug seizures are made and issues of investigation and prosecution fall within their remit.It is acknowledged that drugs present a major challenge to the Irish Prison Service and in this context, the Irish Prison Service Drugs Policy & Strategy, entitled Keeping Drugs out of Prison was launched in May 2006. The implementation of this Policy and Strategy has seen an intensification of efforts in the prison system to eliminate the availability of illicit drugs within prisons. The measures taken reflect the many and varied ways in which attempts are made to bring drugs into prisons and include:Tighter control and monitoring of prisoner visits in all closed prisons;New visiting arrangements in all prisons, with visitors required to be pre-approved by the Governor and required to provide identification on each visit;Greater vigilance in examining mail by prison censors and searching of other items entering the prison;Increased random searching of cells and their occupants;Stricter searching of all persons committed to custody and prisoners returning from court, temporary release, after visits or on receipt of intelligence;Use of modern cameras and probe systems which assist in searching previously difficult areas such as hollow chair or bed legs, under floor boards and other cavities; andInstallation of nets over exercise yards to prevent access to contraband items, including mobile phones and drugs.In addition, a number of new,  enhanced security initiatives have been introduced in all closed prisons including:The introduction of enhanced security screening for all persons (visitors and staff) entering our prisons;The establishment of a drug detection dog service within the Irish Prison Service involving approximately 30 handling teams;The establishment of Operational Support Units dedicated to and developing expertise in searching and gathering intelligence on illicit material being hidden inside our prisons; they will be available in addition to the normal prison staff and can target specific security problem areas; andThe Body Orifice Security Scanner (BOSS) chair was introduced by the Irish Prison Service in early 2008 and to date eight chairs have been installed.I am glad to tell the Deputy that the new security screening at prison entrances and the range of measures introduced have had considerable success in preventing the flow of and assisting in the capture of contraband such as illicit drugs. I am determined to take all reasonable measures to ensure that we stem the flow of illicit substances into our prisons. In that regard there will be no easing off in relation to the security measures already in place and enhancements and improvements will continue to take place in future as deemed necessary and appropriate.In tandem with the emphasis on enhanced security measures the Irish Prison Service also continues to strive to implement its Drugs Policy and Strategy. Part of the implementation of the Strategy includes continued significant investment in services within prisons to reduce the demand for illicit drugs in the prisoner population as well as meeting prisoners' treatment and rehabilitative needs.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1150	Section 6 of the Criminal Justice Act 1960 states that a person shall be deemed unlawfully at large if a condition to which his release was made subject has been broken. Section 7 of the Act then allows for a member of the Gardaí to arrest without warrant such a person and return them back to prison custody. Persons returned to custody in such circumstances then have their cases considered by the appropriate Prison Governor who makes the determination whether or not the temporary release should be revoked. If the temporary release is revoked the person remains in custody.When prisoners are granted temporary release it is for a set and determinate period; in most cases this would be for one week. A fresh decision to grant temporary release is required each time the person returns back to the prison. In cases where it has been brought to my attention that there are serious concerns relating to a person's behaviour the decision is then made not to grant a further period of temporary release. The power to make these decisions is vested in the Minister for Justice and Law Reform and are generally made on my behalf by senior officials in Irish Prison Service Headquarters.The sentence imposed on a person continues to run while they are compliant with the terms of their temporary release from custody. However, a person who goes unlawfully at large or otherwise breaches the terms and conditions of their temporary release will still have to serve out the full balance of the remaining sentence once they are returned to custody.

As the Garda Reserve depends on volunteers who undertake their training and other duties during their free time, it is difficult to predict how many people will commence training in any particular period. However, I can assure the Deputy and the House that the Garda Commissioner is continuing recruitment with the objective of reaching that target. The Public Appointments Service has received over 7,000 expressions of interest to join the Reserve since the start of this year.  The Government is strongly committed to the development of the Reserve. It has been a very successful initiative and I am confident that it will continue to flourish into the future.It is important to note that the moratorium on recruitment and appointments in the public service does not apply to the Garda Reserve, as members are volunteers and do not draw a salary.

No Secretary General retired in the period in question.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1157	I propose to take Questions Nos. 413, 418 and 419 together.On 6 July, there were 57,516 applications in the system.  Of these 12,400 represent applications received by the Passport Office in Cork.  It is not possible to produce statistics for North Tipperary alone.  Whereas this backlog is excessively high it nonetheless represents a reduction of almost 10,500 applications in the backlog since the middle of June.  One additional contributory factor to the time taken to reduce the backlog in passport applications is the exceptional demand for passports this year.  To date passport demand is running at 13.8% higher than this time in 2009.In recent weeks the Passport Service has re-introduced a guaranteed turnaround time for passport applications.  Applications submitted via the Passport Express service (Swiftpost in the Republic and NIPX in the North), available through local post offices, are now guaranteed to be processed within 20 working days.  This 20 working day guarantee will be kept under review and it is intended that this will reduce over the coming weeks.  The new guarantee turnaround time will help re-establish trust in the operation of the Passport Service.Applications received through the ordinary post channels are currently being processed with eight weeks of receipt.  There is no difference in waiting times for a passport renewal or first time application.A new service to prioritise applications for those with immediate travel plans has also been introduced.  Applications with proof of travel are now guaranteed to be processed within three working days.  Applicants should make contact with the Passport Service & provide this proof where applicable.  An additional fee may apply in respect of such new applications.  This is the fastest turnaround time for all applications except for those whose travel is required for urgent humanitarian reasons.Passport Service staff continue to work overtime to assist in keeping the number of applications in the system to a minimum.  In the last few weeks, additional temporary staff have commenced work in the Passport Service and will be working to clear this backlog.  While this will take some time, every effort is being made to minimise the inconvenience to the travelling public and to restore normal processing times at the earliest opportunity.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1158	The 2007 Programme for Government contained a specific commitment to support a binding and comprehensive global treaty on the trade of arms, covering all weapons and ammunition.  In implementation of this commitment, Ireland has worked within the UN and with the EU to achieve a comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. The EU has a common position in support of this objective.Since December 2006 the UN has been examining the feasibility, scope and draft parameters for a comprehensive, legally binding instrument establishing common international standards for the import, export and transfer of conventional arms. As part of this process, Ireland submitted a report on its views on the Arms Trade Treaty to the UN in April 2007 and this was included in the UN Secretary-General's report on this subject in August 2007.Ireland cosponsored resolutions adopted by the UN General Assembly in 2008 and 2009 and has taken an active role in deliberations and UN meetings on various aspects of the proposed treaty.  The 2009 resolution provides for a UN Diplomatic Conference in 2012 to negotiate the Arms Trade Treaty, with a number of Preparatory Committees in the run-up to that Conference.  The first two sessions of the Preparatory Committee will take place from 12-23 July next. Ireland will be represented at senior level from the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Defence Forces.The Chair of the July meetings, Ambassador Moritan of Argentina, has indicated that he hopes to get general agreement on the structure of an ATT, with future sessions then focusing on the detailed discussion of the composition of its individual elements. Ireland takes the view that the scope of the ATT should be as wide as possible and should cover both the items on the UN Register of Conventional Arms as well as Small Arms and Light Weapons, ammunition and explosives. We will be making these points in the negotiations.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1159	Like every other country, Israel is entitled to play a full and active part within the UN and other international organisations. This is perhaps especially important to acknowledge in Israel's case, as for many decades Israel has been excluded from some organisations, or from regional groups within UN organisations, due to the denial in some quarters of its legitimacy and right to exist.Ireland has and will have no part in a policy of exclusion on such grounds. The Government's policy in relation to the admission of Israel to organisations of which we are already a member will be decided on the basis of the rules, purpose and remit of each organisation. We have been and continue to be highly critical of many aspects of Israeli policy, above all connected with the ongoing occupation of Palestinian lands. But the Government does not consider attempts to block Israeli membership of international organisations as a useful means of exerting pressure on Israel to change these policies. Such action would not increase Ireland's influence either on Israel or among our other partners in these organisations.As I have said before, the list of countries around the world with which we might have serious concerns on political or human rights issues is a long one, and is not confined to Israel. I believe instead that cooperation in international organisations can go much deeper than relations with the government of the day, and can encourage or sustain more open and tolerant thinking at deeper levels and over a longer period.I have on a number of occasions explained in the House the Government's position on Israel's accession to the OECD. Israel was invited to begin accession negotiations along with four other states as part of a balanced compromise expansion package agreed by the existing members. When Israel was judged to meet the basically economic criteria of the OECD, it was invited (along with Slovenia) to join the organisation. Ireland supported this decision, and the question of a veto did not arise.In international organisations which allow a veto to members, or which operate by consensus, the use of a national veto should be considered only as an absolute last resort, not simply as a means of making your argument more emphatically. If member States did not observe that discipline, all such organisations would immediately grind to a halt. Ireland attaches a very high priority to the working of the international multilateral system, and works hard to ensure such organisations can function effectively.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1160	A number of Social Partnership Organisations have received funding from my Department during the period in question, the details of which are outlined below.In all cases funding is provided as part of regulated schemes operated by my Department. There are no state agencies under the aegis of my Department.The Reconciliation and Anti Sectarianism Funds in my Department have provided support to the Irish Congress of Trade Unions (ICTU), as detailed in the table below. Throughout the Troubles and in the period since, ICTU has played a vital role in promoting improved community relations in Northern Ireland. The funding awarded has been used to support ICTU's ongoing work in Northern Ireland. In the period 2004-2006, funding supported the Trade Union and Community Protestant Leadership Course which provided training to community leaders in areas of weak infrastructure to establish, operate and develop community groups. These leadership development and capacity building programmes have been developed and continued in the period to date, specifically targeting marginalised communities. ICTU has also delivered anti-sectarianism capacity building programmes in workplaces across Northern Ireland. Part of the funding awarded is used, in consultation with the Department of Foreign Affairs, to support small projects, run by local community organisations, designed to foster reconciliation and combat sectarianism in and between communities . The funds awarded under this scheme are subject to the provision of a project report and audited accounts.Year€Fund2004100,000Reconciliation Fund200525,000Reconciliation Fund2006100,000Reconciliation Fund2007100,000Reconciliation Fund200880,000Reconciliation Fund201090,000Anti Sectarianism FundMy Department has also provided funding to the Irish Council for Prisoners Overseas (ICPO) under the Emigrant Support Programme.

All funded organisations are required to submit fully certified or audited accounts along with a detailed narrative progress report for each project for which Emigrant Support Programme funding has been provided. In addition, Departmental officials meet regularly with each organisation in receipt of funding.My Department also provides funding to a number of social partnership organisations to promote deeper public understanding of global development issues. The table below outlines details of support which is provided through the Irish Aid programme. This includes a partnership between Irish Aid and the National Youth Council of Ireland to promote learning among young people on the links between local and global issues. Support for the Irish Congress of Trade Unions is primarily for the ICTU Global Solidarity Programme which aims to deepen understanding within the trade union movement of global development and labour-related issues, including child labour.In 2008, funding also included an allocation of €20,000 to support a project by ICTU to strengthen the capacity of the Lesotho Congress of Democratic Unions.In addition to the support outlined in the table, €10,000 was provided to the Conference of Religious in Ireland (CORI) towards the costs of organising an international conference held in Dublin in 2008.OrganisationType of Funding2004200520062007200820092010 to date€€€€€€€National Youth Council of IrelandDevelopment Education funding provided under two partnership agreements (2004-2006 and 2007-2009).164,895217,850252,577290,366309,806325,758New proposal for 2010 is currently under consideration.Irish Congress of Trade UnionsDevelopment Education Grant Funding/Civil Society46,66475,00075,00080,00085,000107,00093,000ECO-UNESCODevelopment Education Grant Funding31,61210,500—50,00080,00080,00045,000Friends of the EarthDevelopment Education Grant Funding———50,000——23,000Just ForestsDevelopment Education Grant Funding55,00020,00025,00026,00052,00055,00025,000Pavee PointDevelopment Education Grant Funding15,000—19,041————Social Partnership Organisations, like any persons or groups based in Ireland, are also eligible to seek funding for projects for promotion of EU affairs under the annual Communicating Europe Initiative.

For Irish citizens the application is administered directly with the Embassy concerned or through a sponsoring organisation. While precise figures are not available in relation to the number of visa applications by Irish citizens approved in all of the countries listed, the table beneath sets out the visa allocation for 2010 and the available information on the number of visas approved in 2007, 2008 and 2009.In the case of Australia there is no specific allocation for Irish nationals under the Working Holiday Agreement. Approvals are usually dependent on meeting the eligibility criteria. The programme runs from 1st July to 30th June and the figures provided reflect these periods.Allocations under the Working Holiday agreements for each of the countries concerned are reviewed on a regular basis. Allocations remain unchanged with the exception of Canada which increased from 2,500 to 4,000 in 2010. Information on visa approvals to the US is not released on an individual country basis so the figure below is an estimate.The Working Holiday agreement with Argentina was concluded in September 2008 and figures are only available from 1st January 2009.Working Holiday AgreementNo. of visa approvals in 2007No. of visa approvals in 2008No. of visa approvals in 2009Allocation in 2010Argentinan/an/a14100Canada2,1331,9242,5004,000Japan634235400Hong Kong302911100Australia18,63727,24118,495Not cappedNew Zealand1,7651,9282,383Not cappedU.S.A.n/an/a400 (i)Not capped(i) estimated figure.

The Embassy of Ireland to the Italian Republic is also accredited to Libya and San Marino, and the Ambassador to Italy is Ireland's Permanent Representative to the Food & Agriculture Organisation (FAO), the World Food Programme (WFP) and the International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) — all international organisations based in Rome. During the period in question the Ambassador to Italy was also accredited to Malta.  The operating costs figures for each Embassy as detailed below relate to: salaries, travel, post and telecommunications, office machinery, office premises expenses and incidental expenses.In regard to Embassy premises: the Embassy to the Holy See is owned by the State, where the Chancery and Ambassadorial Residence are combined in a single building.  Premises expenses as detailed below relate to the maintenance of the building.  In the case of the Embassy to Italy, both the Chancery and the Residence are rented properties and the premises expenses figures below primarily relate to these rental costs. The Residence is rented on favourable terms as the Irish State has rented the property for over fifty years.  The Chancery is rented on a long term lease having moved into its current premises in 1996.  It should be noted that there is no possibility of combining either the premises or Ambassadorial duties of these two Missions, as apart from having very different purposes, the Vatican will not accept the accreditation of an Ambassador who is also the Ambassador to the Italian Republic and neither will they accept the accreditation of an Embassy with the same address as the Embassy to the Italian Republic.YearEmbassy to ItalyEmbassy to the Holy See2007Operating Costs Outturn €1,908,899792,618

However, I do not expect that a decision in this regard will be made in the short term.  The priority for the Passport Service at present is to reduce the substantial backlog in passport applications and to restore the normal turnaround time for passport processing at the earliest opportunity.  At that time the question of additional passport office services will be examined in more detail.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1168	The Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, as published in July 2009, made a number of recommendations in respect of my Department and the agencies under its aegis.  Specifically, the Special Group made proposals to reduce programme expenditure by almost €105 million in 2010 and to structurally reduce 170 staff across the Department and its agencies.  It also proposed that consideration should be given to the discontinuation of the Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism as a Department in its own right.  This department's three sectors make a major contribution to Irish society and the economy.  This must be considered alongside the recommendations in the Special Group's report.  The Government considered the Special Group's report prior to Budget 2010 and adopted the report's recommendations in a number of areas where the benefits of the changes proposed were considered to outweigh any disadvantages.Savings of more than €35 million, or almost 7 per cent, were achieved in the Revised Estimates for 2010 for the department's Vote Group, compared to 2009.  Moreover, the Government's moratorium on staff recruitment and promotion and its incentivised early retirement scheme continue to achieve reductions in staff numbers across my Department and its agencies.  In May 2010, the Government made structural re-alignments to a range of Departments of State.  As part of these re-alignments, the former Department of Arts, Sport and Tourism became the current Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport, having an enhanced emphasis on maximising the benefits to Ireland, in financial and other terms, of both our tourism product and our cultural and sporting heritage.  In addition, responsibility for the horse-racing and greyhound industries was transferred to the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food.  I am confident that this Department has a strong role to play in Ireland's economic recovery and am determined to work with the various agencies and stakeholders to maximise the economic potential of the tourism sector in particular.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1169	Under the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme, which is administered by the Department of Tourism, Culture and Sport funding is allocated towards the construction, refurbishment or replacement of public swimming pool facilities throughout the country.  The current round of the Programme was closed to new applicants since 31 July 2000 and no application was made in respect of a public swimming pool for Lucan before that date.  South Dublin County Council applied for and received the maximum grant of €3.8m for a new pool at Jobstown and a replacement pool at Clondalkin under the current round of the Programme.Under the current round of the programme, 57 applications were received, of which 45 projects have been completed and opened to the public.  The priority now is to work with the relevant local authorities in completing the remaining 12 pool projects, which are included in the current round.  Since the current round commenced in 2000, total expenditure to date has amounted to €144.5m million and this has leveraged a total investment of some €400m.  The allocation of €7.5m in 2010 will be sufficient to meet commitments arising in 2010 under the current round of the Local Authority Swimming Pool Programme.  When the Programme is re-opened, it will be open to all local authorities, including South Dublin County Council on behalf of Lucan, to submit applications under the terms that will apply.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1175	The Deputy will be aware that the Government has agreed to transfer responsibility for the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme from my Department to the renamed Department of Social Protection.  Arrangements to enable the transfer of these programmes are currently being progressed as part of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010.  The Deputy will appreciate that, in this context, any proposals to extend these programmes would fall to be considered by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1176	As the Deputy is aware, the Local Development Social Inclusion Programme and the Community Development Programme were my Department's two main social inclusion/community development programmes.  These came to an end on 31 December last and have been superseded by a new integrated programme, the Local and Community Development Programme (LCDP).  All community development projects (CDPs) and local development companies (LDCs) that are currently in receipt of funding through the LCDP have signed up:to implement the new programme in the context of my Department's integration strategy; andto meet specified deadline dates (submission of workplan by 26 March 2010 and of integration plan by 30 June 2010).The position is that, unless a project has received provisional approval from my Department for an alternative LCDP integration model, groups were still required to submit their plans for full integration by 30 June.My Department has set out a national model involving full integration of CDPs with LDCs, but has made it clear that other options can be considered and that it is not a question of ‘one size fits all'.  Alternative models will, however, be required to meet a range of criteria, including a reduction in the number of structures, promoting the potential for integrated delivery of services to the public, supporting efficiencies and reducing the burden of company law compliance for CDPs.  The only option not acceptable is one that seeks to preserve the status quo: some models proposed by CDPs and other parties in the period since the launch of the LCDP have had to be rejected on that basis.  In recent weeks, I have been able to respond positively to possible alternative models put forward by the Paul Partnership and Limerick City CDPs, and by HSE South and a number of CDPs in the Cork/Kerry area.  While agreement has not yet been fully finalised in these cases, I am confident that a real possibility for agreement exists.Additional proposals from other CDPs and LDCs, including Northside Partnership, the National Community Development Forum and others, have also been under consideration.  However, a model that does not entail significant change is unlikely to meet the specified criteria.  The model proposed by the Forum, while having the potential for integrated service delivery, does not meet the objective of reduced structures, and, in fact, would constitute maintenance of the status quo with regard to those structures.  In addition, it does not appear to have the potential to reduce the administrative and legal burdens currently required of CDP board members.  However, I can assure the Forum that my Department will continue to respond positively to all constructive proposals that it receives, based on the specified criteria, and that my officials will continue to be available to meet with the boards of projects.It is important to note that, despite what is stated by some commentators, full integration does not mean closure of a CDP or the cessation of CDP activities in any given area.  As has been stated previously, any worthwhile community development activity or service delivered under a CDP can continue to be delivered under the proposed new LCDP structure and by the same staff who currently do this work.  Of course, CDPs may opt out of the LCDP integration process and decide to go it alone. In such cases, my Department will be supportive in relation to the retention of any assets acquired with programme funding and may also be in a position to provide for some limited funding for a transition period, subject to certain conditions.A number of CDPs have raised concerns about the treatment of assets (particularly buildings) in a full integration situation, where all assets and net liabilities would usually transfer by agreement. However, I want to emphasise that other arrangements are possible — for example, the ownership of buildings need not transfer to an LDC.  This was also made clear in the context of the information event for CDPs and LDCs, held by Pobal on my Department's behalf, on 10 June last.  May I take this opportunity to reassure all concerned that my focus remains firmly on ensuring that scarce resources are targeted at the most vulnerable communities through optimising our efforts and resources at the front-line.

I am advised that South Tipperary Development Company, the Group charged with implementing the Rural Development Programme in the South Tipperary region, has carried out some pre-development work with Halla na Féile and that they are at the very early stages of the RDP funding application process.  The Deputy will appreciate that a decision in this case is a matter for South Tipperary Development Company, having regard to the operating rules and criteria of the Programme.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1179	In 2000, my Department engaged economic consultants Indecon to carry out an independent review of the expenditure programmes of Údarás na Gaeltachta.  A summary of the consultants' recommendations is set out in Appendix 1 below.  My Department has, over the past number of years, worked closely with An tÚdarás to implement these recommendations, insofar as practicable.  While some of the recommendations were outside the direct remit of my Department, many have been implemented, in part or in full.  The Deputy will, of course, be aware that the future remit of An tÚdarás will fall to be considered in the context of the draft 20-year Strategy on Irish, which has been under consideration by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Arts, Sports, Tourism, Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  The report of the Committee is expected shortly and I hope to proceed thereafter with submitting the draft Strategy for final approval by Government.Appendix 1: Summary of recommendations from Indecon review of the expenditure programmes of Údarás na GaeltachtaRecommendation 1:There is a need to utilise a wide range of policy initiatives including some which are outside of the remit of current Údarás programmes if the objectives for the Gaeltacht are to be realised in the most effective manner.Recommendation 2:Consideration should be given to the relocation of public sector funded services employment to Gaeltacht areas.Recommendation 3:There is a need for significant infrastructural development in the Gaeltacht, particularly in the areas of energy and telecommunications.Recommendation 4:The National Education and Training Systems should seek to address the educational attainment deficit among present Gaeltacht residents.Recommendation 5:Measures should be taken to reduce the average cost of most jobs sustained in firms assisted by An tÚdarás.Recommendation 6:Differential targets for cost per job sustained will be appropriate for remaining areas of high unemployment and for higher skilled knowledge based sectors.  A maximum cost per job should, however, be applied to all projects.Recommendation 7:Reliance on Traditional Sectors in Manufacturing should be reduced.Recommendation 8:An agreed national policy should be put in place which will give priority to the Gaeltacht for the location of projects in certain niche sectors.Recommendation 9:Higher priority should be given to avoiding potential deadweight in industrial incentives programmes.Recommendation 10:The education and skills base in the Gaeltacht should be enhanced through initiatives by An tÚdarás and other organisations. The concept of life-long learning should be central Údaras policy.Recommendation 11:An tÚdarás should adjust its own training activities to increase emphasis on transferability of skills and external certification of training. It should also focus attention on management development.Recommendation 12:An tÚdarás should work with other agencies to promote an optimal mix of active labour market measures. Involvement with social economy should be redirected in line with national changes, including involvement with the new Social Economy Programme .Recommendation 13:The terms under which Údarás equity is provided should be adjusted to enhance the prospects of financial returns.Recommendation 14:Significant revisions to Údarás property development activities should be pursued, including the rationalisation of the land bank, the sale of building to existing tenants, and the involvement of the private sector in new building projects on a partnership basis. There should be an explicit rationale for property decisions within the context of managing property as a resource.Recommendation 15:Adjustments should be made to the grants for small industries programme to attempt to reduce the high attrition rate.Recommendation 16:Improvements are needed to provide on-going information to monitor the effectiveness of Údarás projects.Recommendation 17:An tÚdarás should continue to develop partnership relationships with local communities and organisations.

My Department is, however, compiling the relevant information and will revert to the Deputy in writing within the next two weeks.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1181	I propose to take Questions Nos. 440 to 442, inclusive, together.The Deputies will be aware that the transfer to my Department of responsibility for social inclusion policy and family policy from the Department of Social Protection and of responsibility for equality, integration, human rights and disability from the Department of Justice and Law Reform has now taken place.  The title of my Department changed to the Department of Community, Equality and Gaeltacht Affairs with effect from 2 June 2010.My plans for 2010 and for the coming period will be to progress the actions and commitments reflected in the Programme for Government and the Revised Programme for Government that relate to my functions and areas of responsibility. In this regard, work is in hands on the preparation of a new Statement of Strategy for my Department.  In developing this new Statement of Strategy, my Department will take stock of the progress made to date on meeting Government Programme commitments and, against that background, I will decide how best to focus efforts over the coming period so as to achieve real results on the ground and deliver on our mandate.  As a consequence of the additional responsibilities, my Department’s gross financial allocation has increased by €47.36m in the current year.  This represents 10.2% of my Department’s gross financial allocation, as amended by the transfer of functions.In relation to costs arising from my Department's change of title, it is not possible to quantify the amount in question at this time. I can confirm, however, that it is my intention that all stationery currently held by my Department will be used to the greatest extent feasible.  I have also directed my officials to ensure that any costs arising due to the name change of my Department are kept to a minimum and are met from within existing resources.  With regard to the transfer of responsibility for the Rural Social Scheme from my Department to the Department for Social Protection, the position is that Part 4 of the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2010 provides for the transfer of both the Rural Social Scheme and the Community Services Programme to the Department of Social Protection.The Bill is currently before Seanad Éireann, having completed Second Stage on 6 July 2010, and I understand that it is planned to take Committee, Report and Final Stages on 13 July 2010, subject to agreement. Part 4 of the Bill will be subject to a commencement order.  Following the transfer of the Rural Social Scheme to the Department of Social Protection, issues in relation to the future administration of that scheme will, of course, be a matter for that Department.
#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1182	Funding of €2.1m was provided to community and voluntary organisations under the Scheme of Community Support for Older People (CSOP) in 2009.  The Scheme, which was suspended in April 2009 to facilitate a comprehensive review of its operations, was re-opened to applications from community and voluntary groups in October 2009, pending the introduction of a new Scheme in 2010.  The Seniors Alert Scheme replaced the CSOP on 24 May 2010 and is open to applications for support from community and voluntary organisations registered with my Department to operate the Scheme.  Overall, some €3.1m has been provided in my Department's Vote for the CSOP/Seniors Alert Scheme in 2010, an increase of 50% on the 2009 provision.  The Deputy should note that my Department continues to process applications received under the CSOP prior to its closure in May.  To date in 2010, some €1.3m in grant support has been provided to 324 community groups for the provision of items of safety and security equipment to more than 4,000 older people.  Details of the grant support paid to community groups are available on my Department's website (www.pobail.ie).

Statistics on recipients were kept on a county basis for the years 2007, 2008 and 2009 only. The 2010 figures relate to Local and Branch Offices and their respective catchments in the South Tipperary area.The farm assist scheme is a practical response by the Department to the situation of low-income farmers and it represents a long-term safety net for them. It benefits farm families with children and also provides increased payments to farming couples without children and to single farmers on low incomeWhile this means-tested payment is broadly similar to the jobseeker's allowance scheme, it has a more generous means test, which takes account of the specific nature of farming and, unlike jobseeker's allowance, farmers claiming this payment do not need to be available for work outside of the farm in order to qualify.

In addition, there are 9 civilian staff employed at the barracks.  I am advised that total direct expenditure on upgrading and maintenance of the property between 2000 and July 2010 was in the region of €4.5 million.The Department and the Defence Forces continually review Defence Forces requirements in relation to barracks, infrastructure and other military installations.  Properties deemed surplus to requirements are disposed of and the proceeds are invested in the ongoing modernisation of the Defence Forces.  There are, however, no plans to alter the current status of Kickham Barracks, at this time.

As part of the pension reforms in the National Pensions Framework, the requirement for 260 total paid contributions will increase to a requirement to have 520 paid contributions from April 2012.In 2020, the introduction of the total contributions approach will require that people have 30 years of contributions/credits (10 years of which can be credits) before qualifying for a maximum pension. The 30 years can be calculated across a customer's full working life. Under the total contributions approach, allowing for the ten years of credits, a person will qualify for a two-thirds pension (66%) if they have the minimum number of paid contributions (10 years) and the maximum number of credits (10 years).The means-tested State pension (non-contributory) will continue to be there for people on low incomes who have not paid sufficient PRSI contributions to qualify for the contributory pension.The current and the proposed new system strikes a balance between recognising periods outside the paid workforce while emphasising the need to maximise the paid element in the contribution conditions for pensions.For people reaching State pension age before 2020, a person's social insurance credit record can be used in its entirety for calculating entitlement.  In addition, social insurance credits for people who take time out of the workforce for caring duties will be introduced.  This will replace the current homemakers disregard and will assist people, including women who do not have sufficient paid contributions, qualify for a contributory pension or a higher level of payment.

The continued provision of a free examination allows people to continue to have regular check-ups and helps ensure the early detection of disease and other health issues.The dental benefit scheme is a PRSI based scheme available to all who satisfy certain PRSI conditions. A person may also qualify for dental benefit on his/her spouse/partner's PRSI record provided certain conditions are satisfied. However, the dental benefit scheme does not apply to the children of qualified adults.Questions relating to dental provision for children and the dental service provided in schools are a matter for the Department of Health and Children and should be addressed to my colleague the Minister for Health and Children.

This application was referred to one of the Department's Medical Assessors who found that her child was not medically eligible for DCA.A letter issued on the 22nd April 2010 advising her of the decision to refuse DCA. In the case of an application which is refused on medical grounds, the applicant may submit additional information and/or ask for the case to be reviewed, or they may appeal the decision directly to the Social Welfare Appeals Office within 21 days.In this case the applicant submitted additional medical information in respect of her claim. This was forwarded to the Social Welfare Appeals Office and they have registered an appeal. As part of the appeal process, the application will be reviewed by a Medical Assessor who will take the new medical information into consideration.Carer's Allowance is a social assistance payment made to persons who are providing full time care and attention to elderly people or to people with disabilities and whose income falls below certain limits. Carer's Allowance may be payable in respect of a child under 16 years of age if DCA is in payment in respect of that child.On 20th April 2010 the person concerned was refused Carer's Allowance on the grounds that DCA is not in payment in respect of the care recipient. She was advised of this decision and of her right of appeal to the Social Welfare Appeal's Office.The Department has not received any application for respite care grant (RCG) in this case. An application form for RCG has been issued to the person in question.

As part of this consideration the Appeals Officer will determine if an oral hearing is warranted in this case.There has been a 46% increase in the number of appeals received by the Social Welfare Appeals Office in 2009 when compared to 2008, which in itself was 27% greater than the numbers received in 2007. There has been an increase of a further 58.8% in the number of appeals received to the end of June 2010. These increases have caused delays in the processing of appeals However, measures are being put in place to address these delays as I have previously informed the House.The Social Welfare Appeals Office functions independently of the Minister for Social Protection and of the Department and is responsible for determining appeals against decisions on social welfare entitlements.

It is important to stress that, at this stage, no decisions have been taken either by me or by the Government in this regard.The Government has already made difficult decisions in this regard and the next steps towards recovery will require further such decisions. At the moment, I am engaged in an intensive round of consultations with a wide range of welfare representative organisations and I am listening carefully to their views. In an uncertain international environment, my priority will be to ensure that the overall Government strategy is advanced and to protect those most in need in a manner which is sustainable in the years ahead.

The claim was disallowed as the person did not satisfy the habitual residence condition. She was notified of this decision in writing and given the right of appeal. No appeal was received.A further application was received in June 2009, and was again disallowed on the grounds that she did not satisfy the habitual residence condition. The decision was upheld on appeal. She was informed of the Appeals Officer's decision in a letter dated the 10 th of May 2010. There are no new facts or evidence that would warrant a review of this decision.As the family concerned all reside in Ireland and have no income from Belgium, the Child Benefit claim is processed under Irish Legislation.

Therefore, the social welfare entitlements of the former workers will not be affected as no money will be directly received. Instead funding is being channelled through the relevant State agencies and educational institutions to deliver the required supports to eligible redundant workers.In this way, workers being supported under the EGF may continue to receive welfare support while attending education or training courses under the Back to Education (BTEA) schemes operated by the Department of Social Protection. Subject to scheme criteria, BTEA participants attending an approved full-time course can continue to receive welfare support for the duration of that course (which may be a number of years). Those who participate in an approved part-time course can receive welfare support for as long as they would ordinarily be entitled to a jobseekers payment (9-12 months in the case of those on Jobseekers Benefit, or longer for those who qualify for the means-tested Jobseekers Allowance). These provisions equally apply to workers studying HETAC or FETAC accredited third level courses at private colleges.

It is a matter for the local partnership company to decide on the application and this decision has not yet been communicated to his Social Welfare Local Office.If his partnership company approves his work project, he may qualify for a short term enterprise allowance at the same rate as his jobseeker's benefit, from 28 June 2010 to 5 July 2010, which is the date on which his entitlement to benefit exhausted.It is open to him to apply for jobseeker's allowance and a form for this purpose was issued to him on 11 June 2010. However, it has not been returned. It is possible he may qualify for back to work enterprise allowance for up to 2 years, subject to him applying and qualifying for jobseeker's allowance.

Most overpayments arise as a result of a revised decision regarding entitlement.  The overpayment information for years 2004 to 2009 requested by the Deputy is setdown in the tabular statements attached. The figures for 2009 are provisional and are subject to audit by the Office of the C&AG.Overpayments arise as a result of fraud, failure by customers to report changes in their circumstances, and Departmental errors. Most overpayments are detected by control activities and claim reviews.  The overall goal of the Department in relation to debt management is to actively pursue the recovery of debt to maximise recovery levels, with due regard to value for money and with greater emphasis on recovery from people no longer dependant on welfare payments.The objectives are:To maximise the recovery of overpayments;To efficiently record, report and monitor the occurrence and recovery of   overpayments;To fulfil statutory, accounting and reporting obligationsTo conduct overpayment and debt management as efficiently as possible.Overpayments may be recovered by:withholding arrears due to the person;deduction from payments due to the person;payment of a lump sum by the person;regular payments by the person to the Department;recovery from the person's estate.The general approach is that the amount proposed would be the maximum repayment that the person can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.Most overpayments are recovered in instalments over a period of years, rather than in a single lump sum. The bulk of recoveries in any one year will relate to overpayments, which came to light in previous years.When determining the rate of recovery consideration would be given to the following:getting repayment as soon as possible;not causing undue hardship to the person;setting a rate that the person will agree to;any case made by the personThe general approach would be that the amount proposed would be the maximum repayment that the person can afford in order to recover the overpayment as quickly as possible.200420052006200720082009Vote SchemesValueValueValueValueValueValue€€€€€€Blind Pension22,5539,57531,66639,1164,15510,040Back to Work Allowance138,766119,58666,219103,111116,892119,477Back to Education Allowance18,41861,24048,089Child Benefit1,673,4551,967,6983,241,7822,489,3773,229,3215,979,412Carers Allowance713,7151,058,210883,662383,1292,046,4254,374,481Disability Allowance1,271,0992,166,5572,570,9762,524,9052,818,8272,781,558Deserted Wife’s Allowance3,45539,59032,24146,50313,973119,012Equal Treatment0000.000.000Early Childcare Supplement2,681.00-2,175.000Fuel Allowance50402,3702,3742,7604,698Farm Assist180,252292,159232,278179,562157,605138,237Family Income Supplement99,266163,344206,826123,234287,418922,622Guardian Payment Non Con58,201274,0143,530One Parent Family Payment22,768,40612,457,7708,366,8144,662,4278,626,6549,430,836Old Age Non Con Pension7,893,4256,824,8926,259,3037,441,3467,843,58311,696,381Part-time Job Allowance1567,8893503642,1391,872Pre-Retirement Allowance140,619160,252212,144153,781212,133164,050Rent Allowance0018,362355,60192,201185,256Second Level Allowance24,86036,21824,36540010,3105,098Single Woman’ s Allowance00001,4340Supplementary Welfare Allowance1,321,341989,7242,816,1832,382,2901,515,6751,911,496Third Level Allowance3,4940002,202500Unemployment Assistance7,669,2008,067,7158,480,49110,401,1098,914,2197,571,336Widow/er’s Non-Con.

Some customers may just stop collecting their payments and, in other instances, may simply state that they are signing off.Since 1971, those in receipt of jobseeker's benefit can transfer their payment to another EU country for a period not exceeding 13 weeks while they seek employment. Payment was made by the country to which the customer travelled to seek work and was reimbursed by this Department. New EU Regulations, introduced with effect from 1 st May 2010, allow for the continuation of payment for 13 weeks by this Department directly to the claimant while they are abroad. The jobseeker is subject to the control procedures operated by the Member State in which they are seeking work and the Department is notified if the customer is not adhering to these procedures.The table shows the number of transfers to date in 2010.MonthNumber of TransfersMaximum Value of TransfersJanuary4631,179,483February308784,623March4301,095,416April4251,082,679May353899,260June4441,131,081July (to 05/07/10)90229,273Total2,5136,401,817The value of transfers has been calculated by taking the personal daily rate for jobseeker's benefit and multiplying this by 78 (the maximum number of days for which the benefit can be transferred).

In order to ensure that the potential of information technology is maximised the Department procures external consultancy to assist with this work. The Department also engages consultants for work which comes within the definition of ‘consultancy' set out in Department of Finance guidelines i.e. where a person or organisation provides intellectual or knowledge based services (e.g. expert analysis and advice) through delivering reports, studies, assessments, recommendations, proposals, etc. that contribute to decision making or policy making.The information requested by the Deputy is set out in the table and includes all private consultancy firms used by the Department during the periods 1 January 2004 to date in 2010.It should be noted that the total expenditure on larger projects may be incurred over a period of one or more years.I am satisfied that spending on consultancy ensures that the Department is maximising its investments in information technology and on improving its service to customers.CONTRACTOR€PURPOSEBearingPoint Ireland Ltd.1,826,186Service Delivery Modernisation Programme Phase 2Hewlett Packard Ireland Ltd.383,782Migration of Service Delivery Modernisation Phase 1 to Microsoft.net platformGartner80,877Organisational Review of the Department’s Information Systems DivisionFujitsu Consulting72,771Service Delivery Modernisation Phase 1 Post Implementation SupportGartner55,055ISD ResearchPropylon42,380Support services in relation to Central Records System DevelopmentIBM Ireland Ltd.36,300Service Delivery Modernisation Phase 2 — Organisational change programmeSimilarity Systems Ltd.30,885Data Quality Audit on Customer Identity DataLansdowne Market Research Ltd.30,492Expenditure review of Atypical Working Arrangements in relation to the Unemployment SchemeAccourt Ltd.26,391Development work in relation to Public Service CardBT20,691Technical Support — GVPN (Networks)Qualbase Ltd.17,854Database support for Oracle Financials Application.First Impression Design16,335Paper on demographic, economic, social and other changes impacting family life.Peoplesoft UK Ltd.15,365Maintenance of HRMS Peoplesoft applicationGoodbody Economic Consultants13,310Social Housing Cost Review for SWA SchemeHewlett Packard Ireland Ltd.13,190Post implementation support for .NET Microsoft upgraded platform.James Doran & Associates Ltd.10,890Review of Dental Benefits SchemeFinglas Cabra Partnership Ltd.10,000Consultancy ResearchOracle EMEA Limited9,433Maintenance of Oracle Financials applicationCPL Solutions Ltd8,833Consultancy in relation to REACH ProjectPublic Appointments Service8,479Human Resources ConsultancyMr Robert Dowdall8,140Review of PRSI Benefit in Kind SchemeTechnical Guidance Ltd.7,926Report on Insurance and Introduction of Actuarial TablesOlivia O’Leary6,655Family Fora ReportTouchpaper Ireland Limited6,351Implementation of HelpDesk for Facilities ManagementEdward Delaney & Associates6,156Advice on DecentralisationThe Policy Institute5,396Synthesis Report on NGO submissions in relation to family policy.Open Interface ltd.5,055Consultancy in relation to Office of Social Inclusion (OSI) websiteCommunity & Enterprise Department5,000Research relating to FamiliesUna Ryan4,600ResearchQueen’s University4,590Family Fora ReportLandsdowne Market Research Ltd.3,872Review the Back-To-Work SchemeEconomic and Social Research Institute (ESRI)3,594ResearchRichard Pawson3,542Support on Service Delivery Modernisation Business Object Modernisation (BOM)Excellence Ireland2,985Q-Mark Mock AuditLAN Communications2,542Webmarshall Installation & ConsultancyBlue Wave Technology2,541Information Services Technical SupportMel Cousins2,178Methodological advice in relation to unemployment schemesCore Computer Consultants Ltd.1,742Maintenance on Corepay Salaries ApplicationMatheson Ormsby Prentice1,452Research on Occupational Pensions PolicyEircom1,392Anti Virus Consultancy ServicesDSP Global Ltd.1,215Consultancy in relation to Oracle financials application.Frank O’Brien1,210Preparation of CommentaryUCD1,120Families Research ProgrammeManagement Support Services (Ireland) Ltd.1,065Personnel investigationS.H.B.

They work in close co-operation with other agencies and service providers including FÁS, VEC, other education and training providers and the local and community and voluntary sector.  In addition they provide advice and support to customers who wish to access the back to education scheme, the back to work scheme, and the short term enterprise allowance scheme of the department.The facilitator service is available locally to all social welfare recipients via the local network. Facilitators are assigned to cover a geographical area.  They hold open clinics and meet with people who have been referred either by the social welfare local office, the employment support section or by other agencies.The service was enhanced under the National Development Plan (NDP) Social and Economic Participation Programme. Additional facilitators have been appointed during 2009 and 2010.  It is envisaged that there will be 70 facilitator posts provided for under the Plan. There are currently 63 serving facilitators covering 61.4 facilitator posts.

For example, means assessments are required for all of the social assistance schemes, customers must also satisfy the habitual residency conditions, and medical examinations are required for some of the illness-related schemes. In the case of insurance-based schemes, it may be necessary to ascertain details of foreign insurance records.It should also be noted that many factors outside the Department's control can impact upon claim processing times, e.g. the supply of relevant information by the customer, employers, other EU countries or other third parties.While every effort is made to decide on entitlement for any individual person as close to their eligibility date as possible, there are cases where delays will necessarily be experienced. In situations where customers find themselves suffering financial hardship while awaiting such a decision, the facility to receive supplementary welfare allowance funded by the Department and administered by the Health Service Executive is available. In May 2010, more than 96% of basic SWA applications were decided on and paid within a week.The table shows the processing times from January 2010 to May 2010. The statistics for June have not yet been finalised.

This number was previously known as the Revenue and Social Insurance (RSI) number. The name was changed to indicate the broadening of its role to one which supports delivery of a broader range of public services but it is also still used for its original core purpose of providing a common identifier for the Revenue Commissioners and this Department.As well as facilitating wider-scale exchange of information, the PPS number also has a role in the development of on-line services for individuals. The Department provides identity related services to a number of agencies in accordance with legislation.The overall Government strategy is to realise the potential of the Information Society through innovation and modernisation of public services. As part of this, the Standard Authentication Framework Environment (SAFE) programme, co-chaired by this Department and the Department of Finance, provides the basis for a consistent set of registration and authentication services for customer interaction with public services. The Revenue Commissioners are represented on this group.Under the SAFE programme, the Department is developing a Public Services Card (PSC), to replace the existing Social Services Card. The aim is to develop a card that acts as a key for access to public services in general, identifying and authenticating individuals as appropriate and where required. The necessary legislative provisions were included in the 2007 Social Welfare and Pensions Act. The development project for the PSC commenced in January 2010 and is scheduled to complete by the end of the year.In December 2008, the Department and the Revenue Commissioners signed a Memorandum of Understanding with the purpose of improving and intensifying the levels and scope of existing policy, consultative, administrative and operational co-operative arrangements between them. The Department and the Revenue Commissioners recognize the necessity for clear and unambiguous communication and consultation on any policy, legislative, administrative, operational and modernization proposals which may have implications for either organization. This will include, for example, proposals being brought forward in the context of, inter alia, the Budget, Finance Act(s), Social Welfare Act(s), and national social partnership agreements.In addition to continuing with meetings at every level, in 2010 the Department and Revenue Commissioners also formally established a high-level steering group to consider the range of interactions between the two organisations and to propose and implement improvements to those interactions.The Department will continue to explore on the basis of these ongoing developments how greater data and money transfer efficiencies could be realized in the future.

The Strategy will set out actions under way and proposed further actions to protect vulnerable households with a view to ensuring that existing and future measures are targeted at households where the risk of energy poverty is greatest.As part of its work, the Group was asked to make recommendations as to the precise package of measures, including in the area of income support that should be put in place to assist those at risk of fuel poverty. These recommendations will be considered as part of the overall strategy to deal with energy affordability which will include supports for low income households.

The processing times for appeals is taken as the time between date of receipt and date of finalisation. Appeals not yet finalised are not counted.I am informed by the Social Welfare Appeals Office that there are currently 21,718 appeals awaiting decision. There has been a significant growth in the number of appeals over the past couple of years with an expected intake of some 35,000 in 2010 compared with around 15,000 per annum up to and including 2007.While this growth is clearly impacting on processing times, it must also be remembered that such processing times cover all phases of the appeal process including the submission by the Department of its comments on the grounds for the appeal, further examination by the Department's Medical Assessors in certain illness related cases, further investigation by Social Welfare Inspectors, where required, and circumstances may also arise where further information is sought from the appellant. Delays can also occur where the appellant submits new information or evidence, often at an advanced stage in the proceedings. In some cases adjournments may be sought by the appellants or their representatives.A number of initiatives are currently underway designed to enhance the capacity of the office to deal with the current caseload and inflows. In that regard:2 additional Appeals Officers were assigned to the Office in 2009,A number of additional staff are being assigned to the administration area of the Office,The organisation of the Appeals Officer's work has been changed so as to increase productivity,A project to improve the business processes in the office is underway and a number of improvements have already been implemented, andSignificant enhancements are being made to the office's IT and phone systems.Notwithstanding these measures, it is clear that additional staff are required in the short term to address the backlog that has developed. It has been decided to use experienced retired staff strictly on a short term basis to supplement the current resources and the services of eight retired officers have now been secured on a part-time basis.

In addition, there are 9 civilian staff employed at the barracks.  I am advised that total direct expenditure on upgrading and maintenance of the property between 2000 and July 2010 was in the region of €4.5 million.The Department and the Defence Forces continually review Defence Forces requirements in relation to barracks, infrastructure and other military installations.  Properties deemed surplus to requirements are disposed of and the proceeds are invested in the ongoing modernisation of the Defence Forces.  There are, however, no plans to alter the current status of Kickham Barracks, at this time.

I recently made the necessary regulations bringing the scheme into operation from 14 June 2010.The Regulations allow incremental purchase arrangements to be applied to new housing units, including unsold affordable houses in approved circumstances, with the following exceptions:dwellings that had not been designated for incremental purchase at the time the dwelling was allocated to a household in need of social housing support;dwellings specifically designed for occupation by older persons;dwellings specifically designed for members of the travelling community in a group setting;dwellings transferred to local authorities under section 96 of the Planning & Development Act 2000 for the purposes of providing social housing, andcaravans, mobile homes or structures capable of being moved.It is a matter for each individual housing authority to determine which of its housing units, in accordance with the Regulations, it will make available for sale under the scheme.Houses sold by housing authorities and approved bodies under the scheme will have been provided by the authority or body through their main construction/acquisition programme which is fully funded by the State through annual capital allocations.  There will therefore be no monies outstanding to the housing authority or approved body on sale other than the monies due to be paid by the purchaser.

For these sites the derogation by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, has now expired.The land owned by the individual in question was designated as a Natural Heritage Area, and, as such, is not within those sites. Therefore, this purchase does not qualify for priority treatment this year.

The legislation provides that the EPA may impose conditions on a licence relating to the operation of facility, including requirements in relation to the closure, restoration, remediation and aftercare of the facility. The EPA is entitled to seek the necessary financial provisions, including the use of a bond or other form of security that will ensure the waste licence holder can meet the obligations of the licence. There are no specific provisions in the waste legislation providing for the taking over of a landfill where the licensee has gone into liquidation.Waste legislation provides for a number of methods of dealing with environmental protection issues arising on sites where waste is held, recovered or disposed of. The EPA can issue a notice requiring the waste licence holder to carry out specified measures to limit environmental pollution at the site or can carry out operations itself to prevent or limit the pollution from waste sites, with costs recouped through the courts. The EPA can also apply to the High Court seeking specified measures to be carried out in cases where the holding, recovering or disposal of waste is causing environmental pollution.The European Communities (Environmental Liability) Regulations 2008 (S.I. No. 547 of 2008) transpose the EU Environmental Liability Directive into Irish law.  The EPA, as competent authority for the Directive and Regulations, may as a means of last resort exercise its discretion to take remedial measures itself where environmental damage has occurred in circumstances where an operator fails to comply with his or her obligations to take the remedial measures.  The Regulations apply to occupational activities including the operation of landfill sites.The Environmental Liability Regulations came into effect on 1 April 2009 and do not apply to damage caused by an emission, event or incident which took place before 1 April 2009 or derive from a specific activity that took place and finished before 1 April 2009.

This is on condition that the overall staffing levels in the sector are reduced significantly by the end of 2010 in adherence with the Government's Policy on Staffing and Numbers in the Public Sector.The FÁS Work Placement Programme is a work experience programme to assist people who are unemployed to retain their skills levels and/or secure work experience that will assist them in getting a job. It is a condition of the programme that any such placements should not displace an existing member of staff or be used to fill a vacant post (the provider of the work placement has to sign a declaration to this effect). The placement of individuals under the Programme is not affected by the moratorium on recruitment in the public service.While notifications under this programme from various local authorities have been received by my Department, to date none have been received from South Dublin County Council.However, South Dublin County Council has successful experience of previous placement programmes, especially the Community Employment Scheme targeted at people who are long term unemployed.  It is understood that the Council is currently examining the placing of individuals under the FAS Work Placement Programme, under which it is envisaged that the Council will address new areas of work that will make a positive difference to the community and the environment. Preliminary discussions have taken place between South Dublin County Council, FAS and other Government Departments in relation to implementation.

This funding assists such organisations in the delivery of housing objectives and services. Funding is also provided through the Irish Environmental Network for ecological, environmental non-governmental organisations in respect of core activities, capacity building, research, training and participation in social partnership (the Environment Pillar of social partnership was established formally in 2009).In addition, under the various national social partnership agreements, workplace partnership was introduced and implemented successfully in the local government sector.  To assist in this process, funding was provided on an annual basis at central level to the Local Authority National Workplace Partnership Group (LANPAG) that is comprised of management, trade union and Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government representatives.  The disbursement of this funding is overseen by four trustees who recommend to LANPAG funding allocations for a range of initiatives in the sector, and LANPAG in turn approves these recommendations as appropriate.

As part of that circular, proposals from previous capital programmes which had not received tender approval were withdrawn. A proposal for a new library headquarters for Kilkenny had been in place for some time but had not progressed in part due to lack of a suitable site.As a result, no funding had been allocated to the provision of a new library in Kilkenny prior to the announcement on 5 July, 2010 of €350,000 in 2011 for a central library in Kilkenny City. This will form part of the 2010-2011 Libraries Capital Programme.

The Department's role is one of supporting and assisting local authorities in delivering fire services through setting of general policy and the provision of funding under the fire service capital programme.Following a request by my Department, in autumn 2008, Kilkenny County Council indicated that its priorities under the fire services capital programme were the construction of new fire stations at Castlecomer, Graiguenamanagh and Urlingford respectively.In June 2010 a new two-bay fire station, funded by my Department, was opened in Castlecomer.The proposal by the Council to build a new two bay fire station in Graiguenamanagh was approved in principle under the 2008 Fire Service Capital Programme. In November 2009, my Department approved the Council's proposal to appoint consultants to prepare detailed design and tender documents, and these are now awaited.Proposals to replace the existing single bay station in Urlingford will be considered under future capital programmes within the constraints of available resources having regard to the fire authority's priorities, the spread of existing facilities and demand from other fire authorities for available funding.

The number of boarded up houses held by local authorities continuously fluctuates as houses become vacant and are remediated, re-let or demolished.  Information, other than that made available through annual Local Authority Service Indicator Reports, is not collected on the number of such houses.
#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1243	Local authorities operate a range of housing supports, including support involving the voluntary and cooperative sector, for households with varying degrees of need, from the most vulnerable and disadvantaged households, including homeless people and people with disabilities, to middle income households whose needs may be more modest. The various supports available are detailed on my Department's website, www.environ.ie.I am determined to ensure that the schemes in place are framed in a manner which continues to optimise delivery of supports to the households who must need them.  To achieve this, it is essential to tailor available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions, and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities .
To these ends, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded. For example, last year I announced the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which I expect a substantial number of dwellings to be provided to meet housing needs.   This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme, complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1244	The issue of pyrite was brought to the attention of my Department in mid-2007. Having consulted the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Body, my Department issued a circular letter (Ref. BC 6/2007) to each county manager and local building control authority on 16 August 2007 to bring this matter to their notice and to request co-operation in the enforcement of the relevant requirements set out in the circular.  The circular also brought to their attention a notice issued by Fingal County Council on 26 July 2007 on this matter.Following an intervention from my Department, the National Standards Authority of Ireland (NSAI) published a new amended Standard Recommendation on the use of aggregates as infill for civil engineering and road construction work.  The new Standard Recommendation came into effect on 7 December 2007 and it is intended to address the quality standards of new homes and buildings insofar as problems relating to pyrite are concerned.  My Department incorporated this NSAI Standard Recommendation into the relevant Technical Guidance Document (TGD-C) of the Building Regulations.  A copy of the relevant amendment to TGD-C is available on my Department's website at www.environ.ie.   My Department has also notified Local Authorities, the Construction Industry Federation, the Irish Home Builders' Association and other key stakeholders of the provisions of the amended TGD-C. In addition, I am aware that HomeBond has included the amended NSAI Standard Recommendation in their published 6th edition of the House Building Manual.  I am satisfied that the measures outlined represent an appropriate response by my Department to this issue.Responsibility for compliance with the Building Regulations is a matter for the owner or builder of a building. Enforcement of the Building Regulations is the responsibility of individual Building Control Authorities which are empowered to carry out inspections and initiate enforcement proceedings, where considered necessary.  The resolution of problems arising between building owners and builders is a matter for the parties concerned, namely the building owner, the relevant developer and the builder's insurers. Where the construction of a building is the subject of a contract between the client and the builder enforcement is a civil matter.Compliance with the building regulations is kept under constant review by my Department. The Building Regulations Advisory Body, which was established under the 1990 Building Control Act to advise me on matters relating to building regulations, has submitted a report on enforcement of the regulations.  This document will be an important input to my Department's ongoing consideration of the building regulations regime.

On the basis of the EAG's own analysis and its consideration and assessment of the proposals and submissions received from the public and interested groups, the group finalised a new Tentative List, which was approved by me and submitted to UNESCO. The new Tentative List was publicly announced by me in April 2010.Some 54 submissions were received during the public consultation period on the draft of the new Tentative List.  Each property on the draft list was re-examined by the EAG with regard to the submissions received and the UNESCO Tentative List Submission Format. Following this re-examination, the EAG did not propose any changes as regards the properties included on the draft list other than to recommend a change in the title of the Dublin property to "The Historic City of Dublin".Consideration of conservation and other relevant issues will take place during the preparatory stage of any proposed nomination of a property on the Tentative List for inscription on the World Heritage List.With regard to Cashel, my Department is aware that the Office of Public Works is engaged in a major conservation project at Cormac's Chapel. A temporary roof and access scaffold has been erected over the chapel to facilitate the investigation of the roof and water damage. This roof will allow the chapel to dry out and conservation and repair works to be carried out.  Re- pointing of masonry, securing of walls and a general programme of maintenance are at present being carried out by the Office of Public Works.

The total funding involved in block grant allocations was nearly €85 million and a list showing the overall allocation to each Council is available in the Oireachtas Library.These block grant allocations cover both funding for group water and sewerage schemes and small public water and sewerage schemes.  The major part of the funding for the group sector is directed at investment required under the Rural Water Action Plan developed to improve drinking water supplies in response to an adverse ruling against Ireland by the European Court of Justice.Responsibility for the administration of the Rural Water Programme has been devolved to local authorities since 1997.  The selection and approval of individual group sewerage schemes for advancement under the programme, within the overall priorities set by my Department and subject to the block grant allocation provided, is a matter for the water services authorities.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	The Government, largely through the Radiological Protection Institute of Ireland (RPII), has, for many years now, worked towards assessing the extent of the radon problem throughout the country. Between 1992 and 1999 the RPII carried out a comprehensive National Radon Survey to measure radon concentrations in Irish homes. The principal objective was to identify the scale of the radon problem in Ireland and areas at higher risk of radon contamination above the National Reference Level of 200 becquerels per metre cubed (Bq/m3). Over 40,900 homes have now been measured for radon by the RPII. The results of these tests have been compiled into a central database, which has greatly aided our knowledge and understanding as to the extent of Ireland's radon problem. A summary of the number of homes measured and the number of houses in categories of radon concentration is included in the table below for the last three years. In 2007, the RPII introduced a protocol advising a graded approach in responding to reported average radon concentrations in homes above the national Reference Level.  This protocol is summarised as follows:Homes (Bq/m3)Proposed Actions< 200Write to customer advising no action is needed.>200Write to customer recommending remedial action is taken.>800As above and phone customer.>2,000As above and issue public statement.>4,000As above and take local public awareness action. Engage with other statutory agencies and local authority.Prior to 2007 there was no formal graded approach.The Government's approach to radon, which is similar to that of the majority of EU Member States, is to concentrate efforts on increasing public awareness of the risks posed by radon in the home. Householders, particularly those in known high radon areas, have been strongly encouraged by the RPII to have their homes tested for radon and to undertake remediation works where necessary.Furthermore, the RPII have carried out targeted information campaigns in high radon areas and in some instances where areas of particularly high radon levels have been found they have written directly to householders in these areas. This will continue to be the focus so as to enable and encourage householders to address monitoring and remedial requirements effectively and economically.If a dwelling is found to have a high radon level remediation work may be recommended. Technical guidance on radon remediation techniques is available in a booklet issued by my Department: Radon in Buildings — Corrective Option. The RPII has also issued guidance: Understanding Radon Remediation — A Householders Guide. In addition, the website of the RPII provides a list of companies who can provide a radon remediation service and can offer specific advice and recommendations.Members of the public can access information on radon on the RPII website, www.rpii.ie. Publications and information leaflets about radon can be downloaded free of charge. The RPII can also be contacted on freephone 1800 300 600.Summary statistics for the years 2007, 2008, 2009 and 2010.YearNumber of homes measuredNo. of homes < 200 Bq/m3

In accordance with the requirements of the Water Framework Directive these plans set out environmental objectives to be achieved and measures to be implemented to protect and improve our waters.  The plans, which have been developed through river basin district projects funded by my Department, provide a blueprint for improving and restoring waters in each river basin district.Since 2007 I have strengthened the legislative framework for the protection of waters.  I introduced the Waste Water Discharge (Authorisation) Regulations which require local authorities to obtain discharge licences from the EPA for wastewater treatment plants. The licences impose emission limits on wastewater discharges, compliance with which is overseen by the EPA.  In 2009 I revised the Nitrates Regulations in order to provide for better farmyard management and to strengthen enforcement provisions. I have also introduced regulations to transpose the revised Bathing Water Directive, to transpose the Groundwater Directive, and to further transpose the Water Framework Directive.  I intend bringing proposals to Government later this year to provide for a new system for monitoring and inspecting the performance of septic tanks and other on-site waste water treatment systems.The Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, a copy of which is available in the Oireachtas Library, which I published in April 2010, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure.  An Exchequer provision of €508 million has been made available this year to fund the ongoing provision of water services infrastructure under this Programme and the Rural Water Programme.  The new programme builds on the achievements already secured through the €2.7 billion which has been invested by the Exchequer in major public waste water schemes between 2000 and 2009.  In 2000, 25% of urban wastewater discharges were in compliance with the end of 2005 requirement under the Urban Waste Water Treatment Directive — to subject discharges from agglomerations of a population equivalent of 2,000 (in the case of fresh or estuarial waters) or 10,000 (in the case of coastal waters), as appropriate, to secondary treatment prior to discharge. Compliance has now risen to some 92%, with all remaining non-compliant agglomerations included in my Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012.The Water Services Investment Programme aims to prioritise projects that target environmental compliance issues and has been aligned with priorities identified in River Basin Management Plans. It also fully supports economic and employment growth.These measures, together, are a clear statement of the priority which the Government is giving to preserving and protecting our water resources.

In keeping with this strategy, the reform programme, now well underway in my Department, involves a re-balancing from construction/acquisition, and a one size fits all approach to meeting social housing needs, towards a more graduated system of supports. This re-balancing, in policy and financial terms, is rooted in the clearly articulated rationale set out in the Government's housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities.While the allocations for 2010 show a reduction in the provision for the main traditional local authority programme, of some 50%, I anticipate that, through more flexible market based delivery mechanisms such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and long term leasing, as well as the significant increase in funding available under the Capital Assistance Scheme in 2010 to €145m, and the availability from the second half of 2010 of a direct lending facility from the Housing Finance Agency to approved housing bodies, delivery across the range of social housing measures this year will maintain the momentum built up over recent years.

While ensuring that we can deliver across the full range of needs, the scale and composition of the public housing programme in the years ahead will be dependent on a number of factors, including the level of available funding and the evolution of the housing market generally.I am determined to ensure that the programme is framed in a manner which continues to optimise the delivery of social housing.  To achieve this it is essential to tailor available Exchequer supports to prevailing market conditions and explore alternative solutions to address housing needs, having full regard to the sustainable communities philosophy outlined in the Government's housing policy statement Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities .
To these ends, the range of delivery mechanisms continues to be adapted and expanded.  Last year, I announced the introduction of a new Social Housing Leasing Initiative, through which I expect a substantial number of dwellings to be provided in the years ahead, to meet housing needs estimated at just over 56,000 households in the 2008 Housing Needs Assessment. This, together with the Rental Accommodation Scheme (RAS), complements the traditional capital funded programmes operated through local authorities and the voluntary and co-operative housing sector.An amendment to Part V through the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill 2009, to allow local authorities take units under RAS or lease arrangements, will provide a further option for maximising supply through these more flexible sources.  I will be keeping the leasing initiative and all the other housing programmes under ongoing review to ensure that they are appropriately geared towards meeting the maximum level of housing need.

Staffing and organisational arrangements for the purposes of carrying out the functions of fire authorities are matters for the relevant city or county manager under section 159 of the Local Government Act, 2001. My Department supports the local fire authorities through setting of general policy, the provision of capital funding, training support and issue of guidance on operational and other related matters. Fire Services will continue to be developed having regard to service priorities, the need to maximise effectiveness and efficiency, and taking account of the resources available.

Where my Department provides funding for local authority sewerage schemes in urban areas, these schemes may, on occasion, provide limited measures to prevent flooding where inadequate collection networks exist.  These schemes may also provide storm water drains and outfalls, to facilitate the separation of foul and surface water, to create additional capacity within existing combined systems.In addition, in partnership with the Office of Public Works, my Department published Guidelines for Planning Authorities on the Planning System and Flood Risk Management in November 2009 with the aim of ensuring a more consistent, rigorous and systematic approach to flood risk identification, assessment and management within the planning system.  These statutory guidelines provide the basis for planning authorities to identify, assess and take appropriate steps to manage flood risk in a sustainable manner.

It is a matter for each local authority to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the individual schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them by my Department, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within their allocation.The overall level of Exchequer funding sought by Local Authorities for spending in 2010 was €92.650 million. On the basis of the January returns from the local authorities, some 13,000 applications had been submitted for approval under the suite of Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability, of which some 4,430 relate to adaptation works to meet the needs of persons with a disability.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1256	Provision is made in my Department's Vote for 2010 for capital expenditure by local authorities and others of some €1.509 billion this year, including €880 million in respect of housing and €508 million for water services. Work is proceeding on the planning, construction and financing of investment projects across these programmes so as to secure maximum benefit from the resources employed.In terms of the Social Housing Investment Programme, while the allocations for 2010 show a reduction in provision for the traditional local authority programme, I anticipate that, through more flexible market-based delivery mechanisms (such as the Rental Accommodation Scheme and long term leasing), as well as the  funding available under the Capital Assistance Scheme in 2010 and the availability, from the second half of this year, of a direct lending facility from the Housing Finance Agency to approved housing bodies, delivery across the range of social housing measures this year will allow the momentum built up over recent years to be maintained.My Department's Water Services Investment Programme 2010-2012, which is available in the Oireachtas Library, provides for the development of a comprehensive range of new water services infrastructure. The timing of the commencement of projects within the 2010-2012 period is a matter for the local authorities and I would encourage them to expedite the progression of contracts. In developing the Programme, a review was undertaken of all schemes listed in the previous programme on which there had been limited progress over the previous two years to ensure that those proceeding under the new Programme are aligned with the prioritised economic and environmental objectives set out for 2010-2012. Schemes that did not rate sufficiently for inclusion in the 2010-2012 Programme were those that did not feature as highly as others on public health, environmental compliance or economic grounds.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1258	I propose to take Questions Nos. 532 and 533 together.The monitoring, assessment and management of ambient air quality in Ireland is carried out according to the requirements of the EU Air Quality Framework Directive. This Directive was transposed into Irish law through the Environmental Protection Agency Act 1992 (Ambient Air Quality Assessment and Management) Regulations 1999. Under further regulations made in 2002, 2004 and 2009, specific ambient air quality standards have been prescribed for the following pollutants:  sulphur dioxide, nitrogen dioxide and oxides of nitrogen, particulate matter and lead  (2002); carbon monoxide and benzene (2002); ozone (2004); and polyaromatic hydrocarbons, arsenic, nickel, cadmium and mercury in ambient air (2009).The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has responsibility for the monitoring of Irish air quality. The EPA continually monitors a range of atmospheric pollutants via a network of air quality monitoring stations located around the country.  The EPA reports the results of the air quality monitoring of the above pollutants on its website at: http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/ monitoring/air/data/. My Department keeps these data under ongoing review to identify any significant trends which might emerge and also meets periodically with the EPA on air quality issues.Where the indicative level for any pollutant is exceeded, the Air Quality Standards Regulations 2002 require the local authority concerned, following notification by the EPA, to develop a long-term air quality management plan to ensure compliance with the thresholds for the relevant pollutant or pollutants.  The main air pollutants that could be associated with the recent volcanic ash plume would be sulphur dioxide (SO2) and particulate matter, or dust, with a diameter less than 10µm (PM10). Monitoring data has shown no increase in either PM10 or SO2 levels as a result of the volcanic ash cloud.As a precautionary measure, the EPA increased its air quality monitoring activity for the duration of the ash cloud event and monitored the situation on an hourly basis. Data from monitoring stations was transmitted to the EPA website in real-time and can also be viewed at http://www.epa.ie/whatwedo/monitoring/air/data/.The EPA also publishes a comprehensive annual report on air quality, the most recent being the report on Air Quality in Ireland 2008 (September 2009). This report provides an overview of ambient air quality trends in Ireland in 2008 based on data from 30 monitoring stations and a further 18 stations operated by local authorities to measure black smoke. The Report confirmed that air quality was generally good at monitoring stations throughout the country, with pollution levels in larger cities highest at traffic influenced sites, and with the burning of coal and solid fuels being the most significant factor in smaller urban areas. All monitored levels met required EU and national standards.As part of a commitment on monitoring air quality made under the 2007 Programme for Government my Department requested the EPA to undertake an overall review of the adequacy of the air quality monitoring network in light of population change in urban areas.  The review has now been completed and a report of its findings is currently being finalised by the EPA.

This includes 7 voluntary repossessions.  While repossession by a local authority is a last resort, where it does occur it is related to the non-payment of a local authority mortgage, rather than to house type or category of ownership (e.g. affordable home, shared ownership, tenant purchase etc.). The table below therefore sets out the total repossessions carried out in relation to houses purchased with a local authority mortgage.A majority of affordable homes have been purchased using loan finance obtained from private lenders.

The adoption of individual development contribution schemes is a reserved function of the locally elected members of each planning authority.  It is a matter for the members to determine the level of contribution and the types of development to which they will apply.In order to stay within the General Government Balance (GGB) limit for the sector, it is necessary for local authorities to manage their finances and to maintain their current and capital accounts broadly in balance.  Subject to this general requirement, there is no prohibition on Councils spending development contributions.Each planning authority is required to include details of contributions received in that year, together with information on how the contributions have been expended, in the statutory annual accounts of the authority.  A new requirement was introduced for the financial year 2008 to include details in the annual financial statement of all accrued uncollected levies due to the planning authority.The total debtor figures supplied by the Local Authorities to the end of year 2008 amounted to €495 million.  Information on the amount of development contributions due to planning authorities to the end of year 2009, will be available in March 2011, following a full audit by the Local Government Audit Service during the audit cycle 2010-2011.As with all local charges, the invoicing and collection of any outstanding development contributions is a matter for the local authority concerned to manage in the light of prevailing local circumstances and in accordance with normal accountancy procedures. Where any payments required in respect of development contributions are not settled, such payments may be pursued by the planning authority through the courts as a contract debt.

I am satisfied that appropriate powers and resources are available to these enforcement authorities.The 2005 report of the OEE, The Nature and Extent of Unauthorised Waste Activity in Ireland, identified the unauthorised collection and fly-tipping of waste as a problem area which needed to be further tackled. The extent of fly-tipping is not, however, quantified in the report. The report drew attention to the measures already being taken, including the appointment of some one hundred and twenty additional enforcement officers across the local authorities which continue to be funded by my Department, and the stepped up enforcement activity generally being led by the OEE and the local authorities. South Tipperary County Council is paid an annual grant of €58,000 to support the employment of additional enforcement officers.The 2005 OEE Report also identified additional actions which would further support the effort to stamp out this socially and environmentally unacceptable practice, such as a "man in the van" advertisement campaign and use of covert cameras. Non-routine actions are now commonplace, and include vehicle checkpoints and use of CCTV cameras for identification of offenders at fly-tipping hot spots.  The implementation of these actions is coordinated on an ongoing basis by the OEE through its National Enforcement Network.Ministerial policy directions under section 60 of the Waste Management Act 1996 were issued in 2005 and 2008 to the waste enforcement authorities to encourage an intensification of action against illegal waste activity and to ensure the effective use of sanctions in this area.In 2008, there were 19,269 routine litter patrol investigations, 27,825 on the spot fines issued and 608 litter prosecutions. In addition, 12,000 non-litter waste complaints inspections and a further 2,434 other inspections for fly-tipping waste, burning or other surveillance purposes were undertaken by the local authorities. There were 8,151 waste enforcement notices issued and 695 prosecutions initiated but a breakdown as to how many of these related to fly-tipping is not available.  Overall, this represents a very significant quantum of enforcement, consistent with the findings of the OEE's Focus on Environmental Enforcement in Ireland, covering the period 2006 to 2008.

The work of the group is ongoing and a decision on the future use of the site, taking account of the group's work will be a necessary input into the determination of the approach to the site's remediation.

For example, Fáilte Ireland‘s Survey of Travellers 2008 estimates that up to €2.3 billion was generated for the Irish economy from overseas tourists who engaged in cultural and heritage pursuits. Fáilte Ireland's Overseas Holidaymakers Survey 2008 shows that 67% of overseas visitors engaged in historical/cultural visits while 23% visited gardens. In the same year, 26% of domestic holidaymakers visited national parks, 25% visited houses/castles, 20% visited gardens, and 15% visited heritage/interpretative centres.

The Guidelines recommend that applicants demonstrate roots or links to such areas within the local need criteria set out in the development plan in order to facilitate a positive approach to applications from such persons in areas where an application might have to be ordinarily refused.The Guidelines recommend a seven-year occupancy condition period for a dwelling.  Nonetheless, within this period, it is open to the dwelling owner, with the consent of the planning authority, to sell the house to another person who would satisfy the local need criteria for the area.The Guidelines further recommend that lending institutions should not be bound by occupancy conditions if they foreclose on a mortgage and wish to sell the property.  As it would be questionable whether a lending institution would advance funding if in any way restricted in the event of foreclosure, exempting lending institutions from occupancy conditions is intended not to put obstacles in the way of persons who wish to source funding to build a house because of a separate statutory condition which may arise in a planning context.While the enforcement of such planning conditions is a matter for each planning authority, having regard to national policy, I understand that planning authorities consider requests for non-enforcement of occupancy conditions on a case-by-case basis from dwelling owners who are in compelling situations for the sale of their dwelling.

In excess of 2,000 applications and/or expressions of interest have been received over the intervening years.All offers to purchase by my Department are subject to contract. Delays have occurred as a result of the need for surveys, examination of title and the large number of applications dealt with.  My Department has paid out in the region of €23 million since 1999 in completed purchases.The future of the voluntary bog purchase scheme is currently under consideration along with a range of alternative and complementary measures to address the impact of the end of the ten-year derogation on turf-cutting within the limited number of bogs involved. No new applications are currently being invited.  However, it is intended to process applications already on hand.  Having regard to available budgetary resources, priority is now being given to those who have applied to sell their interest in the 32 raised bog sites which were nominated for designation as Special Areas of Conservation between 1997 and 1999. For these sites the derogation by the Government, which allowed the continuation of turf cutting for personal domestic use, has now expired.

Under the terms of the Public Service Agreement (PSA), pay reductions which took effect in January 2010 are currently disregarded for the purposes of calculating superannuation benefits. Accordingly, the salary on which benefits are based may currently exceed the actual salary payable at the time of retirement.A Secretary General who is required by the terms of his or her contract to retire on reaching the age of 60 is entitled to a special severance gratuity of six months salary on the terms specified in sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963. These terms are subject to the application of special abatement provisions if the Secretary General concerned subsequently obtains employment in the public sector.One Secretary General and two Assistant Secretaries have retired from my Department since 2005. Their lump sums were calculated in accordance with  the Civil Service Superannuation Scheme. The total gross lump sums paid in these three cases amounted to €818,866 including a special severance gratuity of €100,589. Retirement lump sums ranged from 148% to 150% of the salary on which superannuation benefits are based.

The timing of enablement of individual EDs is an operational matter for 3.

The EU Commission has recently embarked on a public consultation process aimed at looking at whether this should be extended to include universal access to broadband.In Ireland we aim to achieve full access to broadband through a combination of market forces and targeted Government intervention.The provision of broadband services here is in the first instance a matter for private sector service providers operating in Ireland's fully liberalised telecommunications market.  Broadband services are provided by private service providers over various platforms including DSL (i.e. over telephone lines), fixed wireless, mobile, cable, fibre and satellite.  In cases of market failure the Government will intervene, where it is appropriate and possible to do so.The Group Broadband Scheme, National Broadband Scheme and the planned Rural Broadband Scheme are examples of where Government has intervened to ensure broadband availability in areas, particularly rural ones, where commercial investors have failed to provide services.Once the NBS has been fully rolled out in October next all parts of Ireland will have broadband availability.  This is some three years ahead of the target date set by the EU Commission in its "Digital Agenda". A planned Rural Broadband Scheme to be rolled out next year will aim to cover any remaining rural, non-NBS premises that cannot currently avail of a broadband service.I will also consider the enactment of legislation that would provide for broadband as a right for all citizens of Ireland.

They also advised that on review of a sample of 10 projects that are less than 5MW, the average capital expenditure is now on average €1.824m/MW.In March 2009 the EWEA published a document entitled "The Economics of Wind Energy.' which notes the various European costs in 2006 terms, totalling €1.227m per MW.Costs of development will always vary between markets, depending on geographic location of a windfarm, distance between the wind farm and the available grid connection point, meeting grid code compliance costs as well as local construction rates, etc.Given the rate of development in the Irish market in recent years, virtually all of the main turbine manufacturers are active in our market and there is keen and noticeable competition between them in the sector. Many developers and industry consultants in the Irish market now operate internationally and have direct experience of building plant in many different markets. This means that they are well placed to experience and judge component prices in any development they are planning.

Under the auspices of the Department of Environment ‘Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Wind Energy Development' various Planning Authorities/County Councils have prepared their own ‘Wind Energy Strategies'.  I am fully supportive of local, regional and county involvement in furthering renewable energy development and in the incorporation of renewable energy into relevant plans, with those bodies receiving as much appropriate guidance and information as possible.It is the case that measured wind data in the possession of the energy state companies engaged in developing renewable energy projects would be deemed to be commercially sensitive and its release to local and regional authorities would be a matter for the companies concerned.In relation to the specific concerns raised about the accuracy of certain data in the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's Wind Atlas. I have asked my Department to take up these concerns further with the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), with a view to forwarding you a direct response from SEAI.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1284	Directive 2009/28/EC on the promotion of the use of energy from renewable sources establishes the basis for the achievement of the EU's 20% renewable energy target by 2020.  Under the terms of the Directive, each Member State is set an individually binding renewable energy target, which will contribute to the achievement of the overall EU goal.The Directive requires each Member State to adopt a national renewable energy action plan to be submitted to the European Commission by 30 June 2010.  These plans are to set out Member States' national targets for the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport, electricity and heating and cooling in 2020, taking into account the effects of other policy measures relating to energy efficiency on final consumption of energy.A European Commission Decision (C(2009)5174) of 30 June 2009 established a template  for National Renewable Energy Action Plans  under Directive 2009/28/EC. The purpose of the template is to ensure that the national plans are complete, cover all the requirements laid down in the Directive and are comparable with each other and future Member State biannual reports on the implementation of the Directive.Ireland's National Renewable Energy Action Plan is being finalised in accordance with the established template.  A targeted consultation on the plan was carried out via the Renewable Energy Development Group, which is chaired by my Department.  A number of meetings of the group were convened at which this plan was the main topic of discussion.  Initial draft text relating to section 4 was issued on a section by section basis to the members of the group and feedback was requested and received.Following this first round of targeted consultation, the entire draft plan was disseminated through the Department's website for views and comment by all interested parties ahead of the submission to the European Commission. The draft plan (which runs to some 150 pages) is published and available on the Department's website.  The consultation on the draft plan was open from 11th June to 25th June.Some 55 submissions were received in response to the public consultation.  Most of the submissions, a number of which are lengthy in nature, were received on the final day of the consultation period.  My Department is completing analysis of the feedback received prior to submission of the final version of the National Renewable Energy Action Plan to the Commission and has advised the Commission accordingly.  The final plan is expected to be submitted shortly.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1285	EirGrid applied for planning consent for the 400kV Meath-Tyrone Interconnection Development Project in December 2009, under the Planning and Development Act 2000 as inserted by the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006.An Bord Pleanála convened an oral hearing on the matter on Monday 10th May 2010. On Thursday 24th June, it was drawn to EirGrid's and the Inspector's attention that there was an error in the newspaper public notice and site notice relating to pylon height ranges for a section of the project.  It is the case that full details of the correct heights of the towers concerned were fully described in the Environmental Impact Statement and in the accompanying planning drawings which were submitted to An Bord Pleanála.Following consultation with its legal advisers EirGrid was advised that under the applicable legislation, there is no mechanism to correct the error within the context of the application.  EirGrid therefore notified An Bord Pleanála on Tuesday 29th June, of the withdrawal of its application for the Meath-Tyrone 400 kV Interconnection Development Project.The Meath-Tyrone interconnection project is of significant strategic importance from an all-island electricity market perspective, and from the perspectives, both North and South, of security of supply, competitiveness, economic growth and renewable electricity integration.  I have already made clear my strong disappointment that EirGrid has had to withdraw its planning consent application for this important development.  EirGrid is undertaking a full review of the circumstances which led to the error in the public notice and I have asked to be fully informed of the findings of this review.It is estimated that the total costs incurred by EirGrid on this project since 2006 are approximately €8 million.  These costs include work on key project milestones such as project definition, environmental studies, surveys, consultation, route section, technical design, reports, analysis, production of an Environmental Impact Statement and the submission of an application for planning consent.  EirGrid advises that most of this work remains valid and applicable to the new planning consent application and that the new application will largely reflect the original application.While I have no operational role in respect of transmission development or planning, I fully expect EirGrid to work assiduously and quickly to prepare a new planning consent application, with a view to avoiding any further delays in progressing this important project.  EirGrid has indicated that it will submit a new application as quickly as possible.  Once the updated application is submitted, it is a matter for the relevant planning authority, in this case An Bord Pleanála, to bring the process to its conclusion, and I cannot prejudge the outcome of the process.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1286	Public Service Obligations (or PSOs) are imposed to achieve national energy policy objectives which would not otherwise be delivered by competitive energy markets. In line with EU and national legislation, PSOs have been imposed to support power generation from peat as an indigenous fuel supply for security of supply purposes, to support renewable generation capacity to reduce emissions and reduce dependence on imported fossil fuels, and to support the development of additional generation capacity when it was needed in advance of the introduction of the Single Electricity Market.Electricity consumers pay for the additional cost of these supports through the PSO levy.  Each year, the Commission for Energy Regulation (CER) calculates the estimated costs associated with implementing the various obligations and forecasts of electricity market revenues for the energy companies involved.  Where market revenues are not sufficient to cover the cost of implementing the obligations, additional supports in the form of "top-up" payments are necessary and are funded by electricity consumers through the PSO Levy.For the past few years, electricity market prices, and accordingly electricity market revenues, have been sufficiently high that additional "top-up" payments to support the obligations have not been required.  Therefore the level of the PSO levy has been zero.  This year, however, electricity market prices are significantly lower than in recent years and the CER has calculated that additional supports totalling some €194.5 million will be required to cover the full cost of implementing the obligations over the 12 month period commencing October 1st 2010.  These additional supports will therefore be reflected in an increased level of PSO levy on consumers for 2010/2011.A public consultation on this proposed PSO Levy was conducted by the CER in June and a final decision is likely to be published in the coming weeks.  The CER has advised that a PSO Levy of this scale would add €40.85 to a domestic customer's annual electricity bill. As the CER has calculated that the typical annual household electricity bill is €838, without allowing for other factors mentioned below, this would increase such bills by some 4.8%, all other things being equal.However, a number of other changes come into effect on October 1st, including new transmission and distribution charges, and a new form of price regulation for ESB which gives it slightly more flexibility in terms of setting its own domestic tariffs, subject to oversight by the CER and a requirement to keep within certain revenue parameters. Following the CER decision on deregulation, the CER will no longer regulate ESB tariffs for business customers. This means that it is not currently possible to accurately predict the tariffs that will apply from October 1st.The successful entry of independent suppliers into all segments of the electricity market means that all customers are now free to shop around and benefit from the value and choice offered by these suppliers.  Domestic customers can achieve savings of some 10% — 14%, as well as choosing alternative billing options, dual-fuel (electricity and gas) savings, or "greener" sources of electricity, simply by switching supplier.In addition, there are a number of concrete actions that any customer can take to reduce their electricity consumption and electricity costs as advised by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and electricity suppliers themselves.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1288	The National Energy Retrofit Programme announced on Budget Day in 2010 has the objective of reducing energy costs and carbon emissions in homes and businesses, whilst creating jobs and developing a sustainable market for energy improvement measures and services.The detailed design and specification of the new programme is currently being developed by my Department and the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) and decisions will be made in relation to funding for 2011 in context of Estimates.  I will be bringing the detailed proposals for the programme to Government shortly.  The programme envisages the involvement of energy supply and distribution companies, energy services providers, construction workers, energy auditors, BER Assessors and policymakers, working together to deliver very high levels of energy savings, energy cost reductions and ultimately smaller carbon footprints for energy customers throughout the country.Of the €90 million allocated to my Department's energy efficiency programmes in 2010, some €30 million has been expended to date.  In the domestic sector, this has resulted in energy efficiency improvements to 32,000 homes by the end of June.  Support for energy saving initiatives in the business and public sector continues apace, with the launch last month of a €10m fund that is supporting exemplar projects in 2010.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1289	The National Energy Efficiency Action Plan (NEEAP) sets out 90 actions that Government is either already taking or will take in the period to 2020 to achieve the national energy efficiency targets of 20% across the economy and 33% in the public sector.  The savings identified in the Action Plan represent approximately €1.6 billion in avoided energy costs for the economy in 2020.  There is a requirement in the Energy Services Directive that all Member States must submit their second NEEAPs to the Commission in 2011 and progress on savings made will be reported then.In the public sector, the most significant cost-cutting and energy saving potential lies in improving the energy performance requirements of new buildings, improvement of existing buildings, encouraging more public bodies to actively address their energy use and to use the most energy efficient plant, machinery and equipment.  The Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's Public Sector Programme aims to stimulate the application of improved energy efficiency design strategies, technologies and services in public sector construction and retrofit projects, acting both as an exemplar for good practice and as a demand leader for the services and technologies involved.  In 2009, Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) delivered a €5 million programme that provided grant assistance to the business and public sectors.  The programme supported energy efficiency measures for businesses and institutions across the country.  Over 74 projects were funded under the programme.  As a result of the work carried out, annual energy savings worth €2.6 million and 12kt CO2 were achieved.Building on this success, SEAI last month launched the €10 million Energy Efficiency Retrofit Fund and applications are now being invited from businesses and public sector bodies.  The fund will support exemplar projects in 2010 which achieve significant and verifiable energy savings and provide key learnings for other businesses and public sector bodies.SEAI also runs a support programme providing energy assessments and training to local authorities and other public sector agencies.  This resulted in savings worth between €1.2M and €1.8M in 2009.  A range of best practice guides were also developed and an energy efficiency design process initiated to incorporate energy efficiency principles into the design of new or retrofitted public sector services.SEAI is also developing a Partnership Programme for engaging public sector organisations at the highest levels.  This enables large energy using public sector organisations to take a strategic approach to achieving the 2020 targets.  Regulations introduced in December 2009 require all public bodies to include, in its annual reports published after January 1st next year, a statement describing the actions it is taking to improve its energy efficiency, together with an assessment of the energy savings arising from those actions.  SEAI is already assisting public sector bodies in the development of 2020 energy efficiency strategies and early partners include An Garda Síochána, the Railway Procurement Agency, the Irish Prison Service, Local Authorities, and Bus Éireann.Regulations setting out new energy efficient public procurement rules have been submitted to the European Commission for approval and subject to any comments received will be enacted in September.  These new rules will require public bodies to purchase or lease only plant and equipment across a diverse range of technologies that are listed on SEAI's database of highly energy efficient products.  This database has already been developed as part of the Accelerated Capital Allowance (ACA) Scheme for energy efficient technologies.SEAI is also required under the regulations to produce general guidelines on energy efficient procurement and these will be progressed in conjunction with the National Procurement Service and the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government.In compliance with the 2006 and 2008 Building Regulations, it is the policy of Office of Public Works (OPW) to conduct feasibility studies on the utilisation of renewable energy technologies in all new buildings over 1,000m2 as part of the design process.  The OPW has already installed a number of biomass boiler systems and Solar Panel systems in both new and existing buildings where it has been shown to be both technically and economically feasible.  OPW will continue to take this approach.The Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government has recently prioritised work through the statutory Building Regulations Advisory Board to establish achievable targets for reductions in primary energy and CO2 emissions for buildings in all sectors of the economy including public sector buildings, with a view to upgrading the requirements in Part L (Conservation of Fuel and Energy) of the Building Regulations in 2010.  The work programme currently under way will inform the development of a programme for continuous improvement in Part L requirements in coming years with a view to achieving a Carbon Neutral building standard for buildings other than dwellings, including civic buildings, by 2016.

Kildare since the Scheme began. Funding is not allocated on a county by county basis. The WHS is delivered to homes that apply for the scheme in any county nationwide subject to eligibility criteria being met and funding being available.The WHS remains fully open in 2010 and it is envisaged that the new National Retrofit Programme will incorporate existing schemes such as the WHS and the Home Energy Savings Scheme from 2011.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1292	I propose to take Questions Nos. 570 and 582 together.The Warmer Homes Scheme (WHS), managed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI), provides energy efficiency improvements to homes in, or at risk of, fuel poverty and is primarily delivered by community based organisations (CBOs) of which 25 have, to date, been approved to provide this service.The primary eligibility criteria for receipt of the WHS are that the household is in receipt of a Fuel Allowance from the Department of Social Protection and that the property was constructed prior to 2002.   In the context of the Affordable Energy Strategy currently being prepared by my Department in conjunction with all relevant Departments and Agencies the qualifying criteria for WHS are being examined.The CBOs work in partnership with their local network of poverty and community support organisations including public health nurses, MABS and St. Vincent De Paul to identify and address vulnerable homes. Homes which are identified and referred to the WHS by these support organisations and which may not be in receipt of a fuel allowance but are deemed to be in need of the scheme, are also considered eligible.  Through this devolution model each CBO is responsible for managing the applications in their own operational areas.  The SEAI is therefore not directly involved in the application process.  It does of course monitor and check the scheme to ensure that assistance is provided to the target sector of those on low income.Private contractors were engaged on a pilot basis in 2009 to address the increasing demand for the scheme.  Through these mechanisms, the WHS was delivered to 16,240 homes in 2009.  A further 2,886 homes received similar measures through the ESB's Home Insulation Scheme in 2009.The WHS is now available nationwide using a dual model of delivery with CBOs in their set geographical areas and private contractors extending the geographic reach of the programme while also providing deeper measures including central heating in certain homes.The waiting time for the WHS varies, although it is generally between 3 and 6 months.  The SEAI, through a combined use of CBOs and contractors, is actively working towards reducing waiting times for the scheme.  As households are usually identified by way of referrals from the support agencies, it is not possible to quantify waiting lists.The Deputy may wish to note that a dedicated hot line — 1800 250 204 — has been in operation for some time and all queries, from scheme applicants and public representatives, on delivery dates for individual households and/or funding agreements are dealt with immediately.The number and location of recipients of the WHS to date in 2010 are as follows:WHS 2010 per county to 07/07/2010Number of homesCo.

#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1293	The Commission for Communications Regulation (ComReg) has statutory responsibility for the management of spectrum in accordance with national spectrum policy objectives.  A primary objective of ComReg is to ensure the efficient use of this unique natural resource.The submission from my Department to the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes stated that while it is necessary for the State to receive a fair return for spectrum, it is critical for the creation of a suitable environment for new digital businesses that ComReg also gives due recognition to the innovation and enterprise value of spectrum and promotes spectrum availability as a vehicle for the development of new digital services and technologies.Assignment of spectrum is done by way of licences for specific applications or general authorisations.  The design of assignment mechanisms, such as an auction, is determined by ComReg, taking account of the circumstances prevailing in the sector and the particular markets at a given time.  The objectives of spectrum assignment are to ensure a fair return to the State for the use of this resource; ensure that competition and innovation are promoted; and to protect public service interests.  Operators in this field range from large-scale to small-scale, and from existing to new entrants.  The assignment of spectrum thus requires a balanced approach that recognises these objectives and the various types of players.ComReg has previously used auctions to assign spectrum and is currently finalising plans to assign further blocks of spectrum by auction.  Before deciding on the method of allocation, ComReg holds a public consultation on its proposals, including the terms and conditions of the assignment mechanism.  It is not possible to determine in advance what the outcome in terms of revenue would be.  The price paid by bidders for the available spectrum is determined by market conditions.While market mechanisms, such as auctions, are an efficient means for assigning spectrum, they are not always the most appropriate means.  In areas where social, cultural, safety and security objectives are paramount, assignment mechanisms other than market mechanisms are more appropriate.

Details of the scheme are available from the BAI at www.bai.ie.Section 156 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009 increased from 5% to 7%, the proportion of net television licence fee receipts that the Minister (with the approval of the Minister for Finance) can pay annually to the BAI for purposes of a grant to the Broadcasting Funding Scheme.  The reason for this increased allocation to the Broadcasting Funding Scheme is to implement my policy objectives to enable greater support and finance to be made available to independent producers and all broadcasters licensed in Ireland in the production of new TV and radio programmes.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1295	I propose to take Questions Nos. 573 and 576 together.Directive 2009/28/EC requires each Member State to submit a national renewable energy action plan.  These plans are to set out Member States' national targets for the share of energy from renewable sources consumed in transport, electricity and heating and cooling in 2020, taking into account the effects of other policy measures relating to energy efficiency on final consumption of energy.  Ireland's draft national renewable energy action plan is available on the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources website.  The draft plan includes reference to the current microgeneration tariff available to the domestic sector.Microgeneration is referenced at many points in the draft plan and includes the commitment to put in place a robust framework for the development of a vibrant microgeneration sector as an important component of building societal acceptance and participation in achieving national renewable energy targets.  The microgeneration area has the potential to create employment and enable participation by a wide section of the community.  The Government is committed to developing a comprehensive microgeneration framework which will be taken forward up to 2020.'The draft plan also provides detailed information on the microgeneration pilot scheme currently being conducted by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland and states that "In conjunction with the pilot trials, the market potential of microgeneration and the possible supports that would be needed to achieve that potential are being considered".The principal objective of the pilot is to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the installation, network connection and operation of small and micro scale generation technologies.  An associated programme objective is to assess measures required for supplier and product qualification to minimise the risk of adverse outcomes at small-scale and microgeneration installations, hence promoting the robust growth of a supply base.It is recognised that the equipment used for microgeneration needs to be safe and reliable and should perform to the specified standards. Installation quality may also impact performance and safety, and therefore there is a need for standards for microgeneration installations and for installer training.  By ensuring that the technical specifications and standards for equipment and installations are properly defined, the secure running of the electricity system can be maintained.The draft plan also highlights the importance of ensuring that adequate training and certification schemes for installers are in place in order to ensure safety and reliability and to develop confidence in the sector.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1296	The European Commission Decision (C(2009)5174) of 30 June 2009 established the mandatory template for National Renewable Energy Action Plans under Directive 2009/28/EC.  The purpose of the template is to ensure that National Renewable Energy Plans are complete, cover all the requirements laid down in the Directive and are comparable with each other and future Member State biannual reports on the implementation of the Directive.Ireland's draft plan follows the template required.  The information required under the template relate to renewable energy and detail on energy efficiency programmes has not been elaborated in the plan.The modelling carried out in order to complete the tables in the National Renewable Energy Action Plan does however, as required, take energy efficiency actions into account. Details on the modelling and how energy efficiency measures are incorporated into the figures are set out in the draft plan.  The savings expected from the HESS scheme have been included in the model.Ireland's National Energy Efficiency Action Plan "Maximising Ireland's Energy Efficiency 2009-2020" was submitted to the Commission last year.  This is a separate plan to the National Renewable Energy Action Plan, although there are of course vitally important links between the two.  The National Renewable Energy Action Plan incorporates into the modelled figures the expected energy savings arising from the National Energy Efficiency Action Plan.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1297	REFIT is the ‘Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff' scheme, which is the support scheme for renewable generation administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Prior to the introduction of REFIT, renewable generation was supported through a tendering scheme known as AER (Alternative Energy Requirement.)State aid clearance for the original REFIT scheme was obtained from the European Commission in September 2007.  The objective of REFIT was initially to provide support to deliver on Ireland's electricity directive target of 13.2% of all electricity to be from renewable sources by 2010 and to facilitate delivery of our higher national target of 15% renewable electricity by 2010.  The scheme was successful in delivering the required level of capacity.Like all support schemes for renewable technologies, REFIT is kept under review to ensure that it can continue to deliver the market build rate required at as reasonable a cost as practicable to the electricity consumer who pays the costs through a Public Service Obligation levy.The original REFIT scheme covered small hydro (5MW and below), small wind (5MW and below), large wind (above 5MW), landfill gas and biomass combustion.  Solar PV was not included for cost reasons, as the support levels traditionally required by solar PV are significantly higher than those of other technologies.REFIT extension is designed to extend the scheme in line with delivering on our 40% 2020 target.  The extension application has been submitted to DG Competition in Brussels for consideration for State Aids clearance.By supporting a fixed price 15-year contract REFIT generation rewards clean green electricity.  For example, in the current 2009/2010 PSO period, CER Decision 09/119, the estimated market price is €52 MW/h.  This is well below the REFIT tariff levels and suppliers are compensated for the additional costs in accordance with the REFIT terms and conditions.The UK uses a system of tradeable certificates called ROCs to support renewable electricity generators.  The UK uses feed in tariffs in the electricity sector only for small scale micro-generators.  Every Member State operates its own renewable energy support system and there is no common European support scheme in place.  The REFIT scheme has delivered on its objectives to date and there are no plans to adopt the UK model in Ireland.

The micro-hydro course on offer by the Renewable Energy Installer Academy (REIA) is not accredited as confirmed by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) with City and Guilds and contact directly with the REIA.The SEAI website refers to City and Guilds accredited microgeneration courses offered at the REIA.  The PV and Wind courses offered are accredited to City and Guilds but the micro-hydro one is not.Membership of REIA implies appropriate accredited training has been taken which would deem one eligible to be included on the SEAI registered list.  Currently there are only registered lists for renewable heat products supported under the Greener Homes Scheme.  The REIA courses for heat have been accredited under the National Framework of Qualifications.The draft National Renewable Energy Action Plan (NREAP) notes that lists for installers of renewable heating technologies are published and lists of trained microgeneration installers are being developed.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1299	While I announced plans for a microgeneration pilot trial in 2008, the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland's (SEAI) small- and micro- scale generation pilot field trial was actually launched on 26th February 2009, as an open call for proposals, with defined eligibility and evaluation criteria for proposed generator installations and a defined profile of sites and technologies sought.The public consultation period on the Draft National Renewable Energy Action Plan has been completed and all submission are being considered in the context of finalising the Plan.At the meeting of 30 September 2008, it had initially been envisaged that the SEAI pilot would be launched.  However, around this time ESB was considering offering a microgeneration feed in tariff to domestic customers.  ESB subsequently decided to proceed with this scheme and it was decided that it would be beneficial if both schemes could be launched concurrently, given their obvious linkages.The target of the SEAI pilot scheme was to fund circa 50 representative sites encompassing the potential diversity of technologies, applications and site types and locations in the wider market.  This included a target of 25 wind installations with different targets depending on generator type.  The call for proposals effectively relied on the market to deliver eligible proposals for installations and to subsequently deliver the commissioned installations.The initial rate of applications to the pilot was low and many applications received were incomplete and failed to meet the defined eligibility criteria.  Aside from incomplete applications, the principal deficiencies in applications were largely related to evidence of product quality and certification and installer training.  In many cases obtaining this evidence significantly delayed the evaluation of applications and the award of grants.  Some applications did not succeed due to the fact that planning exemptions did not demonstrably apply at the proposed sites and that evidence of planning permission or confirmation of exemption could not be produced.The first grant offer was issued in July 2009 and offers were issued as applications were received and evaluated.  Over 110 applications were received up to the close of the call for proposals in September 2009.  There were 63 qualifying applications, with 20 applications being withdrawn either due to lack of financing or planning constraints.  There are currently 43 projects participating in the pilot field trial comprising 27 wind turbines 15 solar photovoltaic installations and 1 hydroelectric turbine.SEAI issued a call for tender with regard to the monitoring element of the pilot.  Following the decision to award the tender to a particular company, negotiations on the contract terms commenced and have proven protracted, which has led to an acknowledged delay in commencing monitoring.The rationale for the pilot microgeneration scheme is outlined at length in the draft National Renewable Energy Action Plan currently available on the Department's website.The principal objective of the pilot is to investigate and test technical, market and regulatory issues associated with the installation, network connection and operation of small and micro scale generation technologies.  An associated programme objective is to assess measures required for supplier and product qualification to minimise the risk of adverse outcomes at small-scale and micro-generation installations, hence promoting the robust growth of a supply base.It is recognised that the equipment used for microgeneration needs to be safe and reliable and should perform to the specified standards. Installation quality may also impact performance and safety, and therefore there is a need for standards for microgeneration installations and for installer training.  By ensuring that the technical specifications and standards for equipment and installations are properly defined, the secure running of the electricity system can be maintained.  There are therefore significant issues to be addressed which merited the running of the pilot trial.In the context of developing a comprehensive microgeneration framework, the case for a wider support scheme for microgeneration is being assessed.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1300	The rules applying to the Scheme of Accelerated Capital Allowances (ACA) for Energy Efficient Equipment are set out in section 285A of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, as inserted by the Finance Act 2008.  Those provisions require that for a particular technology to be eligible for accelerated capital allowances, an Order in required specifying the minimum energy efficiency criteria to be met by such products.  The Order must also name individual products that meet these criteria.  Any company paying corporation tax can claim the accelerated capital allowance based on their records of purchase of a named product.I have made five such Orders to date on the basis of a range of criteria drawn up by the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) for 29 technologies, following a period of industry consultation in each case and based on lists of named products meeting these criteria, submitted to SEAI by manufacturers or their agents.  The range of technologies eligible for the scheme will increase to almost 50 following a further Order in August listing criteria and products for additional technologies added to the Scheme by the Minister for Finance in Budget 2010.To date, it has not proved feasible to establish minimum energy efficiency criteria to be met by commercial scale hydro electric power solutions or to name specific hydro products in an Order.  Modern hydro solutions such as screw turbines tend to be bespoke solutions, designed by the manufacturer for each individual site.  As such, there are few, if any, "off the shelf" products that can be named in an Order.  While it may be possible to establish the efficiency of a particular hydro solution after installation on site, given the volume of products named in ACA Orders (close to 7,000 at present), the ACA Scheme does not and cannot seek to establish the energy efficiency of solutions after they are installed on a company's site.  Rather, the energy efficiency of standard products available for purchase by any buyer is established before they are named in the Order and compared to the minimum criteria for the scheme.  This is possible for solar PV and wind turbine solutions as standard products are available on the market, but at present is not feasible for hydro.There is at present no REFIT tariff for solar PV.  The cost of REFIT tariffs are recovered on the basis of public service obligation levies on electricity users.  The high cost of solar PV generation makes a PSO levy for this technology impractical at this time.  However, given continued technological development, the matter will be kept under regular review.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1301	REFIT is the ‘Renewable Energy Feed-in Tariff' scheme, which is the support scheme for renewable generation administered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.The original REFIT scheme covered small hydro (5MW and below), small wind (5MW and below), large wind (above 5MW), landfill gas and biomass combustion.  I have announced the expansion of REFIT under certain terms and conditions to cover additional technology categories, namely ocean energy (wave and tidal), offshore wind, anaerobic digestion high efficiency CHP and biomass co-firing.The REFIT scheme allows generators of electricity from renewable sources (in the technologies covered) to secure the necessary investor confidence to finance debts. Renewable generators enter into 15-year power purchase agreements with suppliers at negotiated and fixed prices.  Via the Public Service Obligation (PSO) levy mechanism, REFIT compensates participating retail electricity suppliers according to the REFIT terms and conditions for the net additional costs attributable to their participation in the scheme and purchase of electricity from the relevant generators in the REFIT scheme.The length of the power purchase agreements in Ireland (15 years) for renewable generation eligible for REFIT compares favourably with the length of power purchase agreements in other EU Member States and offers the necessary stability to secure financing.Insofar as the UK is concerned, their main support scheme is not a feed-in tariff scheme, but a Green Certificate scheme.  The Renewables Obligation is the main support scheme for renewable electricity projects in the UK.  It places an obligation on UK suppliers of electricity to source an increasing proportion of their electricity from renewable sources.  A Renewables Obligation Certificate (ROC) is a green certificate issued to an accredited generator for eligible renewable electricity generated within the United Kingdom and supplied to customers within the United Kingdom by a licensed electricity supplier.In terms of harmonisation of support schemes, this is something that the European Commission has been looking at for several years.  In SEC(2008) 57 published in January 2008, the Commission staff working document on the support of electricity from renewable energy sources which accompanied the proposed Renewable Energy Directive, the European Commission concluded that it was inappropriate to harmonise European support schemes at that time.  Ireland does not have any plans to harmonise our support scheme with any other Member State at present.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1302	I am informed by Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEAI) that there are two types of solar technology supported by the Greener Homes scheme, namely evacuated tubes and flat plates.  Evacuated tube solar products are more efficient than flat plate products if compared on an area basis.SEAI also indicate that evacuated tubes are, however, not suitable for all applications, and thus a significant market remains for flat plate products.  To ensure the consumer will utilise the more effective technology when appropriate, Greener Homes Scheme gives a greater subsidy per unit area for evacuated tube systems than it does for flat plate products — €300/m2 for evacuated tube products and €250/m2 for flat plate products.The Greener Homes Scheme supports the installation by householders of renewable energy heating technologies including wood-pellet and chip stoves and boilers, gasification boilers, solar panels and geothermal heat pumps.  The grant is a fixed amount, based upon the particular technology selected, towards the cost of purchase and installation of the chosen scheme.  Products and installers must be selected from published Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland (SEAI) registered lists.  The net number of applications from 2006 to date under the Scheme is 29,000.  Nearly 25,000 installations have been completed under the Scheme.  Exchequer funding to date has amounted to just under €62m.The Greener Homes Scheme has created a stable market in domestic renewable energy technologies and has supported the development of the renewable heating industry.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1303	The Audiovisual Media Services Directive (AVMS) provides that Member States of the European Union may designate sporting and cultural events of major importance to society as free-to-air.  The Broadcasting Act 2009 having transposed the AVMS Directive, sets down the statutory process for designating events free-to-air.Section 162 of the Broadcasting Act, 2009, provides that I may by order designate events of major importance to society so that a qualifying broadcaster has the right to provide coverage on free television services in the public interest, and determine whether coverage of a designated event should be available on a live, deferred or both live and deferred basis and in whole, or in part or both in whole or in part.The Broadcasting Act requires that I: consult with the organisers of the event(s) that I intend to designate; consult  with broadcasters; publish a notice of the event(s) that I intend to designate and invite comments on the intended designation from members of the public; consult with the Minister for Tourism, Culture and Sport and; lay a draft of the order designating events before each House of the Oireachtas for approval.This process is under way.  The closing date for receipt of submissions has passed and I will take all submissions received into consideration when deciding on whether to designate an event.My final decision on this matter will also be informed by an independent analysis of the financial and other impacts of listing each event.My Department published a tender on the eTenders website on 4th June 2010 for an independent consultant to prepare such a report.  The closing date for receipt of tenders is Friday, 9th July and the successful tenderer will have 8 weeks after contract award in which to present the report.  I will make my decision as soon as possible after receipt of the report.Following the completion of the statutory consultation process I am required under the Audiovisual Media Services Directive to inform the EU Commission of any changes to the events to be designated.  The Commission has a period of three months to verify that the list is compatible with Community Law, to notify other Member States and to seek the opinion of the Committee established pursuant to Article 23a of the Directive.  The designation will only be effective after the Commission has published the list in the Official Journal.As I indicated to the Deputy when I attended the Select Committee on Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, while a contract has not yet been awarded for this consultancy, it is estimated at this stage that the value of the contract is likely to be in the region of €60,000 to €70,000.

These consultants, when appointed, will work with my Department's team to introduce a six digit alpha numeric model capable of being refined into a location based code.  I expect a national postcode system for Ireland to be developed by the end of 2011.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1305	The Smart Metering Programme is a central component of the Government's strategy to radically enhance management of energy demand, deliver smart networks and enable greater energy efficiency through the use of cutting-edge technology.The harnessing of renewable energy and the development of micro generation and electric vehicles is creating an utterly different supply and demand energy landscape.  The integration of energy and ICT systems will deliver an energy network which looks a lot more like the Internet than a traditional grid.  Therefore, smart metering systems will be intrinsic to the transformation of the energy system.  I have asked my Department to work with the Commission for Energy Regulation and ESB Networks to explore the synergies between the national electric vehicle programme and the smart meter programme.The current pilot phase of the smart meter programme is underway as planned.  The technology trials are continuing to test a number of advanced metering systems and their associated IT and communications infrastructure.  The Customer Behaviour trials are determining the potential of smart meters to achieve measurable change in consumer behaviour.The potential for a Smart Metering Prepayment Model, similar to the ‘Pay As You Go' mobile telecommunications arrangements, is also being assessed by the Smart Metering Steering Group for use in both electricity and gas.  A prepayment pilot is now under way with ESB Customer Supply staff in advance of a trial with ESB Customer Supply customers, which is expected to get underway by September.The electricity element of the pilot phase went ‘Live' in January of this year and will be completed at the end of December 2010.  The electricity technology trial is examining metering functionality and supporting information and communications systems.  3,400 meters have been deployed to accommodate technology testing in Limerick/Ennis and Cork City/Bandon, in addition to further desk top studies of radio frequency and power line carrier solutions.Significant progress has also been made in the gas element of the pilot phase.  Over 1,900 meters have been deployed for Gas Customer Behaviour Trials.  A further 100 meters will accommodate Gas Technology Trials.With the six month benchmarking period for the gas element of the Customer Behaviour Trial having been completed at the end of May, the Trial went live on 1 June. It will continue until end May 2011.A key component of the smart meter pilot is the associated cost benefit analysis, which will critically inform future decisions, including on a full national roll out.  An interim analysis will be completed this year, with the final analysis, to include the results of the gas trials, to be completed by mid 2011. To that end, on 11 June, the CER opened the first of what will be a series of smart metering consultations, seeking views on possible functional requirements for a national smart metering roll out. Responses received will inform the cost benefit analysis. The closing date for this initial consultation is 23 July. All documentation is available on the CER website.Smart Metering is now seen at European Union level as a critical dimension of energy demand management in the interests of consumers and businesses.  I am pleased to say that Ireland is to the forefront among Member States in making real progress on the smart meter agenda.

The acreage on offer covers an area of approximately 8,000 square kilometres over parts of Counties Cavan, Donegal, Leitrim, Mayo, Monaghan, Roscommon and Sligo in the North West Carboniferous Basin, and parts of counties Clare, Cork, Limerick and Kerry in the Clare Basin.  The closing date for receipt of applications was Friday 11th June 2010.The Department is currently examining the five applications received under the competition and I will announce the outcome in due course.

A total of €644,129 in lump sums was paid in respect of these two retirements.Amounts paid to individuals on retirement are personal to the individual but the percentage of final salary was 183% in the case of the Secretary General and 148% in the case of the Assistant Secretary.The superannuation benefits accruing to each individual upon retirement were linked to the length of service and rate of final pensionable remuneration.  The retirees received lump sums at the rate of 3/80ths of pensionable remuneration for each year of service.  In the case of the Secretary General, Sections 6 and 7 of the Superannuation and Pensions Act, 1963, were applied in determining final payment.

Mayo, some 2,875.32 hectares are designated Special Areas of Conservation [SACs] and some 389.39 hectares as Special Protection Areas [SPAs].  Both of these designations (SACs and SPAs) are collectively known as Natura 2000 sites. They overlap in some instances so they cannot be summed to give a total.In relation to the land owned by the company in Co. Mayo designated as National Heritage sites [NHA], I am advised that there are 220.17 hectares of NHA and 2,305.58 hectares of proposed National Heritage Areas.While it is not possible to provide a breakdown by barony a list of the designated Natura 2000 sites on Coillte land will be forwarded direct to the Deputy.

The position is that I have made proposals to the European Commission to increase the rate of payment on SACs and other Natura areas under the Agri-Environment Options Scheme. I have no plans to increase the rate of payment under REPS.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1310	By the closing date of 17 May 2010, my Department had received over 9,000 applications under the recently introduced Agri-environmental Options Scheme from farmers who, if they prove eligible, will be entitled to up to €5,000 per year for the period ending 31 December 2015.  Together with ongoing commitments in REPS, this means that all EU funding for agri-environment payments up to the end of 2013 is now fully committed.  Any further support for agri-environment schemes in that period will, therefore, have to be funded entirely by the Exchequer and this is a matter which will be considered in the context of the annual Estimates process.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1311	Statutory responsibility for prize money for horse racing tests with Horse Racing Ireland (HRI) in accordance with Section 8. (1) (a) (iv) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act, 2001.I understand from HRI that prize money produces a significant multiplier effect. The Dukes Report "Analysis of the economic impact of the Irish Thoroughbred Industry", commissioned by ITBA, directed by Alan Dukes and published by the Irish Thoroughbred Breeders Association in Autumn 2009, showed that an investment of approximately €30m in prize money by HRI was the catalyst for an investment of €290m by owners in keeping horses in training and thereby creating employment and economic activity in rural Ireland.  HRI have pointed out that this investment underpins the success of the Irish thoroughbred training and breeding industries. Irish trainers have won five of the last ten Epsom Derbys, five of the last ten Aintree Grand Nationals, three of the last ten runnings of the Prix de l'Arc de Triomphe, the most important flat race in the world, and seven of the last twelve runnings of the Champion Hurdle at Cheltenham.In 2009, Irish horses filled three of the top four places in the year end World Rankings, including for the second year in a row, the World Champion Racehorse in Sea The Stars.These successes bring great credit to our racing and breeding industries and to the country as a world leader in the sectors.

In keeping with standard procedure, both individuals were written to and asked to confirm their entitlement to claim the land in question. Both responded claiming the right to claim said land and both submitted legal documentation purporting to support their claim. Given this conflict it has not been possible, to date, to resolve the matter. However, I have arranged for an official of my Department to contact both parties, directly, in an effort to resolve matters.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1317	Since the publication of the Report of the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programmes, Department funding to Teagasc has been cut by €11m from €146m in 2009 to €135m in 2010. The Government moratorium on public service numbers also applies to the filling of posts in Teagasc and requires Teagasc to achieve a permanent, structural reduction in the numbers of staff serving in the organisation.  Teagasc is now operating with fewer staff with staffing levels falling by 142 posts since the moratorium commenced in March 2009.  An Employment Control Framework for Teagasc is also being finalised for the purposes of managing staff numbers to 2012.In 2009, the Teagasc Authority approved a major ‘Change Programme' to reorganise and refocus the organisation to meet the significant challenges that lie ahead.  This required Teagasc to build greater flexibility and responsiveness in all areas of its activities and to implement a credible rationalization plan to enable the organisation adapt to medium-term budgetary constraints.  The planned Programme provides for rationalisation measures across the organisation including the advisory office and educational networks, disposal of land resources and prioritisation of programme activities. The Teagasc Authority recently approved the second stage of the rationalisation programme —“The Teagasc Change Programme 2009-2013: The Next Steps”. It builds on progress made during the first phase and incorporates a further series of rationalisation measures.The Teagasc Change Programme fits in with Government policy enunciated in the Croke Park Agreement to create a modern, efficient and customer focused public service. The Teagasc Authority is committed to full implementation of the Programme to transform Teagasc into a more efficient organisation that is totally focussed on servicing its clients and stakeholders. The agreed actions, which are being implemented, also tie in with the recommendations in the Special Group on Public Service Numbers and Expenditure Programme Report as they concern Teagasc.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1319	I propose to take Questions Nos. 599 and 613 together.The European Communities (Good Agricultural Practice for Protection of Waters) Regulations 2009 were developed for the purpose of giving statutory effect to Ireland's Nitrates Action Programme under the EU Nitrates Directive. The Directive requires each Member State's Action Programme to specify periods when the land application of fertilisers is prohibited. The prohibited periods in the Irish Regulations are based on a range of scientific factors, including average rainfall amounts.The Action Programme runs for a four-year period and is under review at present. On the 11th June the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government and I issued a joint consultation paper, including draft amended Nitrates Regulations. It is open to all stakeholders to put forward their views on the proposals and these submissions will be considered in finalising the new Regulations. The period of public consultation ends on the 23 July 2010 and submissions must be made to my Department or to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government before that date. The consultation paper and full text of the draft Regulations is available on both Departments' websites.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1320	Notwithstanding that the amendment form in question was received in my Department after the latest date for receipt of amendment forms under the 2009 Single Payment Scheme, as defined in the governing EU Regulations, under the rules concerning the consolidation of single payment entitlements ("the 50% rule"), were the two parcels which were listed on the amendment form in question to be taken into account, the person named would still fail the 50% rule and, therefore, the issue of the acceptance, or non-acceptance, by my Department of the amendment form in question is not relevant.The 50% rule in relation to the consolidation of single payment entitlements concerns the number of SPS entitlements held in 2005, which in the case of the person named was 68.10. The eligible area declared by the person named under the 2009 Single Payment Scheme was 24.30 hectares and the area of the two parcels included on the amendment form in question was 9.05 hectares, a combined area of 33.35 hectares, which is below the 50% requirement i.e. 34.05 hectares.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1321	Since the FMD outbreak in 2001 and arising from certain concerns relating to scrapie, all exports of sheep for breeding or production must comply fully with normal rules for intra-community trade.  Intra -Community trade in sheep is governed by the provisions of Council Directive 2003/50/EC which amends Council Directive 91/68/EEC.  These controls apply to breeding sheep whether they are imported or exported and all sheep must be certified with regard to their health status.Under these rules, breeding sheep must be certified as having been continuously resident on a holding of origin for at least 30 days prior to export including a standstill period of 21 days prior to export during which time no sheep have been introduced on to the holding.  A derogation applies where sheep introduced during the standstill period are completely isolated from all other animals on the holding.Breeding rams must also come from a holding on which no case of contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) has been recorded in the last 12 months and they must have been kept permanently on the holding for 60 days prior to export.  Breeding rams must also be tested for contagious epididymitis (Brucella Ovis) with a negative result, within 30 days prior to export.  The rules in relation to Scrapie are that all breeding sheep must either be of the ARR/ARR prion protein genotype, or have been kept in a scrapie monitored flock for at least 3 years with no cases of scrapie being confirmed during this period.Breeding sheep being exported must be inspected by an official veterinarian during the 24 hours preceding the loading of the animals and issued with an Intra–Community health certificate signed by an official veterinarian.

I intend to give statutory effect to the current very comprehensive guide for the care and welfare of greyhounds published by Bord na gCon.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1323	Funding for the horse and greyhound racing industries will continue to be provided through the Horse and Greyhound Fund. The level of funding to be provided in 2011 will be determined in the context of the preparation of next year's estimates.  In the meantime, work is progressing on how best to give effect to the commitment set out by the Taoiseach in relation to the application of betting duty to telephone and internet betting.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1324	My Department's overall national strategy for the eradication of TB provides for a comprehensive range of measures, including the mandatory annual testing for all cattle in the national herd, the restriction of holdings where reactors are disclosed, risk-based testing of herds contiguous to infected herds, the early removal of reactors, a wildlife programme involving the targeted removal of badgers where they are implicated in a TB outbreak, the use of the gamma interferon test in problem herds, the depopulation of infected herds, where appropriate, and the payment of compensation to farmers whose herds are affected by disease.With regard to TB outbreaks in isolated blackspots, in addition to the measures outlined above, my Department also implements more frequent risk-based testing of herds that had experienced TB outbreaks in the recent past. Such herds are obliged to undergo a sequence of six monthly TB tests for a period of 18 months after clearance. Furthermore, these areas are the primary focus for gamma blood testing, which can help to identify additional infected animals and thereby shorten the length of time taken to clear the herd of infection, and badger removal. With regard to the latter, if no source of infection is otherwise apparent in a high risk herd, an epidemiological investigation will seek to establish if badgers were present in the local environment of the herd and were the probable cause of the breakdown. Where there is evidence of badger activity, badger capturing and removal takes place in the areas associated with the TB breakdowns, under licence from the Department of Environment, Heritage and Local Government. The selected areas, which may cover a number of infected high risk herds, are subject to continuing surveillance and capture for a period of 5 years.These measures have contributed to the effectiveness of the programme as evidenced by the significant progress which has been achieved here in controlling TB over the past 10 years, particularly since the introduction of an enhanced badger removal programme in 2004/5. Reactor numbers have fallen from 45,000 in 1999 to just under 24,000 last year. The herd incidence has fallen from 7.7% to 5.1% in the same period. More recently, the average annual number of reactors removed in the 5 years since the introduction of the enhanced badger programme was 14% lower than in the 5 years preceding its introduction.My Department will continue to monitor and review the effectiveness and efficiency of the programme on an on-going basis with a view to the eventual eradication of the disease in all areas.

My Department has already written to all applicants acknowledging receipt of their applications, and advising them that once all applications have been assessed they will be told whether their applications have been successful.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1326	Provision has been made for the launch of the Agri-Environment Options Scheme at a rate of up to €5,000 for approximately 10,000 participants.  By the closing date of 17 May 2010, my Department had received over 9,000 applications.  My officials are currently examining these applications, and until this process is completed it will not be possible to determine what costs will arise in respect of AEOS this year.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1327	Farmers in REPS 3 are paid at the start of each year of their contracts.  There are still 24,753 farmers in REPS 3.  Of these, 10,601 will finish their contracts between now and the end of 2010 and received their last payments during 2009.  The other 23,693 will finish their contracts in 2011, and are receiving their last payments this year.  At an average annual payment of €6,200 per participant, these payments will amount to some €147 million.The EU Regulations governing payment in REPS 4 are different.  Payment of up to 75% may be made each year once administrative checks on all applications are concluded.  The balance may be paid when the last of the on-farm inspections for the year has taken place.  There are some 31,300 participants in REPS 4, including those whose applications were received after the annual closing date of 15 May 2009 and up to the time the Scheme was closed to new applicants on 9 July 2009.  Based on the average annual payment of €6,200 per participant, this represents an annual cost of €194 million for REPS 4 for the years 2010, 2011 and 2012.  Some 12,500 participants will finish their contracts in 2012 and a further 17,000 will finish in 2013, with the result that the cost of REPS 4 in 2013 will be about €115 million, falling to under €10 million in 2014 when the last payments will be made.

Up to 1 July 2010, 805 had received their payments.  In all the other cases there are issues to be resolved before payments can be released.Farmers in REPS 3 must submit an annual application for payment.  There are 20 of these currently being processed in North Tipperary.  Payments have already been made to 228 REPS 3 participants in the year to date.

There has been a decrease in the numbers employed in the fish processing sector from 2,205 full-time and 1302 part-time employed in 2005 to 2,150 full-time and 380 part-time employed at the end of 2009.   This ongoing reduction is mainly in part-time employment due to less fish being processed, process plant consolidation and the upgrading of plants with automation. While there are a reductions in part-time operation staff, there are more full time specialists being employed in quality control, business development and marketing.

Expenditure to date and committed in 2010  is still being calculated but is estimated to be of the order of  €5m with  increased expenditure projected in 2011.The EGF coordination unit and the EGF Steering Committee are in place to support the implementation of relevant measures. They are charged with insuring the effective and efficient management of EGF measures at local level. That function includes appropriately addressing and resolving problems encountered.All EGF funded measures are designed to assist EGF clients to return to work or to keep in contact with the labour force. In this context FÁS is providing a number of specific internship programmes which place persons in employment and provide relevant training in specific sectors.  The City and County Enterprise  Boards as well as Enterprise Ireland are also providing appropriate supports for persons seeking to start their own business.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1336	Since June 2009 the Government had made four applications under the European Globalisation Adjustment Fund (EGF) for co-financing assistance for measures in support of redundant workers.  Two EGF applications, in respect of redundant workers at the Dell plant in Raheen, Co. Limerick and the Waterford Crystal plant in Kilbarry, Co. Waterford have been approved by the EU budgetary authorities to date. Two further EGF applications in relation to redundant workers at the S R Technics facility at Dublin Airport and on behalf of certain redundant workers in the construction sector are currently under consideration by the European Commission. The latter application was made on 9th June 2010. In total, the EGF applications made to date seek to support over 13,000 redundant workers.In relation to the implementation of EGF assisted measures in support of redundant Dell and ancillary workers over 2,200 persons to date have availed or are availing of measures including occupational guidance, training, upskilling, enterprise supports and educational opportunities being provided. In relation to the implementation of EGF assisted measures in support of redundant Waterford Crystal and ancillary workers over 480 persons to date have availed or are availing of measures.It should be highlighted that in the implementation of the EGF payments are not made to individual clients. Relevant supports are delivered to the individual EGF client through the appropriate State agencies and educational institutions including those offered by private service providers.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1341	There is a number of supports for persons in Cork City and County who have lost their jobs, the majority of which are provided through education programmes and FÁS interventions aimed at ensuring that these people who are unemployed are better equipped to re-enter the workforce.The FÁS South West Region (Cork and Kerry) is providing key early supports to unemployed people that are aimed at assisting them to enhance their skills and better enable them to secure employment in these difficult times.FÁS Employment Services Cork provides client services and supports, including jobsearch, through its Employment Services Offices located in Cork City (x3), Mallow and Bantry.  FÁS Employment Services also provides fortnightly Clinics in all major towns in County Cork. All clients registering with FÁS have the opportunity to access to FÁS Jobs Ireland for CV posting and for reviewing and follow up of current job vacancies, locally, regionally and nationally.FÁS provides a wide range of training courses across Cork County through its Training Services Division. Within the Training Centre in Bishopstown and its satellite locations, including Carrigaline, Sunbeam and Farranferris, over 488 programmes have been scheduled for 2010.  These include daytime short courses, long courses, traineeships, evening/ night and Saturday courses. Of this number 251 are complete, 48 are currently ongoing, and 188 are yet to run.FÁS operates a bus service runs from many county locations including Youghal,  Mitchelstown, Mallow and West Cork, stopping at the major towns and villages en route to ensure ease of access for those living in the county to programmes running in our city locations.Over 66 training programmes are currently scheduled in 2010 for locations across Cork County including  — Mallow, Mitchelstown, Fermoy, Bantry, Bandon, Carrigaline, Youghal, Carrigtwohill.  Of the programmes scheduled 19 are complete, 18 are ongoing and 29 are yet to run.Clients can also avail of the FÁS Technical Employment Support Scheme Grant to assist them in availing of training courses, not directly provided by FÁS. This support is consistently available to support Mallow/North Cork clients. Typical courses funded through TESG include HGV/Rigid Driving, Fork Lift Driving and Energy Related Skills Training.Through its Community Services Division, FÁS provides funding for over 2,000  Community Employment places in Cork City & County.  Funding is also provided for four Community Training Centres in Cork City, which provide training and education for educationally disadvantaged early school leavers.In relation to the education supports available for the unemployed, the City of  Cork VEC and the County Cork VEC provide a range of programmes and supports that are open to unemployed people who are seeking to upskill to better equip them for re-entry to the workforce. Among the full time programmes available are:1. Post Leaving Certificate (PLC) — 5,350 places are available on the PLC programme across City and County Cork. The PLC offers a programme of integrated general education, vocational training and work experience in schools and colleges.2. Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme (VTOS) — 550 places are available on the VTOS programme across City and County Cork. This scheme gives second chance education and training for unemployed adults aged 21 and over in receipt of social welfare payments.3. Youthreach — just over 400 places are available on the Youthreach programme across City and County Cork. This programme offers a two-year programme of integrated education, training and work experience for 15 to 20 year-olds who are not in the labour market and left school without formal education qualifications.Additionally the Back to Education Initiative (BTEI) offers part time learning options for the unemployed. In 2009 3,167 learners accessed the BTEI programme across City and County Cork. A similar provision is available for 2010.Adult Literacy and Community Education programmes are also available to unemployed people.The VECs also provide support services to learners enrolling in their programmes such as the Adult Educational Guidance Initiative which provides a quality educational guidance service for adults. Childcare support is also available to participants in the Vocational Opportunities Scheme (VTOS), BTEI and Youthreach programmes.All higher education programmes are open to unemployed people. Applications from mature students accounted for 14% of all CAO applications in 2009, up from almost 12% in 2008. In addition, almost 1,800 unemployed people were supported to embark on part-time higher education courses that support the goals of the 'Smart Economy' from September 2009.  135 of the places on this scheme were allocated to higher education institutions in Cork.

Parents and tutors are, therefore, aware that they will receive grant aid on 11 November and have been able to make their payment arrangements accordingly.In 2009, 121 schools participated in the July Education Programme. In addition,  1,897 children participated in the home-based programme. Applications this year have increased by approximately 20% in comparison with 2009. The Deputy will appreciate therefore that the major proportion of administrative work is devoted to processing home-based applications.Staffing resources have been assigned to process payments as speedily as possible. The certainty granted to parents and tutors with a fixed payment date will increase efficiency in this regard, as staff will be able to channels their efforts into processing payments rather that dealing with numerous queries on payment dates.

This team meets regularly to discuss issues which require input from both Health and Educational services.  In addition, the Special Education section of my Department works in a dual reporting arrangement with the Office of the Minister for Disability and Mental Health which has responsibility for promotion of co-ordinated delivery of services in the health and education sectors to people with disabilities and special educational needs and co-ordination in the provision of information to those with disabilities and special needs and, in the case of children, their parents/guardians.The Deputy will be aware that the National Council for Special Education (NCSE) was established to co-ordinate the delivery of services for children with special educational needs. The NCSE is responsible, through its network of local Special Educational Needs Organisers, for allocating resource teachers and special needs assistants to schools to support children with special needs. The NCSE responds to applications from schools, including any applications in respect of newly enrolling children, for additional supports. The Health Service Executive is responsible for the provision of health supports such as therapies to children.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1347	The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level for the coming school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009.  The level of extra teaching support provided in respect of language support to any school is determined by the numbers of eligible pupils enrolled and the associated assessed levels of these pupils' language proficiency. This is done through an annual application process in the Spring/Summer of each year.Under present arrangements which are set out in Department Circular 0015/2009 a school can be allocated up to 4 language support teachers. Additional support is also available for those schools which have at least 25% of their total enrolment made up of pupils that require language support. Such applications for additional language support are dealt with through the Staffing Appeals process.It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0021/2010 and Circular 0015/2009 — Meeting the needs of pupils learning English as an Additional Language. Both circulars are available on the Department's website. The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is final.

The application has been assessed in accordance with the published prioritisation criteria for large scale building projects and assigned a Band 2 rating.  Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, including the project referred to by the Deputies, is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction phase will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of the project at this time.  I would note that when grant aid was approved for additional accommodation at the school in 2009, this was on the basis that the additional accommodation would meet the school's accommodation needs for a number of years.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1351	On 6 July 2010 a total of 18,932 retired primary, secondary, community and comprehensive school teachers were in receipt of pension from my Department, of which 12,746 were female and 6,186 were male.  Of that total 2,214 were in receipt of a supplementary pension of which 1,328 were female and 886 were male.  Traditionally teachers who were members of an occupational superannuation scheme paid PRSI at a modified rate. Such teachers were insured under the social welfare code for a very limited range of benefits, and generally would not qualify for State Pension (Transitional) or State Pension (Contributory). These teachers paid superannuation contributions on their gross pensionable pay and their occupational pension was determined by reference to that pay at retirement.In 1995 amended regulations were introduced which provided that the modified rate of social insurance would no longer apply in the case of many categories of public servants including teachers appointed on or after 6 April 1995 for the first time or for those who return to employment after that date having previously resigned or retired. It should be noted that periods of approved leave of absence taken by persons who were in service prior to 6 April 1995 (who have otherwise unbroken service) do not constitute a break in service for the purposes of the social welfare regulations. Teachers to whom the amended regulations apply are covered for the full range of social insurance benefits.A teacher who is subject to full rate PRSI will, subject to satisfying the necessary eligibility criteria, qualify for the full range of social welfare benefits including State Pension (Transitional) or State Pension (Contributory).  Such teachers pay superannuation scheme contributions on a lower rate of salary to take account of the fact that their employer, by virtue of paying employers PRSI, has contributed to their social welfare benefits. It is common practice in superannuation schemes in both the private and public sector to take account of the fact that the employer has contributed for social welfare benefits. Correspondingly the occupational pension is based on the pay on which the contributions were based and is lower than the pension payable to a teacher who did not pay PRSI at the full rate.The occupational pension scheme provides for the payment of a supplementary pension in specific instances. Supplementary pension is payable in respect of periods during which the retired teacher is not employed in any capacity which involves the payment of social insurance contributions and due to circumstances outside his or her own control, either fails to qualify for Social Insurance Benefits, or, qualifies for such benefits at less than the maximum rate of State Pension (Contributory) payable to a single person. The rate of supplementary pension is calculated as the difference between the total of occupational pension and State benefit in payment and the occupational pension payable had the teacher been insured at the modified rate.As mentioned above, employment precludes the payment of a supplementary pension. Where a person who, having retired with an occupational pension, returns to teaching, the supplementary pension is not payable for the duration of such employment. In general supplementary pension can resume on cessation of the further employment provided that the person satisfies the other conditions for payment i.e. does not qualify for social welfare benefit of such amount as would, when added to the occupational pension, equal the pension payable if integration had not applied.

Individual school authorities are responsible for the drawing up of a school policy in relation to the wearing of school uniforms.My Department has not issued specific guidance in this matter.  However, my Department recommends that the formulation of such a school policy should allow for prior consultation with teachers, parents and pupils where appropriate and enable any concerns about the issue of cost to be raised and considered. Decisions regarding school uniforms are a matter for the Board of Management of each individual school.

The total cost of this funding from 2004 to date was €3.19 million, and the main application of the funds was for the pay of partnership co-ordinators and facilitators, national and regional partnership meetings in Ireland, and office administration costs.In 2001, my Department agreed through the Teachers Conciliation Council to provide £7,500 annually to each of the three teacher unions towards the cost of substitution, enabling the release of executive members to conduct union business. This payment is reviewed in line with pay movement affecting teachers' salaries. The total cost of this measure from 2004 to date in 2010 is €237,000.

The additional posts in the renewed Programme for Government enabled some improvement to be made to the staffing schedule. The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level for the coming school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009. The final position for any one school will depend on a number of other factors such as the allocation of support teachers, additional posts for schools that are developing rapidly and posts allocated as a result of the appeals processes.It is open to any Board of Management to submit an appeal under certain criteria to an independent Appeal Board. Details of the criteria for appeal are contained in the staffing schedule, Circular 0021/2010 which is available on my Department's website.  Posts allocated on the basis of the staffing schedule are specifically for mainstream classes and should be deployed accordingly. School authorities are requested to ensure that the number of pupils in any class is kept as low as possible, taking all relevant contextual factors into account (e.g. classroom accommodation, fluctuating enrolment etc.). In particular, school authorities should ensure, as far as possible, that there is an equitable distribution of pupils in mainstream classes and that the differential between the largest and smallest classes is kept to a minimum.

I am conscious that the impact of the moratorium on middle management posts has applied unevenly in schools depending on the level of retirements. For some schools, between this year and the coming school year, the level of retirements will create a significant number of vacancies. The changes that I am now making will allow those schools to fill a limited number of vacancies while the overall number of promotion posts continues to reduce.The measures that I have announced will provide a measured and balanced response to the manner in which the moratorium has impacted unevenly in schools.  145 Assistant Principals and 227 teachers with Special Duties posts of responsibility retired at primary level since the introduction of the moratorium in March, 2009.  The moratorium will continue to apply as the position whereby over 50% of all teachers have promotion allowances is simply not sustainable.

The information includes the number of pupils in each class, the number of pupils in each class size range and the number of teachers in each school.  The primary census for the 2009/10 school year is currently underway and the final outcome will be made available on 1 September, 2010.The Deputy will also be aware that the renewed Programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government and also the provision of 500 additional teaching posts between primary and second levels over a three year period.The initial tranches of these additional posts have been allocated and, at primary level, this has enabled some improvement to the primary staffing schedule for the 2010/11 school year. The improvement has been targeted at medium to larger size schools which typically are under the greatest pressure in relation to class sizes.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The review of SNA allocations being carried out by the NCSE, through its network of SENOs, is with a view to ensuring that the criteria governing the allocation of such posts are properly met. This is an exercise in identifying surplus posts which are in the system and which do not meet the current criteria — posts that have been retained when a pupil's care needs have diminished or where the pupil has left. At the same time, the NCSE is allocating additional posts where the criteria are met. The terms and criteria for the SNA scheme have not changed.The NCSE published its report on the Review of SNA Allocation to Schools April 2009 — March 2010 on its website www.ncse.ie. A copy is attached for the Deputy's information. A small number of approximately 70 schools remain to be reviewed and the NCSE has indicated that these will be reviewed early in the 2010/11 academic year. A final breakdown of the outcome of the review will be made available by the NCSE when all schools have been reviewed.I have arranged for the Deputy's request for additional information in the context of the review to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.  I wish to confirm for the Deputy that my Department is very supportive of the SNA scheme. It has been a key factor in both ensuring the successful integration of children with special educational needs into mainstream education and providing support to pupils enrolled in special schools and special classes. The SNA scheme will continue to be supported and the NCSE will continue to support schools, parents, children and teachers by allocating resources to schools in line with my department's policy.

The NCSE operates within my Department's criteria in allocating such support.The Deputy will also be aware that the NCSE has introduced an appeals process whereby schools and parents, where appropriate, may seek to appeal the decision of a SENO in relation to the allocation of resources. Information regarding the appeals process is available on the NCSE's website at www.ncse.ie.  The NCSE administers this appeals process without recourse to my Department. The information requested by the Deputy is therefore not available within my Department. I have arranged for the details supplied by the Deputy to be forwarded to the NCSE for their attention and direct reply.

Grants per school were comprised of a block amount of €1,700 plus a per-capita amount of €34.59 based on enrolments as at 30th September 2008.  I am pleased to advise the Deputy that a second tranche of ICT infrastructure funding in the region of €20m will be distributed to post-primary schools shortly and further ICT grants will issue to primary schools in the autumn.Roll NumberSchoolAddress00359VSt. Louis Girls National SchoolPark Road, Monaghan Town00373PDeravoy National SchoolDeravoy, Emyvale, Co Monaghan00467BBallinspittle N SKinsale, Co Cork00538VClochar DaingeanAn Daingean, Co Chiarrai00570RMhuire Naofa CailiniBishop Street, Limerick00590ABorrisoleigh B N SBorrisoleigh, Co Tipperary00606MMonard N SMonard, Solohead, Co Tipperary00651RBorris Mxd N SBorris, Co Carlow00697SSt Brigids Mxd N SCastleknock, Dublin 1500714PLucan B N SLucan, Co Dublin00729FClochar Loreto N SGrange Road, Rathfarnham, Dublin 1400743WMater Dei Primary SchoolBasin Lane, James Street, Dublin 800752ACentral Senior Mxd N SMarlboro St, Dublin 100779UPresentation Girls Primary SchoolMaynooth, Co Kildare00788VLisdowney N SBallyragget, Co Kilkenny00796UScoil LachtainFreshford, Co Kilkenny00851CPresentation ConventBallymakenny Road, Drogheda, Co Louth00856MScoil Naomh MichealLongford, Co Longford00860DForgney N SMoyvore, Co Westmeath00883PAine Naofa N SNavan, Co Meath00885TRatoath Junior N SRatoath, Co Meath00892QShanganamore N SShanganamore, Athy, Co Laois00895WBallinakill Mixed N SBallinakill, Co Laois00934GPresentation Convent (Jnr)Mullingar, Co Westmeath00941DS N BhrideEmper, Ballynacargy, Co Westmeath00973QGrange Con N SGrange, Co Wicklow00977BBallyconnell N SBallyconnell, Tullow, Co Carlow00984VGlenealy 1 N SGlenealy, Co Wicklow01000EEsker N SAthenry, Co Galway01013NScoil Croi IosaPresentation Road, Galway01086RS N Pol NaofaCastlerea, Co Roscommon01116ABaile An Chuilinn N SMuinebeag, Co Carlow01125BLeitrim Mxd N SCarrick On Shannon, Co Leitrim01170GS N Na H-AilleThe Naul, Co Dublin01197DStrawberry Hill B N SSundays Well, Cork01215CNewtown Dunleckney MxdMuinebeag, Co Carlow01272OS N Chuan DoirChuan Doir, Co Cork01285ATipperary Jnr Bn STipperary, Co Tipperary01300QSt Michaels National SchoolCo Kilkenny, Co Kilkenny01309LStackallen N SStackallen, Navan, Co Meath01328PKiltormer N SBallinasloe, Co Galway01356UKilnaleck Mixed N SKilnaleck, Co Cavan01395HAglish N SCappoquin, Co Waterford01396JTulloha National SchoolKenmare, Co Kerry01415KRathoe NsRathoe, Co Carlow01421FKilskyre Mixed N SKilskyre, Kells, Co Meath01434OS N ColumcilleTullydonnell, Togher, Drogheda Co Louth01553WLouth Mixed N SLouth, Dundalk, Co Louth01554BBaile An Phusta N SSmarmore, Drogheda, Co Louth01556FScoil BhrideBallyroan, Portlaoise, Co Laois01569OBallycahill N SBallycahill, Thurles, Co Tipperary01572DS N Naomh PadraigDrumfries P O, Clonmany, Co Donegal01574HScoil Naomh IósafBallymagan, Buncrana, Co.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1383	As the Deputy will be aware all primary and post-primary schools have access to educational psychological assessments either directly through the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS) or through the Scheme for Commissioning Psychological Assessments (SCPA). Schools that do not currently have NEPS psychologists assigned to them may avail of the SCPA, whereby the school can have an assessment carried out by a member of the panel of private psychologists approved and paid for by NEPS.In common with many other psychological services and best international practice, NEPS encourages a staged assessment process, whereby each school takes responsibility for initial assessment, educational planning and remedial intervention, in consultation with their assigned NEPS psychologist. Only if there is a failure to make reasonable progress in spite of the school's best efforts, will a child be referred for individual psychological assessment. This system allows the psychologists to give early attention to urgent cases and also to help many more children indirectly than could be seen individually. It also ensures that children are not referred unnecessarily for psychological intervention.The document "Special Needs Education — A Continuum of Support", which has been circulated to all primary school teachers, demonstrates this process which moves from simple classroom based interventions to more specialised and individual interventions. These guidelines describe a graduated problem solving model of assessment and intervention in schools and comprise three distinct  school based processes which are summarised below:1. Classroom Support — is an intervention which is co-ordinated by the Class Teacher and is carried out in the regular classroom,2. School Support — is an assessment and intervention process which is usually co-ordinated by the learning support/resource teacher working alongside the class teacher. Interventions at this stage will be additional to those provided through classroom support.3. School Support Plus — is generally characterised by the school requesting the involvement by the relevant external service in more detailed assessment and development of intervention programmes. This level of intervention is for children with complex and/or enduring needs and whose progress is considered inadequate, despite carefully planned interventions at previous levels.The staged model recognises that pupils present with a wide range of issues and difficulties and allows for their amelioration and intervention at the level most appropriate to the particular need.NEPS psychologists provide both support and development service to teachers in accommodating the various needs at levels 1 and 2 of the staged model and provide advice in relation to appropriate intervention in relation to unnamed pupils or groups of pupils as well as servicing the identified needs at individual named pupil at level 3 up to and including full psychological assessment. The input in respect of stages 1 and 2 is therefore not recorded at individual pupil level by NEPS. It should be noted that even at level 3 the assessment may take a variety of forms depending on the pupils needs.NEPS also provide support to the State Examinations Commission in making recommendations for students applying for special accommodation under the Reasonable Accommodation for State Examinations (RACE) scheme mainly at leaving certificate level.As the assessment of children as being potentially in need of additional support is continuous throughout the school year, figures in relation to the number of children with whom NEPS has engaged in the 2009/10 school year are not yet available.For the academic year 2008-09 the NEPS service engaged, as described above, with some 14,200 named pupils in primary and secondary schools across the range of formal educational assessment routines to inform teachers and parents as to the particular needs of the pupils involved.  This figure does not include pupils who would have undergone other forms of assessment by a range of health professionals and clinicians.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1385	The specific information sought by the Deputy in relation to the number of schools that have a general purpose or physical education facility is not readily available in my Department.However, my Department recently launched an on-line inventory of school accommodation which is available to schools on the Department's Esinet portal.The system went live for all schools in May and schools have commenced inputting the relevant data since then. Information such as that sought by the Deputy will be available when all the data has been received and analysed from schools.My Department is committed to funding the provision of general purpose rooms and outdoor play areas in schools as part of the school building and modernisation programme.  This is being addressed in the context of available resources and published criteria for prioritising school building projects.The Department's design guidelines for schools include guidance on the provision of PE Halls, general purpose rooms and outdoor hard play areas such as basketball courts.  The size of these facilities would be dependent on the size of the schools.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1386	I propose to take Questions Nos. 682 and 692 together.The issue of patronage and governance of our primary schools is of significant national importance. Irish society will continue to change at pace over the years to come and our education system must therefore continue to adapt and change to reflect this. I have previously indicated that I recognise that there is a need to seek the input and views of a wide cross section of contemporary Ireland on the relevant issues.As the Deputy may be aware consideration of many of the relevant issues is under way already.A review of procedures for establishment of new primary schools is being undertaken by the Commission on School Accommodation.  Among the range of issues being considered is the issue of patronage including the criteria that must be met to become a patron and the circumstances where changes to patronage may be warranted.  The Commission is due to report to me shortly.Furthermore, my Department has had discussions on the potential transfer of patronage of catholic primary schools with senior representatives of the Catholic Church.  During discussions with representatives of the Catholic Church in November 2009 it was agreed that my Department would look at identifying a sample number of areas of relatively stable demographics where a requirement for the establishment of new primary schools is unlikely to emerge in the foreseeable future and where the provision is exclusively Catholic or where there is very limited diversity of provision at present.  A report on the assessment of ten sample locations, where the modalities for changes to schools' patronage may be tested, has been drafted.  It is my intention that this report be provided to the Catholic Church authorities and published in the near future.There has already been significant consultation around these issues with stakeholders.  The extent and nature of the further consultation under consideration will be determined as the work underway is completed.  My Department will continue to liaise with all of the relevant stakeholders in relation to the issues concerned.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1387	The arrangements for vetting of teaching and non-teaching staff are set out in Department Circular 0094/2006 which is available on my Department's website.The specific data on vetting requested by the Deputy is not readily available from the Garda Central Vetting Unit (GCVU).Irrespective of the position on vetting by the GCVU, where facts or information comes to a board of management's attention calling into question a person's suitability to work with children it is a matter for the board to satisfy itself that the person is suitable to work in that capacity.  This will naturally have to be assessed on a case by case basis.  The board will have to consider all the circumstances of the case, give due weight to all relevant factors, and afford fair procedures to the individual concerned before making a decision.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1388	The statistics section of my Department's website contains information relating to primary schools including the number of teachers in each school and enrolment data for the school years 2006-07 to 2008-09.  The primary census for the 2009-10 school year is currently under way and the final outcome will be made available on 1 September 2010.The public sector numbers for 30 June 2010 were 31,880 primary teachers and 27,870 post-primary teachers.  Enrolment at post primary level for 2009-2010 is 350,687 pupils.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1389	The criteria used for the allocation of teachers to schools is published annually on my Department's website.  The key factor for determining the level of staffing resources provided at individual school level for the coming school year is the pupil enrolment at 30 September 2009.Pupil numbers at both primary and post-primary level continue to increase and this results in an increased requirement for additional teachers for the foreseeable future.  The Deputy will be aware that the renewed programme for Government commits the Government to no further increase in the pupil teacher ratio in primary and second level schools for the lifetime of this Government.The renewed programme for Government also provides for 500 teaching posts to schools over the next three years over and above additional posts that will arise due to demographic increases.The staffing schedule includes an appeals mechanism for schools who are dissatisfied with their staffing allocation.  The appeals criteria are outlined in the published staffing schedule which is available on my Department's website.The final staffing position for all schools will ultimately not be known until the autumn.  At that stage the allocation process will be fully completed for mainstream classroom teachers and any appeals to the staffing appeals boards will have been considered.  The appellate process is particularly relevant at post-primary level where any specific curricular needs of the school concerned are considered.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1390	I propose to take Questions Nos.  686 and 687 together.The Education (Welfare) Act, 2000, established the National Educational Welfare Board, NEWB, with statutory responsibility to ensure that each child attends a recognised school or otherwise receives a certain minimum education.  The Act provides a comprehensive framework for promoting regular school attendance and the adoption of a welfare based approach to tackling the underlying causes of absenteeism and early school leaving.  The general functions of the board are to ensure that each child attends a recognized school or receives a certain minimum education.The board has an authorised staffing complement of 109 posts.  Currently 100 posts are filled.  The breakdown of grades and responsibilities is shown in the table.In May 2009 I announced plans to extend the remit of the board with effect from September 2009.  The extended remit brings together the Visiting Teacher Service for Travellers (VTST), the Home School Community Liaison Service (HSCL) and the School Completion Programme (SCP) as well as the National Educational Welfare Service (EWS) under one common management team.  The underlying rationale for this new single strategic approach, acknowledging and utilising the combined strengths and capacities of the four services, is to deliver better outcomes for children, families and schools.  Combining these four services to deliver a composite service at national, regional and local levels is a positive development and one that will in time realise significant benefits.  The board is charged with the development of a single strategic approach to delivery of services, reflecting equally the nature and strengths of each of the services.  My Department will continue to work closely with the board on the development of this new approach.Since its establishment the board has carried out research aimed at increasing awareness around the underlying causes which impact negatively on attendance in school.  To support and advise families the NEWB has issued leaflets to parents, run public awareness campaigns to raise the profile of school attendance and operates an Education Helpline to provide information on attendance and related matters.  Guidelines for Developing School Codes of Behaviour, which were issued to all schools in 2008, is a valuable tool for schools to assist them put in place strategies to deal with poor behaviour and other underlying causes of poor attendance.The board's network of Educational Welfare Officers (EWOs) is the means by which the board delivers on its statutory remit to ensure that each child attends and benefits from education.  The board has a range of functions and powers to intervene at different levels to vindicate a child's right to an education.  Educational welfare officers work closely with the family, the school and other support services to address the particular issues for each child.  The needs of children can vary considerably from those who are not attending school to those for whom there is no school place, while in other cases, placement in an alternative education programme like Youthreach may be more appropriate.Each year the National Educational Welfare Board works with between 8,000 and 10,000 children and their families who have been reported as having attendance or school placement difficulties or who have been expelled from school.  In the 2009-2010 school year, the board worked intensively with 4,000 cases involving children and their families who have been reported as having serious educational welfare problems.  In addition, the board worked with between 4,000-6,000 children and their families where a less intensive involvement was required to resolve the barriers to their attendance issues.As regards level of absenteeism, recently published figures from the board's analysis of school attendance data in primary and post-primary schools 2006-07 and 2007-08 report shows that the percentage of student days lost through absence has remained stable over the last five years.  Over 57,000 students miss school each day, consisting of approximately 31,500 primary and 26,000  post-primary students.  This is a loss of 12 school days per student per year in primary school and 13 days per year in post-primary school.  About 12% of primary school students (58,000) and 17% of post-primary students (57,000) were absent for 20 days or more during the school year 2006-2007 and 2007-2008.  However, there were considerable differences between schools. Some schools will have had no pupils absent for twenty or more days while others will have more than one fifth (20%) of pupils missing this number of days.

The number of days worked by unqualified substitute teachers in post primary schools reduced from 45,187 days in the period 1 January to 30 June 2009 to 43,841 days in the same period in 2010.There were 303 unqualified teachers employed in a part-time capacity in primary schools in the current school year.  Prior to September 2009 the teachers employed in a part-time capacity were paid by the managerial authorities of the schools.  They were placed on payroll operated by my Department from September 2009.  The priority of my Department in the current school year was to place this group of teachers on payroll.  It is expected that the number of unqualified teachers employed in this group will reduce significantly for the 2010-2011 school year.The school managerial authorities have been advised of the position of my Department regarding the employment of unqualified teachers in a number of circulars.  The position has been outlined in circulars 0020/2007, 0010/2008, 0002/2009 and 36/2009.  Reference is also made in the appointment form completed by the managerial authorities when a teacher is appointed in a  permanent or temporary capacity.The position regarding the employment of registered and qualified teachers by the managerial authorities of schools was outlined recently in Circular 40/2010.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1395	Project Maths will begin in all second level schools in September 2010.  The programme is designed to transform teaching and learning of mathematics at second level, so that students will develop instrumental understanding (knowing how), relational understanding (knowing why), the ability to apply their  knowledge and skills in familiar and unfamiliar contexts, and analytical and creative powers in mathematics.  A key objective is to improve attainment levels in maths and to encourage more students to take the subject at higher level.The Project Maths initiative is designed to encourage better understanding of maths, to reinforce the practical relevance of maths to everyday life, and to ensure better continuity between primary and second level, and junior and senior cycle.The initiative started in 2008 and was piloted in 24 schools.  The experience in the project schools is informing the national mainstreaming of the initiative.  The curriculum changes will be phased in over three years and mainstreaming is beginning in 2010-11 in all schools.  A national programme of professional development for all teachers began in 2009, and will continue to at least 2013.The NCCA website www.ncca.ie. sets out the draft syllabus for Strands 1, 2, 3 and 4 at junior and senior cycle, a draft common mathematics course for the first year in junior cycle, and a Geometry course.  The website www.ProjectMaths.ie sets out additional supports in the form of teaching and learning plans, a forum for teachers, and additional resources.  These resources will expand over time.  Overall, the changes will be implemented in five strands of mathematics over a three year period.  Project Maths is being supported by intensive investment in professional development for teachers, with some €5 million being invested in this area in 2010.Strands 1 and 2 will begin in all schools in September 2010 for first examination in 2012 at leaving certificate and 2013 at junior certificate.  Strands 3 and 4 will begin in 2011.  The syllabuses for strands 1 and 2, already available in draft form, will be finalised in the light of experience in the 24 project schools, and will issue to all schools this summer.  The remaining strands will follow in sequence, informed by the experience in the 24 project schools.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1397	Section 24(3) of the Education Act 1998 provides for the suspension and dismissal of teachers by boards of management.  Under the terms of Towards 2016 the parties undertook to review and revise existing procedures and to agree new procedures.The agreed procedures provide for two separate and independent strands which should be utilised in appropriate circumstances:Procedures relating to professional competence issuesProcedures relating to work, conduct and matters other than professional  competence.Reasonable and appropriate support, training and assistance is provided in procedures relating to professional competence.  In this context, a major focus of the work of the revised model of teacher support from September 2010 will be the provision of appropriate advice and assistance to school management and teachers in the formulation of improvement plans and, where relevant, in their  implementation.  Arrangements have also been put in place to provide for the timely accessing of those services as required.To date there has been only a small number of cases in which the support services have been enlisted to provide professional support to teachers identified under the professional competence strand of the section 24 Education Act.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1398	The High Level Group on International Education is currently finalising a strategy and action plan to enhance Ireland's performance as a centre of international education.  I understand that they are on course to submit the draft Strategy and Action Plan to me by the deadline of late summer.  I expect that the strategy and action plan will be published in early autumn.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1399	In December 2008 the Government published Building Ireland's Smart Economy: A Framework for Sustainable Economic Renewal.  It centred on five key action areas: Securing the Enterprise Economy and Restoring Competitiveness; Building the Ideas Economy — Creating the Innovation Island; Enhancing the Environment and Securing Energy Supplies; Investing in Critical Infrastructure, and; Efficient and Effective Public Services and Smart Regulation.A progress report on the Smart Economy Framework was published in March 2010.  The progress report highlights key headline progress from the wide range of policy actions and developments in each of the five key action areas.Key progress in the education sector highlighted in the report includes the following:- Higher education institutions have been responding to increasing demand for higher education by increasing the number of places they offer.  CAO acceptances for the 2009/10 academic year, at 45,582, were up 8.3% on the previous year (2008/09), which in turn had seen an increase of 5.4% on 2007/08.  The total number of full-time enrolments in higher education institutions aided by the Department of Education and Skills is projected to be more than 155,000 for the 2009/10 academic year.— In 2010, based on current participation rates, almost 48,000 learners will participate in full-time further education through the Youth reach, Vocational Training Opportunities Scheme, Senior Traveller Training Centres and PLC programmes.  An estimated 125,000 learners will participate in part-time programmes under the adult literacy, community education and Back to Education Initiative Schemes.— A process to develop a new national strategy for higher education began in February 2009.  Led by a high level strategy group comprising national and international expertise, it is examining how well Ireland's higher education system is performing, how it ranks internationally, how well existing resources are being used and how the system can be re-configured to best meet the many challenges it faces over the next decade having regard to the key role it has to play in contributing to Ireland's economic recovery.  It is envisaged that the strategy will provide a vision and related set of national policy objectives for Irish higher education over the coming 20 years and identify the operational framework for the higher education system which will enable it deliver these objectives.  The strategy group are expected to finalise their report before the summer.— Project Maths, which is designed to bring about a changed approach to student learning of mathematics, with greater use of contexts and applications and greater emphasis on the development of problem-solving skills, began in 24 post-primary schools in 2008, and will begin in all schools in September 2010.  Project Maths is being implemented on a phased basis over 5 strands of Mathematics.  Leaving Certificate candidates in the 24 initial schools were examined on strands 1 and 2 for the first time in June 2010.  In addition, the Project Maths Implementation Support Group presented its report to me on how stakeholders can work together to help achieve the objectives of the Project Maths in May of this year.The full Smart Economy progress report is available on the Department of the Taoiseach's website: www.taoiseach.ie.

A full review of DEIS, including a comprehensive evaluation of measures in the School Support Programme (SSP) over the period of the DEIS action plan to 2010 is also currently underway in my Department.A Steering Group has been established within my Department to progress the technical work in preparation for a new identification process to a stage when wider consultation with relevant stakeholders on the identification method can be commenced.  It is expected that the consultation process will commence in the autumn.On the basis of the previous identification process there will need to be a lead-in period of at least nine months from the establishment of a new identification process to the commencement of its application.In terms of the broader evaluation of DEIS, the aim is to have the outcomes of the ERC evaluations completed towards the end of 2010 and these are to be considered by my Department along with the relevant evaluations of practice in DEIS schools undertaken by the Inspectorate as well as relevant recent research undertaken by the ESRI and the NESF.While stakeholders have been involved in consultation on the nature of the evaluations, there is also an expectation that there will be further consultation with stakeholders when the evaluations are complete with a view to the outcomes of such consultation impacting on the future of the School Support Programme.It is not yet possible to determine when the process will be complete as this will largely depend on the outcomes of the planned consultation process.

The procedures adopt a progressive approach to addressing professional competence matters which include both informal and formal stages within the school.  The involvement of the Inspectorate in reporting on a teacher's performance in specified circumstances will arise only at stage three, the external review stage, following completion of the earlier in-school stages.  No request for an external review of a teacher's performance has yet been received by the Chief Inspector.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1408	Information in respect of the current school building programme along with all assessed applications for major capital works, is available on my Department's website at www.education.ie.The priority attaching to individual projects is determined by published prioritisation criteria, which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners.  There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it.  Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest.  Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.It is not possible for me to provide information to the Deputy regarding the projected costs of each project before it is tendered, as to do so would risk compromising the tender process.Set out below for the Deputy's convenience, are lists of projects in South Tipperary, at tender and construction, in architectural planning and at application stage, as well as details of projects in South Tipperary which have received funding for major capital projects in the past two years.CountyRNSchoolYear of ApplicationCurrent StatusBand RatingProject DescriptionTipperary17779PPowerstown NS, Clonmel, Tipperary1999In Early Architectural Planning2.4Extension RefurbishmentTipperary72430HScoil Ruaine, Killenaule, Co Tipperary1997In advanced Architectural Planning4.1PE HallCountyRoll NoSchoolYear of ApplicationBand RatingProject DescriptionStatusTipperary65240LScoil Mhuire Presentation Secondary School, Ballingarry, Thurles19972.4Extension/ RefurbishmentProgressing to TenderCountyRoll No.SchoolYear of ApplicationCurrent StatusApplication forProvisional Band RatingTipperary02237RDualla NS, Dualla*ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary02670ISan Isadoir, Cashel2010ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Tipperary04620DThomastown NS, Thomastown2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Tipperary07048QMohober NS, Mohober2007ApplicationNew SchoolBand 2Tipperary07245SCullen NS, Cullen1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary07358ISN Sceichin A Rince An Chuirt Doite1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary08903M & 13014IFethard Convent NS and Naomh Padraig NS, Fethard *Design Team to be AppointedNew SchoolBand 1Tipperary10120P &18716TCahir BNS & Cahir GNS, Cahir2000Design Team to be AppointedNew SchoolBand 1Tipperary11453BLisnamrock NS, Coalbrook2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Tipperary11470BSlieveardagh NS, The Commons1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary12180UPresentation Primary School, Clonmel2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Tipperary13210ISt Joseph’s NS, Ballingarry1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary13678MKillurney NS, Ballypatrick2001ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary14181JPoulicapple NS, Callan1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary15008AShronell NS, Lattin2005ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary17332TSt Mary’s Parochial School, Clonmel2001ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Tipperary17783GSN Chuirt Doighte, Cahir2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary18486FSN Cill Siolain, Cill Siolain1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2CountyRoll No.SchoolYear of ApplicationCurrent StatusApplication forProvisional Band RatingTipperary18538VScoil Mhuire Caislean Nua1999ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Tipperary19230VCormaic Special School, Cashel2007ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 1Tipperary19294BLisvernane NS, Galbally2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary19615SScoil Aonghusa, Cashel2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 1Tipperary19645ESt Oliver Plunketts NS, Heywood Road2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2Tipperary20007CGaelscoil Chluain Meala, Clonmel1999ApplicationNew SchoolBand 2Tipperary20085WGaelscoil Charriag na Siuire2003ApplicationNew SchoolBand 2Tipperary65490LThe Abbey School, Station Road2002ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Tipperary72390VVocational School, Cappawhite2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 3Tipperary72400VComeragh College, Greenside2008ApplicationNew SchoolBand 2Tipperary72420ECentreal Technical Institute, Clonmel2000ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 4Tipperary72480WSt Ailbe’s School, Rosanna Road2001ApplicationExtension/RefurbBand 2*School has been offered a devolved grant to meet the long term accommodation needs.COUNTY/ SCHOOLTOTALTIPPERARY SOUTH€BALLYTARSNA NS ( 15970S)138,530POWERSTOWN NS (17779P)15,892ANACARTY NS (18528S)38,310BALLYPOREEN NS (20129Q)79,795TOTAL TIPPERARY SOUTH272,527COUNTY/ SCHOOLTOTAL€BALLYTARSNA NS (15970S)73,697ANACARTY NS (18528S)3,400TOTAL TIPPERARY SOUTH77,097

It is operated by Vocational Education Committees (VECs).VTOS is a two year programme but in very exceptional circumstances, such as if a significant amount of tuition time was lost through health problems or where an extra year might be required to achieve an award or certificate, learners may participate in a third year.Decisions on the enrolment of individual learners are for the VEC concerned.  In relation to the person referred to by the Deputy, I understand from the VEC concerned that the person has completed a two year programme, achieving awards at Junior Certificate and FETAC Level 4.  I also understand from the VEC concerned that this person has not requested a third year.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1410	Financial assistance is available to students under the maintenance grant schemes, which are administered by the local authorities and Vocational Education Committees on behalf of my Department.  Students who are entering approved courses for the first time are eligible for grants where they satisfy the relevant conditions as to age, residence, means, nationality and previous academic attainment.Under the terms of the Higher Education Grant Scheme a student is not eligible for grant assistance in respect of a second period of study at the same level, irrespective of whether or not a grant was paid previously.  However, financial assistance is available to eligible candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and who wish to enter a further postgraduate course, at a higher level, which represents progression from the level at which the first qualification was attained.The progression route at postgraduate level, for grant purposes, is as follows: Higher Diploma/Postgraduate Diploma, Masters, PhD/Doctorate.Candidates who already hold a postgraduate qualification and are pursuing an undergraduate qualification cannot be considered for funding.  In addition, persons pursuing a second undergraduate degree cannot, in general, avail of the Free Fees Initiative.Eligibility for the Back to Education Allowance is determined and administered by the Department of Social Protection and is primarily a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection.

The OPW has been instructed to negotiate the acquisition of a site for the school and my officials are in ongoing liaison with OPW on the matter.Due to commercial sensitivities attaching to site acquisitions generally, I am not in a position to comment further at this time.The progression of a project for the school, from site acquisition through to the initial design stage and construction will be considered in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the Department's capital budget, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of a project for the school at this time.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1415	Based on current demographic trends my Department anticipates that there will be a need for a further post-primary school in the Lucan area in the medium term.Given the changing nature of Irish society and the projected need for a number of post primary schools to open in the medium term, the Department is considering a number of broad policy issues regarding the establishment of new post-primary schools.  As part of this, consideration is being given to the setting up of a new framework in relation to the establishment of new second-level schools and their patronage.  New schools where only very initial planning has taken place will be considered in the context of this framework when it is established.The second-level school at Clonburris in Lucan is the only such school where a VEC has already been informed about patronage.  It is not the case that patronage of this school has been withdrawn from County Dublin VEC rather the position is that the issue will receive further consideration in the light of the new framework.  It was anticipated in 2008 that 2 new second level schools would be required in the general Clonburris area in Lucan.  However, given the demographics in relation to the area and the nature of the planning, design and building process, no building has commenced yet and it is likely that only a single school will be needed in the area in the medium term.The consideration of this new framework is not delaying the site acquisition, planning, design and building of second-level schools in any way.In addition to the County Dublin VEC, an application has been made by Educate Together in relation to the proposed new school in Lucan.  Furthermore, a general application in relation to schools in developing areas has also been received from the Loreto Education Trust.

Once the preferred bidder has satisfied the required terms and conditions and submitted the necessary documentation to the Department, assuming no issues arise and the land transfer has been completed, the contracts will be signed and the project can progress to construction.

The costs in question are being met from my Department's existing administrative budget allocation.The following table lists all of the costs incurred to date arising from the change in my Department's title. It is anticipated that all of the necessary conversions will have been fully implemented by the end of this month. While it is possible that some further minor costs may arise it is not anticipated that these, if any, will significantly increase the total cost as outlined in the table.Department of Education and SkillsCost TypeCost (incl.

It should be noted that the cost shown does not take account of the fact that some of the stocks ordered on this occasion would have had to be ordered in the normal course of replenishing stocks. Accordingly, the total cost indicated here is not directly attributable to the change in the Department's title.

The proposed merger has the support and agreement of the Governing Boards of both institutions and they are currently working to a target of September 2011 for completion of the arrangements for a formal merger.  The infrastructural needs of the emerging unified organisation will be examined on completion of the merger.

It is a matter for each institution to determine how the block grant received from the HEA is allocated internally.   My Department allocates capital funding directly to the Institutes of Technology.Details of recurrent funding, provided by the HEA to Athlone IT, and capital funding, provided directly by my Department, in the years 2007 to 2009 and to date in 2010 are as follows:Year€200727,944,407200828,709,272200927,274,039201012,708,907Year€20072,485,553200819,298,882200910,852,6642010727,844

However, the decision on eligibility for a student grant is a matter, in the first instance, for the relevant assessing authority, i.e. the applicant's local authority or VEC.An applicant may appeal the decision to the relevant local authority or VEC.  Where the assessing authority decides to reject the appeal, the applicant may appeal this decision to my Department by submitting an appeal form outlining  clearly the grounds for the appeal.The candidate referred to by the Deputy should apply to her local authority or VEC to establish her entitlement to a student grant for 2010/2011 academic year.

The provision of accommodation for a school with provisional recognition is a matter for the Patron and Board of Management in the first instance.In April 2010, the school authorities submitted a proposal to my Department to relocate to a new site to meet the accommodation needs for an additional teaching post sanctioned on foot of increased enrolments from September 2010. My officials considered the proposal and have requested the school authority to review the costings of their proposal.  My Department will consider any revised or new proposal that the school authority wishes to submit.
#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1432	Under the terms of my Department's Post Primary School Transport Scheme, a pupil is eligible for transport if s/he resides 4.8 kilometres or more from her/his local post primary education centre.The scheme is not designed to facilitate parents who choose to send their children to a post-primary centre outside of the catchment area in which they reside. However, children who are fully eligible for transport to the post-primary centre in the catchment area in which they reside, may apply for transport on a concessionary basis to a post-primary centre outside of their own catchment area — otherwise known as catchment boundary transport.  These children can only be facilitated if spare seats are available on the bus after all other eligible children travelling to their local post-primary centre have been catered for. Such children have to make their own way to the nearest pick up point within that catchment area.The Transport Liaison Officer of Co Leitrim has informed my Department that the pupils referred to in the details supplied are not attending a school in the catchment area in which they reside and may avail of catchment boundary transport subject to the terms outlined above.As the Deputy is aware, in line with the commitment in the Programme for Government, the review of the catchment boundaries formed part of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme.The report of the Value for Money Review of the School Transport Scheme is currently being finalised.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1433	The new post primary school referred to by the Deputy, is one of eight schools which were approved for inclusion in the 3rd Bundle of schools to be procured via Public Private Partnership.This bundle is in the pre procurement stage. Detailed output specifications and Public Sector Benchmark (PSB) have been finalised and outline planning permission has been received in respect of the eight schools. Following completion of the pre procurement process, the Bundle will be ready for handover to the National Development Finance Agency (NDFA) for procurement.The indicative timeframe for the delivery of a PPP school currently stands at approximately 4 years from the date the Bundle is announced.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1434	I propose to take Questions Nos. 735 and 736 together.Under the Institutes of Technology Acts, 1992 to 2006 the Institutes of Technology are autonomous statutory bodies. Under the legislation, the  Institutes' management authorities are responsible for their governance and operational management, including arrangements for dealing with legal issues relating to the running of the Institutes.Institutes are not required to notify my Department of legal actions taken by or involving the Institutes and the legal costs incurred, which are met from within the institutions' budgets.In regard to general funding my Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority (HEA) for direct disbursement to the Institutes of Technology.   It is a matter for each institution to determine how the block grant received from the HEA is allocated internally and my Department does not have details of the breakdown of individual items of expenditure by each institution. Accordingly, the information on legal fees in relation to the company and other firms referred to by the Deputy is not available in my Department. The HEA is working closely with the Institutes to effect economies and efficiencies across all levels of activity with a particular focus on the use of shared services.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1435	I propose to take Questions Nos. 737 and 738 together.In general, full-time fixed term contract appointments of ten years duration are awarded to Directors of Institutes of Technology (IOTs) / the President of  Dublin Institute of Technology (DIT) respectively.  These contracts are awarded subject to the terms of the Institutes of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006, and the  Dublin Institute of Technology Acts 1992 to 2006.These contracts are non renewable and there is no possibility of extending the contract beyond 10 years.  However, it should be pointed out that there is no impediment to existing post-holders re-applying for the post of Director/ President on the expiration of their contract on the basis that they would be subject to the same recruitment procedures as all applicants for the post.In light of the fact that the contract is non-renewable, a protocol was drawn up with DIT and with those Institutes under the ambit of the Institutes of  Technology of Ireland (IOTI) to clarify the position following the expiration of the 10 year period of the contract.  In line with this the arrangements on expiry of the 10 year contract terms are as set out below.  There are currently no plans to review these arrangements.  It should be noted however, that these arrangements do not apply to new entrants.Arrangements on expiry of 10-year contract:Upon the expiry of this fixed term contract, three options may be available, namely:(a) retire immediately from the Institute / DIT whereupon pension entitlements will be preserved until the appointee reaches age 60.  In this scenario, pension and lump sum will be calculated on the basis of service (including previous reckonable service) and salary as Director / President where salary as  Director/ President will be uprated, by reference to general pay increases, to the rate payable at age 60.or(b)  Where the Director / President is more than 50 years of age, retire immediately from the Institute / DIT with payment of actuarially-reduced superannuation benefitsor(c) receive from the Institute / DIT a contract of employment in the capacity of a personal-to-holder post equivalent to that of Secretary-Financial  Controller/Registrar/Head of Development in an Institute / Director in DIT commencing immediately at the end of the fixed term contract.  Such post will be under the same conditions and with the same remuneration as those equivalent posts within the Institute / DIT.  This new post would be pensionable and retirement would be compulsory on reaching age 65.In the event of the option at (c) above being taken up, the following arrangements will apply on retirement:(i) Pension and superannuation lump sum calculated on the basis of service (including previous reckonable service) and salary as Director / President where salary as Director / President will be uprated, by reference to general pay increases, to the rate payable on the date of retirement from the personal-to-holder post plus;(ii) Pension and superannuation lump sum calculated on the basis of subsequent service and salary in the personal-to-holder post (iii) No pension or superannuation lump sum payable until final retirement;(iv) A maximum limit of 40 years must apply on all reckonable service;(v) Professional added years, where applicable, must be appropriately reduced in the event of voluntary retirement before age 65.Employment in the education sector following retirement on pension:Where, following retirement on pension from the Institute / DIT, the pensioner takes up employment in the education sector of the public service, pension (where payable) will be continued provided that the aggregate of the rates of pay and pension do not exceed the pensionable remuneration, uprated to current rates, on which pension was based.  Where the rate of pay exceeds pensionable remuneration as uprated, pension is not payable.  Where the rate of pay is less than pensionable remuneration as uprated, but the aggregate of pay and pension exceeds the pensionable remuneration, the rate of pension is correspondingly reduced.The education sector of the public service includes all teaching posts funded by the Department of Education and Skills, all employment in recognised schools, Institutes of Technology/ DIT, Universities and Vocational Education  Committees and all employment in other bodies related to education and funded  by the Department of Education and Skills.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1437	To date in 2010 a total of €135.133m of this year's capital allocation of €578.8m for the primary and post-primary sectors has issued from my Department under the school building and modernisation programme.Arising from earlier announcements regarding the school building and modernisation programme, funding will be allocated to major school building projects as they progress through the various stages of the building programme.  Funding will also be expended throughout the year on site acquisitions as well as on a range of other capital schemes operated by my Department, such as the Summer Works Scheme, Emergency Works Scheme, the Permanent Accommodation and Small Schools Schemes, the Energy Efficiency Scheme and payment of the Minor Works Grant to primary schools.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1438	The Deputy will be aware that the need for budgetary adjustment has made it necessary to discontinue the Millennium Partnership Fund from the 2010/11 academic year. The fund was disbursed by local Partnership Companies, mostly in the form of small grants to individual students to cover costs of items such as books and travel. Most students in receipt of support from the fund will continue to be supported under the means-tested student maintenance grant schemes. In addition, third level students in difficult financial circumstances will continue to have access to the Student Assistance Fund.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1439	I can confirm to the Deputy that all the schools referred to by him have applied to my Department for capital funding.The progression of all large scale building projects from initial design stage through to construction phase is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under the Department's capital budget.Applications are assessed using published prioritisation criteria which were formulated following consultation with the Education Partners. There are four band ratings under these criteria, each of which describes the extent of accommodation required and the urgency attaching to it. Band 1 is the highest priority rating and Band 4 is the lowest. Documents explaining the band rating system are also available on my Department's website.I can confirm to the Deputy that a building project at the first school to which he refers is at an advanced stage of architectural planning.The second school to which the Deputy refers has agreed to amalgamate with another primary school in the town. My Department has approved grant aid to the school authority to provide accommodation for the amalgamated school.The third school referred to by the Deputy has applied for funding for a stand alone PE hall. The band rating under the prioritisation criteria for such a project is 4.1.In 2004, the fourth and the fifth schools referred to by the Deputy agreed to amalgamate. An application for capital works to facilitate the amalgamation was assessed within my Department and the project was assigned a band rating of  1.4.A technical inspection was carried out on the existing school buildings to determine which would be suitable to host the amalgamated school. The report produced following this inspection concluded that the most suitable building to facilitate the amalgamation would be the fifth mentioned school. It also found that an additional portion of land would be required from the Sisters of Mercy to facilitate the development. The Sisters of Mercy have indicated that they would, in principle, be disposed to selling land to the Department to facilitate the proposed works.The progression of this building project and the acquisition of the additional land required to facilitate the amalgamation, will be considered in the context  of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.The building projects referred to by the Deputy will be considered for progression in the context of my Department's multi-annual school building and modernisation programme.  However, in light of current competing demands on the capital budget of my Department, it is not possible to give an indicative timeframe for the progression of these projects at this time.

This report is the first of a number of reports due to be produced by the Educational Research Centre (ERC) as part of their evaluation of the DEIS action plan.DEIS, the Department’s Action Plan for Educational Inclusion was published in 2005.
A vital element of the DEIS initiative is the commitment to develop and implement an in-depth programme of research and evaluation to inform policy formation and to facilitate a better understanding of the role which interventions have to play in the achievement of better outcomes for children targeted by the DEIS action plan.In this context, the Department has commissioned the Educational Research Centre (ERC) to conduct an independent evaluation of measures in the School Support Programme (SSP) over the period of the DEIS action plan to 2010.
The ERC produced a report on Rural Disadvantage in March 2009, entitled “Educational Disadvantage in Primary Schools in Rural Areas”.
The costs of the evaluation of DEIS are largely being borne by the ERC as part of their contract with the Department.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2010-07-08 00:00:00	Prelude	1447	I can confirm that no Secretary General and three Assistant Secretaries General, from my Department, have retired over the last five years. The lump sums for the three officers totalled €464,777. The three officers in question retired under different schemes. As a result, the percentage of final salary that their lump sums represent is different in each case. i.e. in the case of the voluntary retirement with full service the lump sum represented 150% of their final salary, in the case of the early retirement it represented 86% of their final salary and in respect of the Incentivised Scheme of Early Retirement (ISER) it represented 119% of their final salary. In the case of the ISER, 10% of the lump sum has been paid to date and the remaining 90% will be paid when the officer reaches the relevant normal preserved pension age, 60 or 65 years, as appropriate.It should be noted that all lump sum superannuation benefits (i.e. retirement lump sums and all gratuities) are calculated by reference to pensionable remuneration and reckonable service (Pensionable remuneration is the aggregate of pensionable salary and any pensionable benefits which are additional to basic salary). The retirement lump sum is calculated as 3/80ths of this pensionable remuneration for each year of reckonable service, subject to a maximum of 1.5 times pensionable remuneration.
