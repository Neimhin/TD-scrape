#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	0	Today the board of CIE meets to make a decision to close by stealth a number of rail freight lines and, as a consequence, a number of rail passenger lines throughout the country. The consequence of this decision will be to force thousands of extra trucks onto overcrowded and inadequate roads. It is bad regional policy, bad rail policy, bad freight policy, bad road safety policy and bad governance, which is compounded by the fact that the strategic rail review has not yet been published. Will the Taoiseach ask the Minister for Transport to instruct the CIE board not to make such a decision until the strategic rail review has been published and the House has had a chance to discuss it in order that we can give our views on the future of rail policy at a time when the pleasure has gone out of driving because roads are congested and on road safety as the Government by stealth will force thousands of extra trucks onto overcrowded and dangerous roads?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I do not want to interfere with the decision of a semi-State body as that would be entirely inappropriate—
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	2	It is contrary to Government policy.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	3	—but Deputy Kenny is correct that the board of CIE will consider the future of rail freight at its meeting today in the wake of the IFI closure, in particular. The Minister for Transport expects to hear the outcome of those deliberations shortly thereafter to enable consideration of the future strategic direction of the rail sector in the light of the board's analysis of the situation and the strategic rail review.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	4	On a point of order—

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	6	—the Minister for Transport told us he had given an instruction that no decision would be made until the strategic review was published. Is that not the case?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	7	The Deputy has no right to intervene at this stage. It is Deputy Kenny's question.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	8	In reply to the second part of Deputy Kenny's question, the Minister for Transport has engaged consultants, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, an international rail consultancy firm, to undertake a major strategic review of Irish railways, of which the purpose is to provide the Government with a basis for establishing a strategic policy framework for the future development of the rail sector over the next two decades. It will embrace both rail freight and passenger services; address urban, commuter and inter-regional rail services, and examine the long-term rail requirements of the country as a whole in the light of emerging spatial planning and regional development policies. The review is due to be completed by the end of this year.The conclusion, in reply to the first part of Deputy Kenny's question, is that whatever decision is made today will hold until the completion of that work. Whatever decision is made will go to the Minister and no action will be taken. He will complete the review by his consultants, Booz-Allen & Hamilton, and take into account what has been said by the board. However, there will be one total decision which will not be influenced by anything that happens today.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	9	The position is that today the board of CIE will make a decision to close the rail freight section of its business. That means it will be closed before the end of the month and, therefore, before the strategic review is published. It also means less maintenance will be required on the lines affected and that this is a closure by stealth. The solution put forward by the Minister for Transport, who is not present, is to charge citizens to drive into this city, which makes a mockery of good governance, a good spatial strategy and good regional development planning. Hundreds of thousands of people would use the rail service if it was modern, efficient and professional. However, following the board's decision today, the rail freight division will be closed before the strategic review is published. If CIE decides to cease the rail freight service on a number of lines today, will the Government reverse the decision in the light of what emerges in the strategic review when published?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	10	I will not interfere with a State board's right to make a decision, particularly one on which worker-directors sit, but whatever decision is made, it will not be enacted in any form until the strategic rail review is completed. The decision holds until that is examined by the Minister.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	11	The worker-directors are fundamentally opposed to it.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	12	Correct.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	13	I want to revisit yesterday's refusal by the Taoiseach to answer questions put to him about the effective dismantling of the community employment scheme. Is it the case that his own backbenchers share the concern of this side of the House at the destruction of community employment? Does the Taoiseach agree it is pointless putting questions to him after the publication of the Book of Estimates? His backbenchers are in need of support now from this side of the House. Does he acknowledge the beneficial and productive work being done in the community by community employment? Does he acknowledge that disadvantaged communities in particular will suffer as a result of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment's proposals to reduce the number from 28,000 to 15,500 next year? Will he intervene to prevent her and the Minister for Finance colluding to inflict further pain on the communities most in need of the effort put in by community employment? Will he side with his backbenchers against the McCreevy-Harney axis? The work being done in parts of my constituency – I know Deputy O'Connor will tell the Taoiseach at the parliamentary party meeting later this morning about the valuable work being done in the community – is replicated in every constituency throughout the country. There will not be any point giving answers to the House after the publication of the Book of Estimates. Will the Taoiseach prevent that happening at this time?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	14	As I said yesterday, I replied to the position for 2002. I am not in a position to reply for 2003. I am glad that community employment has become popular. I remember when the social employment scheme was first set up by Deputy Quinn – it later became the community employment scheme which I, as Minister for Finance, extended considerably – it was seen as an excuse for dodging the high unemployment figures of the day. I am glad the House is concerned about its enormous social value. A review is being undertaken by FÁS and the number will be clear in the Estimates. The figure for this year is 25,000. There are also training schemes. The PPF mandated a review of active labour market programmes, including the CE. That is currently in progress under the standing committee on the labour market which includes all the relevant people.Deputy Rabbitte mentioned its value to the community. It is of benefit to the health and education sectors, although it has changed in terms of the latter as it now has a permanent role in that sector. There are some aspects of it which can be streamlined. There is little value in some parts of it, but other parts have enormous value. I am sure it will continue in the future after the review is completed. I and my backbenchers support it. The necessary resources are available to keep a meaningful number of people on community employment. It is a major difficulty when we have to give work permits to people from outside the country to do jobs that many people on community employment are well able to do and should be given an opportunity to do. That option should be there. It should not be seen as an end in itself or as a permanent job because that was not the intention. We will try to move people away from community employment and into meaningful employment. The review will assist in that regard.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	15	It is not a question of continuing the scheme in the future but of whether the Taoiseach will prevent the reduction of participants in the scheme to 15,500. There is no point telling the House the situation for 2002 as it is almost over. We are concerned about 2003 before the Book of Estimates is published. The Taoiseach referred to the review being carried out by FÁS. Is it the case that FÁS is carrying out the review only at the political direction of the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment? As regards the transfer of places to the Department of Education and Science, is it the case that they are already factored into this year's figures? If the Taoiseach is not concerned at the prospect of Deputy O'Connor raising this issue at the PLP meeting, I can threaten him with Deputy Conor Lenihan because he will also raise it.
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	16	The Deputy's minute has concluded.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Will the Taoiseach side with his backbenchers or with the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, to prevent this happening?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I hope Deputies O'Connor and Conor Lenihan are not at the PLP meeting because that is the parliamentary Labour Party meeting.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	19	I am only slightly premature.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	20	I said yesterday I did not believe the figure of 13,000 or 15,500 was under discussion. It is not just a question of a review, but a review of active labour market programmes. It is useful in that regard. I accept the point about the benefit of community employment in areas where it is useful. It is not always popular to say that all community employment schemes are not useful. However, a large proportion of them are and that means we must continue to keep a large number of people on them. I will continue to argue that point. It will come up in the Estimates. It is important as part of the review that we do not portray community employment as a long-term job for people, while we continue to bring in an inordinate number of people to do jobs in the hotel, catering, security and labour industries. That is incorrect and it is of concern to the trade union movement, to me and to everyone else.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	21	I want to press the Taoiseach further on the decision of Iarnród Éireann. The Taoiseach said he will not interfere in a decision by Iarnród Éireann to close half its rail freight service. Who makes or should make transport policy in the State? Is it the Government or an appointed board which is supposed to carry out the Government's policies? Does the Taoiseach agree that in terms of Iarnród Éireann's proposal, rhetoric by the Government in favour of public transport must now give way to concrete choices? Does he agree the experience of all modern industrial societies, including our own, is that the promotion of road over rail transport is disastrous in terms of traffic gridlock, quality of life and the pollution of our environment? Does the Taoiseach agree that rail transport should be promoted over road transport and that the decision by Iarnród Éireann is going in the wrong direction?
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Luas has arrived.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	23	Will the Taoiseach leave aside niceties and instruct CIE not to accept any disastrous decision taken by Iarnród Éireann about its freight system and to suspend two passenger lines?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I am not sure if Deputy Joe Higgins was here for Deputy Kenny's question.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I was.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	26	I will repeat my answer.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	27	No.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	29	I will not repeat myself totally.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	31	The Deputy repeated what Deputy Kenny said or at least part of what he said.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	32	As the Taoiseach did not answer him, I did not have an option.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	33	I did answer him. I will give the answer in one sentence and then I will say a few more things. Whatever decision CIE makes today in its discussions, which it is entitled to make as a board and I will not interfere in that, the Minister has made it clear that it will not be acted on until the strategic review by Booz-Allen & Hamilton is complete. The Minister for Transport and the Government continue to put enormous resources into the rail safety investment programme to enable the extended use of rail transport. We have upgraded Heuston Station and many other stations. Suburban rail and DART services have been expanded.

The Allen Hamilton report, the international rail consultancy report, will set out a major strategic view of Irish railways. No major decision will be made by the Minister until that report has been concluded.

#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Does the Taoiseach agree it would be nonsensical for the CIE board to make a decision to accept the closure of half the freight transport service, as proposed by Irish Rail, when, as he suggests, the Government may reverse such a decision? Is that not a nonsensical way to plan public transport? In terms of one specific consequence of closing half the freight service, does he agree it would be detrimental, to say the least, if instead of a train travelling from Dublin to Sligo with oil, 75 megatankers had to take to the roads and clog them up further to make up for the discontinuation of that train? Does he agree that would be disastrous?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	46	The board of CIE has to take account of changed circumstances in the wake of the closure of IFI, its main freight user. The reality is that freight is making substantial losses and is about to make even greater losses. The company must examine its overall position and take that into account. It would not be doing its job if this was not the case. The Minister then has to take account of what the board is saying, which must fit in with the overall international rail consultancy report, and consider the report, which will be finalised by the end of the year, before he makes final decisions. As Deputy Rabbitte said, the end of the year is not too far off.

They are members of the Committee on European Integration who are led by their chairman, Mr. Pavel Svoboda.On my behalf and on behalf of the Members of Dáil Éireann I extend to you, Mr. Svoboda, and members of your delegation a most sincere welcome. I express the hope that you will find your visit to be interesting, successful and to our mutual benefit.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	51	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 7, inclusive, together.The commission of inquiry is engaged in writing its report, which Mr. Justice Barron expects to complete early in the new year. The commission of inquiry received certain information from the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, last March and has received no further communication since. It is not proposed to widen the independent commission of inquiry's terms of reference further.Deputies will be aware that Mr. Justice Barron is also examining the case of Seamus Ludlow in addition to other cases, including the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and the Castleblayney bombing of 1976, to which I referred in previous replies. The costs relating to the independent commission of inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings amount to €1,625,084.62, including the legal engagement with the inquiry by Justice for the Forgotten.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	52	The last time I and others raised this question in the House the Taoiseach indicated he was passing on a letter to the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, from Mr. Justice Barron in respect of the level of co-operation being received from the British authorities about the Dublin and Monaghan bombings. Arising from that letter, has the Taoiseach had further contact with the British Prime Minister and is he happy that a satisfactory level of co-operation has been reached?Will the Taoiseach comment on a directive sent out by the British Ministry of Defence to former employees it engaged in the 1970s instructing them not to provide information to the families of the victims of the atrocities? Does he not believe this kind of directive adds to the suspicion and perception that something is not above board?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	53	I will address the two questions the Deputy raised separately. Deputies will be aware that I raised the issue of the co-operation of the British authorities with the British Prime Minister on a number of occasions. The British Prime Minister is aware that we want maximum co-operation from the British authorities. More recently, the issue was raised at the Anglo-Irish Secretariat during the recent meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference. At that meeting the Minister for Foreign Affairs again raised the matter with the then Secretary of State, Dr. John Reid, who stated that further material would be forthcoming. That material is awaited.I am aware of the letter to which the Deputy refers and I am surprised by both its tone and contents. I had the matter raised immediately through the Anglo-Irish Secretariat as soon as I became aware of it. A response has been received reiterating the Prime Minister's undertaking to respond as positively as possible to Mr. Justice Barron's request for material. It further stated that the British Government had made it clear to former employees that the decision on whether to co-operate with Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry is a matter for the individuals concerned and not the British Government. I hope Mr. Justice Barron will receive all the information he requires from all sources.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	54	On a further point—
#RoryOHanlon	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-party	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-dob	unknown-#RoryOHanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	55	I will return to you, Deputy.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	56	I ask permission to conclude with a supplementary question. On 17 May 1974, 33 people were killed in Dublin. If it transpires that, following the Taoiseach's further intervention with the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, insufficient co-operation is received or the agencies on both sides of the Border and the British Government do not provide the truth, will the Taoiseach consider establishing a formal inquiry to investigate the decisions that lay behind the Dublin and Monaghan bombings?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	57	As the commission is entirely independent, I am not aware of the information it has gathered to date. I do not know the import of the commission's information or how it will affect its final report. In order for conclusions to be drawn on the basis of the best information possible, it is important that the information requested is made available. As soon as we see the report, I will honour my commitment to bring it to the relevant committee, after which we will have to examine the options.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	58	The Taoiseach stated that the information promised by Dr. John Reid is still awaited. Is that the same as saying it has not been furnished? Does he have any reason to believe this information will be forthcoming and that the requisite files will be supplied? What communication has the Taoiseach had from Mr. Justice Barron? Is it his Lordship's view that this inquiry is running into the ground because of lack of co-operation from the British side. Arising from his discussions with his opposite number, Prime Minister Blair, does the Taoiseach have reason to believe this is likely to change, especially given the communication made by the British Ministry of Defence, to which Deputy Kenny referred, instructing current and former staff not to co-operate with the inquiry? It is highly unlikely that this is not the uniform position of the British authorities.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	59	I reiterate that Mr. Justice Barron is independent and, therefore, does not answer to me on a day-to-day basis. It is important to make that clear. I am well aware he is trying to get as much information as he can from the British authorities, as he has set out, and he has had direct dealings with those authorities at a very senior level regarding this matter. Following meetings I had earlier this year with the Prime Minister, Tony Blair, and Secretary of State, John Reid, he received information, but I do not know what its content is. I confirm to the House that Mr. Justice Barron is seeking other information and that the British authorities are aware of the information he seeks. As I said at the British-Irish intergovernmental meeting on or around 22 October, those authorities indicated that they would pass on further material. I will be meeting the new Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, this afternoon and, among other issues, I will raise this matter again and ask that any outstanding information be made available. As I said in my reply, Mr. Justice Barron is writing the report and it is not run into the ground, but the more information he has, the better the quality of his report will be. Its quality will not result from any fault of his – the more information he has the more authority he will report with.Regarding the Deputy's last question, from my many discussions of this over a long period and appreciating that we received information but would like to see further material, what concerns me is whether the information exists and where it is. I assume if it was in the Departments it would have been uncovered at this stage, but perhaps some of the information is elsewhere in the security structure. I am not sure of that, but I must be frank and say that I suspect it may be the case. If it is, God knows whether we will see the information, but regarding the information it has been possible to acquire, Mr. Justice Barron has done an enormous job as did the late Justice Hamilton before him. Although I am not aware of precisely what is sought, it is available in the British system and I feel duty bound to press as hard as we can to have the information made available or at least as much of it as politicians can get their hands on.
#TonyGregory	unknown-#TonyGregory-party	unknown-#TonyGregory-dob	unknown-#TonyGregory-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	60	On the same point, is it not the case that this inquiry has been going on for nearly three years and that the main reason it has dragged on for this length of time is the lack of co-operation by the British Government, as has been said by previous speakers? Following the Taoiseach's intervention earlier this year, a small amount of relatively innocuous material was sent to the tribunal and its inadequate nature led Mr. Justice Barron to send, months ago, a list of specific items on which he needed responses. I ask the Taoiseach to confirm that the list has received no response to date. The Taoiseach is aware that, in light of recent revelations regarding Richie Barron, the families of the victims are extremely concerned that the fullest public scrutiny of the Garda inquiry into the bombings, during which known suspects were not questioned, cannot be provided by an Oireachtas committee following the Abbeylara decision. It is no longer an adequate way of dealing with this commission's report, which will produce huge amounts of material after a three year investigation, and the only way to resolve the issue now is through the establishment of a tribunal of inquiry.
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	61	I agree with much of the background of what Deputy Gregory has said, but I cannot agree with his comment that the information was innocuous. As I replied to Deputy Rabbitte, I do not know what Mr. Justice Barron has received. I understand he received quite an amount of information though not all of it, which is why he is seeking the rest. It is not correct to say that the inquiry has been held up because of lack of information. Mr. Justice Barron has gone through all the information that has been provided here. He has had total access to the Garda files the Deputy mentions, to those of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform and those of the other relevant agencies. He has had access to all the information that is on the public record and that available elsewhere and it has taken an enormous amount of time to go through all that. He is not just covering the 1974 Dublin and Monaghan bombings, he has also gone through a number of other cases that relate to that period, such as the Castleblayney bomb of 1976, the Dublin bombings of 1972 and 1973 and the murders of John Francis Green and Bríd Carr, and he has also been involved in an extensive examination of the case of Seamus Ludlow. They were additional cases which we asked him to take on late last year and earlier this year. It would be helpful if the remaining information he wants was made available. I assure the House I will be urging the British authorities, through the new Secretary of State, to do that.In relation to Deputy Gregory's last point, when I set up this committee with all-party support in the House I stated I would give an undertaking that when the report was completed we would do our best with it, bring it to the committee and look at where to go from there. Deputy Gregory is right to say that the committee would have to take legal advice on how to proceed, taking into account the Supreme Court judgment to which he refers, but as I have said many times, we have to see, based on Mr. Justice Barron's report and the work done by the late Mr. Justice Hamilton, if anything more can be achieved through a public inquiry. That can only be considered after deliberation of the work.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	62	The Taoiseach must be aware of suggestions that information has not been forthcoming to the Barron inquiry to a sufficient degree. Does he agree that shows very bad faith by the Prime Minister, Tony Blair? One element of the Good Friday Agreement agreed between the Taoiseach's Government and that of Britain is that it is essential to acknowledge and address the suffering of the victims of violence, meaning that there is a treaty basis to a commitment to address the victims of the Dublin and Monaghan bombings, including the families. Crucial to addressing their suffering is the obtaining of full information. Does the Taoiseach, therefore, agree it is incumbent on the British Prime Minister to order every Department in his Administration to hand over any information it has? It is insufficient merely to make the request of the new Secretary of State who cannot command each Department in the way the Prime Minister can. What commitments has the Prime Minister given? Has he given a commitment that all available information will be handed over and if that has not happened what is the problem?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	63	I reiterate what I said to Deputies Kenny, Rabbitte and Gregory. Mr. Justice Barron and the late Mr. Justice Hamilton examined an amount of information and from their examination of all the records and files they concluded that there are issues within the British establishment on which it would be useful to have information. However, it is not clear if such information exists. To his credit, the British Prime Minister has given me and others a clear position on this. He gave an instruction that anything that is there should be passed over. If Mr. Justice Barron believes there is information that has not been handed over, I can only conclude that it is not readily available or is in the security system. Given the way the British system works, it always seems to be difficult to get information in that system, as any of us who have dealt with Northern Ireland over the past ten years or more will be aware. That is a fact of life.As Deputy Higgins will be aware, I cannot go to the security people to get this information. I can go only to the British Prime Minister. I do not know how many times I have raised this matter with him, but it must be more than ten.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	65	The Deputy heard what I said. I have made it clear that whatever Mr. Justice Barron is seeking to get should be passed over. I believe that should and will happen in so far as Prime Minister Blair has control over it. Mr. Justice Barron has made the request for material clear, although I am not sure what it is, but when I meet Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, today I will make it clear that this House is not happy about this. I will relay to him what has been said by all parties, that information should be passed over. If we were to set up a public sworn inquiry, the difficulty is that it is unlikely we would get this information. We will get it this way or we will not get it at all. That is why it is important to keep pressing for it.

We can only try to comprehend the anxiousness and the frustration of the families of the bereaved, which has been reflected repeatedly to me by people I know. I knew people who were killed in this tragic visitation on both communities. This is something of which we must take charge. The idea that the British authorities, in their widest understanding, are continuing to withhold essential information from Mr. Justice Barron's efforts to get to the full truth of what happened leading up to, on the day and subsequent to that tragic day in May 1974, is unacceptable.The Taoiseach indicated he will raise this matter with the new Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, this afternoon, which I have no doubt he will. However, what does he intend to say to him to reflect not only the frustration of Members of this House, but the ongoing hurt and anxiety of the many families who continue to suffer due to the absence of trust and justice in regard to this event? Deputy Dempsey will probably share my concern and that of other families, but I do not know what it is that he thinks is worth sniggering about at this time.

What action will he take if the British Government maintains its obstinate refusal to co-operate fully with Mr. Justice Barron in this inquiry?In relation to commitments the Taoiseach made, there is not only a failure on the part of the British Government. On the allied issue of the report presented by the former Tánaiste, Mr. John Wilson, it was indicated here last November 12 months, in response to a question I put to the Taoiseach, that he expected Mr. Wilson's report to be dealt with, acted upon and implemented within the lifetime of the previous Dáil. That was the response he gave and it is on record that was his intention, but that has not happened. The many people who co-operated—

I again ask a question I have asked repeatedly, when does the Taoiseach and the Government intend to act on the report of the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, on the Victims' Commission, and will he give a full and frank response to that today?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	71	Deputy Ó Caoláin will appreciate I answered most of the points raised, although he asked me two direct questions, which I will answer. He asked what I will say to Secretary of State, Paul Murphy, today. I will reiterate to him that Mr. Justice Barron has commenced the completion of his report and that to obtain the fullness of that report to the satisfaction of this House which agreed to set up this process, we want the additional information Mr. Justice Barron requested. That is what I will be seeking.Regarding the Deputy's second question on the report of the Victims' Commission, following the publication of the Wilson report, the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform initiated a consultation process with all the interested Departments and all public agencies affected by its recommendations, which he had promised to do at the time, with a view to drawing up an implementation plan, which he had also promised to do. I wish to thank the former Tánaiste, John Wilson, for his work in this area some years ago.Prior to the summer, the Government agreed a range of measures recommended in the Wilson report, including the assigning of a high ranking official in my Department to advance and monitor the implementation of all the recommendations contained in the report. In addition, in respect of the recommendations relating to financial assistance and as a variation on the recommendations contained in the report, the Government agreed, in principle, to the establishment of a trust fund – a fund analogous to the memorial fund in Northern Ireland – to address the financial needs of the victims of the conflict in Northern Ireland and their families in this jurisdiction. A working group of officials from Departments are drawing up detailed proposals for the operation of that fund. I understand that the working group expects to be in a position to report to Government with legislative proposals, which will be required for the establishment of the trust, before Christmas – this month if I recall correctly. A final figure has not been put on the amount of money to be made available to the trust, but that will be necessary as part of the decision.In addition, a number of the recommendations made in the report of the Victims' Commission have been, or are being, implemented. Deputies will be aware of the progress made regarding the inquiries into the Dublin, Monaghan and Dundalk bombings. Mr. Justice Barron will consider other cases in his report, the Castleblayney bombing, the case of Bríd Carr, which were mentioned in the report, and he will undertake an inquiry into the case of Seamus Ludlow.Funding has also been provided to the group, Justice for the Forgotten, in respect of the provision of a family support centre, which was a recommendation of the report. The Department of Health and Children also provided funding for counselling in the aftermath of Omagh and in respect of some other cases, which is also mentioned in the report.We are mindful of the pain and trauma suffered over the years by the victims of violence in Northern Ireland – all the victims of all violence in Northern Ireland. It is important to make sure there is an appropriate and sympathetic response by the State to the needs of those who have suffered so much. What I have said gives a full report on this matter.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	72	When I was 13 years old I remember clearly my mother thinking that my brother, sister and father, who were in Dublin on the night of the bombing, 17 May 1974, had been wiped out. Unfortunately, relations of many families were wiped out on that night as well as in other incidents in other parts of the Republic in 1972, 1973, 1975 and 1976.When the Taoiseach meets the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, this afternoon will he ask him whether, hypothetically, he would countenance the current Taoiseach or any Taoiseach standing over a refusal by the security forces in the Republic to co-operate with, for example, the investigation into the Omagh bombing? What would the British establishment say if the word went out that the security forces here were not to co-operate with such an investigation? That is the context of the outrage in this country at the Ministry of Defence in Britain telling its former employees not to respond to requests for information from the Barron inquiry. Will the Taoiseach articulate that outrage? Is he himself enraged or has he expressed or indicated the extent of people's outrage? We can discuss cold facts and statistics, but it must be appreciated it would be outrageous if the security forces here were not to co-operate with the Omagh inquiry. The situation is the same in the context of the shoe being on the other foot.I hope the Taoiseach will be able to articulate the level of outrage among people in this country. Will he indicate when he believes the Barron inquiry will be completed? Is he in a position to inform the relatives that the Barron inquiry will clearly take time to complete or that, because of the extent and substance of the information it has uncovered, there will be a need to set up a tribunal to discover what really happened and establish who was involved in and responsible for those atrocities? Will the Taoiseach indicate what he will say to the relatives after his meeting with the Secretary of State, Mr. Murphy, what will he say to the Secretary of State and how will he articulate the outrage among people in this country at the refusal of the British authorities to co-operate in terms of providing information?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	73	Perhaps I could deal again with a number of points. I take on board what Deputy Sargent has said. I believe he will acknowledge that it was I who commenced this process after 25 years and that I was not pressed by anybody, other than the relatives who continued to approach me and other Members during that period, to do so. I do not believe we need to discuss in detail the level of outrage among people. What we are trying to do is discover as much of the truth as possible. I know many of the families of people who died in the Dublin bombings and other Members know the relatives of those who were killed in the Monaghan bombings.As Deputy Rabbitte stated earlier, the issue is that the bombings took place almost 30 years ago. As we know from the Bloody Sunday tribunal, it is not that easy to piece together information about all of the individuals involved, establish what were the possible links between members of the security forces and paramilitary groups, etc. The inquiry is concerned with trying to get to the bottom of this matter. The work of Mr. Justice Barron is nearing completion. He is writing his report and it will hopefully be finished early in the new year. The one remaining aspect is to obtain as much information from the British system as is now available. I frankly do not know whether that information is available.I reiterate that I was surprised at the tone and content of the letter in question. We raised it through the British-Irish Secretariat and we received a firm commitment that the British Government made it clear to the employees that they could co-operate. The employees have been informed that this is not a matter for the British Government, it is a matter for them. We were also informed in recent weeks that Mr. Justice Barron would receive all the information – that which is available – he requires from all sources.The question is, what is available and who might have it? That is the difficulty we face in light of the fact that so many years have passed. We must also ask if some of this information was ever documented or if it took the form of allegations? That I do not know. I have my own suspicion and not even with the benefit of Dáil privilege would I be prepared to reveal that suspicion. I hope Mr. Justice Barron will assist in that area. I am aware that he has been trying very hard to achieve progress. However, we must wait to see what his work uncovers.I wish to use this extensive debate on Question Time to make it clear that, even with the passage of so many years, the House remains extremely concerned. The British authorities should do all they can as quickly as possible to answer Mr. Justice Barron's questions. As I informed Deputy Gregory, I do not know the extent to which those questions have been answered and I accept his point that they have not been answered in full. We want the judge's questions answered in full and I will make that position clear.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I have a particular interest in this issue because I was a teacher in North Great George's Street at the time and some of my students were injured and were taken to hospital. When I returned to the area later that evening, I witnessed the indescribable carnage in Parnell Street. If the bomb had exploded an hour earlier, hundreds of girls from Loreto College and hundreds of boys from Belvedere College, who walked home down North Great George's Street and on to Parnell Street, could have been killed or injured. There could have been absolute mayhem.After 28 years, we are not one step closer to discovering what happened, how it happened and who was responsible for it. This was the greatest atrocity in the entire period of the Troubles. We know that the Garda investigation that took place at the time ran into the sand at the Border and that there was no co-operation from the RUC. With the Good Friday Agreement and the advent of the new police service in Northern Ireland, would it not be possible to achieve progress on this matter? Is the Taoiseach prepared to publish the findings of the initial Garda inquiry? Is he also prepared to state what was the outcome of those findings and to indicate both the difficulties the Garda experienced in pursuing the perpetrators beyond the Border and the extent of the lack of co-operation from the RUC?Does the Taoiseach agree that the families affected by these atrocities have not achieved closure and that they have suffered enormously? Many family members lost their dear ones and have endured great emotional distress and financial hardship. There must be closure in respect of this matter. However, there is no indication that, after 28 years, such closure will be achieved, whether it be in terms of allaying the enormous suffering experienced by families or in terms of what we would expect in relation to a terrible outrage of this nature, namely, the provision of financial compensation by those who perpetrated it. Will the Taoiseach indicate when closure might be achieved? Is he in a position to say when the report might finally be delivered to us in order that we might put this matter to rest once and for all?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	75	The commission of inquiry is engaged in writing its report, which Mr. Justice Barron expects to complete early in the new year. I reiterate that we are discussing a particular aspect of this matter. I regularly meet representatives of Justice for the Forgotten and the relatives. I have had sessions with the entire group of relatives, many of whom live abroad or in different parts of Ireland. They are extremely grateful to the House for the work being carried out by Mr. Justice Barron and they do not have a sense of being betrayed. They are grateful for the amount of work, effort and commitment that has been invested by Mr. Justice Barron and others in trawling through the data. For 25 years they were not grateful because all of the information was in existence but nothing happened. However, things were different then.Since I began considering this matter in 1998 or 1999, I have found it hard to understand how the system operated during the period in question. It was difficult for Governments at the time because there was a security threat to the State, many paramilitary groups were operating and there was great pressure on the authorities. With regard to the original report of the Garda, which Deputy Costello mentioned, the facts surrounding that have long been in the public domain. That report actually closed within a matter of weeks, which we find hard to understand now. Even though it is four and a half years since the Omagh bombing there is still a huge number of personnel working on it each day. At that time, however, the entire operation closed down within five or six weeks. I cannot understand that but that was how it happened. We just have to accept it, we cannot change it. All we can do is try to uncover the facts. What happened then is that they moved on. What we have to do—

I do not want to get into what happened in 1976. I do not blame the Administration of the day or any other Administration for any of these cases. They were faced with all kinds of horrendous problems. That is the reality, although it is hard to accept and understand it now. I went through this with the relatives for a long time one night. It is not easy.We have an obligation now and we are trying to carry out that task. We should finish the report. Mr. Justice Barron has gone through every shred of information he could get his hands on. It is an enormous amount, as I know from the volumes of records. He and the people assisting him have worked hard on it, as have Justice for the Forgotten and the families and legal experts who co-operated with him. We are coming to the end. Whether it will bring closure, I do not know but we will then move it on a further stage. I will relay the one outstanding part to Secretary of State Paul Murphy today. We cannot say that nothing has been achieved. We have moved a step further; indeed, we have moved a long way on this.

I am a little concerned about one of the Taoiseach's remarks earlier in which he seemed to imply that if we do not get the information from the British Government this way, we probably will not get it at all. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that should the British Government fail to co-operate, it will not be used as an excuse to avoid having full public scrutiny by way of a tribunal of inquiry into the huge amount of material that has been gathered by the commission? The only way to deal with that material is through a public tribunal of inquiry. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that this will happen regardless of whether the British Government co-operates?

Does he regard that as acceptable? Will he express equal outrage to that response? It is the same as the Ministry of Defence saying: "Do not co-operate." It is offering an excuse for non-co-operation. Will the Taoiseach pursue this matter and not be fobbed off by that assurance? I am pleased the Taoiseach has set up the inquiry.

An explanation is required for the continued obstinacy on the part of a section of the British establishment and that is the only logical explanation I can offer. Does the Taoiseach share that view?
#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	85	In response to Deputy Gregory's question, if I gave that impression, that was not my wish. It has to be taken in the context of the final report and then it has to be examined. No excuse should be accepted then, so I am not saying a tribunal ultimately will be ruled out because we have not got information. I wish to make that clear.With regard to Deputy Sargent's question, the tone and content of those letters were wrong and unacceptable. That is why I tried extremely hard to ensure we got clarification that that was not an instruction to the staff, that it was not the British Government's position and that there was no block on the information. We got the three issues cleared up on 22 November.The CIE workers, as I well remember, were murdered by the bomb beside Clery's. Those were the bombs in 1972 and 1973 and they are included in Mr. Justice Barron's inquiry. He will report on them. With regard to the last question, I have no information that the people concerned are in senior positions. Many of these people are probably retired. Some might still be in office but I do not have information in that regard.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	203	At the outset, I express my regret for any offence I may have caused to people who have suffered so much.I was outlining the difficulties concerning the truth as regards the board's role and its responsibility for factor 9-related HIV infections, or its knowledge of same. Neither chairman nor board members were called to the tribunal to settle this central issue. Instead, the tribunal chairman, Ms Justice Lindsay, took it as fact that the board did not know and, therefore, this information did not come to the Department of Health, which led to the Minister for Health at the time, Deputy O'Hanlon, giving misleading, inaccurate and incomplete information to this House, albeit unwittingly.It is reasonable to expect that such a chain of events would have been the subject of scrupulous attention and investigation by the tribunal. The haemophiliac community was poorly served by this failure and so was this House. We have a right and a duty to know when a serving Minister was led up the garden path, intentionally or not, and, as a consequence, misled the public who are represented in this House. It is up to the Minister for Health and Children to investigate this matter further. He should appoint a senior counsel to go through all the documentation with the full compliance of the BTSB. If there is any non-compliance he should take immediate action, and I look forward to his reply to this particular request when he responds to this debate.We do not have answers concerning the conflict of interest in the role of Mr. Seán Hanratty, who was a member of the board and yet, at the same time, a company director of Accuscience, a company responsible for importing factor 8 concentrates into this country. Furthermore, there was no thorough investigation into his destruction of documents, which not only created obstacles for haemophiliacs taking legal action, but also led to the finding of the tribunal that 20 people have remained untraced who may potentially be infected by HIV. That inability to trace these people stems directly back to the destruction of records. Their untraceability may well mean that more illness and death will result from this desperate saga.We have to commend all those victims who were courageous enough to speak at the tribunal. Their testimony, more than anything, is a central part of this process. We have to ensure that the Minister for Health and Children finishes the work that should have been taken up by the tribunal chairman, that is to investigate the role of international pharmaceutical companies. Her decision not to extend the terms of reference was most regrettable. In fact, her statement at the early stages on this issue was essentially that it was too early to make a decision on whether to investigate these companies' roles, and later she refused to do so on the grounds that it was too late in terms of the proceedings of the tribunal. I do not believe that she was restricted by the terms of reference. She clearly did not wish to embark on that part of the project as her refusal to accept the Minister's suggestion indicates.It is now vital that, whatever form this investigation takes, the lessons learnt from this process are applied and mistakes are not made in the same way. The international pharmaceutical companies are important. For example, the report does not deal with the role of Armour Pharmaceutical Company in respect of its defective heat treatment process. One Irish child died as a consequence of an Armour product, yet the report is silent. An expert witness, Dr. Francis, talking at the tribunal about the role of international companies stated: "What they did was eliminate a whole generation of haemophiliacs who indeed needed their products".I commend the media for its role in highlighting the issues affecting Irish haemophiliacs. Television programmes like "Bad Blood" made a real and significant difference and the coverage over the years by the media was essential to exposing the nature of the catastrophe. Great hopes were pinned on this tribunal, and great effort was put in to make it live up to its possibility. Sadly, the outcome has not lived up to the expectations. As we can see all around us, dark, painful and important secrets about Irish society are being revealed. However, the full truth has not yet been told about the contamination of blood products and their impact on Irish haemophiliacs. It is a matter of deep regret and it is a fact that must not be forgotten. We should all strive to ensure that whatever can be done is done to provide the closure and ease of mind that the haemophiliac community so richly deserves.I hope that the Minister and the Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, the chairman of which I will be writing to in this regard, will pursue the unanswered questions in the report. Clearly, the Oireachtas committee is limited, particularly in light of court decisions, but at the same time it provides an important democratic forum where these issues can be further explored.I ask, as does the Irish Haemophiliac Society, that the Minister for Health and Children take on the specific issues concerning the role of the BTSB in respect of its responsibility as regards the infections caused by factor 9 and that he appoint a senior counsel to be given the brief to survey and assess all the documentation, because not all the documentation came to the tribunal. Documentation was withheld, not by the Minister but by the board. Nevertheless, the Minister appoints the board and he is in a powerful position to ensure that all that information comes into the public arena.I would like to ensure that we proceed with this work rather than presume that, because the tribunal has sat, that represents inevitable closure on the issue, because there is grave dissatisfaction and disappointment regarding the lack of conclusions and findings in the report. It is inconclusive in many ways although, having said that, it is also an important report and its value lies to a great extent in the record of events that took place, particularly the testimonies of individual people who were brave enough to come forward.At the outset, I expressed my regret for any offence I caused. It is the last thing in the world I wanted, and I wanted to put on the record that any assistance I can give in the future to people who have suffered will be very heartfelt.
#MaeSextonPD	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-party	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-dob	unknown-#MaeSextonPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	204	On the scale of public scandals in this country to date, the provision of infected blood by a public service body, the BTSB, has to rank as the gravest. This State-sponsored catastrophe is widely accepted and agreed to have led to the deaths of 79 people. In view of this, the conclusions of the Lindsay tribunal are, to say the least, disappointing in the extreme.This ostensibly expert body entrusted with central purchasing and distribution of blood products in Ireland had an ethical and moral duty to ensure that all necessary measures were in place to protect haemophiliacs, a vulnerable and innocent group of people. The gross negligence displayed by the BTSB has caused, and will continue to cause, untold pain and suffering to the victims and their families for many years to come. Not even the most rudimentary ethical and commercial practices were followed when guarantees or assurances of any kind were neither sought from, nor given by, the companies supplying the product.I do not agree with the tribunal finding that because of prevailing opinions and practices, the BTSB should not be criticised for continuing to import and distribute commercial concentrates while aware of the risk of transmission and infection by these products. We all, as individuals and groups, have individual and collective responsibilities on matters of this nature and it is incumbent on all of us to act swiftly when we receive information that might adversely affect life. It is our moral duty to ensure that action is taken immediately to minimise the risk to life.In line with the policy of self-sufficiency regarding the provision of blood and blood products which existed in the early 1970s, the report makes reference to the heparin project. Essentially, this appears to have been an experimental project which drifted from year to year without any evaluation or assessment as to its progress or usefulness. This calls into question the management of the BTSB and its ability to take decisions at all.The inability of the BTSB to respond to matters of urgency drawn to its attention is clear. When in January 1985 it was asked to give urgent attention to heat treatment of all products, this did not happen until October 1985. In fact, non-heat treated factor continued to be used by it until December 1985. Such delays and negligence contributed to and were, the report concludes, the most probable cause of seven people who had hepatitis B becoming infected with HIV. This further lack of control was evident when the BTSB did not even pursue the possibility of entering into partnership with suppliers who could have provided concentrate that had been effectively inactivated.Self-sufficiency was the policy of the BTSB. The tribunal asserted that the lack of capital resources did not inhibit the achievement of this policy, therefore, the conclusion is obvious. The pursuit of the ideal sponsored by the board proved to be non-viable and was gravely erroneous. While I agree with the tribunal that if capital funding had been provided by the Department of Health and Children it might have allowed the time and energies of the BTSB to be confined to medical and technical matters, the provision of such funding would not necessarily have been successful because the management structures within the BTSB were such that there were no guarantees as to how this funding might have been expended. It might have been squandered in the pursuit of the ideal of self-sufficiency.The findings revealed by the tribunal were not confined to Ireland. There were many blood scandals throughout Europe. The French experience comes to mind most readily where criminal prosecutions and custodial sentences were imposed on those deemed to be culpable. Early last year I contributed to the development of a common opinion at European Union Committee of the Regions level regarding a proposal for a directorate by the European Commission for setting standards of quality and safety for the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of human blood components. In proposing such a directive the Commission acknowledged that the existing Union legislation did not comprehensively deal with standards of quality and safety in blood product matters.I am confident the new legislation will soon be implemented here through statutory instrument. It will close the existing gaps in Union legislation and provide a suitable legislative framework for the quality and safety of blood and blood components used in therapy and will strengthen requirements related to the sustainability of blood and plasma donors and the screening of donated blood. It will set up at member state level requirements for the establishment involved in the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of whole blood and blood components as well as national accreditation and monitoring structures. It will lay down provisions at Union level for the formulation of a quality system for blood establishment and will provide common provisions at Union level for training staff directly involved in the collection, testing, processing, storage and distribution of blood and blood components. It will establish rules for the traceability of whole blood and blood components from donor to patient, which will be valid throughout the Union.While significant improvements and programmes have been put in place to support the reorganisation and redevelopment of the service in Ireland, the further addition of this European Union legislation will complement and strengthen them. There is a need to regulate and inspect the application of appropriate standards in Ireland and throughout the European Union. The new EU directive will ensure that the standards envisaged will always reflect best established practice and will not allow member states to fall behind.For public confidence to be restored in the BTSB it is vital to ensure that the highest standards are maintained. I am pleased that when he spoke last month the Minister reassured the House of his intention to refer the tribunal report to the DPP where I hope and expect action reflecting the serious nature of this gross negligence will be recommended to the relevant authorities. While all of these matters are of scant consolation to the many victims and their families, it can only be hoped that what is now being pursued might lead to the prevention of a recurrence of a tragedy of this nature.
#DanNeville	unknown-#DanNeville-party	unknown-#DanNeville-dob	unknown-#DanNeville-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	205	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to this important debate, one of the most important on the health issue to be held in this Chamber because of the implications of the difficulties experienced by a small group of citizens. I support the Fine Gael Party amendment, proposing to add to the motion a call on the Government to initiate the promised inquiry into the relevant international pharmaceutical companies and support the provision of adequate funding to the Irish Haemophilia Society on an ongoing basis to allow the society to fully represent the interests of people with haemophilia.The issues dealt with by the tribunal concern one of the biggest medical catastrophes to have occurred since the foundation of the State. On reading the reports of the sitting of the tribunal, one could not fail to be shocked, deeply moved and upset about what happened to members of the Irish Haemophilia Society and the fact that 260 people and their families were deeply affected, with their lives practically destroyed. An effort should be made to put oneself in the position of somebody who was visited by such an event to try and understand the extent of the catastrophe. Given that 79 people died from contaminated blood products, the Lindsay tribunal was probably the most important of all the tribunals established in recent times.We are concerned here with life, death and human suffering and the effect on those involved, their families, brothers, fathers and children. We have all experienced tragedy in families but it is another matter to be visited by tragedy in this fashion. Those concerned fully trusted the system to deal with their condition and it is difficult to describe the extent of the catastrophe of their betrayal.I congratulate the Irish Haemophilia Society for the work it has done and for the way it facilitated witnesses to the tribunal. The reports of the tribunal sittings revealed people who were deeply traumatised, to such an extent that they found it very difficult to present their evidence to the tribunal. They felt they could not reveal their names, which is surely a strong statement about the problems they experienced.I thank the Irish Haemophilia Society for the excellent briefing it provided to Members of this House. It was very helpful in the context of reading the tribunal report. The society has made clear in writing that it is very disappointed with the report, which, it maintains, largely fails to identify those who were responsible for what happened. I support that view and while a political view is one thing, this is the view of those who suffered.The society also refer to the manner in which witnesses from the BTSB were allowed to depart from their prepared statements while those with haemophilia who delivered personal testimony in such an emotional and difficult way were required to strictly adhere to the content of their statements. If they deviated in any respect from their written statements, senior council on behalf of the tribunal objected. I am at a loss to know why people were not allowed to freely give their views. We all know the difference between a written statement, which is historical in nature, and the spoken word. Why were the witnesses not allowed to add to or qualify some of their remarks?As the haemophilia society stated, such testimony is by its nature very emotional, bordering in some cases on the distraught. Those giving evidence had grave difficulties with the manner in which the tribunal dealt with their personal disasters. Surely the tribunal's job was to obtain the truth of the information presented to it. Why were the witnesses not allowed to express, in their emotive distraught fashion, how they felt in giving their evidence? That must have significantly added to the trauma those people had already experienced in their lives. It required great bravery on their part to go into the tribunal in the first place to give evidence, yet the tribunal's attitude to them was very inhuman.The haemophilia society is extremely concerned about the failure of the tribunal, as it sees it, to undertake a proper and comprehensive investigation. It also expresses concern at the failure of the tribunal chairperson to deliver a report in a clear and concise manner which indicated what went wrong, who was responsible for such wrongdoing and how recommendations could be implemented to prevent future repetition of such mistakes. Surely they were vitally important questions that should have been part of the summary. We have seen other reports that were concise, detailed and to the point, whose first pages contained details of the core issues surrounding the tribunal investigation. That did not happen in this case. People with haemophilia required from the Lindsay tribunal report evidence that a full investigation had occurred. Regrettably the report failed to achieve such an objective. That is not only my view but that of the Irish Haemophilia Society.Why was the tribunal reluctant to investigate certain matters and call all witnesses relevant to it? The haemophilia society referred specifically to the absence of witnesses such as various Ministers for Health who had ultimate political responsibility for policy decisions such as the non-implementation of a national policy in respect of European Council recommendations. In addition, a later Minister for Health refused the request of the Irish Haemophilia Society for recompense and compensation for their members. No board member – this has been central to some of the criticism with regard to the taking of evidence – was called to deliver evidence, although the Irish Haemophilia Society suggested it on numerous occasions in written correspondence. It would have been appropriate to do so, as it would have resolved some outstanding issues.It is crucial to the haemophilia society's desire for truth and justice that the Minister for Health and Children immediately follows through on his commitment to ensure there is a comprehensive inquiry into the international pharmaceutical companies who criminally exposed the lives and safety of people when they knew the inherent dangers.

A valuable role of the tribunal is that it has offered a forum to the victims of this appalling litany of negligence to finally be heard, but is this the best that the inquiry can offer those victims?The failure of Ms Justice Lindsay to apportion blame or responsibility is disappointing and for those who have borne their pain, anguish and suffering in such a dignified manner, frequently under such hostile cross-examination at the tribunal. Having fought for so long to get the inquiry set up it is all the more disappointing that the report gave rise to more questions than it answered. This has given rise to fury in many instances. I am glad the Minister for Health and Children, who has direct responsibility for this issue, has decided to send the report to the DPP, despite the reluctance of Ms Justice Lindsay to advise him of that. It is important that whoever is responsible for the deaths of 79 people stands accountable, that a scandal of this magnitude never occurs again and that rather than find ourselves at the end of a process we are merely at the beginning.Previous speakers have adverted to the experience of France where crimes against the State were punished with prison sentences. As has been said by many tribunals that have reported back to this House, it is a measure of our maturity as a democracy how we respond to criticisms and failures of State systems. I believe the action announced by the Minister to send the report to the DPP reflects the seriousness with which the Government views this scandal. I imagine the report will receive the diligent attention of the authorities. Where there was a wrong done it must be righted. I believe this House is unanimous in its quest for justice in this matter.In the early 1980s, which is the period being investigated by the tribunal, AIDS was a scourge with which we were becoming familiar and it remains a most devastating disease. There was an element of groping in the dark in regard to the treatment around it. At that time it was seen as a disease which blighted the gay community but as we have since discovered that is not necessarily the case. With regard to its transfer through sexual contact the message of "safe sex" was very clear. For haemophiliacs there was another clear message "safe blood". It would appear a sentence needed to be added to that – safety, honesty and rigourousness from State agencies.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	207	I am delighted to get the opportunity to make a few short observations in regard to the Lindsay tribunal report. We have had many tribunals and most of them have been in regard to corruption but no deaths were involved. This has been the greatest scandal that ever happened in this country. I was disappointed with the report's failure to identify the guilty parties.On the day the tribunal was set up by the Minister at the time, Deputy Michael Noonan, I was the next speaker for Fine Gael to speak after him. I stated in my contribution to that debate that I hoped there would be an inquiry and at its conclusion the people who were responsible would end up in Mountjoy Prison. While the Minister is not fond of prisons, it is wrong that people who were identified in the report and who displayed arrogance towards the tribunal are still walking around when many a son, daughter, husband, wife, brother or sister has lost a loved one because they are in a graveyard. That is the greatest scandal. The other scandal is the media gave a great deal of coverage to the other tribunals even though not one life was lost. The loss of life and the suffering of loved ones resulted in this tribunal.I hope the DPP will act on the report. If the Minister feels the DPP cannot act on it and that the matter should be taken further through criminal prosecutions taken by the Department of Health and Children against the individuals responsible, that should happen. They should not walk away free because this is such a scandal nor should they be allowed to walk away free because they worked in the Civil Service and in hospitals. They should not be protected by the State or anybody else. This has been the greatest scandal in the State's history because people lost their lives. This issue must not be hidden or brushed under the carpet because those who were responsible were part of the institutions involved and they must be dealt with.I refer to another group of people about whom I wish the Minister to respond. I am aware of the case of one of these people, who resides in my constituency. The Acting Chairman is a doctor and he is also aware of this case. It and others involve people who received contaminated blood transfusions and displayed all the symptoms of hepatitis C. When their blood was tested, the disease did not show up. What can be done for them? They feel they are being pushed aside by the State and medical professionals and nobody will fight for or defend them. We know they received contaminated blood products and have been affected but the infection does not show up in the hepatitis C blood test. I ask the Minister to re-examine the cases involving these people, to show them a little compassion and that somebody cares about them and to ensure they will not have to fight like we did in the Oireachtas to get the Lindsay tribunal up and running. These people seek recognition of their problem and medical help, not compensation.A lady came into my clinic who had received contaminated blood products and for the first time in my life in politics I cried. She had gone through the health system. She met all the medical professionals involved and at the end of the day they tried to imply that she was not keeping well in her head. This poor woman received contaminated blood and when she did the hepatitis C test, the disease did not show up. She is upset, as is her family. She displays all the symptoms of the disease and is in very bad health as she has gone from one illness to the next. The Minister should re-examine the cases involving people who were affected this way and perhaps down the road in ten years we will discover they were infected. I hope they can be given the sympathy they need.I hoped the report, similar to the Flood tribunal report, would highlight who was responsible for this scandal and that they would be dealt with in the Four Courts. The families of the victims feel hurt, let down and that the State has not done its duty. Are those responsible being protected because they work for the State? If they were ordinary Joe Soaps, they would be identified and prosecuted. My blood boiled when I witnessed the arrogance and defiance they displayed at the tribunal. Those who were responsible must pay a price and justice must be seen to be done. While the families do not want people sent to prison, they want those responsible for this national scandal to be identified. They do not want this scandal brushed under the carpet.The State has done a disservice to the families who have lost loved ones. The victims entered hospitals expecting to be cared for by the State. Those who were responsible for the scandal were recruited and paid by the State in good faith. However, there is no doubt there was a cover-up because people knew what was going on. At the time, as was pointed out at the tribunal, certain individuals should have stood up to be counted and spoken out because some lives might have been saved. I hope there will be prosecutions and that the people who knew what was going on are put in jail and pay a price. We cannot bring back the loved ones of the families involved in this national scandal. What happened was the greatest disgrace in the history of the State. Our own citizens were infected and those responsible must pay a price.The Ministers for Health and Children and Justice, Equality and Law Reform are present and both are strong Ministers. I hope they will ensure justice is done quickly because if somebody is not identified as being responsible, then there is a cover up.

She presented a report within three years of being authorised to do so and perhaps the other tribunals could learn from that. Haemophilia is a serious, genetic condition caused by a problem with Factor 8 in the clotting mechanism in our blood and Factor 9 in Christmas disease. While the disease is carried by females, it is manifest in males and because of its genetic make up it tends to occur in families. The distress and anguish caused by the disease is worsened because it affects entire families.Such families in the past had a close working relationship with their medical advisors and, in many cases, had built up trust. The health system exists to help people and the most important person in it is the patient. The BTSB is an important part of the health system and during the period that the report covers the board did not deliver. Unfortunately, in giving blood to patients at the time, they were in effect giving them a loaded gun and that proved fatal in a number of cases. As I read the report I was struck time and again by the severe anguish and stress that patients suffered for a multiplicity of reasons, not least of which was deaths in their families. However, there were other reasons for their distress.Ms Justice Lindsay stated in the report:There was an abiding sense of hurt, anger and resentment as a result of their experiences with health professionals. I found the evidence at times sad, at times tragic and at times harrowing.This hurt was all the more distressing because of the close relationship that had been built between the patients and health professionals involved. It is not good enough that information in some cases was delayed as regards the status of patients' health. In some cases that information was transmitted to the patients or their relations in an unsympathetic manner and in corridors or other unsuitable places.We should spend time looking at the recommendations of the report because that is where the future lies. I note that in 1996 there were 15 haematologists in the country. Today there are in excess of 33. That was one of the recommendations of Ms Justice Lindsay. She spent a lot of time talking about medical records. As those of us who worked in the health care field know, much time is spent taking a patient's history, examining the patient and making a diagnosis. However, the same time should be spent writing up what one has found. In this case and in the cases outlined in the report there was a deficiency in the medical records. That must be corrected in the future because it hampered the work of the tribunal to a certain extent.The Irish Blood Transfusion Service, which was called the BTSB, has regained the faith of the people. That is good because the health service needs blood and patients must have full faith that the blood they get is of the highest possible standard. I recommend to the Minister that an external audit should be carried out by a consultant haematologist every year for the coming years to ensure that the blood patients get continues to meet the standards they deserve. That would help to develop faith in the Irish Blood Transfusion Service in the future.I welcome the recommendation to set up a national committee. I would warmly welcome the Minister's decision to establish it. I know he is in ongoing discussions with the Irish Haemophilia Society about the structure of that committee. It is important to put it in place to ensure the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates which meet the highest possible standards in terms of safety and efficiency. I welcome the fact that last year the Minister set up an ad hoc committee along those lines. During the establishment process, he asked the Irish Haemophilia Society and the Irish Blood Transfusion Service to become involved. It is interesting to note that the Irish Haemophilia Society welcomed the involvement of the IBTS in the committee.I welcome the Government's decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. The report clearly outlines what has happened. As previous speakers said, if blame is to be applied – in this case there must be blame – it is important that the DPP gets the report and acts on it forthwith.
#MaryUpton	unknown-#MaryUpton-party	unknown-#MaryUpton-dob	unknown-#MaryUpton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	209	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. The subject must be treated with respect and sensitivity in the House and it should be above party politics. Haemophilia sufferers and their families, who were at the coalface of the tribunal, put themselves through considerable trauma in many cases by attending the inquiry. Our first concern must be for them.The tribunal cost approximately €13 million and ran for approximately three years. Surely it is reasonable to expect value for money apart from any moral consideration of the outcome of the inquiry? It is a reasonable expectation that the families of those who died and those who continue to suffer would be given straightforward answers. Accessing that information by reading the tribunal report is not easy. Conclusions are dispersed throughout the document and it is an exercise in perseverance to try to extract the concise findings. Furthermore, and more importantly, many questions remain unanswered.I find it amazing that no call was made to any member of the board or the chair of any of the boards to give evidence in their capacity as board members. They are not named anywhere in the report. Ms Justice Lindsay notes in her report that on the tribunal's analysis the board was not entirely blameless. If that is the case, we can assume it was in some way to blame. Why was it not asked to account for itself by coming before the tribunal and answering the appropriate questions? Is it possible we are expected to believe that those appointed to the board do not have responsibility to the public whom they represent, that they are not answerable for the day-to-day decisions made by board employees or, more significantly, that they do not have responsibility for those who suffered and died? Nobody expects that every trivial detail would be recorded at board level, but there is a clear indication in the Lindsay report that board members were aware of the practices and, more importantly, the concerns about the blood products. There were clear and unambiguous expressions of concern about some of those practices. Who are the mysterious board members that we cannot ask them straight questions? It is the absence of such accountability that gives rise to cynicism and justifiable anger.The reference to the Ministers for Health who were described as inadvertently misleading the Dáil further compounds the issues. Who supplied the information to the Ministers and what was the basis for not providing accurate and correct information? It is not right to walk away from these questions on behalf of the victims. Were there conflicts of interest in the blood bank? What were the procedures for accessing the products and what criteria were laid down in deciding from which supplier to purchase? Was there a cash crisis that drove the board to make decisions on a wing and a prayer while ignoring the health of the people being treated?The Blood Transfusion Service Board seemed to ignore all the signs. The scientific evidence on AIDS had been available since 1981. Hepatitis C had been recognised since 1974, although it was called non-A non-B at the time. At the most generous, it was clear that in 1984 the Blood Transfusion Service Board knew it was dealing with a high risk product which could cause infection and kill. There was an air of secrecy surrounding the decisions with no apparent accountability for the consequences. It was left to a locum doctor in August 1985 to eventually coerce, persuade and insist that the BTSB should heat treat factor 9 to safeguard against HIV infection. Despite this, the BTSB continued to supply many units of unheated product to hospitals. The BTSB product continued to cause infection up to February 1986.The softness of the report's language defies credibility. The report does not remotely attribute a reasonable level of responsibility or accountability. The terms used are frequently woolly and meaningless and warrant a degree of scepticism. I refer to terms such as "steps should have been taken", "should have been pursued with greater urgency", "it might also be thought", "regrettable", "unsatisfactory" and "a missed opportunity". That is hardly the language of a robust tribunal attempting to establish straightforward facts when it was clear that 79 people died and many more continue to suffer. It is in stark contrast to the language used in the interim report of the Flood tribunal. By contrast, during the Lindsay tribunal hearing one judge felt it appropriate to say that the tribunal should not over-indulge a witness giving evidence on behalf of her father who had died. It appears that the language of the tribunal was open to modification depending on the person being questioned. The balance always seemed to fall in favour of those defending their actions and against those who sought answers to their legitimate questions.The recently published Flood tribunal interim report has in many ways set a precedent for clarity and forthright conclusions. The families of those who died as a result of being treated with contaminated blood products are entitled to the same clarity. The availability of the Flood tribunal report at €1 contrasts with the cost of the Lindsay report at €10.The role of the multinational companies and their responsibility to deliver safe products must be investigated. I accept the Minister is committed to doing that. For all those involved, that line must be pursued and those who made significant financial gain must be held accountable for their actions. How much did these companies know about the risk associated with their products? It is clear from the information available that Armour Pharmaceuticals, for example, had knowledge from three laboratories that its heat treatment method used to eliminate HIV infection from factor concentrates was ineffectual. I welcome the decision of the Minister to refer the tribunal report to the DPP. While there may have been good legal arguments for Ms Justice Lindsay's decision, it further contrasts with the clear position of the Flood tribunal.I have identified six questions – there may be more – which need to be answered. Who supplied inaccurate information to successive Ministers for Health leading them to inadvertently mislead the Dáil? Why was no board member called to give evidence when it is clear from the report that they would have answers to some of the key questions? Will there be an inquiry into the actions of the multinational companies which supplied the blood products? I accept the Minister is committed to investigating the role of the companies and their responsibility to deliver safe products. Why did the board continue to supply hospitals with products accessed from sources that included donors from what a BTSB employee described as "skid row", thereby carrying a high risk factor? Will the Irish Haemophilia Society be provided with adequate funding to allow it to plan, organise and continue the work it has been compelled to undertake arising from the failure to protect persons with haemophilia? It is no more than natural justice that the society should at least have the consolation of knowing it does not have to depend on fundraising activities. Why is there no summary of the conclusions of the Lindsay report?I welcome the recommendations. However, although they are clear, they are the kind of recommendations one would expect to apply to any process or organisation. As they constitute the basis of good practice, I sincerely hope one did not have to wait for the outcome of the tribunal to implement them.The findings of the tribunal were, to say the least, very disappointing for those people whom it was meant to reassure, namely, the victims. For them, it was almost as though they were the culprits or defendants. They were rightly offended at the lack of consideration shown to those among them who were called to give evidence. They had difficulty in accessing information and documentation. They also feel aggrieved at the failure of the tribunal to pursue issues which they felt would get to the truth, namely, the questions I have outlined. Most significantly perhaps, the tribunal failed to establish why the system failed and how 79 people died as a result of that failure. Now that the question has been raised again here, the Minister will give a reassurance that answers will be provided.The tribunal report raises many questions to which it is very limited in providing the answers. At a minimum, this is demoralising for those families who have been affected. It is also very frustrating that so much time and money was spent with the objective of establishing a number of salient facts about the infection of people with haemophilia and the causes of the deaths of 79 people. More than this, those responsible for allowing this to continue have not been called to account for their actions in any substantial way.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	210	I will share my time.It is remarkable that the Lindsay tribunal report which deals with loss of life and real human tragedy was not given the same coverage as the Flood tribunal report. In this regard, considerable credit must go to Mr. Paul Cunningham of RTE who has done a fantastic job in highlighting and analysing the issues and ensuring the victims are not forgotten. This proves, once again, how important public service broadcasting is. The Flood tribunal report was greeted with enthusiasm because of its directness, clarity and willingness to point the finger. Regrettably, the Lindsay tribunal report pulls its punches.The Government motion states that we accept the findings of the report. While this is true, it applies only in so far as they go, as the report does not get to the heart of the matter. It fails properly to apportion blame, a failure which has left many people in the Irish Haemophilia Society bitterly disappointed.The Lindsay tribunal took two years to sit and a further ten months to report. Contrast this with the Finlay tribunal on hepatitis C which sat for only two months and pointed the finger. The public will no longer tolerate this type of wishy-washy report which allows people to make excuses and effectively exonerates them from wrongdoing. The beef tribunal was an example of this equivocal attitude. The Irish Haemophilia Society was entitled to ask the reason a judge from the Circuit Court was appointed to such an onerous and sensitive tribunal.Why did the tribunal fail to investigate certain matters or call crucial witnesses? Why were no board members of the BTSB called to give evidence? Why did the tribunal fail to investigate Accuscience which imported Factor 8 concentrate? This was the same company of which Mr. Sean Hanratty from the BTSB was a director. Mr. Hanratty subsequently destroyed the relevant documentation in the BTSB. All of this is scandalous. It represents a clear conflict of interest and constitutes an attempt to pervert the course of justice. Let us be very clear: people died as a consequence of this negligence. In France, in similar cases, people went to jail.This report will not cause any of the main protagonists to lose a night's sleep. The victims, on the other hand, have lost not only many nights' sleep, but their health and their lives. The inquiry revealed the arrogance of the medical profession and gave us a glimpse of the criminal negligence of the pharmaceutical companies while not getting to the heart of it. The power of the international pharmaceutical companies is a matter I have raised here in the past. We see it reflected in their influence on Government policy and on the Irish Medicines Board. We saw evidence of it in the vaccination scandals and we see it in relation to MMR. The Lindsay tribunal report gives us a further insight into it, even if only a glimpse.The Irish Haemophilia Society sought an investigation of the international pharmaceutical companies. After much toing and froing Ms Justice Lindsay ruled that she did not have discretion under the terms of reference of the tribunal to investigate the companies in this jurisdiction. Later the Attorney General under direction from the Minister asked for an investigation into these companies. I do not intend to go into the correspondence between Judge Lindsay and others on this issue as it has been comprehensively documented in the IHS document in the report. It is quite clear, however, that there was not just a reluctance to investigate these companies, but that there was no intention of doing so from the beginning. This was an appalling and astonishing decision given that 74 Irish citizens died as a consequence of being infected by blood products manufactured by these companies.We need to get this information. We also need to establish who gave false information to previous Ministers for Health. This is a crucial question which I hope we, on the Committee on Health and Children, will be able to examine in detail in the future. I am committed to finding the truth. There can be no more evasion, diversion and cover ups. We must have the full truth and we must punish those people who are guilty of these crimes, because they are crimes.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	211	It is clear haemophiliac patients died because of decisions, some intentional, others unintentional, made by doctors and administrators. They died because of ignorance of the causes of the infection and the inability of our health care system to respond to the changes HIV inflicted on our society. Before this report can be put away, we must get closure on the role of the international pharmaceutical companies with regard to infected blood products. The first paragraph of part VI of the report, which covers recommendations, states: "the main focus of the tribunal was on the past rather than the present."  It continues: "great changes have taken place in personnel, facilities and procedures since the occurrence of the events which were investigated by the tribunal".Could it all have been prevented? The Lindsay tribunal report is a perfect example of how it can all go desperately wrong when doctors do not speak up and the Government of the day refuses to input the resources the health services need. Reading through the letters in the appendices, it becomes clear that there was an immense lack of knowledge about HIV and AIDS in the mid-1980s, even in medical circles. I entered medical school in 1987 when ignorance of the HIV issue was common among the young people with whom I socialised. It comes as no surprise that the Virus Reference Laboratory only started using HIV antibody testing kits in April 1985. There was confusion in the medical profession as to how we should deal with HIV. We oscillate between an in-your-face giving of the facts and an ostrich-like approach of burying our heads in the sand and trying to ignore it. Let us look at the approach of the Government of the day to this issue. In part V, division III, chapter 9, of the Lindsay tribunal's report, the history of the national haemophilia service co-ordinating committee is given. It was established in 1971, but by the mid-1980s at the height of this endemic its meetings were held infrequently and, as the tribunal comments, there is little doubt that its work and effectiveness were adversely affected by a lack of resources. Everybody should read this chapter as an example of how complacency and bureaucracy led health services into a catastrophe that could easily have been avoided.That is not the only example of what was obviously a casual and non-urgent response to the growing crisis by that Government. In 1985, at the height of this crisis, there were four consultant haematologists in the Blood Transfusion Service Board and they acted as the medical experts examining blood products on its behalf. One retired in December 1985, but was not replaced, another retired in 1986 and was not replaced immediately meaning that in 1986, when this crisis was at its worst, the BTSB had only half the number of consultants it had when it started. It gets worse. One of the two remaining consultants retired in December 1987. This doctor worked in Cork and his position was not filled until a consultant was appointed in 1989, instead he was replaced on retirement by a medical registrar. There was only one consultant in Dublin for most of 1987 and 1988 until a consultant was appointed towards the end of the latter year. If this was a move to save money rather than lives, let us benefit from hindsight to stop it happening again.I am under no illusion that the health services face similar problems today. We have more diseases, more illness, a more elderly population and a shortage of doctors across all specialties. The present structures and responsibilities of the Department of Health and Children are not going to work because they are too expensive and the Department cannot handle its diverse brief. The interface between the Department and the people is the health boards, but these old-fashioned structures are from another era and require radical reform quickly.The structure of how health care is delivered by doctors also needs reform in general practice and, especially, in hospitals. This is not the Minister's problem alone, it is a collective problem to be faced by the Cabinet. There is no doubt that the cutbacks of the 1980s played a role in this crisis and we are facing such cutbacks again. Depriving 250,000 citizens of free health care for another year is morally wrong when millions may be wasted on a politically bloated health board structure. The Taoiseach has spoken of doubling health care spending since 1997, which is when I began to work as a GP, but I have not seen the fantastic improvement in health services that one would expect.As a doctor and a Member of the Oireachtas, I hope that no more lives will be lost because we were slow to reform the health services. It was with great sadness that I read about the cases of these many people and I do not want to see the same thing happen again.
#DamienEnglishFG	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-party	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-dob	unknown-#DamienEnglishFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	212	The film "Children of a Lesser God" which was made some years ago dealt with the lives of a number of physically challenged children. While the subject today is not the same, the title of the film sums up how the people directly affected by those poisonous blood products must feel. For me, or anybody else, to claim to know how these people feel is to take a great liberty, but it would not be the only liberty this country took in dealing with the victims of the incompetence which seemed to go hand and hand with the Blood Transfusion Service Board at the time of this crisis. Are these people citizens or criminals or, indeed, are they even human? I have news for us all here. They are citizens and human beings, not that it made any difference, and the only crime they committed was to need and believe in a service guaranteed to them by the State.Unlike modern day criminals who operate in a revolving door system, these people received a life sentence for the crime of being sick and paid the price with their lives. What these people and their families endured and are enduring we can only guess, but what we, the political establishment, forced them to endure over and above what was an already unbearable cross is a national scandal and a total disgrace.I will not go over the whole story which has been well documented by now, but I express my utter disgust at the way in which the cases of these people were handled by the State and its servants. It is with no honour that I say those responsible for this unbelievable tragedy came from both sides of the House as this tale of woe went from Minister to Minister and Government to Government and each tried to ignore, forget or bury the problem. As politicians, we must all hold up our hands and say that we are sorry. We must learn the lessons which are clearly on show for us today and vow to never again ignore the pleas of our sick and injured, no matter what the cost.It does not appear that we have learned the lessons. The Lindsay tribunal was eventually and begrudgingly set up by the State when it finally realised that these sick people were not going away, but they were still ignored at every opportunity. The terms of reference of the tribunal, its limited powers of investigation and its final results fell far short of what victims who had suffered enough already expected from the justice system of a land of saints and scholars.Comparing the findings of the Lindsay tribunal with those of the interim report of the Flood tribunal is like comparing chalk and cheese and the blame lies with the Minister and the Government of the day under whose administration it was established. Despite countless meetings and requests by the victims and their families, its terms of reference were cast in stone for reasons best known to the Government. That was wrong. It is said that two wrongs do not make a right which this Government and its predecessor have done their best to show.The unforgivable mistakes and mismanagement of the BTSB are directly responsible for this crisis which befell ordinary, decent and undeserving people. When that is coupled with the mismanagement of the crisis by Governments, it adds up to two giant wrongs, one of which caused almost as much pain as the other. The air of secrecy and mistrust which grew out of this tribunal reflects no credit on anybody, but to say that this air was expected of civil servants would be close to the truth. The proof is that even today some of our health boards and hospitals have refused to release valuable information and records needed by the tribunal. All I can do here is ask why that is, who they are kidding and why they think they can do it. Even at this late hour, I ask all involved to become willing participants in the tribunal process. I ask the families and friends of the victims to keep fighting because their courage and bravery are an inspiration to us all. With their courage and our support we will hopefully see this through to the end and I ask the Government to send the tribunal back to work until it comes up with definite answers. The Minister has said that this matter is to be referred to the DPP, which I ask to be done quickly while also requesting that the Garda is involved.It is only by a stroke of luck or the hand of God that one of us here is not the victim of something that could have happened to anyone. The truth may hurt, but it will always be our friend be we statesmen or political leaders.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	213	I wish to share time with Deputy Finian McGrath. I wish to reiterate the comments of my party colleague, Deputy Caoimhghín Ó Caoláin, in welcoming the publication of the Report of the Tribunal of Inquiry into the Infection with HIV and Hepatitis C of Persons with Haemophilia and Related Matters. Sinn Féin broadly supports the Government's motion and the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and the Labour Party and welcomes the Government's commitment to implement the recommendations of the report. I also welcome the decision to refer this report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.A number of issues arise from the publication of the report on which I wish to comment. The Irish Haemophilia Society in its response to the report of the Lindsay tribunal stated it should be known that in the course of establishing and participating in the inquiry the Irish Haemophilia Society had to overcome many obstacles. The society expressed concern over the adverse adversarial attitude of the tribunal towards people with haemophilia and their families. In its criticism, the IHS referred to two incidents in particular, the comments of John Finlay, SC, counsel on behalf of the tribunal, who during the course of the evidence of Ms Linda Dowling, whose father died from the consequences of HIV and hepatitis C infections, said that the tribunal should not over-indulge the witness any longer, and his question to a witness who had contracted HIV regarding how he had spent his compensation money. The disappointment of the society over this report becomes increasingly clear when one realises the difficulties it overcame to participate in this tribunal. Particularly harrowing for the society were the difficulties it faced in its attempt to obtain priority for its witnesses, many of whom were seriously ill, in the order of witnesses to deliver evidence before the inquiry.In light of these difficulties the victims deserved a more thorough investigation and a conclusive report. On reading Ms Justice Lindsay's report I was extremely disconcerted to find that it failed to assign responsibility for infection of haemophiliacs with HIV and hepatitis C. Why does the Lindsay report not include criticism of Armour, a company which took a decision in June 1988 to continue supplying a product to the BTSB about which it had serious safety concerns? Evidence was given to the tribunal of the knowledge of Armour Pharmaceuticals Limited of the HIV infection risks posed by Armour products which it continued to distribute in Ireland.I wish to express concern that the tribunal failed to investigate certain matters. Why were all board members of the BTSB not called to give evidence? Why did the tribunal fail to investigate various Ministers for Health who had ultimate responsibility for policy decisions such as the non-implementation of national policy in respect of Council of Europe recommendations? Why did the tribunal fail to investigate the late Mr. Sean Hanratty, former chief technical officer of the BTSB, who had a key role in deciding what product was used and who was also a director of the company which acted as an intermediary for Myles Laboratories Incorporated, which supplied non-heat treated and unscreened so-called Cutter products which were responsible for some of the Irish infections? Mr. Hanratty was also responsible for destroying BTSB paper work that could have been used to identified precisely which products caused infection.I would like to address a number of comments made by the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, in his contribution to the House on the report of the Lindsay tribunal on 23 October last. In relation to the possibility of the establishment of a tribunal to investigate the role of the pharmaceutical companies, will the Minister clarify precisely what he had in mind when he stated that he believed it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would allow access to publicly available materials and to persons and bodies willing to co-operate? Sinn Féin has called for the establishment of a adjudicative tribunal to investigate the role of the pharmaceutical companies because it is our belief that any other form of inquiry or tribunal will not result in those responsible for the infection with HIV and hepatitis C of persons with haemophilia being held accountable. Is the Minister aware of the comments by Mr. John Finlay, SC, counsel for the tribunal, on 20 July 2001 that he foresaw at the very least a potential problem in investigating the role of the pharmaceutical companies as it was his understanding that documents would be only released under American Judicial Assistance Statute to an adjudicative tribunal and not an investigative one? Will the Minister inform the Dáil if he has received advice to the contrary and, if not, how the people of this State can have confidence in what he terms "useful investigation"?
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	214	The Lindsay tribunal report is perhaps one of the most important issues that has come before this House. Before getting into the detail of the debate, I wish to welcome the comments by Deputy McManus this morning on the differences last week between the technical group and the Labour Party. I concur with her views. As far as I am concerned this issue is bigger than all of us and one we must take seriously and get on with addressing.For me, this is a human story of sickness, tragedy and death. I express support and sympathy to all the families concerned. I acknowledge the extraordinary suffering endured by those with haemophilia who were infected. It was a nightmare and none of us can understand the hurt and the pain. For what it is worth, I as a newly elected Deputy and a member of the Health Alliance will do my best inside and outside the Dáil to ensure that those affected receive justice. I acknowledge their personal testimonies given to the tribunal of inquiry. We have had inquiries about corruption, planning and sleaze, but for me this is the most harrowing and must be given top priority, which I certainly intend to give it.Paragraph 4 of the motion refers to the public dismay at the matters disclosed in the report, but for me it was more than dismay. There is massive public anger at the way these people were treated. We must act on this crime against humanity. That is why I strongly support the decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions. There must be a response from the State based on justice and fair play. To date these people have not received fair play.Page 21 of the report states that the tribunal sat in public for 196 days and 146 witnesses gave oral evidence to it. That speaks for itself. We saw the tragedy and the pain of this terrible crime against a group of Irish citizens. We can sit here all day debating this sad report, but the bottom line is that if the State does not act in a positive and constructive manner, we fail as politicians, democrats and, above all, as human beings. These people were poisoned. There is no point in beating around the bush. We owe it to the victims and their families to do three simple things. First, apologise and accept total responsibility, second, those who are guilty must be prosecuted and the families concerned properly compensated and, third, ensure that this type of horrific crime against a group of our people never happens again.

In light of its recently published report, I consider the tribunal to have been an expensive exercise in futility in that a vast amount of taxpayers' money was expended in discovering precious little and scarcely apportioning blame for the debacle. Culpability and responsibility were fudged in the report to the extent that it revictimised the victims and the second injustice was almost worse than the first. The report demonstrated an appalling lack of sensitivity for the victims of this tragedy and a total lack of understanding or appreciation of what they endured. It is patently clear that the major share of the blame must attach to the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Its failure to provide HIV-free home produced product for haemophiliacs prior to 1984 was inexplicable and its failure to heat treat Factor 9 and withdraw non-heat treated Factor 9 directly led to the infection of seven haemophiliac sufferers with HIV and the subsequent death of five people.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	216	At this stage it is expected that the outturn of expenditure on the different subheads of the Defence Vote will show gross savings of €43.5 million, excess of €3.5 million and surplus appropriations-in-aid of €1 million, resulting in overall net savings. The main areas in which savings will be achieved are: compensation, €14.5 million; Air Corps, €14 million; and pay and allowances, €13 million.The savings on compensation are due to the fact that the number of settlements of loss of hearing cases this year is less than had been anticipated. In that regard, the rate at which such cases are finalised is governed by variable factors which make it difficult to forecast the number of settlements.The savings under the Air Corps subhead are mainly due to the decision announced by the Minister in July not to proceed with the tender competition for the purchase of medium lift helicopters.The savings on pay and allowances are due to the rate of recruitment being less than anticipated and a reduction in the number of PDF personnel serving overseas consequent on the withdrawal from UNIFIL in 2001.While the decision regarding medium lift helicopters was difficult and painful, the Minister is fully satisfied that the other ongoing programmes of investment in equipment and infrastructure, which are unprecedented in the history of the Defence Forces, will be maintained this year and in the years ahead.

Is she aware that the International Transport Workers' Federation, which represents 600 unions and thousands of workers – seafarers and airline workers – has expressed great concern and disappointment, particularly in terms of the curtailment of expenditure on the purchase of helicopters? We find ourselves in the almost embarrassing position that we are not able to provide an adequate rescue service along our coasts.Does the Minister of State believe it is correct that we should continue to rely on the RAF and its personnel and machinery to provide this sort of service in respect of incidents which occur either a medium or long distance off our coasts, particularly the west coast? Does she accept that this has had a demoralising effect on the Air Corps and on the search and rescue services in general?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	218	The Minister is well aware of the acute disappointment felt by Air Corps personnel when the decision not to proceed with the purchase of the aircraft was announced. However, he is equally convinced that the Air Corps has an important, long-term future in the area of search and rescue. As the Deputy is aware, the Air Corps has a long and distinguished history in providing search and rescue services and will continue to play an integral role in this area in the future.The lease of the Sikorsky S-61 helicopter by the Irish Coast Guard for the north-west, which will be flown by Air Corps pilots from early next year, is a sign of our commitment in this area. We aim to ensure that the Air Corps remains at the forefront and training is well advanced to ensure this happens. A later question deals specifically with the issue of helicopters, but I wish to inform the Deputy that a number of options are being considered in respect of PPPs, etc. However, I will address the matter in greater detail when we reach said question.It is important that people realise that search and rescue activity is continuing and it is not as if people are being left in danger. The Irish Coast Guard, based at the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, has overall responsibility for the provision of marine search and rescue services here. The Air Corps provides coverage off the north-west coast, while CHC Scotia Ltd., which is based in Scotland, is contracted to provide services for the rest of the country. We are fully committed to continuing the service and we appreciate the disappointment at the decision announced earlier this year.

We are all indebted to them, especially people living on the west coast. Air Corps personnel were greatly disappointed that the purchase did not proceed.The second matter to which I refer involves hearing impairment claims and the early settlement scheme. Does the Minister of State agree that this early settlement scheme has been abandoned or terminated more in the interests of saving money than in the interests of those who have suffered injuries while in the service of the country?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	220	At the end of October of this year, a total of 1,126 hearing impairment claims were settled compared to 2,728 settled during the same period last year. However, it is anticipated that approximately 2,000 claims will be finalised this year compared to the original estimate that 2,500 would be settled. There are a number of claims still outstanding, but the money being saved this year is due to the fact that court proceedings, settlements, etc., will not be completed by the end of the year.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	221	I propose to take Questions Nos. 46, 49, 115, 116, 126 and 128 together.On 15 July 1998, the Government approved a programme of evacuation and sale of six barracks which are considered surplus to military requirements. The barracks in question are located at Fermoy, Castleblayney, Naas, Kildare, Ballinollig and Clancy Barracks, Dublin.The sale of 19.218 acres at the former Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, to Cork County Council, in conjunction with IDA Ireland, for €973,889 has been completed. In relation to Castleblayney, the sale of the property to the North Eastern Health Board for €761,843 has been completed.The former Devoy Barracks, Naas, County Kildare, comprises an area of approximately 22 acres. The Minister for Defence agreed to cede seven acres, free of charge, to Naas Urban District Council and to sell one acre to Kildare County Council for €380,921, all for local community purposes. The Minister also agreed to sell the remaining 14 acres or thereabouts, which are zoned for housing, to Naas Urban District Council for €8,888,167. The sales have been completed.Magee Barracks, Kildare, still remains to be sold. At present, approximately 15 acres of the property are being used by the Reception and Integration Agency of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform to accommodate asylum seekers and a further site comprising approximately one acre is being used by Kildare County Council as a temporary halting site for 20 persons.Agreement has been reached for the sale of approximately 91 acres of the total lands comprising 138 acres at Murphy Barracks, Ballincollig, and it is hoped to close the sale shortly. Negotiations are continuing regarding the sale of the Department's reversionary leasehold interest in a further area of about six acres at the former Murphy Barracks. Approximately 27 acres of the barracks' lands will be handed over to Cork County Council for community use on completion of the sale. The Department accepted an offer in June 2002 for the sale of Clancy Barracks in Dublin. It is hoped to have a contract of sale completed shortly.The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 set out the decision of Government to maintain a strength of 10,500 within the Permanent Defence Force. The transfer of military units between barracks may arise from time to time for various operational or other reasons. A decision was taken to decentralise a number of units to Kickham Barracks in Clonmel. The units which moved to Clonmel were the directorate of military police, directorate of reserve forces and HQ1 southern brigade, FCA. These three units comprise 23 personnel in all. The transfers took effect on 30 September-1 October 2002. The Minister has no plans to close any further barracks.As regards the military post at Manorhamilton, this is the location of D Company, 19th Infantry Battalion, and is situated in the Old School House, which is the property of the Department of Defence. The current Permanent Defence Force strength attached to this unit is two NCOs and one private. As the Minister indicated in his reply to Question No. 135 on 22 October 2002, a military board, namely, the Reserve Defence Force review implementation board, was established to formulate a plan for the implementation of the recommendations of the special steering group on the reserve. The Minister for Defence established the steering group in 1998 to undertake a study of the reserve and the group reported to him in September 1999. In June this year, the Minister received the draft Reserve Defence Force review implementation board report from the Chief of Staff and that draft report is currently under examination.The steering group report did propose an amalgamation of the 19th Infantry Battalion and the 24th Infantry Battalion. The military authorities have advised that the proposed amalgamation will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake actively in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force envisaged both by the reserve steering group and by the recent military implementation board.Additional informationI am advised that this proposed amalgamation will not affect the use of the current departmental premises in Manorhamilton. In addition to the foregoing properties, agreements have also been reached for the sale of the following: 3.0192 acres at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, to Limerick City Council for €1.162 million; 1.559 acres at Waterford Barracks to Waterford Corporation for €0.662 million; 20 acres of the Curragh lands to Kildare County Council for €0.273 million to assist with the construction of the Kildare bypass; married quarters at Orchard Park, Curragh, County Kildare, to residents, which will realise €3.8 approximately – to date €2.8 million has been received; three sites at Renmore, comprising approximately ten acres, to Galway City Council for €250,316; and 1.07 acres at Arbour Hill to the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform for €3.174 million.Consideration is being given to the disposal of part of the lands at Gormanston Camp. However, it is intended that the military camp, comprising 58 acres, will be retained. A total of 6.39 acres, known as "Susan's field", adjoining Collins Barracks, Cork, has been sold to Cork Corporation for €1.523 million. In addition to the foregoing properties, which are surplus to requirements, and in the context of the White Paper on Defence and the management of resources in the best possible way, the military authorities have been asked to identify any additional properties considered surplus to requirements. This process is ongoing.The barracks reinvestment programme was initiated by the Minister for Defence in 1999 to complement expenditure on the normal range of building and engineering works for the purpose of providing modern living, operational and training accommodation for the Defence Forces. It was agreed that the proceeds from the sale of the barracks would be used to fund this reinvestment programme, which is centred mainly on the Curragh Camp and on Collins Barracks, Cork. The total cost of the programme, estimated to the end of 2002, is €68.75 million. The programme commenced in 1999 and the final projects will be placed in 2002.Expenditure on the programme to date is as follows: 1999 –€3.6 million; 2000 –€10 million; 2001 –€38.7 million; 2002 – estimated €16.45 million; total – estimated €68.75 million.

What discussions, if any, have taken place, in the context of the Estimates and the budgetary process within the Department, about cutbacks and how they might affect manpower levels in the Defence Forces and the continued existence of military establishments throughout the country? Have there been any reports or discussions in the Department regarding reductions in numbers or the possible closure of facilities, in light of the Taoiseach's statement yesterday about further cutbacks? Some of the six barracks which were sold contained accommodation for retired military personnel. What is the situation of those individuals? Will the Minister give an assurance that natural wastage will not be used in the coming year to reduce the numbers serving in the Defence Forces? Will all vacancies that arise be filled?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	223	There is a commitment in the programme for Government for 10,500 personnel to serve in the Defence Forces. As of 30 September, the strength was 10,606, which includes 242 recruits in training. The Estimate provides for a total strength of 10,500 with an additional 250 recruits in training at any time. That remains the commitment of the Government. This year 468 privates, cadets and apprentices have been recruited and the recruitment programme will continue.I spoke earlier about the savings under various subheads but as the Estimates process continues there will be various considerations to be taken into account. It is the intention of the Government to maintain the Defence Forces and not to sell any further Army facilities. My reply also refers to agreements that have been reached with regard to small acreages at Sarsfield Barracks, Limerick, and Waterford Barracks. It is our intention to meet our commitments.

This will almost inevitably lead to a downgrading of the Manorhamilton military post. Is the Minister of State aware of the importance of that military post? It is part of the infrastructure of the town, which serves a wide geographical area from Drumkeerin in County Leitrim to Ballyshannon bridge in County Donegal and from Dowra and Blacklion in west Cavan to Calry and Ballintore in County Sligo. Does she comprehend that any streamlining or reorganisation of this post would be equivalent to removing a small Government industry from a small rural town? How will the downgrading of such a post in a rural area be justified in terms of rural proofing, which has been promised in the White Paper on rural development?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	225	I am advised that the proposed amalgamation will not affect the use of the Department's premises in Manorhamilton. I appreciate that such a unit would have a major impact in a rural area. If the amalgamation goes ahead as proposed, consideration will be given to rural proofing and the effect on the area.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	227	The military authorities have advised that the proposed amalgamation will provide an optimal environment for personnel in the relevant areas to partake actively in the new enhanced Reserve Defence Force envisaged by the steering group and by the military implementation board. It is not envisaged that there will be any downgrading of Manorhamilton.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	228	The decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps last July was taken due to the budgetary constraints, which meant that the level of defence expenditure had to be reduced this year. The decision was extremely difficult for the Minister. He regarded the acquisition of the helicopters for the Air Corps as a priority. He is aware of the huge effort put into the tender process by Air Corps personnel and of their evident disappointment when the decision not to proceed was announced.When the decision was made, the Minister asked his officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue while taking account of the current financial position. An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions. This work is at an early stage.The Minister is adamant that there will be long-term involvement by the Air Corps in search and rescue. A decision has been taken in consultation with the Irish Coast Guard to lease a medium lift helicopter for three years. The helicopter will be operated by Air Corps pilots out of Sligo Airport from early next year. Training of Air Corps personnel is well under way on this process. Despite the fact that expenditure programmes have now to be prioritised, the Minister will not allow anything to take precedence over the long-term development of the Air Corps' most important resource, its pilots. The main priority for the Air Corps is the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft.The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft is going well and the Minister is hopeful that he will be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	229	Will the Minister of State agree that this shocking U-turn on the part of the Government will have serious implications for the viability of the Air Corps and for the effectiveness of our search and rescue service? Lives may well be lost as a result of the decision which will jeopardise up to 1,500 jobs at FLS Aerospace in north Dublin, as Sikorsky had agreed to provide significant additional business for the plant as part of the contract process.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	230	Yes, it was a disappointment both for the Air Corps and the Minister that this did not go ahead. Budgetary constraints meant that it was not possible but that does not mean that the medium-lift helicopters will not become available. The process being engaged in now is somewhat different in that, for example, public-private partnerships are being examined. It is a scenario that has worked successfully in other areas and we believe it could be realistic in this case also. We are very confident of the long-term future for the Air Corps and we want to ensure that proper training continues. Pilots are the most important asset of the Air Corps. We are moving to provide fixed-wing training aircraft which is a major requirement. That aircraft, together with the provision of a second Garda helicopter and the Sikorsky-S61 for search and rescue in the north-west bodes well for positive future developments.The Minister for Transport is ensuring that all airport jobs are protected and we hope that when we go ahead with the provision of extra helicopters under the PPP arrangement it may be possible to provide even greater guarantees in this regard.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	231	I stated that lives may be lost as a result of the decision not to proceed with the Sikorsky contract, but what further cuts does the Government propose to make in this regard? The Minister of State has said that six area units have been disposed of by the Air Corps. Surely it is reasonable to expect that the amount accruing from the sale of such units, including Fitzgerald Camp, Fermoy, in my constituency, is made available for Defence Forces funding?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	232	I reject absolutely and out of hand the Deputy's suggestion that lives are in danger as a result of the decision not to go ahead with the Sikorsky contract. Any such suggestion would only serve to undermine the valuable search and rescue work by helicopter crews based in Dublin, Donegal, Shannon and Waterford. We expect to go ahead with three new helicopters, which will add greatly to that search and rescue work, but that must be done in agreement with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources. It would be wrong to give the impression that people's lives have been put in danger as a result of one contract not going ahead.The money the Department of Defence obtains from the sale of barracks will of course be invested for the good of the Defence Forces.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	233	I propose to take Questions Nos. 48, 118 and 119 together.Married quarters are provided for serving personnel of the Permanent Defence Force. The Department of Defence has no responsibility for the provision of accommodation for ex-members of the force or their families. On being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force, soldiers are obliged to vacate married quarters within a number of weeks of their discharge and in this regard the vast majority of occupants comply with this requirement.On 26 August 2002, the Department wrote to the occupiers of 54 quarters which were overheld, and requested that they vacate the quarters in which they were residing. The Minister subsequently met representatives of the overholders in the Curragh Camp on 2 October 2002. Since then, officials of the Department have interviewed the persons concerned to establish the particular circumstances in each case. It is now the Department's intention to work with Kildare County Council, the statutory body responsible for housing, with a view to resolving the problem of overholding, and it is hoped to meet officials of the council in the near future. All options will be discussed with the council, including affordable housing, shared ownership and co-operative housing schemes. Every effort will be made to ensure that the council offers assistance in all cases where the individuals are eligible for local authority housing and grant applications for mortgages in cases where overholders have been offered sale of the quarters. Each case will be considered on its own merits and the Department will be in further contact with each of the individuals concerned in due course. In the interim, no further action will be taken in the matter.

There is a significant waiting list in Kildare for local authority housing. Will the Minister say whether extra accommodation will be provided by Kildare County Council to house these families?Does the Minister of State agree with the language used by the Minister in a statement last September? Will she not agree it was both inappropriate and intemperate to say that he was going "to lance this boil" and that unless the people concerned moved out within a month he would initiate eviction proceedings? Will the Minister of State agree that the word "eviction" has deep-rooted connotations in the Irish psyche? It brings back to all our minds the picture of the battering ram used to evict tenants in earlier centuries. I hope the Minister does not envisage throwing out families who have provided such valuable service in the defence of the State. The Minister of State should give an undertaking that no families will be thrown out on the side of the road.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	235	The Deputy is very sensitive, obviously, about the issues involved. As I have said, however, every case will be dealt with on its own merits and the families concerned will be spoken to individually. A number of them, although not a majority by any means, have been offered the option of purchasing the quarters. Others are located within the security fence, so it has not been possible to offer them that option. I appreciate the Deputy's remarks concerning the housing list in County Kildare and that is why the Department is anxious to deal with each individual case. It is not the Department's intention to seek the eviction of persons who are not in a position to pay for their own accommodation. Some people are now employed outside the Defence Forces, yet they are paying a rate of €1.20 per day in respect of quarters that were built prior to 1954. Others who are no longer employed in the Defence Forces are paying up to €27 per week. The Minister has to examine how best use can be made of these quarters, while remaining sensitive to the needs of the people in those quarters.

The Minister should be responsible for this matter until everyone involved has been adequately housed, and no evictions should occur.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	237	The Department will work closely with Kildare County Council and has opened negotiations with the various families concerned. We are talking about 54 quarters being overheld. There are 73 married quarters in the Curragh Camp and a further 54 – those are the numbers to which we refer. Further consultation and discussion will continue.
Question No. 49 answered with Question No. 46.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	238	I propose to take Questions Nos. 50 and 82 together.A key focus for the Minister for Defence since his appointment has been the acquisition of new equipment and the provision of modern accommodation for the Defence Forces. Significant investment has taken place which has ensured that the Defence Forces are now well equipped for their roles at home and overseas.While much has been done, both on the equipment and the infrastructure fronts, the Minister is aware that more needs to be done. While expenditure programmes will now have to be prioritised due to the changed financial situation, substantive equipment and building programmes will still go ahead to enhance the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces. For example, discussions are commencing with Mowag of Switzerland this week on the acquisition of a further 25 armoured personnel carriers. In addition, the tender competition for the acquisition of trainer aircraft for the Air Corps is progressing well and the Minister hopes to be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of a contract before the end of the year.With regard to infrastructural improvements, significant contracts are ongoing in various barracks, particularly in the Curragh Camp and Collins Barracks, Cork.The Minister has ensured that there has been a policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in recent years and this policy will continue. Training of personnel has always been top of the Minister's agenda. Training will continue to be regarded as a priority and training programmes will not be curtailed in any respect because of the changed financial situation.

Will the Minister of State explain precisely the role of PPPs in the Defence Forces? To what extent will they be used to assist in the provision of the services the Defence Forces are expected to provide? What are the precedents for the use of PPP in defence and security generally? In view of the current crisis, with potential threats from international terrorism coming ever increasingly into focus, does the Minister for Defence recognise the need to ensure the Permanent Defence Forces are adequately equipped and up to date in terms of all aspects of training and equipment?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	240	Public private partnerships are being considered only in relation to the medium lift helicopters at present. A working group from the Departments of Defence and Communications, Marine and Natural Resources is examining PPPs and other options, particularly in that regard, but at present there is no proposal to move that forward. As the Deputy will be aware, PPP is being developed in other areas also.The aim of the Minister and of the Department is to ensure our Defence Forces are fully trained and equipped to deal with all eventualities and that is why that investment is still going ahead and why we are getting the new equipment. Other new equipment has to do with specialised transport cargo vehicles, new troop carrying vehicles, new tactical VHF radios and so on. It is our continued aim to ensure that not only the facilities and the training but also the equipment of the Defence Forces is kept up to date.

Have the cutbacks to which the Minister of State referred had any effect in the area of training in preparation for participation in the Rapid Reaction Force? Is that training taking place and, if so, what stage has it reached? Is the required equipment being purchased or is all of this being held up due to the cutbacks?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	242	That is the subject of Question No. 63. Should I wait until we reach it?

#BernardJDurkan	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-party	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-dob	unknown-#BernardJDurkan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	244	It has been suggested by the Minister of State, Deputy Hanafin, that the dropping of the Sikorsky contract does not particularly affect the degree to which services can be provided by the Defence Forces. In that event, what was the purpose of the contract in the first place? It would appear that by leasing aircraft, other than fixed-wing aircraft, it would be possible to continue as before. If at first it was thought the Sikorsky helicopters were necessary for the degree of service envisaged at the time they were ordered, I am at a loss to know why they do not affect the delivery of service.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	245	As I mentioned earlier, the helicopter lease will be a three year contract. Obviously it was the intention when we went to tender to have equipment of our own for the longer term.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	246	On the cutbacks and the Sikorsky deal, the last time the Minister answered questions in the Dáil he vigorously defended that deal even though many of us were of the opinion that it was suspect from the very beginning. There were legal proceedings initiated by Eurocopter, to name but one, which felt aggrieved at how this contract was given out. Does the Minister of State agree this cutback or re-adjustment has been a diplomatic loophole for the Minister to get out of that suspect deal?

#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	251	On Question No. 82, the effect of such cutbacks and adjustments will have serious implications for the development of the Defence Forces? The Minister of State answered clearly but I did not get the message. I request her to repeat that part.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	252	At the outset I stated where the savings have been made. The savings on hearing loss compensation are due because they would not be paid before the end of the year. In no way are the Defence Forces going to suffer as a result of that.The Air Corps is affected only as a result of not going ahead with the contract for the helicopter but, as I stated earlier, there will be a leased helicopter and therefore it will not affect them. Their training, numbers and so on will continue as heretofore. The savings on pay and allowances – the other €13 million – are due to the rate of recruitment being less than anticipated. There are, however, still 10,606 members. We do not envisage that the current number and regular recruitment will be affected.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	253	We have been dealing with income and expenditure in the Department and, until now, mostly with expenditure. What has happened to the income that accrued from the sale of Defence Forces properties to date? Is a brochure of extra property to be disposed of prepared or being prepared in the Department?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	254	All the money gained from the sale of properties has been re-invested in full in the Department of Defence and in the Defence Forces. No such brochure is planned. It is not our intention to sell any further barracks.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	255	There are currently 30 posts in the Civil Defence branch of the Department of Defence. To date 12 members of staff serving in the Department have indicated a desire to transfer to Roscrea. In addition over 100 civil servants in other Departments have indicated an interest in transferring to Roscrea. It is expected that the Civil Defence school and branch will relocate to Roscrea in mid-2003.There are currently no further decentralisation plans for the Department.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	256	Are any groups or individuals refusing to transfer to the out-station in Roscrea?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	257	We are confident that all the vacancies will be filled by voluntary transfer. Already 12 members of staff have indicated their wish to transfer to Roscrea as well as 100 officials from other Departments. This will fill the vacancies there.All unions and associations have been fully informed of what is happening.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	258	There are eight personal injury claims on record relating to riot training exercises. Four cases have settled to date at a cost of €53,329. The safety of those engaged in these exercises is of primary concern. Prior to the exercise they are instructed by safety personnel attached to the training school. The exercises are conducted in such a way that those in charge can intervene as required. In addition safety equipment, anti-riot helmets with visors, protective elbow and knee pads and safety shields are provided.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	259	Would the Minister of State agree that proper facilities must be provided so that training exercises do not result in claims of this nature being necessary?Soldiers have made claims for battle stress resulting from training in riot situations. What does the Minister of State propose to do about that?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	260	The eight claims referred to relate to four incidents over the 12 year period from 1990. Deputy Sherlock is right in saying sufficient safeguards should be put in place and the Minister is satisfied that such safeguards are now in place. Such strategies include pre-exercise safety briefings conducted for troops and rioters in the mock events by school staff. The riot situation is stage managed by the use of scenario serials and each serial represents an escalation in behaviour such as shouting, pushing, throwing objects etcetera. The instructional staff are pre-briefed and familiar with each serial and can readily intervene to control the training as required. In addition, safety equipment such as riot helmets, elbow and knee pads, and safety shields are provided.

Were they of a superficial nature or have people been incapacitated or obliged to retire from the service because of them?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	262	In the main the injuries were caused by the use of baton rounds. In 1997 a Cabinet sub-committee decided these would no longer be permitted.In 1990 a private was struck across the back of the neck and his case settled for £25,000. During a riot control exercise in Casement Aerodrome a private and two apprentices who had volunteered for the roles of rioters and demonstrators sustained head injuries and their cases were settled for £7,500, £4,750 and £4,750. This would not indicate very serious injuries.In Kilpedder Camp on 18 July 1995 a number of privates were required to gather in a confined space and while so confined rocks, including a canister of smoke, were thrown into the confined space. Three privates sustained injuries as a result of smoke inhalation. In November 1999, while involved in a riot drill exercise in O'Neill Barracks in Cavan, a private received a head injury and these cases have not come to court.

Has the use of baton rounds by the Defence Forces ended?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	264	When the Cabinet sub-committee on security decided in 1997 that the use of baton rounds would no longer be permitted the Government issued a direction accordingly. Baton rounds have not been used by the Defence Forces for operations or training since then. In fact, all baton rounds were withdrawn on direction and destroyed.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	266	For the purpose of the training exercise a canister of smoke was used.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	267	The Department has accepted an offer from Florence Properties Limited, Jersey, for the sale of Clancy Barracks, Dublin. A contract of sale is expected to be completed shortly. Pending completion of the sale contract it would not be appropriate to refer to the sale price or conditions of sale at this time.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	268	The Minister of State's answer indicates that the sale will be completed very shortly. Has the Minister examined the possibility of ensuring that the property is used for housing or for some other useful purpose?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	269	It is expected that the contract will be signed in the coming weeks. The question of the sale of Department of Defence property for housing was discussed in the Dáil earlier this year, before the Deputy's re-election. It has been agreed to sell the property to Florence Properties.

Is the property inclined to go to the highest bidder or is consideration given to the needs of voluntary organisations or to social housing?
#SeamusPattison	unknown-#SeamusPattison-party	unknown-#SeamusPattison-dob	unknown-#SeamusPattison-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	271	I draw the Deputy's attention to the fact that Question No. 53 is specific and relates only to Clancy Barracks.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The main considerations are those of the open market. Every Department must be seen to get the best value for its property. However, the Deputy is aware that some land has been sold to Kildare County Council for community use. In trying to fulfil a civic duty we must be cognisant of the requirement to get the best value.
#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	273	Who are the beneficial owners of Florence Properties, an off-shore company based in Jersey?Dublin City Council also made a bid for Clancy Barracks. It is a pity the land was not sold to the local authority, in line with the other policy adopted by the Department. Could the council's bid not be re-examined by the Department?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	274	I am not sure the Deputy is correct regarding a bid from Dublin City Council. It is my understanding that the council did not wish to go ahead with that bid.Because a contract of sale has not been signed I am not in a position to give information about the beneficial owners of Florence Properties.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	275	There are about 1,075 civilians employed with military units at present. Civilian employees are typically engaged to free military personnel from non-military tasks or engaged in areas where there is a specialist or technical need which is best addressed through the employment of civilians. The number and grade of civilian employees at each location is kept under ongoing review in the light of military requirements and value for money considerations.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	276	There are about 1,075 civilians employed with military units at locations throughout the country. Has there been a reduction in the figure in recent years, has it been static or has it increased? Are the employees employed on an ad hoc basis or has the Defence Forces or the Department a definite policy on the mix between enlisted and civilian people in the Defence Forces?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	277	The filling of all vacancies is reviewed on an ongoing basis. The Deputy is correct in saying that 1,075 civilians are employed. The vacancies are filled by appointment from candidates nominated for interview by FÁS-Training and Employment Authority, open competition, advertisements in the public press etc.The number in the Defence Forces per se is 10,500. The civilian number on top of that is the number I have outlined. I do not believe a particular ratio is adopted.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	278	Tenders were received in August 2002 for the supply of eight turbo-prop training aircraft to replace the Marchetti aircraft in the pilot training role. These tenders are being evaluated and the Minister hopes to place a contract before the end of the year.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	279	There is a need for aircraft for pilots to be deployed because if they do not have them they will leave the Air Corps.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	280	It is quite a substantial investment as well. The total cost is expected to be in the range of €45 million to €60 million. A number of tenders were received and the Minister is looking forward to signing the contract by the end of the year.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	281	I seek clarification on whether the extra planes for the Air Corps are for defensive purposes. Will they be armed?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	282	The aircraft will be used for pilot training and they will have a light armament capability so they can be used for security or defence operations if necessary.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	283	I propose to take Questions Nos. 56, 57 and 65 together.The Garda air support unit, GASU, currently comprises one twin-engined AS355N Squirrel helicopter and one Defender 4000 fixed-wing aircraft. The Garda Síochána is responsible for the operational control and policing functions of the service, while the Air Corps personnel have responsibility for all matters relating to the flying and maintenance of the aircraft.With the introduction of the EC 135, the Air Corps will assume responsibility for the flying of this aircraft, while the maintenance will be contracted out. The original plan had been to contract out both flying and maintenance. However, for technical, operational and legal reasons this did not prove possible. The Air Corps will continue to be responsible for all matters relating to the flying and maintenance of the existing aircraft.The Air Corps, which is responsible for registration of aircraft on the State military register, is currently finalising arrangements to accept the EC 135 on to that register. It is expected that this acceptance procedure will soon be completed and that the aircraft will be delivered to the Air Corps later this month. Following an initial work-up period, the aircraft will then become operational. While the introduction of the new aircraft has taken some time, due to lead times for the manufacture of the aircraft and the extensive fitting out of the aircraft with highly sophisticated equipment, both the Department of Defence and the Air Corps have co-operated fully in this process.The question of night flying capacity has been the subject of ongoing communication between the Departments of Defence and Justice, Equality and Law Reform. It should be noted that there are no restrictions on the Garda helicopter for night operations in the greater Dublin area, where the greatest number of night call-outs has occurred. Cover is also provided on request in urban areas outside Dublin. The demand for night-time air support in non-urban areas is relatively small. However, it is obviously desirable that the facility for air support in rural areas would be available should it be required, while having regard to the absolute priority of the safe operation of the aircraft. I am pleased to report that a training programme for night operations is being developed in conjunction with the introduction into service of the new EC 135.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	284	When does the Minister of State expect the aircraft to be operational? She may have already answered that but I did not pick it up if she did. What type of operations are envisaged? Will they pertain to security, traffic control or flights of mercy to bring patients to hospital?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	285	We hope that it will be fully operational by early next year. Obviously, the aircraft will be available for night-time cover, which will include security. I do not know if airlifts to hospitals will be a function, but, as I said, the purpose will largely be to assist the Garda with the night cover it normally does.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	286	Has the Minister of State stated that this agreement has been reached and that the helicopter will be made available, because one can strongly criticise what could be described as an unacceptable level of bureaucratic bungling by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform which has left a badly-needed second helicopter for the Garda sitting unused in an airfield in the UK for almost two years? Why has it taken so much time? When does the Minister of State expect that the aircraft will be available for service?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	287	I expect the aircraft to be operational by early next year, not just contracted.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	288	Does the Minister accept the aircraft is being brought to this country as a statement of fact? Is it correct that it will be put into use early next year?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	289	Yes, I confirm what the Deputy is saying.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	290	The Judge Advocate General, Ms Oonah McCrann, has completed her review of the circumstances surrounding the retirement of ex-lieutenant Donal de Róiste and recently submitted her report to the Minister with her conclusions and recommendations. A copy of her report has been forwarded to Mr. de Róiste's solicitors. In accordance with her recommendations, arrangements are being made for Mr. de Róiste to have access to view all the documentation relating to the circumstances of his retirement.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	291	Does the Minister's reply mean that there is an agreement between the de Róiste family and the Department?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	292	The Department and the Minister are very anxious to move on the report of the Judge Advocate General and to work on her recommendations, one of which was that Mr. de Róiste would have access to the documentation. Those arrangements are now being made with him and the family.
#JoeSherlock	unknown-#JoeSherlock-party	unknown-#JoeSherlock-dob	unknown-#JoeSherlock-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	293	Is the Minister of State saying that the de Róiste family is prepared to reach an agreement with the Department based on the judge's findings? The family is prepared to reach an agreement with the Department based on the judge's findings.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	294	I understand that on 14 November the family will view the documents regarding the circumstances surrounding the treatment of the person concerned.
#DinnyMcGinley	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-party	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-dob	unknown-#DinnyMcGinley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	295	Does the Minister of State agree that in view of the publicity surrounding it, this case has generated much comment and concern, especially in the past year? Does she agree it is unforgivable that it has taken almost a quarter of a century to progress the case to its present stage? In view of the trauma this man's family has suffered, will she give a guarantee that everything possible will be done to bring the case to a satisfactory conclusion as soon as possible? It does not reflect well on the Defence Forces, the Department or the country that satisfactory answers have not been given to outstanding questions.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	296	It would be inappropriate to discuss the details of this case and I know Deputy McGinley does not wish to do so. However, he is correct when he says the case has generated huge interest. A number of extraordinary and bizarre suggestions were made in sections of the media. The Minister considers it especially regrettable that utterly unfounded imputations and insinuations of impropriety were aired in one national newspaper against a named individual Army officer who is now deceased and who had no personal involvement in the case. It caused great distress to his widow and children. The judge fully investigated the matter, including undertaking a comprehensive examination of all documentation and facts, and did not find a scintilla of evidence in support of any of those suggestions. On the contrary, all the documentary evidence at the time leads one inevitably to the same conclusion reached by the military authorities in 1969. The Minister is satisfied that the judge's report and investigation was thorough. We hope, therefore, that when the family views the documents next week it will also be satisfied.

Procedures are in place, for example, interviews are conducted when people leave the Defence Forces. These measures provide a good form of protection to individuals and the Defence Forces.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	300	On the night of 27 November 2001, a progression course from two to three star private ranking was under way in the Glen of Imaal. A number of personnel were instructed to fire blank ammunition during the course of the exercise, however, a number of live rounds of ammunition were accidentally discharged. The injured private received bullet wounds to his arm and chest. A military ambulance was on site and he was immediately treated by a qualified emergency medical technician. He was then transferred to Tallaght hospital and subsequently to St. James's Hospital where he underwent treatment.Military police were immediately called to the scene and carried out a full investigation. Resulting from this investigation military disciplinary action is ongoing. In addition, a civil action has been initiated on behalf of the injured party. Against this background it would be inappropriate for me to comment further on the matter at this time. However, I assure the Deputy that safety procedures have been revised to prevent a recurrence of similar events.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	301	Arising from a recommendation made in 1990 by the commission on remuneration and conditions of service in the Defence Forces, the Gleeson Commission, military service allowance was made pensionable in the case of personnel retiring on or after 1 August 1990. This approach was fully consistent with settled public service pensions policy, which provides that the benefit of an allowance being made pensionable for serving personnel does not extend to existing pensioners. More recently, the commission on public service pensions specifically addressed the issue of the pensionability of allowance, including the MSA, and the consequences for public service pensioners generally in its final report, which was published in January 2001. The commission was an independent body which had invited submissions from interested parties through an advertisement in the national press in September 1996. I understand that groups representative of military pensioners were among those who made submissions and were met by the commission.However, having considered the arguments advanced by the groups affected, together with long-standing public service pensions policy in that context and the substantial cost implications involved, the commission did not recommend any increase for the pensioners concerned. No change in existing policy on this matter has been authorised.

Is she aware that the Progressive Democrats general election manifesto recognised the contribution made in earlier years by members of the Defence Forces who have since retired and that it undertook to ensure that military service allowances be payable to pensioners? Does the Minister of State agree with this?

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	304	The individual referred to retired voluntarily from the Permanent Defence Force on 1 October 2002 after six years' service. She joined the Defence Forces as a cadet in October 1996 and was commissioned as a second-lieutenant in July 1998. On commissioning, she was posted as riding officer to the Army Equitation School. During her service at the school she was a regular prizewinner on the national circuit and represented the country at an event in Lyon, France, in 2002 where she finished the show as the leading lady rider.Following her application to retire from the Defence Forces she was interviewed by her commanding officer. During this interview she indicated she wanted to pursue a change in career. The officer in question was a valued member of the Army Equitation School and her positive contribution to that establishment was always appreciated. She has now embarked on another career and she may be assured that the good wishes of all ranks of her former unit go with her in that new career.

Is she aware of comments in the newspapers which indicate that she was not made to feel fully welcome in the Army? Is the Minister of State happy with such a situation? Former Lieutenant Quinlivan is reported to have referred to the Army as being a man's world and said that she found herself frustrated in progressing her career as a woman Army officer. Does the Minister of State accept that is not the kind of welcome that should have been extended to her?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	306	The lady in question was an outstanding showjumper and a great asset to the Army Equitation School. I understand the Defence Forces have nothing to indicate that the comments reported in the newspapers were made by her, either when she left or prior to her leaving the Army. She undertook an exit interview with her commanding officer when she applied to retire at which she indicated her wish to change her career. In response to some of the issues that were in the paper the officer in question was allocated horses and opportunities based on the criteria of compatibility, skill and so on, as with all other riders in the school. We do not have any evidence to back up the comments made in the papers.

There was a lovely photograph of Lieutenant Quinlivan and her horse in the paper. Is the Minister not concerned that there could be some truth in the assertions that she did not feel comfortable continuing in her army career? This was an outstanding member of the army, one who brought pride to it and the country by representing us so well.I extend my best wishes to Lieutenant Quinlivan and hope that she will be able to continue to represent the country in another role. Will the Minster ensure that the comments that were made will be taken seriously and examined, so as to prevent any woman in the army, in any capacity, from being made to feel that it is a man's world with no place, or career, for her?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	310	I agree, absolutely, with Deputy O'Keeffe. I too, would like to wish Lieutenant Quinlivan well in her equitation and her newly chosen career. All of us would want to ensure that workplace bullying at whatever level and against whomever should be stamped out. That is why the Defence Forces and the Minister asked Dr. Eileen Doyle to carry out an external review in regard to harassment, sexual harassment, bullying, discrimination and so on, in regard to the Defence Forces. She completed a very fine report with a large number of recommendations, all of which have been accepted by the Minister. It is only with the commitment that now exists for their implementation that we can wipe out what she found to be very unacceptable levels of harassment, bullying etc. This is the only way we can prevent incidences such as that referred to by Deputy O'Keeffe.

Is the Minister of State aware that not so long ago an attempt was made to board an Irish airline in a foreign country by someone who was armed?Does the Minister of State not agree that neutrality is a nonsense if we do not have the capacity and the capability to protect that neutrality? Is she satisfied that we have that ability at present as far as our air cover is concerned?
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	313	The Deputy will be aware that we have a very fine defence force, 10,606 in number who are constantly being trained and re-trained to cater for every eventuality. They are very well equipped with the most up to date equipment which might be needed for changing circumstances. As he knows, at the moment the Air Corps has 17 fixed wing aircraft and 12 helicopters which are used for various purposes, be they for basic pilot training, twin-engine pilot training, fisheries surveillance, air ambulance and search and rescue purposes.With regard to transport capabilities, as referred to in the question, that is done by chartered aircraft. We are quite satisfied that the ability and numbers of our Defence Forces is sufficient.

#Bertie	unknown-#Bertie-party	unknown-#Bertie-dob	unknown-#Bertie-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	315	I attended the European Council meeting held in Brussels on 24 and 25 October together with the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen. The Minister of State with special responsibility for European Affairs, Deputy Roche, was also a member of the delegation. The European Council marked a major watershed in the enlargement process. In particular, the agreement on the financial aspects of enlargement was a major achievement and a most satisfactory one from Ireland's point of view. The meeting was the first European Council meeting to be conducted according to the shorter and more focused format agreed at the Seville European Council. Copies of the Presidency Conclusions have been laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas. The positive outcome to our referendum on 19 October laid the basis for achieving a successful outcome to the meeting. The Irish people stretched out the hand of welcome and friendship to the peoples of the accession countries. By doing so, we removed the last major obstacle on the path to enlargement.In Brussels, we decided that ten candidate countries close to concluding their negotiations will be able to become members of the European Union in 2004. These countries are: Cyprus, the Czech Republic, Estonia, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Malta, Poland, the Slovak Republic and Slovenia. As Ireland will hold the Presidency of the European Union from 1 January 2004, the honour of welcoming the new member states will fall to us. The dynamic created by the successful outcome of our referendum on Nice should not be under estimated. The resounding and positive welcome by the Irish people to the people of the candidate countries was enormously significant. This sense of historic opportunity was shared, not only by the members of the European Council, but by the President of the European Parliament, Pat Cox, who addressed the members of the European Council on this issue.I am also happy that, as a result of the positive outcome to our referendum, Ireland's place at the heart of Europe, where we belong, has been secured. I took the opportunity to thank the members of the European Council, including the President of the European Commission, Romano Prodi, for their positive response to the referendum outcome. I thanked them also for the support they had shown to Ireland, in particular the adoption of the declarations agreed in Seville last June. While much work is required to be done to conclude the negotiations at the European Council in Copenhagen in December, the key elements of the European Union's approach to the enlargement negotiations, including the financial aspects, were agreed. The Financial Perspective for the period 2000 to 2006, which was agreed at the Berlin European Council in March 1999, included a provision for the application of the Common Agricultural Policy, with the exception of direct payments, to six new member states.The Commission's recent proposal that direct payments should be gradually extended to the ten candidate countries considered ready to join the Union in 2004, required a new decision from the European Council on the agricultural aspects of enlargement, at least for the period 2004 to 2006.The Commission proposed that direct payments should apply incrementally to the new member states, with the first increment of 25% of the level applicable in the Union of 15 to apply in 2004, followed by three increments of 5% in the next three years, and, from 2008, by annual increments of 10%, reaching 100% in 2013. The European Council accepted the Commission's proposals. Direct payments are made a year in arrears and consequently the budgetary impact of, for example, paying 100% direct payments to the new member states in respect of 2013 will not be felt until 2014. The cost of this proposal is estimated by the Commission at €1.3 billion in 2005 rising to €4.7 billion in 2013.The Brussels European Council decided that the total annual outlay on market-related expenditure and direct payments should not exceed the amount in real terms of the ceiling set for these expenditures for the Union of 15 for 2006 by the Berlin European Council, plus the amount of these expenditures for the ten new member states in 2006 as estimated by the Commission. These two amounts, €42.8 billion and €2.5 billion respectively, constitute the baseline for future years. The European Council decided that expenditure in nominal terms over the years 2007 to 2013 should be kept within this baseline, increased by 1% a year. These decisions relate to a Union of 25. A separate decision about funding for Bulgaria and Romania will have to be made prior to their accession which is at present targeted for 2007.The annual 1% increase in the budget over the 2006 baseline provides funding of €48.6 billion in 2013. The cost of market-related expenditure and direct payments in the new member states in 2013 is estimated by the Commission at €5.5 billion. That leaves a balance of €43.1 billion for the existing Union which compares favourably with current levels of expenditure of between €40 billion and €41 billion. These decisions of the European Council are stated to be without prejudice to future decisions on the Common Agriculture Policy and the financing of the European Union after 2006; any result following the implementation of the reviews of the Agenda 2000 agreement provided for by the Berlin European Council; and the international commitments which the Union has undertaken, inter alia, in launching the Doha round of WTO negotiations.While the Brussels agreement is, as I stated, without prejudice to the outcome of the mid-term review of Agenda 2000, there is now little likelihood that a qualified majority can be obtained for any significant change in Common Agricultural Policy until 2007. A further positive feature of the Brussels agreement is that no upper limits have been placed after 2006 on rural development expenditure which includes agri-environmental programmes such as the rural environment protection scheme, forestry and farmer retirement. The European Council also emphasised that the needs of farmers living in disadvantaged areas should be safeguarded and that multifunctional agriculture should be maintained in all areas of Europe.In arriving at its conclusions, the European Council strove to balance the need, as perceived particularly by the net contributor member states, to restrain expenditure on agriculture with the need to make a fair offer to the new member states and the need to provide all farmers in the enlarged Union with a reasonable degree of stability. I believe the agreement reached in Brussels meets those needs in a balanced way. Direct payments will be extended to the new member states in a gradual manner which will minimise the distortions which, in many cases, would result from sudden huge increases in income and which will not unduly hinder the widespread structural changes that are necessary. The agreement also provides assurances to the net contributor member states that the extension of the Common Agriculture Policy to a Union of 25 will not place intolerable burdens on their exchequers and, in the process, provides safeguards for the farmers of the existing member states, including Ireland. In so far as can be foreseen, budgetary provision for the Common Agriculture Policy is now in place until 2013 and there is no budgetary reason why direct payments should be reduced during that period. In addition, the absence of a limit on rural development expenditure and the emphasis placed on the importance of rural development amount to a significant commitment by the European Council to protect and enhance the economic and social fabric of Europe's rural areas.In addition to the issue of enlargement, the Brussels European Council resumed the ongoing discussions on how the European Union can undertake peacekeeping operations, an issue that has been on the agenda of successive European Council meetings. Because the European Union is not a military organisation it requires access to NATO infrastructure, particularly in the Balkans, to carry out its peacekeeping tasks. This will facilitate the European Union playing a central role in response to humanitarian and other crises that may arise. The European Union is considering taking on responsibility for the current peacekeeping operation in Macedonia. This mission provides security to unarmed European Union monitors. These monitors are led by an Irish official. This is fully in line with long-standing European Union decisions and Ireland's position of military neutrality which is fully recognised in the European Council Conclusions. I want to emphasise again that Ireland's participation in any EU humanitarian or crisis management operation will be subject to the three conditions of United Nations authorisation, a Government decision and Dáil approval.As the Presidency Conclusions show, the European Council strongly condemned the hostage taking in Moscow as an act of terrorism. The European Council also endorsed the approach adopted by the General Affairs and External Relations Council on Kaliningrad. This issue will now be discussed at the EU-Russia Summit later this month. At their separate meetings on the Thursday evening and at lunch time on Friday, the Foreign Ministers discussed a range of foreign policy issues including Iraq and the Middle East.I had a very constructive bilateral meeting with Prime Minister Simitis of Greece. The Prime Minister outlined the priorities of the incoming Greek Presidency from 1 January next. These priorities include enlargement, with the accession treaty due to be signed in Athens in April. The incoming Greek Presidency also promised to pursue vigorously the European Union's goals and objectives on the wider agenda. Greece will pay particular attention to developing the enlarged European Union's relations with its neighbours.When I met with Prime Minister Blair in the margins of the European Council meeting in Brussels, we again emphasised our full commitment to the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. In the course of our ongoing contacts with the parties, including Sinn Féin, we will be working to ensure that all issues are addressed in a way which will promote confidence and trust and will allow for the restoration of the devolved institutions as soon as possible.I would like to take this opportunity to thank the Danish Presidency for the efficient and effective way which in which the European Council meeting was managed. I look forward to the European Council meeting which will be held in Copenhagen on 12 and 13 December. There, once again, the main item on the agenda and the major priority will be the enlargement of the European Union with a view to concluding the negotiations with the accession countries. The full agenda for this meeting will be prepared in due course by the General Affairs and External Relations Council. At this stage, it is expected that, in addition to enlargement, we will discuss an initial report by the Presidency on reform of the Council on foot of decisions we took at Seville. The Brussels European Council proved once again that the European Union works. At the Council, Ireland proved once again that it is committed to the European Union and that it is able to further its national interests within the framework of stability, prosperity and peace provided by the Union.The Brussels Council was extremely important. It has been well recorded that so much progress was made because the Irish people had voted to accept the Nice treaty. This allowed the German Chancellor, Gerhard Schroder, to come to agreement with the French. That agreement then moved into the extended Council securing a very satisfactory agreement on the Common Agriculture Policy until 2013. I do not think anyone believed we would have concluded that agreement at this meeting – many believed that it would have been discussed and dealt with in Copenhagen.I wish to register my appreciation to Deputy Kenny and his colleagues in Fine Gael, Deputy Rabbitte and his colleagues, the social partners and other groups who campaigned to secure a "Yes" vote. It allowed enormous progress to be made and several months work was dealt with in one fell swoop. I also thank the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, and the Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Roche, who did an enormous amount of work in recent months.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	318	The Taoiseach's last comment is a clear indication of the value of the method of conduct of the Nice treaty campaign here and its outcome. It proves the essential point that Irish politicians, Ministers and Taoisigh negotiating on substantive issues relevant to this country need political allies and that sense of generosity and friendship was generated as a consequence of the ratification of the Nice treaty by Ireland. I attended a meeting of the European People's Party in Lisbon the day before the referendum was held. Prime Ministers from Italy, France, Germany, Austria, Spain and Portugal were in attendance and I pointed out to them that far from being a disgrace in the eyes of Europe as a country that has received €43 billion in supports from the EU, Ireland has become a role model for the development of the Union by bringing the people along with the politicians. It was clear to them that it is fine to sit in ivory towers and make decisions in theory but it is a different matter when a decision is taken to obtain the people's verdict on a treaty as complex or as broad as the Nice treaty.That was brought home to Prime Minister Berlusconi and others. It should be stressed by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs that ratifying a complex treaty such as this requires an information conduit between the political establishment and the people, an understanding of the issues involved by the people and an effort to address their concerns and questions so that a measure of trust and confidence is gained in the political process by them and they make their choice in as fully informed a way as possible.We always said the treaty would be good for Ireland and while Fine Gael took stick at the beginning of the campaign for making the pragmatic and patriotic choice of defending Ireland rather than backing the Government up politically, we were justified because 500,000 more people voted "Yes" in this referendum. I was proud of the part my party played along with the other pro-treaty parties.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	320	Europe is on the agenda in our homes, farms, offices, factories, public houses and so on and it would foolish of us to lose that political momentum. The debate on the Nice treaty brought home the issues of enlargement, voting power, commissioners and sovereignty and they have become matters for general discussion.It is also revealing that a range of issues which were not relevant to the treaty per se became sticking points and obstacles in the ratification process, which brings me to the issue of the Select Committee on Europe Affairs, the chairman of which is sharing time with me. If we are all serious about bringing Europe to the people and shortening the distance between Irish homes and European institutions, that committee must be resourced by Government so it can attempt to explain what will happen in the future.Prime Minister Berlusconi was adamant that a revision of the Treaty of Rome would take place during the Italian Presidency. While Italy will hold the Presidency shortly, that is his ambition. If that is to happen, the Referendum Commission should operate on a permanent basis as more treaties will come down the line following intergovernmental conferences.The decision taken on the Common Agricultural Policy could not have been achieved without the generosity and goodwill generated by the people in the referendum. The Select Committee on Europe Affairs in future will call on Ministers and officials to explain decisions, treaties and so on so that they, in turn, can be explained to the people and that is necessary because much of the resentment and confusion surrounding the Nice treaty related to issues that were not relevant to the treaty per se. Referenda will be enduring features of civic and political life in Ireland and the Government could examine the issue of providing the Referendum Commission with a continuous stream of information rather that providing such information on a need to know basis prior to a referendum.Ireland's status has gained immense moral and political credibility as many of the applicant countries look to us as an EU success story. The deal that was struck at the Brussels Summit means that discussions with applicant countries can be concluded, perhaps in time for the Copenhagen Summit. There is no doubt we are moving into a critical period regarding the future make up of the EU given the differences of opinion that exist regarding a united states of Europe and a Europe of united states. These issues need to be discussed on an ongoing basis. The convention is doing valuable work and it will complete its recommendations by spring 2003. This will be followed by an Intergovernmental Conference and a further treaty. The Minister for Foreign Affairs should keep Europe high on the agenda.With regard to the Taoiseach's meeting with Prime Minister Blair, they should focus on the completion of the implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. The political vacuum that exists cannot continue indefinitely because that is when all the trouble surfaces. I am glad the Taoiseach is reactivating the Forum on Peace and Reconciliation and I hope he keeps in regular contact with the Prime Minister and the pro-Agreement parties. We cannot allow the Agreement to fail and it is preposterous to think that it could. It behoves every pro-Agreement politician to do everything they can to end paramilitarism on all sides and to understand that everybody must share the island together in the future. I will support the Taoiseach in his efforts to re-establish the Assembly so that elections can take place and those who are elected can continue to make decisions in respect of the people they represent in Northern Ireland.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	321	I am grateful to my party leader for the opportunity to contribute. The Select Committee on European Affairs has made real progress in terms of bipartisan agreement between the Government and the Opposition but it is important if the democratic deficit is to continue to be addressed that the committee is resourced accordingly. It is difficult for chairpersons of committees because they do not even have minimal resources to call on so that they can provide leadership to their respective committees. I am grateful for the resources that have been made available to the committee thus far and I hope they can be strengthened so that we can do the job we have been asked in a fair and impartial way on behalf of the Oireachtas.Enlargement is important and is the main issue on the agenda but it is not clear how the Cyprus issue was addressed at the European Council. Cyprus has the right to accede to membership of the Union and it is the hope of the House that that will involve a united Cyprus. I have been involved in European affairs for a considerable time. I was Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs in the rainbow coalition and I was director of elections for the referenda campaigns on the Single European Act and the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties. I also played a role in the Nice treaty campaign recently. I consider myself to be very much pro-European and I am a former vice-president of the Council of Europe movement.I am not a Eurosceptic but there are not only two choices facing us. Certain people think the choice facing us is a totally intergovernmental or a totally federal Europe, which is not the case. I do know what the title is for this change but in political science the important building of governance in the EU does not have a precedent and, therefore, does not have a title. I have called it "quasi-federal" but that is not an accurate description.We should not be forced into bringing about a fully federal Europe because that is the way it is done in other jurisdictions and in the United States. There is a middle way. Some of the proceedings and institutional arrangements must be supranational, while others must remain intergovernmental. We should not try to be simplistic and say we will have a new far reaching federal constitution on which every member state must vote. We have got to the stage we are at incrementally and we will get to where the people of Europe want us to go.I am pro European integration because 16 million people lost their lives in Europe in the first half of the last century because there was no organisation like the European Union. Not only do we have peace and stability, but we have prosperity of which peace and stability are the pre-requisites, as I constantly remind the House. We do not have to fit a square plug into a round hole. We should design the systems of government we want in Europe. While the full and final report of the Convention on the Future of Europe will be a welcome input to the intergovernmental conference, it should not be any greater than that of the reflection group on the Amsterdam Treaty process of which I had the honour to be the Irish member. We should take it as a working document on which Governments can negotiate and then it should be sent to the member states for ratification. We should not be pushed into a position by anyone. This is not only a concern among people who have misled us about Europe for 30 years. I want an integrated Europe, but all member states must have an input. I do not want a simplistic formula taken off the shelf and put to the people across the Union in a referendum as the basis for a new constitution. That would be a recipe for disaster and could undo the acquis which has brought peace and stability to the European Union to date.It is central to the interests of large and small member states in the East and in the West that the European Commission is not undermined in any changes. We should be sceptical about any talk of a president of the Council of Ministers whom the Americans could telephone if they wanted to find out about Europe. Anything which overrides the role of the Commission is not in our interest as a member state or in the interest of the Union generally because the Commission is the protector of the treaty and plays an important role. The balance between the institutions of the Union should not be diminished, especially at the expense of the Commission. I hope the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs will keep that to the fore.As regards Iraq, I feel certain it was discussed at lunch, dinner, in private session or in whatever way such sensitive issues are dealt with. I note the comment by the Minister for Foreign Affairs that one cannot be against unilateralism and multilateralism at the same time. During discussions on the European Union some people in the House eulogised the UN and said everything must be done through it. However, when it comes to doing something through the UN, they denigrate it. We cannot have it both ways.

We must be informed and we must know the basis of any decision we will make at the Security Council. I will return to that issue later this evening. I am delighted to have the opportunity to speak in the debate.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	324	The outcome of the European Council in Brussels on 24 and 25 October and the agreement in respect of the financing of enlargement, if it can be called an agreement, is to be welcomed. However, even if the agreement is not quite what it appears to be, it represents a framework agreed by member states which secures the planned enlargement of the Community. In that regard, even if there is still some tweaking to be done, it should be done on the side of the principles of solidarity and generosity as opposed to the principle of parsimony under the name of budgetary discipline.For well over a decade, EU leaders, commissioners and parliamentarians have talked about a people's Europe, a citizen friendly Community and so on. There has been regular acknowledgement of the gap which has opened up between the Community or the Union and the citizens and the need to tackle that problem. If the Brussels communiqué is anything to go by, we are as far away as ever from the realisation of that ambition of a people friendly Union. The official communiqué released on the conclusion of the Council is notable for its obscurity, opacity and general devotion to making the work of the Council mysterious and impenetrable. What, for example, is meant by the sentence, "The general efforts towards budgetary discipline laid down by the European Council in Berlin should be continued in the period beginning in 2007"? I do not know. What is the citizen to understand by the term "lump-sum, degressive and temporary payments"? I do not know and I do not know if we will all get them.I do not know what FYROM means. Is it intended to be the first deployment of the rapid reaction force, including Irish personnel, early next year? I am told that FYROM is the acronym for the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia and an acknowledgement to Greek sensitivities. However, have we properly communicated to our national and Union citizens what we will do in FYROM? What exactly is the PSC – the Political and Security Committee – and what is the EUMC – the European Union Military Committee? How open will be its deliberations? Have we properly and effectively communicated the rationale for these developments to our citizens?Part of the art of diplomacy – the communiqué is a diplomatic document as well as something that purports to enlighten us about what happened at the Council – is to ensure that fundamentally opposing sides can agree to disagree and represent their disagreement as agreement. Thus, on the agreement reached in respect of funding enlargement and the CAP, President Chirac was reported as emphasising that the CAP is safe until 2006 and that next year's mid-term review is nothing more than going through the motions. Chancellor Schröder in his comments after the summit reportedly looked forward to 2007 and an inevitable fall in farm subsidies from that date. The fundamentally different ambitions of these two leaders in respect of the future of the CAP remain fundamentally different. The French commitment is to maintain a large CAP, while Germany, given that it is the major paymaster, continues to strive for a significant reduction and reorientation of the Common Agricultural Policy. The Taoiseach's view seems to lean more to the French than to the German interpretation.The assessment of the president of the Party of European Socialists group in the European Parliament is relevant. Enrique Baron welcomed the agreement on enlargement, but also remarked that, "This compromise will be superceded", and that, "Agricultural reform cannot be left until 2006". There are divided views on what the agreement amounts to, when exactly the present CAP will come under the microscope and what that will mean.The reported Blair-Chirac tiff is another indication of the type of tensions that lie beneath the surface in the great game of EU musical chairs. Such tensions are inevitable. National interests conflict and differing political views and outlooks clash even in a body such as the EU. However, there is a problem, part of which is that there is a fundamental question which is still being avoided by the Council.Given the conflicting visions of Europe and the European Union, the question is summed up in the words, "Which Europe?".  The Commission and the summiteers will argue that this question is being dealt with in another forum, namely, the Convention on the Future of Europe, which, while true to some degree, is most certainly not the case in other respects.The convention, as I understand it, is not really dealing with the future shape of the Growth and Stability Pact or the Common Agricultural Policy, for example. These are very real issues which affect the lives of everyone in the European Union. At this stage its main focus seems to be on what appears to be a technical and legal exercise, namely, the drawing up of a possible treaty establishing a constitution for Europe. However, such a task is not a mere technical exercise as it goes to the very heart of the question, "Which Europe?".Whatever one's view of the Common Agricultural Policy, it is beyond argument that it has given the European Union a certain socioeconomic structure and a certain shape and configuration to its countryside, farming and agri-business. The CAP in both its dimensions, the guarantee section and the guidance section, grew out of a certain vision of and for Europe among the founding fathers, the politicians who negotiated and nurtured the development of the project that was to become the European Union. Similarly, this applied to coal and steel and the early development of regional policy. These were major interventions, large scale exercises, in social and economic engineering, which configured and curtailed, controlled and shaped marketplaces and market forces, economic development, reconstruction and social change, all in the name of a certain vision of Europe. This was the Europe Ireland joined in 1973.There were also in that design real ambitions for citizens which can be summed up in the word "equality", which encompassed equality of treatment in respect of pay and working conditions, equality of opportunity for all citizens, the ambition to raise living standards both generally and for backward regions and so on. Strangely, this vision for society, which was implemented, for example, through the European coal and steel community, the CAP, regional policy and the agenda for a social Europe, was drawn up and implemented originally by a body which purported to be simply an economic organisation, namely, the then European economic community which was essentially concerned with creating a single market as outlined principally in the Treaty of Rome. It was drawn up by democratic politicians, public representatives full of ambition for the project they were directing, rather than bureaucrats, technocrats and lawyers.Beyond the early developments there were further initiatives, such as the elaboration of the policy of cohesion within the Union and, in the wider global arena, development aid and trade as represented in, for example, the Lomé Convention. Today it is all rather different. Europe is remote from its citizens. The phenomenon of euro-scepticism has grown. There are enormous problems of communication and impenetrable jargon. There is a plethora of acronyms and stultifying summitry and an endless cycle of diplomacy and meetings as well as a distinct sense that "it"– whatever "it" is – is all being done by faceless, anonymous elites and bodies, such as COREPER, about which most citizens know very little.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	326	Ironically, this all developed as the Union moved away from purportedly being simply an economic organisation to being purportedly something much bigger and broader in scope, that is, a real community and a union. Even the European convention seems remote and removed from everyday life. This is the body currently engaged in drawing up that most fundamental of political documents, as we in this polity are aware, namely, a constitution. We must ensure the convention does not succumb to the same syndrome of "clubiness" and "the lodge" that characterises too much of life in the European Union. I am confident the members of the Party of European Socialists will, for their part, oppose any such tendency.There is an obvious need for a more general diffusion of information on the work of the convention and greater public debate and argument on the scope and thrust of the draft constitution, such as we had here in the months prior to the Nice treaty referendum. After all, the convention is discussing and debating a constitution, which is a fundamental document. In this regard it is incumbent on all political parties to ensure citizens are informed about and engage with what is an enormous project, the possible establishment of a real, new political entity in the world. I suggest that the preliminary draft be the subject of parliamentary debate at an early date in both Houses. The Labour Party will seek such a debate.Part of the problem is that the early tasks of the then EEC, the rationalisation and management of change in the hugely important coal and steel industries, the development of the Common Agricultural Policy in the context of the then enormous importance of agriculture, the evolution of a regional policy and so forth, were actions which had a major impact on people's lives throughout the Union. The mythical standardisation of the "euro-sausage" does not quite have the same resonance.Part of the problem is that, as the European Union has grown and expanded its competencies, scope and membership, it has necessarily become more complex. While this should not have meant increased remoteness, somehow it has meant precisely that. Democratic development and accountability have been the poor relations of the European project. What exactly is a body which is governed by four separate elements, comprising more than 1,000 articles, none of which has been consolidated, as well as a forest of protocols and consisting of two different entities, the European Community and the European Union? Whatever it is, it does not readily and easily come within the scope of citizens' comprehension.It is also problematic that the European agenda has changed, as have the forces which dominate the Union. Somehow, this all seems to have happened surreptitiously and principally to the benefit of technocrats and elites. At least that is, with some justification, the widespread perception. I will cite just two examples. With the adoption of the 1992 project, the Single Market, big business achieved a level of influence with the organs of the Union it did not have heretofore. The Union and the Commission were seen to have become even more concerned with the interests of business as opposed to citizens and consumers.Then we had the single currency project. Even after exchange rates had been locked in and national currencies reduced to no more than local shadows for the euro, banks were allowed to continue charging foreign currency commissions. With a version of the single currency actually adopted, bankers achieved an increase in their power that one must question from the point of view of accountability. It is particularly evident in the structure of the European Central Bank. While I accept it is critically important that the ECB is independent, is it necessary that it be entirely unaccountable? Not even the "Fed" in the United States is so removed from political accountability as is the ECB. Mr. Greenspan must regularly turn up on Capitol Hill to face and field questions from elected public representatives at congressional committees.The ideology of Europe has also changed. Gone is the vision and the agendas of the politicians who pioneered the project and people like Jacques Delors in terms of social purpose and ambition. Everything now is about the market, market forces, competition and the nonaccelerating inflation rate of unemployment. The European Court of Justice, an increasingly important force in the life of the European Union, remains a mysterious body. The Commission is a black box, the Council appears to be a gigantic photo opportunity and post-Council communiqués remain impenetrable. All this must change in the direction outlined in the document entitled Priorities for Europe published last October by the Party of European Socialists, of which Labour is a member in the European Parliament.The communiqué is notable for the consideration given to military matters, which encompass the European Union's clear intent to develop an autonomous military capability as well as relations with NATO. Referred to in the communiqué as ESDP, it is yet another acronym which stands for European Security and Defence Policy. The communiqué again reports a breakthrough, essentially in respect of relations between Greece and Turkey, as a result of which the European Rapid Reaction Force can proceed. We have the solemn Seville declaration on our neutrality and the terms of the recent constitutional amendment regarding Nice included, at the request of the Labour Party, a specific constitutional guarantee that Ireland will not join in any common European defence without the express consent of the people through a further referendum.Furthermore, the military capability of the Union is being cast through the framework of the Petersberg Tasks of peacekeeping, peacemaking and crisis management within Europe. We must ask if we have properly explained to citizens what is being developed and why. One reading of annex 2 to the presidency conclusions suggests that the autonomous military capability being developed by the Union, in respect of which we need to have further debate, seems capable of becoming closely connected with NATO. As the communiqué annex states, all of what is described is "as provided for in the Nice arrangements". The development of a Rapid Reaction Force is, within the context of the Petersberg Tasks, included in the Maastricht treaty and the EU's autonomous military capability is being developed within a framework of European security, crisis management, humanitarian intervention, peacekeeping and peacemaking.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	327	I wish to share time with Deputies Gormley and Ó Caoláin.The recent meeting of EU leaders in Brussels was devoted to sketching out the future direction of the Union and it is clear from what they envisage that the future will not be one created primarily in the interests of ordinary working people. The future is being sketched out in the context of an economic policy dictated by the powerful lobby groups such as the European round table of industrialists, the liberalisation of trade in services groups and others representing major multinational corporations. It is an economic policy agreed and supported by the Government which envisages the destruction through privatisation of publicly owned services and industry, a policy being implemented on a weekly basis by this right-wing Administration of Fianna Fáil and the Progressive Democrats. We have seen the very beginnings of the outline of the two-tier Europe we warned about in the course of the debate on the Nice treaty. It is clear that post-Nice, France and Germany are determined they will decide the direction of events and the fact that it will be 2014 before the applicant states are at the same level of agricultural payments as existing ones shows clearly how they are being treated. In the meantime, their small farming communities will be at the tender mercy of the major agri-business corporations operating from the existing EU states.The most sinister developments arising from the EU Council meeting are in the area of militarisation and they fully vindicate our view in the course of the debate on the Nice treaty that nothing less than the full militarisation of the EU is being planned. Fully vindicated also was our criticism of the narrow scope of the Seville declaration which the Government pretended was a declaration of neutrality. We know now that the European Union foreign policy representative, Javier Solana, has been delegated by EU leaders to negotiate the way in which the Rapid Reaction Force can link with NATO and there is even a suggestion that he is negotiating funding from NATO for that force. In The Irish Times today, journalist Paul Cullen outlines how at Prague later this month the Republic of Ireland will for the first time be present at a NATO summit. The so-called war against terrorism will be the subject. We see through the dishonest ploy of the Government in saying that Ireland will be at a European-Atlantic partnership council rather than a NATO meeting. This is being done under cover of the Partnership for Peace and we can see clearly that Fianna Fáil reneged on its promise to hold a referendum on PfP because the people would never countenance what is going on.The Government is bringing us down a treacherous road and the Minister, who may be at that meeting, should know it is not just a gathering of political and military representatives. Seedy arms merchants, the creators of weapons of mass destruction, will also be there selling their wares to the various Governments. Ireland, under various disguises is being involved in the biggest military alliance on the face of the globe. The United States of America and Great Britain are dominant forces in that alliance and they have shown utter immorality in pursuing their interests under cover of a so-called war against terrorism. The United States now believes it can send pilotless CIA planes anywhere in the world to shoot Hellfire missiles to blast to smithereens those it alleges are terrorist suspects, without trial, judge or jury. Their friend, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon, and other leaders are welcome to wrap the flag of the fight against terrorism around themselves to cover similar crimes. The European Council declaration on the hostage-taking atrocity in a Moscow theatre which occurred during its meeting is scandalously one-sided in its condemnation. Every citizen of this State abhors the violence against innocent people by those saying they are fighting for independence in Chechnya, but it is absolutely irresponsible for EU leaders to ignore completely the appalling catalogue of torture and murder by the Russian Army in that country.If five minutes have passed, I will leave it at that in order not to cut across the time of the other speakers.
#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	328	The summit will be remembered for the re-emergence of the Franco-German alliance, which was clearly signalled by Mr. Chirac and Mr. Schröder in their last minute deal on CAP. Mr. Chirac also suggested that Berlin and Paris forge a common position at the convention on the future of Europe and that is clearly what has happened. Giscard d'Estaing is running away with the convention, has been described as an old man in a hurry and wants to go down in history by drafting a constitution. Joschka Fischer has arrived on the scene now to add a bit of dynamism to the proceedings, though he is really there to keep an eye on the French who were running away with the ball, as anyone who attended could see.It is interesting to read the draft constitution produced by Giscard d'Estaing and in the very first line of Article 1 he talks about giving the Union the name the United States of Europe. When I suggested during the Nice referendum campaign that we were heading towards a United States of Europe, I was dismissed as alarmist, yet two weeks later we see it has become a reality. One can call it what one likes.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	330	One can call it a European Union, but the fact is that as far as Giscard d'Estaing and the majority on the convention are concerned we are dealing with a United States of Europe.In comparison to the other delegations, we are under-resourced. There are six people representing Ireland at the convention and the back-up we have is appalling when compared to that of other states. The Government has only a passing interest in the convention because it feels the Intergovernmental Conference will look at this matter in more detail and that the real work will be done when the time comes. This is a mistake. The Government has to get in and work the convention hard and provide the necessary resources. It is scandalous that representatives go there and have no back-up. I go there every week and on Monday, Thursday and Friday I was there with no resources. I ask the Minister to address that because it is not good enough for Deputy McCreevy to say there is no money available. We have one room and one telephone while the resources of the French, Germans and Italians show they are taking this seriously. It is a problem and while it may be typical for this Government I ask the Minister to reassess where he is going on this.I listened with great interest to what Deputy Rabbitte had to say. He has woken up and smelled the coffee, but I wish he had spoken with the same frankness during the campaign on the Nice treaty. He talks about it happening surreptitiously but this has not happened in that way. We have had treaty after treaty where we have tried to explain the direction in which Europe is heading. We tried to explain the link between NATO and the European Rapid Reaction Force, but again were told that we were being alarmist. We tried to explain that we were leaving the back door open for membership of NATO and that provision to guard against that would not be covered by the Government's constitutional amendment, but again this was dismissed. We tried to explain to people that under Article 133 we were letting big business rule the roost within Europe, but again that was dismissed. Who is calling the shots now, the European round table of industrialists, the European federation of employers? These are the people who are calling the shots and we have less and less democratic control.To return to what Deputy Gay Mitchell said about federalism, it comes down to what is the definition of "federalism". Is it the "centralism" of France? Is it the more federalist view Germans have where there is democratic control? The point is that we are moving more and more towards the French version, which is about bureaucracy, centralism and having very little democratic control. I welcome that there is a proposal to open up the Council of Ministers for legislation, but it must go beyond that. We must empower national parliaments to scrutinise the question of subsidiarity.It is clear from the communiqué on defence issues – there is reference to the Nice provisions – that Mr. Solana has been mandated to forge closer links between NATO and the European Rapid Reaction Force. That is the reality. I wish people had listened, but we must continue to make these points.
#CaoimhglinOCaolain	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-party	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-dob	unknown-#CaoimhglinOCaolain-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	331	This is the first opportunity I have had to address EU affairs in this House since the referendum. I commend the progressive parties, groups and individuals, including Deputies here, who campaigned against the treaty of Nice. Despite the onslaught of the establishment, the "No" vote held firm and just over 37% of voters were not prepared to be coerced into reversing their decision of last year. The result of the referendum was disappointing and is a setback for Irish sovereignty and neutrality and for the accountability of EU institutions. Unlike the Government and its allies who dismissed the people's verdict on the last occasion, we have accepted the outcome of the recent referendum, but will maintain continued vigilance against the growing inequality within the EU, a process which the Nice treaty is already clearly accelerating.In no previous referendum did the print media, particularly The Irish Times and the Irish Independent display such blatant bias and lack of balance in their coverage, which has had major implications for democracy. In contrast, the radio broadcast media was by and large fair and balanced.The European Council meeting in Brussels saw the enlargement process move on, something that would have happened anyway irrespective of the referendum result. I welcome the Brussels Summit endorsement of Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic, Slovakia, Slovenia, Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Cypress and Malta as ready to complete accession talks in December and to join the European Union in 2004. That accession must be subject to the approval of the people in each of those states. It is significant that despite the endorsement of these ten states there were sharp differences between them and the existing EU states on future funding.There are major problems ahead, particularly in relation to the Common Agricultural Policy, something which has not been properly examined nor debated in Ireland. There has been little examination of the long-term impact of the accession of tens of millions of farmers to the European Union. There is little long-term planning about the future of farming here with its massive over-dependence on EU aid. There must now also be a focus on rural regeneration, the sustainable development of agriculture and the building of rural communities. That change must be driven by Ireland and by those rural communities. It is not realistic in the long-term to sustain Irish agriculture and our diminishing rural communities on the basis of CAP, yet it is the short-term view which predominates and we rarely look beyond the next meeting of EU Agriculture Ministers. That is the pattern. The Government does not appear to have a strategy to deal with Commissioner Fischler's CAP reform proposals other than to hope that the French will be able to veto any detrimental changes. That is not good enough.The Government and its supporters told us neutrality was not an issue in the referendum and that our neutrality was not under threat, but look at what has happened in the days and weeks after the referendum. The Brussels European Council meeting accepted the text of a joint NATO-EU declaration whereby the EU Rapid Reaction Force will be funded by NATO. It mandated EU foreign policy chief, Javier Solana, to continue negotiations with NATO on that funding. The Brussels approved text is to be discussed at the NATO summit in Prague later this month and we learned yesterday that for the first time ever this State is to be represented at that NATO summit, to which the Minister for Foreign Affairs will lead a high level delegation. That is a shame and a disgrace.The Department of Foreign Affairs must take the Irish people for fools if it expects them to accept its explanation that the Minister is not really attending a NATO meeting but a meeting of the Euro Atlantic Partnership. The EAPC is meeting in the same building at the same time as the main NATO event and they will have shared meetings. The EAPC is the political wing of NATO's so-called Partnership for Peace, an integral part of NATO. Is it not time for the Government to end the charade and to admit that it no longer has a policy of military neutrality? It is pathetic for the Government to allow Shannon to be used by foreign powers as a military staging post and then to pretend that it is normal and something about which no one should worry, but people are worried about it. It is equally pathetic for Ministers to slink in and out of NATO meetings. The dust has hardly settled on the Nice referendum and already the Government is breaking its commitment to honour Irish neutrality.I call for an early debate on the proposals for a draft EU constitution that have emerged from the EU convention. These proposals would pave the way for a fully fledged united states of Europe with a central government. They are currently outline proposals and there is a major divergence of opinion on their implications, but now is the time to have that discussion here in order that at the earliest stage representatives of the people will have a full input into the process.

Does he also agree that its findings will go through the process of an intergovernmental conference in due course, the outcome of which will be laid before this House and that if a treaty results from that process a referendum will have to be held on it; in other words, that nothing will be imposed on the Irish people from the Convention on the Future of Europe?In relation to the alleged abandonment of our neutrality so soon after the Nice treaty, does the Minister accept that what has been agreed in relation to co-operation with the use of NATO infrastructure is no more than was provided for in the Maastricht and Amsterdam treaties approved by the people? Does he agree that it involves only the Petersberg Tasks, including peacekeeping, peace enforcement and humanitarian tasks, perhaps including environmental protection and tasks of a combat force nature on a case by case basis, but that in each case we will have a say on whether the European Union becomes involved and whether we become involved, as is the case in relation to participation in UN exercises of this kind?Will the Minister tell the House he nature of the discussions at the European Council on Iraq and if a common position on the Iraqi question will be taken by the member states of the European Union who are members of the UN Security Council?

If Deputies wish to ask me more general questions, that can be done by way of Question Time, which is what it is for. As I understand it, under the Standing Order I am here to answer questions on the conclusions of the Council. I can confirm to Deputy Mitchell that the situation he outlined relating to the convention and the process and procedure he envisaged is as he set out. What happens at the European Council is that a report by the president of the convention on the progress of proceedings takes place and there is then exchange of views. This process takes approximately one hour.The position with regard to FYROM has been under discussion for many months and a number of states have held the Presidency during that period. The EU capacity is taking up the role that was formerly filled by a NATO-led operation. I welcome the fact that the European Union developed a capacity under the ESDP principles, which allow for full participation by all member states, to take responsibility for the operation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia.

#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	337	I wish to ask the Minister a lay person's question, namely, what lessons does he believe the Government has learned as a result of the Nice experience? Does he acknowledge that some of the criticisms made about communications, impenetrability, remoteness and unintelligibility regarding developments in the EU must be addressed if we are going to engage our citizens in the fashion in which they ultimately were engaged during the Nice referendum? What is the Government's response to the request that we should have an early parliamentary debate on the preliminary draft that has emerged? Does he intend to make Government time available in the House for an early discussion on this matter?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	338	That is a matter for discussion between the Whips. I welcome as much debate as possible on EU issues because I do not believe that adequate time is provided for this. The committee that has been established for the specific purpose of discussing the EU might, perhaps, be a better forum for such a debate, but if people wish to discuss the matter in plenary session I would be amenable to that, depending on agreement among the Whips. The more we incorporate European Union matters into our national debate the better, particularly now that we have learned the lessons of the previous two referenda which clearly indicate the need for an ongoing public debate and dialogue with citizens regarding the relevance of the European Union. I would welcome an expanded debate and I have always stated that there is a need for greater discussion on this matter. In principle, I have no difficulty with having such a debate.With regard to impenetrability, what arose out of the Nice council was not merely agreement of the treaty but also a declaration which set out the need – this was a recognition by the Council even then – for further work to be done in relation to how we make what the European Union and its institutions do more accessible and comprehensible to citizens. That is an agenda which is recognised by all as being necessary to be addressed. The convention process is, therefore, dealing with some of these issues. It is deciding how we, over a period, develop a complex set of arrangements which reflect the important institutional balances that are necessary in an enlarging Union to ensure that the interests of small and large states are recognised and that we have independent institutions which guarantee the full applicability of both the protections and obligations under the treaties and make these available to states and impose on them where necessary.We have reached a stage where we clearly need to see – this is what the convention is attempting to do – how we provide a basic text that is understandable and comprehensible to citizens. There is a sense of disconnection, not because the European Union is not doing important work or because it does not have effective common policies. The Union certainly has the latter but there will always be room for improvement. There is a need to communicate with Europe's citizens about the range of competencies that are exercised by the European Union's institutions, why these are so exercised, what is the appropriate level at which certain decisions should be taken, how is the principle of subsidiarity to be properly addressed, what should be the role of national Parliaments and how can we ensure that national Parliaments have a role and, therefore, enhance the democratic legitimacy of the deliberations of the Union in all its aspects.These are wide-ranging issues which have deep implications. We agreed at Nice to establish the convention, which engaged in a listening phase and is now in the process, through its working groups, of preparing papers. The convention is not of a binding nature, but I accept Deputy Gormley's assertion that it is doing important work and we need to have an input into its deliberations. We are going about doing so at present. The second referendum on Nice has occupied most of our time until now. In light of the outcome obtained at the referendum and having seen that the enlargement process will proceed within the timescale envisaged – it is likely to happen by the end of the year – it is clear that we must all give the work of the convention a very high priority.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	340	The issue of resourcing arises all the time. I will see what can be done in that regard. I do not know whether people accept it, but I have made bona fide efforts in this area. As far as we are concerned, the resources of my Department are available to all Deputies who are involved with this issue. I do not wish anyone to feel that the resources of the Department are not available to them because that is not the case.At the end of the day, however, Members were elected to represent the people in the Oireachtas. They can offer their views on this matter and I cannot tell them what those views should be. I am allowing them to put forward their independent views as they so wish. The Government has its own representatives and they are putting forward its views. The Government's representatives intend, as I am sure do other Members of the Oireachtas, to put forward their views to the various working groups and committees to which they have been appointed. I will arrange to consult Oireachtas representatives on an ongoing basis if they so wish and if they would find it helpful. I will do whatever I can to be constructive. However, just as I do not expect people to agree with me on every aspect, I do not believe I am in a position to meet every demand.

Will he be vigilant in terms of our independent foreign policy? Will he adhere to this position to enhance Ireland's reputation as an international peacekeeper?What is the Minister's view of the silence from the European Union with regard to the slaughter in Chechnya during the past four years in which 100,000 men, women and children were killed and their towns and cities, like Dresden, were demolished? Will he point out to the European Council that it is not a consistent or fair policy to condemn hostage-taking, which we all deplore, but say nothing about the rape and murder of the Chechen people? Will he put forward my view to the European Union and the United Nations?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	342	Deputy McGrath can rest assured that the triple lock relating to participation of Irish Army personnel in overseas peacekeeping missions will be adhered to by the Government since it is the legal mechanism governing this area. For us to do otherwise would be illegal. We are required to adhere to the triple lock under our Defence Acts so the Deputy need have no concerns in respect of this issue.With regard to the question of hostage-taking in Russia, if the Deputy wishes to consider previous conclusions of European Councils or General Affairs Councils in this area, he will discover that the European Union made its views known in respect of what was happening in Chechnya. When Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of Europe that matter was dealt with consistently over the six month period.The Deputy should understand what happened with these conclusions. A hostage situation took place in Moscow and the European Council felt that it should condemn it unambiguously and unconditionally. The issue of broader policy in Chechnya or how a political solution should be found to deal with the Chechen problem was not on the agenda of the European Council meeting. In fact, the Lisbon Council devised what I regard as a welcome development for European Council deliberations whereby the Council sticks to a strict agenda. The issues on the agenda for this meeting were enlargement, the financial package if it was possible to agree one and the Kaliningrad issue.The problem with the work of the Council in the past was that it was open to Heads of Government, in the context of prior consultations by the Presidency with the 15 member state governments before a Council meeting, to put a range of items on the agenda. It meant that none of them was properly addressed in sufficient detail. The result was a detailed number of conclusions referring to anything and everything that was contemporaneous, relevant or topical. That did not exactly affirm the role of the Council which is to maintain a strategic focus on the issues so that the sectoral Councils can get on with their business during the course of each Presidency.The reforms were introduced as a result of the Seville conclusions. I welcome them and the result was an excellent meeting which began on Thursday afternoon and concluded before 7 p.m. on Friday. Major decisions were taken and there was a focus on the issues that were relevant to the Council's deliberations, that is, enlargement, the financial package and further discussions on Kaliningrad. Other issues were not raised formally on the agenda. It was a question of the Council showing solidarity with the Russian people. It was not a full exposition of attitudes towards that or other problems in the Russian Federation. We should accept it for what it was and not seek to criticise the Council for taking a clear position on the specific issue which arose on that day.

Resources are not made available for the convention. I will write to the Minister and make positive suggestions in this regard. Does he not accept, however, that Deputies such as myself and the Minister's colleague, Deputy Pat Carey, who are Members of the Dáil but are in Brussels three days a week, require assistance? We are disadvantaged by being there for so long. We are committed to working in the convention as it is most important. I hope the Minister will not forget what I have said when he leaves the Chamber but will examine the issue carefully. Deputy Carey agrees with me.The NATO-EU declaration was drafted a week ago and agreed by the Heads of State at the summit. Does the Minister not accept that we are moving inexorably towards a closer relationship with NATO? The fact is that we cannot carry out major operations without the assistance of NATO. Will the Minister be honest enough to admit that he has, essentially, sold out on Irish neutrality?

Is finance being sought from NATO for the Rapid Reaction Force? Will the Minister be attending the Euro-Atlantic Partnership council in Prague? Will this also deal with the relationship between NATO and the Rapid Reaction Force?What conclusion did the EU Council arrive at with regard to opening negotiations with Turkey on entry into the European Union? Does the Minister agree that Turkey still has an appalling regime of repression against political opponents and minorities, such as the Kurds? Is it a fact that the United States is putting relentless pressure on the EU to open these negotiations before civil rights matters have been dealt with and rectified?
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	346	Does the Minister agree that the reason for putting the Rapid Reaction Force and the Petersberg Tasks in place was the shame that was felt among decent European parliamentarians and Ministers about the lack of capacity or will on the part of the European Union to act when there was horrific genocide in Srebrenica? Will he further agree that it is a bit much for Members of this House to say that they care about the suffering of people in Turkey when, at the same time, they seek to tie the hands of the Union to deal with that suffering when it seeks to alleviate it?

The views expressed by my colleagues are just as valid. With regard to the NATO-EU declaration whereby the Rapid Reaction Force is to be funded by NATO and the fact that Javier Solana has been asked to continue negotiations in relation to this, will the Minister confirm that he will lead the Irish delegation at the forthcoming NATO summit in Prague? Will the Minister be raising the Brussels European Council text on the funding of the Rapid Reaction Force by NATO either in direct engagement in the Euro-Atlantic Partnership meetings or in other side meetings under the NATO umbrella? What is the Government's position in relation to that text?

NATO will not be funding the ESDP; the European Union will fund it. The involvement of NATO in the development of the ESDP arises from the need for the EU, which is not a military organisation, to have access to planning capability and resources, transport, etc. which will be required for substantial crisis management missions, as UN mandated operations such as SFOR and KFOR have shown.

At the Feira European Council in June 2000, the EU agreed on principles which specified that there should be full respect for the autonomy of EU decision making, recognition of the different nature of the EU and NATO and no discrimination against any of the member states. These principles have been upheld throughout the subsequent development of the ESDP and are fully reflected in the arrangements which have now been reached.There is no new development here; no conspiracy theory has come to fruition. There is no suggestion that NATO funds the ESDP.

#PaudgeConnolly	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-party	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-dob	unknown-#PaudgeConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	355	A sum of €20 million has been spent on establishing and servicing the Lindsay tribunal of inquiry into the infection of more than 260 haemophiliacs with HIV and hepatitis C through contaminated blood and blood products. In light of its recently published report, the tribunal was an expensive exercise in futility. A vast amount of taxpayers' money was expended in discovering precious little, with scarcely apportioned blame for the debacle. Culpability and responsibility were fudged in the report to the extent that it injured the victims again and the second injustice was almost worse than the first.The report demonstrated an appalling lack of sensitivity for the victims of this tragedy and a lack of understanding or appreciation of what the victims endured. It is patently clear that the major share of the blame must attach to the Blood Transfusion Service Board. Its failure to provide HIV-free home-produced product for haemophiliacs prior to 1984 is inexplicable. Its failure to heat treat Factor 9 and withdraw non-heat treated Factor 9 directly led to the infection of seven haemophilia sufferers with HIV, and the subsequent deaths of five people. The buck must inevitably stop with the BTSB, given its failure to warn GPs treating haemophiliacs of the risks of using commercial products which the BTSB had imported and for which it should have been held responsible.The BTSB adopted a cavalier attitude and demonstrated an irresponsible lack of urgency about the infection of haemophilia sufferers. This was evidenced by the observation of Professor Ian Temperley, head of the national haemophilia treatment centre, in June 1986, that he believed five, and possibly six, haemophiliacs were infected with the virus as a result of the Irish blood product. There was an unwarranted delay in introducing HIV screening. The BTSB was responsible for supplying inaccurate and incomplete information to Ministers for Health between 1983 and 1992, including the former Minister, Barry Desmond, who unintentionally presented misleading information to Dáil Éireann in 1985.Up to now, 79 haemophiliacs have died from contaminated blood products, most of which were supplied by international drug companies. It is imperative that a full inquiry into the role of international pharmaceutical companies in supplying contaminated blood to Irish haemophiliacs be set up without further delay. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, should honour his previously stated commitment in this regard. Since the law regarding tribunals was amended this year, an inquiry can be headed by a judicially appointed inspector, rather than a judge, thereby precluding the necessity for a major tribunal.In its failure to carry out its supervisory role over the BTSB, the Department of Health and Children must also accept some culpability. The BTSB had personnel and structural problems in the early 1980s and was clearly not competent to cope with the imminent threat from HIV and the spread of AIDS. The Department displayed both indecision and tardiness in its response. Its arrogant insistence that imported products were responsible for all the infection, when it was perfectly aware that its own home-produced product was responsible for part of the infection, is inexcusable.Since the buck stops with the Department of Health and Children, it is essential that new legislation to expedite adequate and generous compensation for HIV-infected haemophiliacs be introduced without further delay. This is the least the State can do for the victims of this horrendous failure of one of its principal Government agencies.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	356	The report we are debating has come in for much justified criticism because it did not draw conclusions, did not find anyone guilty and did not lay the blame at anyone's door. In addition, by the time it was published the report had lost much of its effect. We listened with great attention to the harrowing stories that emerged at the tribunal hearings and, therefore, anything the report might have contained could not have shocked us to the same extent.The criticism has been made that the Minister who had appointed the BTSB – the same board that was responsible for the scandal with which the tribunal was dealing – could not force the board to produce documentation sought by the tribunal. That is incredible. Responsibility means that from time to time one has to make hard decisions. The first tribunal to investigate the scandal of people being poisoned through contaminated blood products was chaired by Ms Justice Hederman-O'Brien. That report was published in 1996 and I recall it mentioned a culture of arrogance within the BTSB. That culture of arrogance still remains there. In the wake of that report and the hepatitis C scandal, I thought the BTSB would have learned its lesson and would be more than anxious to co-operate with any tribunal. Instead, however, we find the culture of arrogance that existed when Ms Justice Hederman-O'Brien investigated the hepatitis C scandal still exists. That is worrying.I was surprised to discover that the BTSB, which was charged not alone with supplying the country with blood but also with ensuring its safety and availability, decided with the wave of a hand to close the Cork blood testing centre in the Southern Health Board region. This left Dublin as the only blood testing centre in the country, with Cork relegated to being merely a repository of blood for distribution.When members of the Southern Health Board, including myself, and the medics and clinicians involved, objected strenuously to this, we did not receive sufficient explanation for the closure of the Cork centre. It appeared to us that it was done as a virtual punishment because hepatitis C had been discovered in the Cork blood bank. Therefore, it came as no surprise to me that the same organisation refused to furnish documentation sought by the Lindsay tribunal. The arrogance of that board has not diminished and continues to re-emerge time and time again, despite two scandals and the decision of an international panel that there should be two blood testing sites. In the circumstances one might think that sort of arrogance would dissipate, yet it has not done so. Those charged with supplying blood should pay attention to people's needs.It was harrowing to listen to the stories of witnesses who came before the Lindsay tribunal, including mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters of victims as well as victims themselves and their children. The report of the Lindsay tribunal has much to offer if only that it allowed those voices to be heard. For the first time people were able to tell their stories in public. It was not just about their initial treatment, it was also about how they were treated as individual human beings subsequently.The flaw in the report, however, is that it did not lay the blame where it would be clear to most people it should be laid. It did not ensure either that the pharmaceutical firms who supplied the products from abroad would be investigated. We cannot totally blame the Lindsay tribunal for that. The Minister for Health and Children is responsible for the IBTS. He can demand that it hand over the papers. He can abolish the board and appoint a new one. Equally he can decide to investigate foreign companies. It is within his power to do so. To continuously wash his hands of what is happening as if it did not concern him at all is equally a scandal.These people have suffered enough and if they have not suffered as individuals, they have watched close members of their families suffer. They looked on this tribunal as a watershed which would bring closure, and it has done neither.When the Minister replies I hope he will accept the amendments tabled by Deputies Mitchell and McManus. I hope that once and for all the people who were deeply affected by this devastating scandal which virtually wiped out a segment of the population will at long last be able to see a conclusion to this issue and be able to say with dignity that they know what happened, who is responsible and, above all, that they feel safe and secure in the knowledge that it will not happen again.
#JohnPerry	unknown-#JohnPerry-party	unknown-#JohnPerry-dob	unknown-#JohnPerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	357	I am delighted to speak on this important issue. I also call on the Minister to accept the amendments put forward.We must speak about the impact this has had on the lives of the people concerned and the pain it brought to the extended families of those who died. I sympathise with everybody concerned. People are worried that, as in the case of haemophilia, the condition is passed on to the next generation. There are between 500 and 600 people currently at risk, and they are very concerned.This problem arose from the use of blood products in the 1980s derived from donors infected with HIV. At that time the job of the blood bank, which is now the IBTS, was to ensure products were safe, but the Lindsay tribunal report indicates that this was not what happened. The impact of that has been far-reaching and it has resulted in loss of life. Although the remit of the Lindsay tribunal was somewhat confined the report provides consolation to the extended families of the 79 people, but still, a number of people are very worried about it.The State needs to learn from what happened. This has been a major learning curve. The Government must invest in quality products for haemophiliacs and ensure that products are bought centrally through the health boards. There should be no curtailment of the level of care required. More nurses and doctors with expertise should be employed by the State. We talk about a specialised centre of care in Dublin, but that should complement the primary care through the health boards in the different regions. There is no point in duplication of specialised care which will be needed for many years to come. I accept the need for a centralised caring unit in Dublin which would specialise in ensuring that all of the necessary supports are in place.The report criticises the doctors and others who used the service at the time of the crisis. At that time there was insufficient monitoring. Clearly, that is a lesson we must learn. The greatest tribute which can be paid to all of those who have died is to ensure that something like this cannot happen again.We should provide the support staff for dental and orthopaedic care, and that speciality care unit should monitor the side effects of blood products. There is also a great need for counsellors. All of these things have to do with the essence of care. We must realise the human side of this, the number of people who are in pain and the impact this has on so many people.Up to €70 million has been spent on blood products in the past year. Given the scale of this problem the health boards should be monitored with regard to how they use this money. I earnestly appeal to the Minister to ensure that this centre of excellence in Dublin will work with health boards to complement the level of care provided. Certainly, duplication of services should be dealt with but, judging by the level of dissatisfaction with the Lindsay report – many of the families are quite dismayed with the report – the State should reassure people that the supports will be put in place and provide whatever financial backing is needed for the families who will have to cope with this problem for many years. Due to the life expectancy of sufferers and the fact that the infection can be passed on to the next generation, it is important that the reassurances should be stated clearly and the lessons should be learned.The Minister should take on board amendments put down by Fine Gael and the Labour Party. There have been many tribunals of inquiry but because this case involved such huge loss of life and suffering for so many, one cannot comprehend its impact and the far-reaching consequences it will have for many years.Many Deputies have spoken about the findings of the Lindsay tribunal and the level of dissatisfaction with certain parts of the report. The next-of-kin, for whom the struggle for an inquiry has been huge, felt dejected and bitter. They sought the truth and they sought accountability. There were 79 people infected with HIV who died as a result. We hear of inquiries into the loss of money and there was a big debate here about that, but the loss of life is the greatest loss of all. The level of priority that this should get should be far greater than that given to any other tribunal and the recommendations should be acted upon even more quickly.I am quite certain the medical profession has learned from this. The Irish Blood Transfusion Service has had a difficult time reassuring people and regaining their confidence, but it has learned from this. It is its job to ensure the quality of the products.It is very important that the Minister should have a clear system to monitor the side effects of blood products being used at present. That should always be monitored. Although I am not an expert, it is clear looking at this with compassion and dealing with the many people affected by it that this period in our history will never be forgotten by many people. Controls must be put in place to ensure the quality of the products and care given to people who are ill. It is astonishing that something like this could happen in modern times. It is no consolation to the people who have died but we must nevertheless ensure such a tragedy will not happen again. The families of those affected must be supported and reassured.
#PaulKehoeFG	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-party	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-dob	unknown-#PaulKehoeFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	358	Although I am not an expert in this field I can sympathise with the victims of this awful tragedy. I thank the Minister for giving me the opportunity to discuss this important report. This is the greatest medical disaster in the history of the State and it is with great sadness that I speak in this debate.No Member of this House can know how the 260 affected people or their families feel but we know they have been devastated by the actions of a State agency. Given that the report took three years to prepare and that a considerable amount of money was spent on it, it deserves the degree of attention it has received.I am saddened that the report does not identify the people responsible for what has happened. The State has not recognised the importance of what has happened and I am disappointed to learn from the report that simple questions have not been answered. We still do not know why hundreds of sick people were fatally affected and their lives destroyed by the actions of a State agency. Surely, after spending three years and €12 million, the answers to these questions could have been found. I know an affected person and the question continually asked is, "Why did this happen?". I have some understanding of how this person feels but no one can truly know what the victims have suffered in recent years. The tribunal report cannot assure us that something similar will not happen again. Have lessons been learned from the mistakes of the past?The tribunal was set up by the Government when sick people began to fight the wrong that had been done to them. Many of them simply wanted to know the truth and were determined not to go away until they had heard it. However, these people have not heard the truth or been treated with the respect they deserve. Consider the greater importance given to other tribunals and their reports. Surely, a report of events which left people sick for the rest of their lives deserves more importance.The blame lies firmly with the Minister. It was the total mismanagement of the blood transfusion service that led directly to mistakes being made. The effect of the crisis fell on totally innocent people. I often wonder how the members of the Government of the day feel when they think back on this mismanagement.Why did some health boards and hospitals refuse to co-operate with the tribunal or to hand over important files which could have revealed valuable information? I hope these bodies are not hiding important information.The blame lies totally with the Minister and I hope he realises this. What actions will he take to ensure that something similar does not happen in the future? Traceability is one of the most important principles in dealing with any medical condition. Money must be continually invested to ensure this does not re-occur.No one knows what the victims and their families have suffered in the past number of years. I hope they will keep up their fight and continue to hope that they will receive the answer as to why they received contaminated blood products. The victims, with the support of their families and friends, had to struggle to receive proper compensation.The Minister must come up with the proper answers to ensure this does not happen again.
#JerryCowleyIND	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-party	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-dob	unknown-#JerryCowleyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	359	This is perhaps the most important debate ever held in this House. No feeling person would wish to add to the pain and hurt already inflicted on the haemophiliac population. That is why I unreservedly apologise for any part I played in the events in the Dáil when we spoke on this issue two weeks ago.I express my sincere sympathy and condolences to the families of the haemophiliacs who have died. As a GP I frequently see tragedy but this is a tragedy of tragedies. It is a cross which must be carried by these families into the future.Anyone who has witnessed the systematic annihilation of the haemophiliac population of Ireland must be saddened by it. Out of a population of a couple of hundred people 79 are dead and 260 are infected with hepatitis C and are HIV positive. These people did no wrong and committed no crime. Through no fault of their own they were born with a hereditary disease. As citizens they had a right to life, to live that life, to bodily integrity and to be treated equally. They were not treated equally. The story of the haemophiliac population is terrible and shameful. It is one of gross inefficiency and neglect. There was financial neglect of our health services by Government and dominance by the rights of international commerce over those of the citizens of Ireland. It is a story of the failure of a minority group of vulnerable citizens to get even natural justice, the greatest tragedy of all. They have tried hard to get justice and truthful answers, which was the least they could expect.The Lindsay tribunal has failed our haemophiliacs. They had every right to expect much more from it. The haemophiliacs needed clear answers, an explanation of who was responsible for those terrible deeds and to see those people brought to justice. Those were not unreasonable expectations. Who otherwise had been so grievously wronged or had lost their sons, brothers, fathers or grandfathers? These families are still suffering.The haemophiliacs did not lack backbone and were not found wanting in playing their part. They did not lack the heroism needed to go forward and give testimony. They gave remarkable evidence. One man who died – a mild haemophiliac – had received a once-off treatment for haemophilia after a nose bleed. This would have been a minor event for anyone else but he should not have been given this treatment because a safer alternative was available. This man subsequently died but even the medical details of his death formed part of the evidence to the tribunal. Did he, his family and other brave people not have the right to expect clear answers, a proper explanation and to see justice done? The haemophiliacs were clear in their evidence and surely the conclusions of the tribunal should have been just as clear in laying the blame where it should have been laid.I did many locums all over the country in my time and I remember one place where I treated a haemophiliac family. One little lad who had fallen and who was brought in by his father needed only a simple treatment of drug products. That wide-eyed boy sat on his father's lap and I keep wondering if he is dead or alive because he got a clotting factor that he expected would do him good. He expected that that injection would not be the cause of his death, and I hope it was not. However, it could well have been.There was a duty of care owed by doctors, the agencies of the State and the pharmaceutical companies, but it was breached. The fact that this duty of care was not observed screams out for justice and for those responsible for ending precious life to be named and shamed. This should be done no matter who is involved – doctors, hospital workers, agents of the State or anyone else – because justice demands that much at least. The medical profession, whatever part it played, should not be slow to apologise either.It would be reprehensible if any documents or evidence required so justice can be done were not surrendered forthwith and the process of natural justice should be allowed to continue. Nobody in his right mind should stand in the way of anyone who could help this tribunal to stop him or her from doing so.The report said there were serious failures on the part of the State agencies and was critical of the BTSB. However, the Lindsay tribunal was unable to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions, and I welcome the fact that this is being done. The report was unable to extend itself to investigate the role of the international drug companies, despite the disturbing evidence of Dr. Donald Francis who said that the plasma used to manufacture the haemophilia products should rightly have been thrown down the sewer because the blood was obtained from people likely to have been infected with hepatitis C and AIDS.In the streets of New York I saw signs saying "Blood wanted, apply within" and there were queues of drug addicts waiting to give blood. To think that that blood could have been used to kill the haemophiliac population makes my blood boil. However, the Lindsay tribunal would have been par for the course if it was not for the Flood tribunal. Using the benchmark or yardstick of the Flood tribunal, it is a gross understatement to say that the Lindsay tribunal fell far short of the mark of what it should have done. Clear actions and clear conclusions are required.The Lindsay tribunal will not be in vain if a proper investigation is finally conducted into the actions of the international drug companies in this scandal and if those responsible are brought to justice. They must be imprisoned if justice demands it. Although they may have committed crimes of omission, they were criminal acts nonetheless – even though there may have been no criminal intent – given that safe treatment which was available was not given and people died as a result.Reading between the lines of the Lindsay findings, it is obvious that Government health cuts also played a part in ensuring that safe blood products were not used. Health cuts, as is well described even by those who inflict them, affect the old, the sick and the poor. They hurt haemophiliacs as well and I believe they have done so.The Lindsay tribunal is a start and all will not have been in vain for haemophiliacs and ourselves. It is fundamental that those who hold power contemplate deeply what has happened. I congratulate the Irish Haemophilia Society and the haemophiliacs of Ireland on their work. I have children myself, as I am sure does the Acting Chairman, and I do not know where we would begin to pick up the pieces or cope if we had to go through what the haemophiliac population had to go through and the enormity of the tragedy that engulfed it. I wish the haemophiliac population well and hope the Government will continue to provide the necessary funding for the Irish Haemophilia Society to do the work it must do on behalf of its members.All this will not bring back the haemophiliacs who have died or save those who will die, but at least justice will be seen to be done and that is the least our haemophiliacs can expect.
#JoeHiggins	unknown-#JoeHiggins-party	unknown-#JoeHiggins-dob	unknown-#JoeHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	360	The conclusions of the Lindsay report are insipid in the extreme and were it not for the evidence and testimony given by the victims of this sorry saga, it would have been a complete waste of time. The Lindsay report does not vindicate the human suffering of those who were poisoned by the Irish medical system, nor does it vindicate the 79 people who died as a result or the hundreds who are victims for life and have to carry the disability that has resulted.Even judged against its own terms of reference the report falls down hopelessly. Paragraph 3 speaks about an investigation into the adequacy and timeliness of the decision of the board and others in the selection of products which caused the infection, and paragraph 6 relates to the time when the board or other relevant persons in the State became aware or ought to have become aware that products were causing infections. These are precise terms of reference which have been missed hopelessly in terms of the tribunal following them and making findings according to the evidence that was put in front of it.The tribunal totally funked the challenge of investigating the pharmaceutical firms that supplied contaminated blood products to Ireland. This could have been done within the terms of reference originally given to the tribunal at the end of paragraph 14. Again, there was another opportunity for the tribunal to reconsider its original refusal to investigate these pharmaceutical companies when the Minister for Health and Children formulated a request that the tribunal consider such and investigation.The reason the Lindsay report gives for the refusal to investigate the multinational pharmaceutical companies is simply incredible, namely, that it would be unfair to the parties before the tribunal. As far as I am concerned, there was one key party in front of the tribunal, which was the body of people who were grievously wronged as a result of the negligence, and perhaps worse, of elements within the BTSB and the pharmaceutical companies. The key party comprised the haemophiliac victims and that was the only consideration that Ms Justice Lindsay should have taken into account in determining whether she would examine the role of the pharmaceutical companies. That this was not done, allegedly in deference to other people, is scandalous.This approach of the tribunal was consistent with the testimony of victims themselves or relatives who gave testimony and who were treated in an adversarial manner. In some cases they were made to feel unwelcome. They were made to feel as if they were being tolerated rather than valued for the evidence they could provide in the attempt to seek the truth about what happened.The pharmaceutical companies must be brought to book. Armour Pharmaceuticals continued to distribute its product despite knowing that its heat treatment to kill the HIV virus was ineffective. This amounted to criminal complicity by company bosses in the pursuit of profit and at the expense of human life. Incredibly, the report is silent on this issue.It was already known by December 1982 that HIV-AIDS could be transmitted through blood products and further transmitted through sexual activity, yet Hyland Baxter Travenol and Miles Corporation Cutter continued to supply produces after that time which they knew to be dangerous. The report finds that one third of the haemophiliac community became infected after 1983, more than a full year after the facts were known. Take the scenario where manufacturers supplied baby food to supermarkets and, after having done so, they found it was contaminated but they left the product on the shelves so that babies died or were disabled and, even worse, they then continued to supply the product to the supermarkets. There would have been an immediate outcry followed by the pressing of criminal charges against such reckless negligence and conduct. That is what the pharmaceutical companies did, yet the report does nothing to call them to account.It is incredible that the tribunal did not investigate the Accuscience affair, which involved a company importing unlicensed factor-8 concentrates and where the chief technical officer in the Blood Transfusion Service Board was a company director. It beggars belief that the BTSB allowed a public servant charged with the crucial responsibility of ensuring a safe blood supply to moonlight in a sleazy, money making exercise using the very service that he was supposed to be advancing. On this failure alone the then members of the board should have been interrogated by the tribunal. It beggars belief that the report is silent on this issue.The Irish Haemophilia Society in a professional and closely argued response to the report contrasts the conclusions of the recent interim Flood tribunal report with the milk and water terms in which the Lindsay report is couched. The society refers to the language used in the Lindsay report, including the use of such words as "regrettable", "inexplicable", "surprising", "wholly unacceptable" or "unsatisfactory". By contrast, the report fails to use words such as "negligence", "complicity" or "responsibility" to describe the outright failures of the BTSB and the criminal action by the drugs companies. It appears not to know that such words exist in the English language.The Irish Haemophilia Society refers to an incredible situation where, in one of many tragic circumstances, four children were infected with hepatitis C at a time when safe factor concentrates were available. The Lindsay report finds that the availability of these concentrates was a missed opportunity, as if the children had been in line to participate in the television programme "Opportunity Knocks". It beggars belief.The tribunal should have investigated the links between the health cuts being implemented at the time and the criminal negligence of the BTSB. At the time, those involved in the Ansbacher scheme were salting away their hundreds of millions of pounds in foreign accounts while cuts were implemented in State services, including the BTSB. This report does not bring closure to this issue. We must find a way to ensure that the truth emerges and that responsibility for what happened is apportioned.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	361	This is one of the most important debates to have been held in the House for a long time. It covers a sensitive subject and will bring back harrowing memories and trauma to the families affected. It is rare that we deal with an issue in the House that affects the lives and deaths of individuals. Sadly and traumatically, what happened here led to the deaths of 79 people and the infection 260 others. It traumatised the haemophilia community, one that was entitled to expect the best services that money could provide. Unfortunately, it got a deficient service, lacking everything that could have been expected. The country must apologies to the haemophilia society for this. What happened deserves much better consideration than that provided for in the Lindsay tribunal report.I welcome the Government response to the report. I am sure everybody welcomes the decision to refer the report to the DPP, the acknowledgement in the Government motion of the suffering endured by those who were infected and their families and the acknowledgement of the harrowing personal testimonies put by individuals before the tribunal. I also welcome the commitment in the motion to ensuring the availability of an adequate and ongoing supply of clotting factor concentrates to the highest national and international standards of safety and efficacy. I hope the Minister will accept and welcome the amendments to the motion which call on the Government to initiate an inquiry into the relevant international pharmaceutical companies involved and to provide adequate funding to the Irish Haemophilia Society to support the haemophilia community on an ongoing basis.This is a deeply flawed report. It does not apportion blame and is vague and indefinite in its conclusions. It fails to meet the demands of the House or, more importantly, of the affected families. The Irish Haemophilia Society has produced a critique of the report which criticises the methods and conduct of the inquiry and its findings.It is worrying that three years later, and with €20 million costs accrued, there is no closure to the issue and that the report has added to the trauma which the families have endured.The main questions in regard to this matter are what happened, and how and why did it happen. Unfortunately these questions are not adequately dealt with in the report, which contrasts poorly with the recent Flood report which reached definite conclusions. The Lindsay report does not deal with the questions raised in any real way and leaves quite a number of questions hanging.It is unacceptable that documents which the tribunal requested were not made available and this matter needs to be addressed. The report does not in any way apportion blame and raises the fear that there will not be any prosecutions. That contrasts significantly to what has happened in France and Portugal where the state began legal proceedings which proved effective. Some people went to jail as a result of the investigations and in one case a minister ended up in court. However, one does not have the feeling that this will happen here, although it is the type of action that is necessary to bring closure to this episode for the families concerned. It is almost as if a crime has been committed yet no one is responsible.I have been involved in the health service for over 20 years and am concerned that the climate of cutbacks that we experienced throughout the 1980s was instrumental in bringing about the situation we are discussing. The Minister should be mindful that crucial services such as health and education should not be the subject of cutbacks in the future. We have already had indications of cutbacks in the health service this year and we heard the Taoiseach say only yesterday that more severe cutbacks are on the way. I appeal to the Minister to ensure that the health service is exempt from these cutbacks because of the potentially fatal repercussions. The fact that no link was made between the cutbacks at the time and the situation that developed in the BTSB in regard to haemophiliacs is also a damning indictment of this report.I welcome the debate and the extended time made available for it. I hope that the Minister will take on board the sincere sentiments that have been expressed on this side of the House.
#DanBoyle	unknown-#DanBoyle-party	unknown-#DanBoyle-dob	unknown-#DanBoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	362	Sometimes we have to be careful about what we wish for because it might happen. The current knee-jerk response in Irish politics to issues of public concern and scandals when uncovered is to call for a tribunal of inquiry or some form of inquiry that would provide the answers to which those who are aggrieved feel they are entitled.Issues in regard to blood transfusion have had more than their share of tribunals of inquiry and their like. Some have provided answers, some have provided responses, while all have made those of us in the system – the political, the judicial or the medical – think of how the services can be improved; and improvements have been made. However, it has to be acknowledged that this tribunal of inquiry has been a disappointment to all concerned, in terms of the recommendations made and the answers being sought not being provided.This was the inquiry of which most was expected because, regardless of all other ongoing inquiries concerning political or business corruption, or other areas of medical malpractice, this was an inquiry that was meant to be dealing with the effects of malpractice and collusion in a cover up that resulted in the deaths of innocent people; needless deaths that were painful and which claimed so many young victims.This Chamber should not be satisfied with the report put before it. We should ask that the terms of reference that have obviously proved so limiting for the sole member of the tribunal should be reassessed and put forward in a new format. It is the entitlement of those who have been afflicted by this set of circumstances that the tribunal that was originally requested by this House be provided. The Minister and the Government should present such a proposal to the House so that we can go on from this debate and know what answers can and should be sought.The results of this tribunal report contrasts greatly with the circumstances of similar scandals on the same issue in other countries. The case of the French haemophilia blood scandal, where people did go to jail, people were held politically responsible and people in political positions were held judicially responsible, has been highlighted several times. Until we can reach a situation where such repercussions follow, I do not think anyone who has been involved in this controversy over the past 20 years will receive any degree of satisfaction.This House has to be concerned about the information that was given to it at various stages during debates by a number of Ministers for Health who, admittedly, were badly informed. Yet we have still not been informed as to why that information was provided to those Ministers to present to this House.On a basic political level the report is unsatisfactory. However, on a more important human level it is the least satisfactory of the tribunal reports we have witnessed in the past number of years. The ongoing need for answers from the report in regard to investigating pharmaceutical firms is something that we cannot lose sight of or let go. I look forward, in particular, to a response from the Minister and the Government regarding that issue. It is unfortunate that the pharmaceutical industry which deals in products that are meant to prolong and improve people's lives has often been involved in malign activities. The pharmaceutical industry in the United States, where many of the companies who should have been investigated for their involvement in this scandal are based, has been involved in the recent American elections. They have provided $30 million to fund political campaigns, to have their people elected and their policies pursued. This is not an industry without resources. It is prepared to spend resources in a particular way to achieve particular results. The challenge for this Parliament and the Government is to make sure those resources are used in a way that those who have been affected by haemophilia as a result of blood transfusions can have confidence that those in the companies who were responsible will admit it and take the legal responsibilities both morally and financially.Haemophiliacs and their families have been dealt with on the margins of Irish politics for too long. When they moved to centre stage it has always been for the most cynical of reasons. It should not be forgotten that the general election in 1989 was held on the pretext of what resources should be provided to people suffering from haemophilia. Yet 13 years later we have not only failed to see an adequate improvement in resources and standards of services, we have seen a litany of events that have worsened the quality of life of haemophiliacs. That is a matter of shame for this House, the Governments since 1989 and anyone involved in political life in this country. We must go on from here and admit that the political system has failed badly those who it was meant to serve. We have to provide the answers in an immediate, acceptable and readily understandable way for people who have not been helped by the system.I hope the Minister will respond to the various amendments to the substantive motion and lead this House in getting those answers, otherwise the debate we are now having will be repeated in future with different circumstances and different victims.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	363	It is difficult for anyone to adequately cover this issue. I spoke during the debate on organ retention and felt it was very difficult to articulate the pain, suffering and sense of loss that many of those families have gone through. I feel much the same now. I would like to be able to make a speech that could express the anger, frustration, sense of loss and the lack of closure. As the Minister knows, when one talks to families one finds they are looking for answers. I clearly do not have the answers. The system let down these people just as the system let down the families affected by organ retention. If anything is to come out of this debate, it must be that such things will never happen again.I reiterate what Deputies Ó Caoláin and Morgan said. They welcomed the publication of the report of this tribunal but they spoke about it limitations. No blame has been put on anyone and the families feel let down by this. People have said the families got the opportunity to have their stories heard. Each family has its own story but there is no sense of closure. I support the Government's motion and the amendments tabled by Fine Gael and Labour. Perhaps the Minister will accept these proposals. I welcome the decision to refer the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions.I was concerned about the adversarial nature of the tribunal. Some of the questions that senior counsel put to families that are still grieving were disgraceful. The attitude of many of the senior counsel seemed to be that people are in this simply to gain compensation. As with the organ retention scandal the victims were being blamed. In this tribunal people were asked what they spent their compensation on. It does not matter what way people spent it, it will not bring a life back – that whole line of questioning was a disgrace. The senior counsel that posed those questions should look into their own hearts. In what type of world do these people live? Families who had been through the worst were dragged through it again by senior counsel who showed them no sympathy. Why were these victims put in a position where they felt they were defendants? It is clear they are the victims. It can be argued that the pharmaceutical companies, the State or different Ministers were responsible. It is clear the people knew that blood products were infected. It continued and the system did not recognise its own faults.The arrogance displayed by the medical profession was the same. The families of children whose organs had been retained asked questions but were told they did not need to know the answers and to go away. There is something wrong with the medical profession if that is its attitude. The Minister deals with such cases all the time as Deputies, families and counsellors write to him – he hears these stories. It is clear the victims were let down by the system.Many of the victims were angered by the failure of the report to include any criticism of Armour. In June 1988 that company took the decision to continue supplying a product, about which it had serious safety concerns, to the BTSB. Evidence was also given to the tribunal of the knowledge of Armour Pharmaceuticals Limited of the HIV infection risks posed by the company's products which it continued to distribute in Ireland. The families who spoke to me were also angered by the failure of the tribunal to investigate a number of issues which they felt were central to the infection of blood products. These included the failure to call all members of the BTSB and the failure to investigate various Ministers for Health who had ultimate responsibility for policy decisions.The report also failed to address the conflict of interest involving the late Mr. Sean Hanratty, former chief technical officer of the BTSB. He was a director and founder of Accuscience, a company which acted as an intermediary for Miles Laboratories Incorporated, which supplied non-heat treated and unscreened Cutter products that were responsible for some of the infections. Mr. Hanratty was involved in a company supplying products and he had a key role in deciding which products the BTSB used. Evidence of documents being destroyed was given at the tribunal, which created a difficulty in following the paper trail. This is a criminal act for which no blame has been apportioned.Ms Justice Lindsay's report also refuses to comment on the possibility of a future tribunal of inquiry into the role of international drug companies in the infection of haemophiliacs in Ireland and perhaps the Minister will enlighten us in this regard. The Minister sought and obtained a report from Mr. Paul Gardiner, SC, on the matter. I reiterate the demand of my party colleagues for the immediate release of Mr. Gardiner's report and for the establishment an adjudicative tribunal to investigate the role of pharmaceutical companies. Such companies were criminally complicit in infecting people with HIV. Those involved must be prosecuted as this issue cannot be allowed to drag on. The families have suffered too much and for too long. A total of 79 people died and many families were affected by those deaths. Everyone who has met them has been affected. One would have to have something wrong with one to walk away from a meeting with them without feeling useless, let down and angry at a system that would allow this to happen.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	364	I welcome the presentation of the report as it has brought the events surrounding the conflict into the public domain and it has increased our understanding of the suffering the victims and their families endured. In addressing the issue of the Lindsay report people with haemophilia considered its detail with severe disappointment. There were a number of reasons for this but, perhaps foremost among them, was the fact that the report failed in large measure to identify persons who were responsible for what happened.The failure of the tribunal chairperson to deliver the report in a clear and concise manner indicating those responsible for the wrongdoing and her failure to provide recommendations which could, if implemented, prevent a future repetition of these events, are major defects. The failure of the report to apportion blame is leading to a general erosion of trust in the tribunal system. These failures, together with the fact that successive Ministers for Health, as has been stated by a number of previous contributors, were not hauled before the tribunal to give proper account of their role as the Ministers directly responsible, is a damning indictment of this entire process.The tribunal failed to investigate certain issues that were central to the contamination of blood products. Examples of these include the decision in 1988 of Armour Pharmaceuticals Limited to continue supplying a product to the BTSB that it knew constituted a serious risk of contamination to blood products and the failure of the BTSB to withdraw untreated products between October and December of 1985. Ms Justice Lindsay found that one third of the haemophilia community in Ireland became infected after June 1983. Consequently, at least one third of people with haemophilia could have been saved by prompt action on the part of the pharmaceutical companies and the authorities.I reiterate that we want an adjudicative tribunal into the actions of the pharmaceutical companies. Individuals and Ministers were prosecuted and, in some cases, sent to prison for their part in similar scandals in France and Portugal, while in Japan three drug company executives were prosecuted for selling blood tainted with HIV and they served terms in jail. A tribunal rarely results in prosecutions whereas in other states the issue is dealt with through the criminal justice system. An adjudicative tribunal would have similar powers and we would be far more likely to see justice done.The cutbacks in public services being planned and implemented by the Government remind me of the cutbacks in the 1980s that forced the BTSB to cut corners irrespective of whether it cost people's lives. The board put financial considerations before the lives of people. This is nothing short of criminal negligence and those responsible must be held accountable. It would be easy to write all of this off as a systematic failure but it was much worse than that. A group of individuals made a clear decision to place people's lives at risk. They, either wilfully or negligently, infected people and the consequences of this were fatal and brought immense suffering to hundreds of people. The victims of this tragedy seek accountability for what could be described by some as murder. It is time that they got it.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	365	I thank all those who contributed to the debate on this motion on the Lindsay tribunal report. No words can describe the gravity of the issues examined by this inquiry and the human loss and suffering that resulted from the infection of the haemophilia community with HIV and hepatitis C. The Government acknowledges the courage of those who gave personal testimony to the tribunal and, on behalf of the State, I again unreservedly apologise to these persons and their families. In order to ensure that these personal testimonies are put on record and given the acknowledgement which is their due, I have decided that they should be published, subject to normal rules of natural justice, as a memorial to the bravery and courage of those who have borne witness at the tribunal. I will also ensure that this publication is undertaken in consultation with the Irish Haemophilia Society, is available at no cost and is circulated as widely as possible.As I informed the House on 23 October, the Government has decided to accept the findings of the report in full. Having considered the report carefully, the Government has also decided to refer it to the Director of Public Prosecutions as a mark of the seriousness with which it views the events which are documented in the report. My officials forwarded the report to the Director of Public Prosecutions last Friday. As the report itself acknowledges, the events that were investigated took place some time ago. Significant improvements have taken place since then in regard to services for people with haemophilia.The tribunal found that the situation in Ireland regarding the supply of recombinant clotting factor products now compares favourably with many other countries and was remarked upon by many of the international experts who gave evidence to the tribunal. It should be acknowledged that we have a state-of-the-art facility at the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders. There is ongoing communication between the centre and the Irish Haemophilia Society in relation to the management of haemophilia. A person-centred service where the voice of the consumer is a key factor in shaping the services provided is a pivotal aspect of service development. My Department is in consultation with consultant haematologists around the country and with the Irish Haemophilia Society to ensure that services adhere to the highest standards of quality and there is optimal co-ordination of services. I will meet the Irish Haematology Society and the Irish Haemophilia Society in the coming weeks to ensure their respective views are taken on board in the development of all services.I have already outlined to the House how my Department intends to implement all the recommendations in the Lindsay report. In particular, the Department will proceed with the establishment on a statutory footing of a national haemophilia co-ordinating committee, which will be called the national haemophilia council. Representation on the committee will include professionals involved in haemophilia care, the Irish Haemophilia Society representing consumers of the service, health boards, my Department and relevant interests. The results of poor communication and lack of co-ordination of services in the past point to the need for a streamlined uniform system of communication between service providers and a consistent high quality system of care delivered throughout the country. The council will oversee, monitor and advise on all aspects of haemophilia care. Its overall aim will be to ensure improved communication between clinicians and improved co-ordination of services resulting in a consistent quality of care, whether a person being treated for haemophilia lives in Donegal, Dublin or Kerry.A major sub-group of the national haemophilia council will be the product selection and monitoring group. A key task of this group will be to ensure that all decisions regarding the selection, procurement, distribution and monitoring of products used in the treatment of haemophilia adhere to the highest standards. The Irish Haemophilia Society will play a pivotal role on this committee, along with the National Centre for Hereditary Coagulation Disorders, the Irish Blood Transfusion Service, health boards and other relevant interests. An ad hoc group is already in place for over a year and shortly its membership will be expanded to involve key professionals with an expertise in various aspects of haemophilia treatment.I am grateful to the Irish Haemophilia Society for its close co-operation with my Department over the years. I particularly acknowledge the contribution of Mr. Brian O'Mahony, chairman of the society. Brian is also president of the World Haemophilia Federation, which is evidence of the high esteem in which he and the society are held at home and abroad. I also acknowledge the significant input of Ms Rosemary Daly and all the staff at the centre. Rosemary worked tirelessly over the years in the cause of the Irish Haemophilia Society and its members. I understand she is now enjoying a well earned sabbatical from her role as administrator of the society and I wish her well for the future. The society requested an increase of €300,000 in its funding at a recent meeting with me. Having considered its request, I am pleased to inform the House that I intend to provide an additional €300,000 to the society next year to enable it to enhance the services it provides to persons with haemophilia.There has been criticism about the cost of the Lindsay report which was set at €10 per copy. When the cost was being determined, it was seen as reasonable relative to the Finlay report which cost £5 in 1995. However, the Irish Haemophilia Society has pointed out that €10 is high relative to the €1 charged for the interim report on the Flood tribunal. While the society acquired as many copies as it requested free of charge from my Department, the point it made regarding the cost is valid and, as a result, I will request the Government Publications Office to make the report available at the nominal charge of €1. Copies will also continue to be available from my Department on request and an electronic version is available on the Department's website.Calls have been made for a further inquiry into the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies based in the United States whose products were implicated in the infection of persons with haemophilia with hepatitis C and HIV. Ms Justice Lindsay considered it inappropriate to comment on whether there should be a further inquiry into the actions of certain multinational pharmaceutical companies whose products were implicated in the infection of persons with haemophilia with hepatitis C and HIV since I had commissioned and obtained independent advice on the matter. As I have already informed the House, I appointed Mr. Paul Gardiner, senior counsel, to advise me on a possible investigation into the actions of these multinational pharmaceutical companies. I have had consultations with Mr. Gardiner and I will have further discussions with the Attorney General. I reiterate my belief that it would be possible to mount a useful investigation which would allow access to publicly available material and to persons and bodies willing to co-operate. I am in consultation with the Attorney General and all other parties, including the Irish Haemophilia Society, on an effective template, following which I will revert to the Government and the House on my proposals. It is important for the House to have the fullest information possible regarding that inquiry and the pursuance of the pharmaceutical companies.I thank Ms Justice Alison Lindsay, her staff and the many people who contributed to or co-operated with the tribunal. There was much criticism in the House of the content of the tribunal report. However, the Oireachtas set up an independent process. It has reported to the House and the motion notes the report.

#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	375	I move: "That the Bill be now read a Second Time."This Bill marks an important milestone in the development and regulation of the private security industry in the State. It encompasses a broad range of security services, including door supervisors, private investigators, security guards and consultants, as well as suppliers and installers of security equipment. When enacted, it will be the first primary legislation in our jurisdiction to deal comprehensively with this industry. The proposal before us is proof of the Government's commitment to support the industry and its determination to promote and ensure best practice. The Bill represents a balanced and progressive response to the needs of the private security industry and the concerns of the public who increasingly come into contact with it on a daily basis. The key issues we are addressing in the Bill are high standards and quality service.In recent decades our society has undoubtedly become more security conscious, and for good reasons. As part of this process, the work in which the private security industry is involved has broadened into new areas and occupational activities. As a consequence, the industry now has greater direct contact with the public than in the past. Nowadays we encounter security equipment and security personnel routinely in shops, shopping centres, entertainment venues and leisure facilities and we take it for granted. Many of these security related duties that were previously undertaken by in-house staff are now contracted out to specialised security service providers.The private security services industry has grown rapidly in recent years and it now encompasses an extensive range of occupations and activities. It represents an important area of economic activity with an estimated turnover of approximately €250 million annually. According to best estimates about 400 companies are currently active in the industry, while overall employment is in the region of 12,000, not including those involved in part-time jobs.There have also been significant changes in the sector resulting from the development of sophisticated security related technologies in recent years. Modern surveillance systems and monitoring equipment have opened up new and improved possibilities for guarding property and protecting people. This is generally welcomed and supported. In the wrong hands, however, the manner of installation, maintenance and operation of such equipment could lead to abuses.All of these changes point to the need for standards in which we can have confidence and trust. The aims of the Bill, therefore, are the promotion of consumer confidence and enhancement of the quality of service provided. The Bill will help achieve these aims, put the industry on a sound footing for the future and help root out those who bring the sector into disrepute. The private security industry appreciates and supports our efforts in this regard.The suggested framework for a statutory regulatory system, which is at the heart of the proposals in the Bill, was, as many Deputies will know, set out in the report of the consultative group on the private security industry which reported at the end of 1997. This was a representative, high level group which brought together representatives of employers and employees in the private security industry, key Departments, the Garda Síochána and other relevant bodies.It is in the public interest that everyone involved in the private security industry operates to the highest possible standards. Unfortunately, this is not always the case and most of us will have encountered, experienced or received reports of instances of low standards and unacceptable behaviour. To its credit the consultative group did not dodge this issue. Its report acknowledges the problem of low standards which is often related to a lack of training, poor working conditions and a high level of staff turnover.Furthermore, as the report also acknowledges, the problem of low pay in parts of the industry leads to abuses of the social welfare system and non-compliance with the tax code. The activities of companies of dubious origins with links perhaps to criminal or paramilitary groups have also given rise to concerns. While I am not suggesting these are widespread problems, they exist and it is regrettable that the high standards of reputable companies in the private security services industry can be undermined by less scrupulous operators and criminal elements. The private security services industry must, because of the nature of its work, adhere uniformly to high standards of service, responsibility and accountability.This is the background against which the group concluded that the scope for voluntary selfregulation had been exhausted. In its place the group recommended the establishment of a statutory body to introduce, control and manage a comprehensive licensing system for the industry and set and maintain appropriate standards. The group considered that this body could be established on a self-funding basis.The consultative group's report and recommendations recognised a need for consistent, high standards within the industry for adequate selection and training of staff and for overall compliance with legislation in areas such as taxation, social security, company law and health and safety standards in the workplace. The Bill seeks to give effect to the principal recommendations of the consultative group. I take this opportunity to express my thanks to the members of the group for developing the blueprint which underpins the proposals we are discussing today.I turn now to the detail of the Bill. Essentially, it provides for the setting up of a new body to be called the private security authority in order to control and supervise individuals and firms that provide security services and to maintain and improve standards in the provision of those services. One of the authority's immediate priorities will be to introduce and operate a licensing system and maintain an up-to-date and easily accessible register of all licensees. In the longer term, the overall aim will be to improve the planning, development and delivery of the services concerned.I will now focus on the Bill's main provisions in order to give Deputies an appreciation of its scope and an understanding of how the proposed system of regulation will work in practice. The scope of the Bill is set out in section 2. It defines what is meant by a security service and also contains definitions of several categories of persons providing security services. These include "door supervisor", "installer of security equipment", "private security employer", "security guard" and "security service". The definition of "person" in this context includes natural persons, partnerships and companies.Under the commencement provisions contained in section 1, it will be possible to apply the Bill's provisions to sectors of the industry on a gradual basis in order to ensure a balanced workload for the new authority. A number of exemptions are set out in section 3. These include members of the Garda Síochána, the Defence Forces, authorised officers under the Air Navigation and Transport Acts or staff of a Department or State agency while undertaking official duties. Apprentices employed by a person providing a security service are also excluded and additional exemptions may be provided for by means of regulations.The establishment of the private security authority is at the heart of this Bill. This is provided for in section 6. The authority will be independent in the exercise of its functions. Provision for the establishment, if necessary, of advisory committees and for the appointment of whatever consultants or advisers the authority considers necessary is made in the First Schedule. This Schedule also provides for accountability of the chief executive not only to the Committee of Public Accounts, but also to other Oireachtas committees.The principal functions of the authority are set out in section 8. In general, it will control and supervise persons providing security services with a view to maintaining and improving standards in the provision of those services. The authority may grant and renew licences to persons within the industry and, where appropriate, suspend or revoke licences. It may also establish standards to be observed in the training of licensees. Identity cards will be issued to licensees and a publicly accessible register of all such licensees will be maintained.The authority must establish and administer a system of investigation and adjudication of complaints against licensees. It will monitor the provision of private security services generally and advise the Minister on and set appropriate standards to be observed in the provision of security services by licensees. The qualifications required for licences or particular categories of licences will be implemented by means of regulations made by the authority with the consent of the Minister under section 40.The carrying out of investigations will be an important task of the new authority. Section 12 will give it power to investigate any security services being provided by any person. The authority may request information relevant to an investigation from any person and may also request a person to appear before it with a view to furthering the investigation. If these requirements are not complied with, the authority may apply to the District Court for an order requiring compliance. The court may treat a failure to comply with such an order as a contempt of the court.Section 13 will enable the authority to appoint members of its staff to be inspectors subject to terms and conditions determined by the authority. Each inspector shall, on appointment, be given a warrant and shall produce the warrant when requested. Inspectors will require certain powers of entry and inspection for the purpose of obtaining information in relation to any matter under investigation by the authority. Section 14 makes provision for this. An inspector may request the production of records, books or accounts or any other documents or information necessary in order to establish whether the relevant provisions of the Act are being complied with. Refusal to comply with any requirement of an inspector will be an offence.A strategic plan will be essential to provide a coherent framework for the work of the authority and section 9 provides for the preparation and submission of a strategic plan as soon as practicable after its establishment. Plans thereafter will cover three year periods and will set out the key objectives, outputs and related strategies for the authority, including its use of resources.Sections 10 and 11 provide for the appointment of the chief executive of the authority and for the recruitment and appointment of other staff. It is important that the Minister and the Houses of the Oireachtas should be kept informed about the authority's activities. For this reason, section 15 requires the authority to report to the Minister each year before 30 September and the Minister to lay copies of the report before each House of the Oireachtas.In the interests of transparency and in order to avoid possible conflicts of interests, section 16 makes provision for a declaration of interests by the chief executive, members of the authority and others in a manner specified by the Minister. It is a standard provision in legislation of this type. In a similar vein, section 17 provides for the disclosure of interests. Non-disclosure constitutes an offence. Section 18 prohibits the chief executive, members of the authority, members of the staff of the authority and others from disclosing information obtained in the course of their duties. A person who discloses such information will be guilty of an offence.Section 19 is a standard provision in legislation of this nature. It provides that the Minister may make grants out of funds provided by the Exchequer towards the expenditure incurred by the authority in the performance of its functions. However, as I mentioned earlier, it is envisaged that the authority will operate, as far as possible, on a self-funding basis.Details of the licensing system and how it will work are set out in Part III. The licensing system will cover all persons providing security services, including private security employers and the security services set out in section 2. For the purposes of the Bill, a private security employer is defined as a person who employs staff whose principal function is to provide security services for persons other than the employer. This means that a company, for example, specialising in the provision of security guards or door supervisors must have a licence since the principal function is to provide a security service for persons other than that employer. On the other hand, a retail outlet or licensed premises that employs its own security staff is not a private security employer for the purposes of the Act and does not, therefore, require a company licence.As defined in section 2, a licence must be held by all individuals providing a security service. This means that all security guards and door supervisors must hold a licence, irrespective of whether they are employed by a private security employer, a person who is not a private security employer or are self-employed. In other words, in-house, contracted and self-employed security staff are covered. This approach is necessary to ensure that high standards prevail across the entire spectrum of private security services.Section 21 sets out the conditions for obtaining a licence to provide security services. Application forms must be accompanied by references regarding the applicant's character, financial position and competence, as well as the prescribed fee. The authority may require an applicant to furnish such additional information as it considers necessary, including certification by a senior member of the Garda, and may require verification of any information by affidavit. Investigations or examinations may also be undertaken in relation to an applicant's character, financial position and competence. In the case of companies and partnerships, the information required will relate to directors and partners respectively, as well as any manager, secretary or other officer of the entity concerned. Persons occupying any of these positions who are also directly involved in providing a security service will require an individual licence. The authority may refuse to issue a licence in certain circumstances which include cases where the applicant is not a fit and proper person to provide a security service or does not comply with requirements under this legislation.In the cases of companies and partnerships, the conditions I have outlined apply to directors and partners, respectively, as well as to any manager, secretary or other similar officer of the entity concerned. This is provided for in section 22. The section also provides that a licence does not confer any right of property and that it may not, inter alia, be transferred or mortgaged. Section 23 provides for the renewal of licences and in the circumstances outlined in section 24, the authority may refuse to renew a licence, suspend a licence for a specified period or revoke a licence. Such actions would be taken where false or misleading information had been supplied, where the licensee is no longer a fit and proper person to provide a security service or where provisions under the legislation have been contravened. The detailed procedures to be followed by the authority when it proposes to refuse to grant or renew a licence, suspend a licence for a specified period or revoke a licence are set out in section 25. A licensee may wish to apply for a variation in the kind of security service to which the licence relates and this is allowed for in section 26.One of the authority's most important functions will be to issue identity cards to licence holders. Each licensee must have the identity card in his or her possession when providing the security service and must, on request, produce it for inspection by a member of the Garda, a designated member of the staff of the authority or any person for whom the licensee is providing a security service. Provisions in this regard are made in section 27.Section 29 provides that a licensee must surrender the licence and identity card when a licence is suspended or revoked, when it expires or when the licensee ceases to provide a security service. Provision is also made for an inspector to seize and retain the licence and identity card if they are not surrendered. In order to provide ready access to the list of licensees, section 30 requires the authority to establish and maintain a private security register. The register will be kept at the offices of the authority and a copy will be supplied to every Garda station enabling users or intending users of private security services to confirm that a provider is registered for the purposes of the service concerned. The register will be updated and published each year.In the context of vetting licence applicants or licensees, section 31 provides that the authority may request the Garda Commissioner to provide any information required for the due performance of its functions. The Commissioner shall comply with any such request. Section 32 requires a licensee, on request, to produce the licence for inspection to a member of the Garda, a designated member of staff of the authority or any person for whom the licensee is providing a security service under the licence. Where the licensee is a company, the licence shall be displayed in a conspicuous place in the company's registered office.In so far as offences are concerned, section 33 requires an applicant or licensee who has been convicted of an offence, or against whom proceedings are pending, to notify the authority of the conviction or the proceedings in the prescribed manner and within the prescribed period. It is central to the purposes of the Bill that the provider of a security service shall not provide such a service without a licence and this is provided for in section 34. A person who contravenes this provision is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding 12 months, or both, or on conviction on indictment to a fine or imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years, or both. Section 35 makes it an offence to employ a person who does not hold a licence and the register provided for in section 30 will provide a readily-accessible means of checking whether a licence has been issued in respect of the person and the service concerned.A proper complaints procedure is important in a legislative measure of this type and just such a procedure is provided for in section 36. A person may make a complaint of misconduct against a licensee provided it is made in good faith and is not frivolous or vexatious. If, following investigation, the complaint is upheld, the authority may take appropriate action with its options ranging from revocation of the licence to the issuing of a caution or advice to the licensee concerned.In addition to a complaints procedure, an appeals system is also essential. Section 37 provides for the establishment of an independent private security appeal board to hear and determine appeals against decisions of the authority. This means that an applicant or licensee may appeal against any decision of the authority to refuse to grant or renew a licence, to suspend or revoke a licence or to take action on foot of a complaint under section 36. Details of the composition and operations of the appeals board and the procedures for handling appeals are set out in the Second Schedule to the Bill. Section 38 makes provision for an appeal to the High Court on any question of law arising from a determination by the board.As I have already stated, the Bill makes provision for a number of new offences. Section 39 empowers the authority to bring and prosecute summary proceedings for an offence under the Act and makes provision for certain offences under the Act. It is neither possible or appropriate to make provision for detailed implementation of the licensing system in the Act itself. The private security authority, the membership of which will be broadly representative of relevant interests, will have a crucial role to play regarding decisions about the categories of licences to be issued, the form of licences and identity cards, the qualifications required for particular categories of licence and related issues. Section 40 provides for the making of regulations to deal with these detailed issues.It is not feasible to bring the entire system into operation on a set date. I envisage a phased introduction of the new requirements in order to avoid bottlenecks and I also want to ensure that there is no unjustified interruption of legitimate business when the new provisions come into force. For this reason, section 41 contains certain transitional provisions to facilitate a smooth entry into force of the licensing system. The First Schedule provides for various procedural matters regarding the authority including the appointment by it of advisory committees, consultants and advisers, the accountability of the chief executive to the Committee of Public Accounts or other Oireachtas committees, as appropriate, the prohibition of improper influence and the determination of fees payable to the authority.Part 1 of the Second Schedule provides for the establishment of the private security appeal board and related matters including appointment of the chairperson, term of office, procedures of the board, non-disclosure of information, prohibition of improper influence, reports and declarations and disclosure of interests. Part 2 contains details on matters relating to the appeal process including notice of appeal, notice of appeal requirements, documents to be supplied to the appeal board by the authority, submissions by the authority on appeal, submissions by persons who are not a party to the appeal, further information required by the appeal board and the hearing of the appeal.I stress again that the Bill before us is being introduced with the active involvement and support of the private security services industry. It reflects a clear public interest in the introduction of a form of statutory regulation regarding the industry. I am confident the provisions in the Bill will serve to enhance the standing and image of the industry, provide quality assurance for customers and reassure the public that high standards apply and will be maintained in the industry.I assure the House that I will listen carefully to the debate which ensues and will be interested in suggestions and constructive criticisms from any source. It is in that spirit that I commend the Bill to the House.

The Minister for Education and Science has announced a review, the purpose of which is to ensure that the benefits of the substantial investment we make in the third level sector are maximised. I welcome the fact that the Minister has decided to conduct that review. Given the lapse of time since the free fees announcement was made by the then Minister for Education, it is timely there was a review of the overall provision in relation to financial investment in the third level sector.One of the key objectives of the Government is to achieve greater access to third level education. I am sure, and it is clear from the debate, all Deputies share that objective, yet we have not secured it and are still a long way from doing so. This review is being carried out by officers at the Department of Education and Science and will cover a range of topics relating to schemes of student support, the level of maintenance grants, eligibility, income limits applying to grants and the free fees initiative. All these matters are properly within the scope of the review. I do not propose to predetermine the result of that review, but I welcome that good initiative. The evident idealism with which the Minister spoke on this subject last night underscores his commitment to making real progress on this issue.Some of the issues relevant to this review will require external expertise. The Economic and Social Research Institute has been commissioned to carry out research on a number of the issues relevant to the review. Together with other reports, the reports of Professor Clancy were referred to in the course of this debate. That review is under way and I welcome the fact that it has been initiated. That is important.In the context of this debate, it is important to consider what the OECD has said about what we are doing. The most recent OECD international study, Education at a Glance – 2002, points to the significant increase in expenditure per student at third level and higher education in the second half of the last decade. Ireland ranks second of the 27 OECD countries in terms of the increase achieved. That is a good record and one over which any Government could stand.I appreciate that the Opposition has raised the question of the rather dramatic increase in the registration fee that took place last summer, but no speaker – Deputy O'Sullivan will have an opportunity to reply – has outlined an alternative area where the Minister for Education and Science could have effected the necessary revenue savings in his Vote. The measure adopted was in the nature of a revenue gathering exercise rather than a financial cut in the strict sense. There is no doubt it does bear hard and someone must accept that, but these decisions have to be taken by Ministers. This is one of the difficulties the Opposition parties faced in the recent general election. There was much discussion over the summer about what was or was not said by the outgoing Government parties, but I do not agree with all that comment. The Opposition parties, and perhaps the Labour Party under a new Leader, will have to examine their consciences as well because their promises bore no proportion to reality.

Irish people are intelligent enough to make an assessment on these matters. They want real choices in their politics not contrived ones.

If that research is borne out by the study under way, I would welcome that.The device adopted by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, could have secured the objective sought without providing free fees for everyone. If increased maintenance had been provided for students in those categories at that time, there would be an even greater number of them participating in higher education. The vote of the Labour Party had not increased dramatically as a result of that decision because a large section of the public remain deeply sceptical about its merits.As an act of contrition, I accept we should not have abolished the rates in 1977. The Labour Party should examine its conscience on this decision, although I do not want that to be taken as a suggestion that I am advocating reversing the decision.

#PatCarey	unknown-#PatCarey-party	unknown-#PatCarey-dob	unknown-#PatCarey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	386	I will lay my cards on the table. When free fees were introduced by the then Minister, Niamh Bhreathnach, I thought it was a retrograde and regressive step and wrote in The Irish Times about the reasons I thought it was such. I thought, and still think, there are other ways of widening access to education which could be much more effective than the abolition of fees across the board.This debate is about priorities, equity and justice. It is important that we have an opportunity to contribute to the debate on how we consider access to third level education can be widened and, probably by extension, access to first and second level education. I spent 30 years of my career working in first level education. Despite significant investment by the Government in third level education in recent years and despite my constituency having probably one of the most successful universities in the country, DCU, the level of participation in third level education in that constituency has dropped over the past five to eight years.I was marginally involved in the first report produced by Patrick Clancy. Admittedly, we came from an extremely low base where participation rates were limited to the higher income groups. There has been a slight extension in participation rates, but there is no point in pretending there has been a great level of extension of participation of the lower income groups from areas of disadvantage in third level education. That cannot be achieved by the stroke of a pen.A measure that has been probably the most effective in this context, to which all Governments contributed, including Deputy O'Sullivan's party, was the emphasis placed on post leaving certificate education. Those courses have been a step up to the platform of third level education, which many young people who do not come from a tradition of participating in third level education require. That emphasis has been successful and there has been a great expansion in the number of those courses. Students, on completing those courses, may apply for a one year certificate course, a two year diploma course or a degree course, but that takes time. Unfortunately, the abolition of fees did nothing to improve that ladder-form approach.Various legislative measures were introduced. The qualifications authority, the overarching body, allows people to access education, and that is an interesting approach, but to return to the nub of the issue, it would have been much more effective if the level of maintenance grants were significantly increased at the time fees were abolished. I have a row annually with the Minister for Education and Science about the paltry increase in the level of maintenance grants, which are wholly inadequate. I have a major difficulty with even the top-up scheme, the millennium scheme. One would nearly need to be on the poverty line to qualify for it. While this bits and pieces approach to education has improved bits and pieces of our education system, we have not been able to make a significant change in the way people participate in education.I am delighted people from Dublin 4, Dublin 6, counties in the west, farming communities and the self-employed sector can participate in great numbers in third level education, and good luck to them. However, there is something inherently wrong when the son or daughter of a farm worker cannot obtain a maintenance grant while the farmer who owns the land can do so. There is also something wrong when the owner of a pub, with the aid of a helpful accountant, can manage to produce a set of accounts which allows his sons and daughters to qualify for maintenance grants while the children of a person in his or her employ cannot do so.I hope that part of the ongoing review will be to consider issues such as the real causes of high drop-out levels. The University of Limerick, for example, has extremely high drop-out levels, as do some of the institutes of technology.I commend the Minister on introducing the initiative aimed at considering how third level education is funded and how participation is availed of. I would be delighted if people did not have to pay registration fees. Unfortunately, however, the cake is only so big. At the end of the review, I hope we will have arrived at a more equitable approach in terms of the way funds are made available to the third level sector in order that a wider range of students can participate.
#TonyKilleen	unknown-#TonyKilleen-party	unknown-#TonyKilleen-dob	unknown-#TonyKilleen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	387	I also commend the Minister, Deputy Noel Dempsey, for his commitment to address inequities in the education system and, in the context of this debate, to the development of the third level sector in an inclusive and equitable manner. It is clear from what Members on all sides have stated that there is a great deal of work to be done in this area and the Minister is right to address this matter early in his term of office.Like Deputy Carey, I have a background in education. I am somewhat surprised at the extent to which the debate has focused on third level, as though it was a stand-alone entity which operated entirely independently of other sectors in education and of the public and private sectors of employment. That is unhelpful. It is good to acknowledge the extent to which any measure of success in education is predicated on a high standard at primary and second level. In addition to the difficulties which undoubtedly beset it, there are many successes in the area of education which need to be acknowledged. It is only fair to pay tribute to the role and commitment of teachers at the various levels for their contribution to education.In the context of this debate, it is fair to say that rumours about the imminent re-introduction of fees at third level have caused concern to many parents. Some whose incomes are in the very modest €30,000 range have been convinced, by whatever means, that they will be obliged to pay full fees in respect of their sons and daughters in the near future. It is a salutary lesson that if some of those who succeeded in putting across that particular message had been as successful during the election, the composition of the House might be quite different. However, many people believe, quite wrongly, that they will be liable to pay €6,000 if their children are attending arts, law or business courses, €8,000 if they are pursuing science courses or €9,000 if they are studying engineering or medicine.The Government will spend €360 million this year, including fees, on third level education. This figure obviously excludes the amount that will be spent in capital grants. There should be no question of parents of middle or lower income families being obliged to meet the cost of fees. I believe that the report the Minister has commissioned – the findings of which cannot be accurately foretold – will strongly put forward this view. However, it is difficult to argue with conviction that students who are children of extremely wealthy families should not have to pay some form of fees. In essence, that is the kernel of the debate. Ultimately, it is the responsibility of the Minister and, by extension, the House to ensure that the best value for money is extracted from the considerable investment in education at third level.The area of private rented accommodation has not yet been touched on in the debate. I welcome the announcement by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government today of the establishment of a voluntary mediation service under the Private Residential Tenancies Board. This service will be supportive, non-confrontational, confidential and speedy as opposed to the only avenue open to people heretofore, namely, the legal route, which tends to be expensive, slow and adversarial. The Minister did not make it clear in his speech, but I hope that service will be available to students and will be accessed by them.Those of us who are parents of third level students will have found that there is a wide range in the standard of accommodation available and that quite a large proportion of student accommodation is at the lower end of the scale. The difficulties that beset students and, by extension, their parents cannot realistically be addressed through the legal system. I welcome the Minister's announcement today and I trust that the service will be of benefit to, and will be accessed by, students.Part of the motion before us relates to registration charges in third level institutions. However, it is not widely known that students who are eligible for means tested student support are exempt from the €670 charge. Over 33% of university students are exempt on this front and almost 50% of those in the institutes of technology will not have to pay the charge.It is fair to point out that investment in third level education has a considerable social and economic benefit. The Minister's review of the application of student support and free fees funding will recognise this. The review should also examine a range of third level funding and contribution models in Europe and beyond. We must face the fact that the resources available are finite and we need to commit ourselves to obtaining the best value for money.The benefits to the State from the high rate of participation in third level education are also considerable. The report should focus on increasing participation within the parameters of available budgets and also on addressing the problems students quite frequently encounter when they discover, sometimes early in their first year or, on occasion, a little later, that the course in which they enrolled does not suit or is not the best choice for them. Some students have experienced enormous difficulties in changing to other courses and this is one of the areas it would be useful to examine and address.The OECD report "Education at a Glance OECD Indicators 2002" places Ireland second of 27 countries in increased expenditure per student in tertiary education from the mid-1990s onwards. That is a creditable performance, even if many people would state that it is from a relatively low base. It is important that the Higher Education Authority has introduced targeted initiatives to address attrition rates – a major problem – participation rates and the quality of tuition within the sector. The latter is quite a vexed question but, in the context of the delivery of the kind of service to which we aspire, it cannot be avoided and must be addressed – in some instances, with the greatest of urgency.The Government has enjoyed outstanding success in the area of participation in third level education. The number of full-time students increased to 126,000 in 2001 from 107,000 in 1996-97. That represents a 17% increase over four years. During that period, the enrolment of part-time students increased by 41%. Expenditure on third level has increased by 95% since 1998 and there have been some tremendous benefits as a result. The sector has focused on addressing the skills needs of the economy in various targeted areas such as ICT and health. A total of 1,500 students participated in the hugely impressive accelerated technician programmes in the institutes of technology. This has an immediate benefit, not just for the students, but also for the economy.New investment has facilitated rapid development in the research infrastructure at third level and huge amounts, as the Minister outlined, have been expended in this area. It is an area that requires further commitment. There has been a substantial increase in investment in the science and technology fund, another area that requires our continued commitment.There have also been improvements in maintenance grants for disadvantaged students. The top-up fund and the hardship fund have had a favourable and positive impact on families that qualify for them. The recommendations brought forward by the action group appointed by Deputy Woods should be examined.

The Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and Deputy O'Sullivan have often been present when I spoke previously and have heard me sketch the relationship between Tallaght and Limerick. I had not intended to speak about Tallaght tonight but it is important to point out that this issue is one of great importance in Tallaght, as in other towns, including those in Deputy Enright's constituency.I live in Tallaght, the third largest population centre in the country, which has a large young population. Education is an important issue in my constituency. Ten years ago, after a strong local campaign, Tallaght secured its regional technical college, which has become the Institute of Technology, Tallaght. I spend a good deal of time in the college. I take every opportunity I can to visit it because I am extremely proud of it and its part in the infrastructure of the new town of Tallaght. I do not mean to sound patronising but it gives me the opportunity to discuss educational issues with the students, who come not only from Tallaght but from all areas of the country.I wish to discuss access to colleges in Tallaght and elsewhere, particularly for people in disadvantaged communities. Sometimes politicians do not like to use the word "disadvantaged" and I do not wish to use it unfairly, but we must accept that major population centres like Tallaght still have areas of disadvantage. We need to convey the view that every young person is entitled to third level education. It is certainly as important an issue in my constituency as in any other. Through social inclusion policies and other initiatives by Government and State agencies we can ensure that as many young people as possible access third level education. That is as it should be.Over the past decade I have watched the development of Tallaght IT with great pride. It now has 2,500 students. I recently attended Freshers' Day and, according to the local newspapers and one of the national newspapers, the students gave the politicians who visited a warm welcome. Some might even say it was hot, and that is fair enough. I am not afraid to talk to people who wish to raise issues of concern with public representatives and who want us, in turn, to raise them in the Dáil.Students in Tallaght and elsewhere have told me that they wish to challenge the increase in registration fees. They want me and my colleagues, including, I am sure, Deputy Crowe, to bring to the attention of the Minister their concerns and their request that the Minister and his officials place more emphasis on the maintenance grant thresholds before any other increases are introduced. Registration fee increases from €396 to €670 should only be considered as part of a wider exercise that ensures the families who are supporting the education of their children can plan for these increases. More importantly, thresholds should be broadened to take account of the cost of living and the ability to pay.I hope the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, and his officials will understand the need to communicate in greater detail the reason these increases are necessary. Perhaps a value for money exercise in the areas where these increases will be spent would be worth considering to show the benefits that might derive to the students. The Minister will be aware that the 42% drop-out rate among IT students is not acceptable. It is also not acceptable that increases in fees should add to this number.It is important that all politicians understand the worth and challenge of education. On 28 April 1926, Senator W. B. Yeats said in the Seanad that it is precisely because we are poor that we must spend money on education. Thank God, Ireland in 2002 is a different and, I hope, more positive place. I mean no disrespect to our ancestors. However, we should not lose the ideal that was highlighted on that day in April 1926. While Ireland is a different place, education is still important for our community.I do not believe there should be cutbacks in spending on colleges. That is the message I bring from my constituency. I am proud to be a Fianna Fáil Deputy but I am not afraid to speak up on these issues because that is what my constituents sent me here to do. People in Tallaght, Firhouse, Greenhills, Templeogue and throughout my constituency want me, with my colleagues, to make a difference and to relay to the Government what is being said to us on the doorsteps. Ministers, including the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, are prepared to listen. Deputy O'Dea listens to his constituents just like I do to mine.I hope that, arising from what is said in this debate, the Minister will understand the challenge before us and the need to respond to what people are saying in this regard. At the end of this Dáil, five years hence, I hope we will be able to look back and, whatever about other policy areas where there will, I hope, also be progress, we will be able to say with pride that we made a difference in education, we listened to the needs of our constituents in this regard and, where third level education is concerned, we promoted the ideal that any young person, regardless of background, who wants a third level education can get it. That is the challenge and I hope we will achieve it.

He also pointed out that he had only been in office for a short time. This brief time in office has not stopped him implementing savage cutbacks to cover up the ever-increasing hole in the Minister for Finance's books.Questions were put to the Minister last night but he ably ducked and dived and avoided giving a straight answer on this issue. He did not tell us where the money raised by the massive 70% increase in registration fees would be spent. He did not tell us how his desire to reintroduce fees sits with Deputy Harney's refusal to support that policy. Neither did he tell us how the Government plans to live up to its pledge to ensure the number of disadvantaged students participating in third level education will double over the next five years. One of his first acts as Minister was to cut €5 million from a scheme aimed at attracting socio-economically disadvantaged school leavers into third level education.The introduction of free fees was not the solution the Government of the day presented it as being. It has done little for many of the young people attempting to enter university from some of the poorest parts of the State, although it has made it easier for some. It was a step in the right direction towards a fair and open system of education, but it cannot be the solution for tackling inequality in education. We need massive increases in State aid to bring student grants into line with levels of social welfare support. We also need sustained investment in access to education programmes and to start putting money into primary and secondary education.In yesterday's debate, the Minister made the disturbing remark that higher education benefits the individual far more than society. How he can honestly believe that, while holding the Education brief, is beyond me. Society benefits from an educated citizenry. Others in yesterday's debate spoke of the benefits of an educated workforce earning more and thus paying more in taxes, but there are other benefits. Education has a measurable impact on crime rates as well as on the involvement of citizens in community work and in politics. Education gives people confidence and plays a key role in personal development. It broadens the horizons of students and, perhaps more than anything, benefits society at all levels.The Minister also referred to the recent OECD report on education, demonstrating a great skill for selective quotation. He ignored the fact the OECD exposed the State's pupil-teacher ratio, both at primary and secondary levels, as being among the worst of the 27 countries surveyed. The OECD report noted that the Irish Exchequer invests far less per pupil than other countries. It is at primary and secondary level that the inequalities resulting in under-representation of working class young people in university are created. The Government has failed in this area.The Minister has already cut €6 million from the proposed plans to reduce the school drop-out rate and a further €2 million from the second-level building programme. The effects of such decisions can be seen in my own constituency of Dublin South West where over half the adult population of west Tallaght left school at or before 15 years of age. This has had a knock-on effect on the current generation of young people.Years of sustained investment in education will be required even to begin to rectify the damage that decades of Government negligence have caused. In budgets introduced over the last five years, the Government has favoured the better off at the expense of the poor and the disadvantaged. Now that the state of the economy has begun to deteriorate, it seems the Government intends targeting the cutbacks at those who are most in need of support. This is clearest in the area of education. The Minister must realise that education is not the right area in which to cut corners in spending but the area in which to invest in the sure knowledge that benefits will be reaped across society as a result.
#PaulNicholasGogartyGP	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-party	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-dob	unknown-#PaulNicholasGogartyGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	392	The Green Party condemns the recent 69% increase in registration fees and also roundly condemns any attempt to reintroduce additional fees through the back door. That is why I have tabled priority questions for the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, for reply next week. In addition, I have met with student bodies and have marched side by side with them in an attempt to get the message through to the Minister that there are other ways to examine this matter. I am happy to support this motion and will vote against the Government's smug amendment.There are underlying issues at stake here which go beyond third level fees. The Green Party believes there should be no such fees but of equal importance is the need to fund education to a far greater extent than at present. An equitable method of financing such funding needs to be found. I have studied the Clancy report in some detail and the Minister is broadly correct when he says the abolition of fees by his Labour Party predecessor, Niamh Bhreathnach, did little of substance to increase participation by the less well off in third level education. All it did was subsidise the middle income PAYE earners and the upper classes without doing much to improve participation at third level by poorer students. The Labour Party would claim that such a development takes time to come about and that may well be the case. The Government is wrong, however, to say that bringing back fees above a certain level will benefit those who are less well off as clearly it will not. Targeted investment in the root cause of inequality is needed to tackle educational disadvantage. That is why I am so disappointed by the €36 million package of cutbacks, including the back-to-education initiative, the access and school building programmes, IT research, teacher training and recruitment. All of these are vital areas of education.The Government should increase investment in education substantially. We are talking initially about investment in primary level, including breakfast and dinner clubs that would keep pupils from poorer areas interested in attending school long enough to reach second level. Second level incentives are also needed to bring about a cultural change together with additional investment so those belonging to certain socio-economic groups can benefit, even though thus far they may not have had an opportunity or been inclined to attend third level colleges. Extra investment is also required for the third level sector.A lot may have been done, as Fianna Fáil said in its election manifesto, but clearly a hell of a lot more still needs to be done. It should be done now when the economy is going downhill. The investments we make now will allow us to reap the rewards when the economic cycle improves. Where should the increased revenue come from, however? Should one draw an arbitrary line and say those earning beyond a certain figure should pay third level fees? It would be difficult to do that because people on either side the threshold level always tend to suffer. With the registration fees increase, for example, those who are slightly above the threshold are working hard to make ends meet. It is not the best way because it puts pressure on those who are already struggling.The Green Party believes the matter should be dealt with in a different way. We think the principle of free education is good and should be continued. During the past five years, however, the king and queen of voodoo economics – the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, and the Tánaiste, Deputy Harney – made sure that the gap between rich and poor increased. The Government's economic policies have benefited the highest earners and have done nothing to create extra funding for investment in education. In the current downturn caused by this Government's economic mismanagement, the fairest and most equitable way to raise funding is by increasing income tax. The Green Party favours an emphasis on environmentally sustainable taxes. Our finance spokesperson, Deputy Boyle, has called for reform of taxation with the introduction of a three-band system. The richest should be made to pay at the highest band. They are the ones who benefited when the economy was booming, so now when the economy is slowing down they have a moral obligation to finance the country's education and health care systems.Increased investment in education is needed to ensure future generations will be able to meet the challenge of highly skilled and added-value work if we are to be successful when the economy turns around. Our suggestions include the abolition of tax breaks for fee-paying schools. Deputy Boyle has also called for an end to the special savings investment scheme, which is immoral. I am paying €254 into it, which I can afford, but I would not be sorry if the Minister for Finance abolished the scheme. Last but not least, a small income tax increase should be introduced and ringfenced for education. In that way we might be able to pay back what was robbed from the poor over the last five years of the Celtic tiger.More investment in education is required and although the Minister for Education and Science is not present in the Chamber, I hope the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, will pass these sentiments on to him.
#LiamTwomeyIND	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-party	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-dob	unknown-#LiamTwomeyIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	393	We must acknowledge that improvements have occurred in third level education over the past five years, but there is no room for complacency. The Minister was quick to point out these increases during the debate yesterday, including €24 million for third level access this year, €2.5 million last year on the special fund for students with disabilities and €7.49 million in respect of the 2001-02 academic year on the students assistance access fund. I hope these figures will be the new baseline for the Government's commitment to third level access. The anger from students and their parents about the doubling of the college registration fee is an expression of their fear that the cost of third level education will again become prohibitive for many families.The Minister makes no secret of the fact that he is toying with the idea of reintroducing college fees because the projected increases in students from deprived backgrounds did not materialise and he is also expressing a concern with the drop-out rate in all third level institutes. Fees are not the only barrier to those from a deprived background. There is only one career guidance counsellor for every 200 students and early school leavers only get financial support if they are out of the system for two years. Many are lost to a lifetime of poor literacy.The concept of a third level qualification is not expected by parents and students in those sectors of society traditionally under represented in third level institutes. Poor self esteem or a lack of confidence in their own abilities can be a significant barrier. We all have our educational weaknesses and strengths, and they are not often that easy to identify. I will give credit to the Minister and his predecessors for trying to improve this issue. In my constituency of Wexford at least ten primary and secondary schools need urgent attention, and I will explain the relevance of this at a later stage.As somebody who paid £2,000 per year in college fees, and as a professional who will end up having to pay college fees for my own children if they are introduced, I have a vested interest in this debate. For the same reason, I know the review group on the application of student support and free fees will recommend the introduction of college fees.My fear is the genuine commitment of the Government to the noble idea of social equality, which the Minister was so quick to highlight last night. In these leaner financial times, political expediency could see two scenarios develop with the reintroduction of college fees. The first is that we will return to the situation which pertained in my time in college, where third level was a luxury and many bright individuals, not necessarily from a deprived background, were deprived of a third level education. The second scenario is that any savings made by the reintroduction of fees will not be put back into education.This brings me back to my earlier point about the primary and secondary schools in County Wexford and early school leavers. If there is a genuine commitment to reinvest savings in education and to direct investment towards schools and young people, then I could accept the reintroduction of college fees for those who can genuinely afford them. There is no need to waste money on the review group because this will be the outcome of it anyway.There is no need for the Minister to lecture this side of the House about addressing the inherent inequalities, not only within the education system, but also in our health system. I hope the value for money report on education does not go the same way as the one on the health services seems to be going, which is basically nowhere. This Government will be expected to make difficult decisions in the next five years. Health and education are always prime targets for cutbacks and this must be resisted.In the Minister's conclusion last night, he emphasised that this Government will continue to invest heavily in education, will continue to place a premium on our children's future and to give everybody an equal opportunity. In my conclusion, I wish the Minister well and I hope that he is genuinely concerned and that this increase in college registration fees is not the beginning of an unacceptable return to difficult days for students and their parents.
#MarianHarkinIND	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-party	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-dob	unknown-#MarianHarkinIND-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	394	As a former teacher who, depending on the wishes of the people of Sligo-Leitrim, may some day return to that fine profession, I have a particular interest in this issue and other education related issues.The recent decision to impose an increase of 69% in the registration charges for third level students is a retrograde step. The Higher Education Authority only sought a 7% increase in registration charges and the extra 62% simply seems to be a cutback in funding in the education sector because there does not seem to be any benefit, either to students or to the education system itself, because of the increased costs.Given the fact that the announcement came towards the end of the summer and that parents and students were not prepared for it, this has caused considerable concern for some and considerable hardship for others. A huge increase in registration charges, without any warning or rationale other than in the context of Government cutbacks, is an extremely worrying development and casts a cloud of uncertainty over parents and students who are planning their financial outlay for third level for this and future years. When people add the Minister's comments about the possible reintroduction of third level fees, they find themselves in an impossible position.Parents who must maintain strict control of their outgoings will be seriously discriminated against by the reintroduction of third level fees. As the Minister and others are well aware, the current cost for those who have to live away from home to attend third level is in the region of about €10,000 per annum when one has regard to the cost of accommodation, food, registration, books, travel, etc. If two students from the same family are involved, the burden on parents is significant.However, like many issues, this matter is not totally black and white. The fact that the children of those well able to pay fees are being unnecessarily subsidised by the taxpayer is something which merits examination. It should not be beyond the ability of the Minister and his Department to evaluate and separate out those whose incomes are well capable of excluding them from free fees. However, in so doing the Minister would need to set income thresholds at a sufficiently high level to ensure that only those who can afford to pay end up doing so. Unfortunately there is a long tradition in this country of setting qualifying limits far too low and squeezing compliant lower and middle income taxpayers. This creates anger and resentment, and rightly so. However, in the case of third level fees it will also have the effect of ensuring that many students from middle and lower middle income groups will not be able to access third level education immediately after completing second level education. I cannot believe that this would be the intention of the Minister, Deputy Dempsey. He has said that taxpayers should not have to subsidise his children's education and I agree with this sentiment, but can he guarantee that if he reintroduces third level fees the income threshold will be as high as a Cabinet Minister's salary?If the Minister is determined to reintroduce third level fees I would ask him to keep the following in mind: setting income thresholds at a sufficiently high level so that access to third level is, and is seen to be, equitable and fair; considering a tax allowance for third level education costs; taking into consideration the fact that those from rural areas or, indeed, some urban areas must pay accommodation costs and that this adds to the financial burden; looking at some type of sliding scale fees so that those who are just on, or over, the limits do not end up being badly caught; and taking into account if other members of the family are paying third level fees.I will abstain on this motion. I agree with 90% of it but the fact that those well able to pay continue to benefit means I have some reservations about the motion. Finally, I ask the Minister to ensure that if any funds are saved, they would be used in the grossly under-funded primary and secondary levels in areas such as remedial and resource teachers and to ensure that intervention takes place at the earliest possible stage in the education system.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	395	I wish to share my time with my colleagues, Deputies Moynihan-Cronin, Lynch and Costello.As one of the first of the school bus brigade and one of the first from my national school to go to university, I have a particular interest in this debate. I come from a working class family, the eldest of ten. At the time the grant was worth £7 a week and without the help of my own family I would never have survived. I am surprised at Deputy Harkin. One cannot have an each way bet on this issue. One is either for it or against it.My view is clear. Despite coming from that working class background I led the campaign to get rid of tuition fees once and for all. I saw the rich convenanting to one another. Do we want to bring back third level fees to allow them to do the same again? The covenant scheme cost the State £37,000 in the mid-1990s when we abolished fees and opened third level education to everybody. The abolition of fees did not merely help people who had incomes of £100,000. It covered people working in the ESB, Bord na Móna and county councils who, if their overtime payments put them £10 over the limit were ineligible for third level grants. These people were unable to covenant to anyone.I am in favour of the abolition of third level fees even though I come from a working class background. Of course we must improve access to higher education for people from backgrounds like mine. The Labour Party got damn all thanks for the abolition of third level fees. The Minister who took the action lost her seat in the following election. So much for gratitude. I still believe, however, it was the right decision.We did not intend to reduce capital gains tax for the rich. We intended to use that money to finance decent maintenance grants for third level students. In our education document we said the basic maintenance grant should be the equivalent of the minimum social welfare payment, approximately €130. I make no apology for what the Labour Party did. We did not expect a huge influx of students from a background similar to mine. The abolition of fees simply gave them the chance to get into the system. Equality is important. The rich were being subsidised by being allowed to covenant from one to the other. Any hint that the Government intends to re-introduce college fees should be greeted with extreme opposition. It is only another finance saving mechanism. The money saved will not go towards improving education at the lower or remedial levels.We abolished third level fees in the mid-1990s and we continue to support this policy as a fundamental principle. Any attempt by the Government to re-introduce fees as a short-term solution for the mess it has made of a golden opportunity is one of the most short-sighted policies of any Administration. Consistent efforts to open up the university sector have increased from 20% in 1980 to 50% at present the number of students progressing to third level education. More remains to be done but a return of fees would wipe out the progress we have made. I have a young relative who, as soon as he heard of the possibility of a return of fees, said he could not go to university.The registration fee of €700 signifies that fees are already on their way back. That is a huge amount of money for families of people working in county council jobs. I know fathers who worked overtime and mothers who worked in cleaning jobs, only to find that every penny they earned was counted and their grant applications were not successful. The income limits for maintenance grants must be lifted and access to third level education made real and meaningful. The present system is one of divide and conquer. The income level is set at €28,000 and raised by a measly €2,500 if there is a second child. One would not feed a snipe on that amount of money.Instead of looking after their wealthy friends the Government could raise money by bringing back windfall taxes on re-zoned land. Capital gains tax should be increased and the money should be spent on giving ordinary working class people a chance. Income is taxed at 42%, while capital gains is taxed at 20%.We must not be afraid to stand left of centre in this debate. There is a clear choice. We must be for giving people a chance or not. I am certainly in favour of giving working class people a chance. If they are given opportunities they will take them. The Government must increase maintenance grants to a realistic level and let us get on with the debate on education.

When I was going to school one could pick out of a first year class who would go to university. It depended not on the marks but on the wallet. After all the battles this party has been through to make third level education equitable, the Minister is taking us back down the road of giving the rich every facility while throwing others on the heap. I will lie on the ground in Kildare Street and let the Minister roll over me before he will do this.I know people who went to school with me and who were extremely intelligent but were deprived of the opportunity to go to university because their parents were £100 or £200 over the grant level. I know a family who struggled to put one child through university but whose four other children could not get the same opportunity. I hope those who are sitting in this House – many of whom went to school at the same time I did and saw the difficulties students faced – will not support the re-introduction of third level fees. I was delighted to hear Deputy O'Connor say he would oppose the re-introduction of third level fees. I hope he will support our motion in tonight's vote.We must decide whether third level is as much a part of our education system as primary and secondary education. I know my policy and the policy of the Labour Party in that regard. The Labour Party believes that primary, secondary and third level education should be universally accessible. I want the Minister to outline his position on this issue. The Government is all over the place. The Minister says one thing, the Taoiseach says something else and the Tánaiste says something else again.Workers such as gardaí and teachers who pay PAYE and struggle to put a roof over their heads will not be able to cope with paying third level fees. The Union of Students in Ireland has calculated the cost of going to college for a student living away from home at €7,500 per year. The increase in the registration fees and the threat to re-introduce fees could bring that figure to €12,500. The cost for a four year undergraduate degree would be €50,000, or €100,000 for two children. Can the Minister tell me from where ordinary PAYE workers will get that amount of money to educate their children? Their children will not be educated. We will go back to the situation in the 1950s and 1960s when the privileged had the opportunity to go to university and the underprivileged did not.The Minister must get off the fence and tell the people what he proposes to do. There are students studying for their leaving certificate whose parents do not know where they stand. They need to work overtime but they are afraid it may put them over the limit for the third level grant. The Minister must outline his policy on third level education, get off the fence and support students.
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	397	I was reading through the various press cuttings about what the Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Dempsey, the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste have been saying about the reintroduction of third level fees in recent months. If one were to read those press cuttings, one would notice that the Minister comes across as someone who is a champion of the poor. He wants to reintroduce third level fees so the poor unfortunates who cannot afford to pay fees right now can get a leg up and those who can afford to pay will pay. That seems a very reasonable argument to make. Most would be taken in by it but if the Minister was genuinely concerned about those who cannot afford to pay third level fees, he would not have allowed the increase that he has allowed. As Deputy Penrose rightly says, almost €700 in registration fees is an enormous amount of money for some families. Therefore, the Minister is not concerned about the less well off.One should consider that the children who started school in 1994 when the abolition of third level fees took place, whether they started at four or five, are now, on average, between 13 and 14 and in secondary school. Therefore, we have not seen what can happen in respect of the abolition of third level fees because that generation of schoolgoers has not come through yet.It was never entirely a matter of abolishing third level fees to ensure that people who could not afford it up to this point reached third level education. It was also about Breaking the Cycle, Early Start and all the other measures that were introduced at primary level to ensure that the children who did not have the opportunities would have the encouragement and, at the end of secondary school, the opportunity of third level education and that it would not be an economic choice.If the Minister accepts that third level education is now part of the overall education system then he must surely accept that, just as we do not ask people to pay for primary school, we should not ask them to pay for third level. If one believes in the concept of paying third level fees, one must surely see nothing wrong with the concept of paying for primary school.We have all been heard tonight saying we have a particular interest in this matter for one reason or other, whether it is because of our background, our children or our constituencies. However, we all have an interest in it. We have a real interest in ensuring that we have a well educated population in the future that can serve this country well. If the Minister were truly interested in making the very wealthy pay for third level education when their children require it, there is a mechanism for this in place already – it is called taxation and it is what we all pay.Unfortunately, we have a Government that cries crocodile tears over the less well off in third level education, but still continues to tax the rich less severely than it taxes the rest of us. It is not sustainable that one can say this to a generation of children that we have allowed to believe that third level education is available to them when they finish secondary school. This is the first generation, because of this system, to depend on where the Minister sets the level in the determination of whether they can attend. I would have thought, like the IFI workers being locked out of their jobs, that the days of the scholarship boy and girl were long gone, but it seems we are about to return to them. It is an absolute disgrace to be discussing this in this day and age.If the Minister wants to raise taxes, there are plenty of avenues for him to go down and plenty of people who can well afford to pay even if they do not have children at third level. The notion of contributing to a common fund to allow the country to continue, whether in health or education, does not just exist for the little people, but for everyone. I appeal to the Minister not to take this retrograde step, to allow the process to continue and to continue to put additional money into primary level.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	398	What the Minister has done since he became Minister was make a statement saying that he would be the champion of all those who do not have access to third level education and other areas of education and that he would deal specifically with those who are less well off, people in disadvantaged areas, to ensure that education became accessible to all. Those were his words but his actions were the opposite. On the one hand, he spoke of access but on the other hand he restricted it. He introduced cutbacks right across the board, the most dramatic of which was the 69% increase in registration fees. This surprised his Department, which was totally flabbergasted at the increase, as it surprised the heads of the universities. However, the Minister advocated the increase as a desirable one.In effect, the increase was a cutback like the other measures in relation to the cutback on access programmes, back to school initiatives, IT, teacher training and so on. In the lead-up to the Nice referendum he was disowned by the Tánaiste and the Taoiseach and he was quiet for a little while, but as soon as the referendum was over he was mouthing the same intentions.It seems the Minister is simply introducing cutbacks on behalf of the Minister for Finance, Deputy McCreevy, rather than putting forward any thought-out policy in respect of education. That is why I am so critical of the Minister. We have blatant hypocrisy on his part. He is saying one thing and doing another. If he is really interested in providing access to third level education he has all he needs before him.The report of the acting group on access to third level education, which was sought by the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Woods, and was published in 2001, has everything he requires. The review he is talking about has been completed, but his predecessor presented that review in the context of the abolition of third level fees. That review involved consultation with all the groups and bodies concerned with access to third level education. They have come out with a blueprint, a key document whereby we can now put resources where they are most needed to ensure access is extended.We need to ensure this country has a fair taxation system. A fair taxation system produces a fair society, and a fair society will ensure that certain fundamental services are provided for all citizens. No service is more fundamental than providing young people with education. It gives them freedom to be independent citizens. That is the road we should be going down.There should be access to tuition at all levels. We feel it should be extended to pre-school education. We should retain it at primary level. At second level it was introduced by Fianna Fáil and everybody on this side of the House supported it. The Labour Party will fight to ensure that what it introduced in 1996 – access to third level education – will be retained, but we want to go a step further and have second-chance education for those who did not have a chance prior to free second level education in the old days. They should also get their chance as adult and mature students.The Minister should hear loudly and clearly that we will not accept any change in the status of the measure that was proposed by the Labour Party in 1996 in respect of free tuition for all citizens.
#SiledeValera	unknown-#SiledeValera-party	unknown-#SiledeValera-dob	unknown-#SiledeValera-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	399	This debate has been instructive in providing an insight into the respective positions of the parties on issues of fundamental principle concerned with the administration of public policy. The Minister rightly identified the issue of inequitable access to third level education as one that should exercise those with an interest in social justice and a concern for ensuring the human capital potential of the economy is maximised to the benefit of all. How the public resources available for student support can be put to best effect in achieving that objective is an issue this Government wants to explore.It is remarkable that this willingness to ask the hard questions concerning the impact and effectiveness of the administration of public funds and the outcome of public policy is one the Opposition would like us to shy away from. I was under the impression that the job of the Opposition was to engender debate and critical analysis, not to defend the status quo and attack the very concept of reviewing well worn policies that may not be meeting their objectives.The review the Minister has initiated into the use of student support funding, including free fees, is important and timely, coming seven years after the introduction of free fees and given the lack of progress that has been achieved in the meantime in meeting the stated objective of that initiative. All of us engaged in this debate agree that meaningful progress has not been made in achieving equitable rates of participation in higher education among the more disadvantaged sectors. That is not a party political statement: it is a straightforward recognition of a policy failure of successive Governments. In initiating this review, the Minister and the Government are seeking to point the way to better, more effective, policy options, rather than seeking refuge in the comfortable option of pretending these problems do not exist or avoiding at all costs the possibility of upsetting particular interests in society.In seeking this better way, the Government does so on the back of five years of unprecedented commitment to the development of education at all levels and to seeking to address the fundamentals of educational disadvantage. Between 1997 and 2002 global day-to-day spending on education increased by 87% while capital investment in the educational infrastructure has increased almost fourfold under this Government. An additional 3,450 teaching posts at primary level have been created, including almost 1,500 resource teachers for special needs. Capitation funding at primary level has been increased by 80% and a targeted fund of €36 million has been put in place to address the needs of disadvantaged children across 2,276 primary schools. There has been a huge expansion in the numbers of post-primary teachers with a significant fall in the pupil-teacher ratio from 18:1 to 14:1. There has been a massive expansion in the third level sector with 19,000 new full-time places, an increase in part-time enrolment of 41% and a six-fold increase in current spending for research. Support for access programmes at third level increased from €500,000 in 1997 to €24 million this year, an increase of 4,700%. A new top-up maintenance grant for disadvantaged students has been introduced and the income threshold for grant qualification has been raised by 32%.Achievements in my areas of responsibility include an allocation of €25 million to youth work initiatives this year, providing for an extension of the Youthwork and Youthreach programmes. This is a 38% increase in the funding available in 1997. Youth work has been placed on a statutory basis with the enactment of the Youth Work Act, 2001, and the phased implementation of the Act has already commenced. This Act is the culmination of a comprehensive process of consultation and addresses the needs of the voluntary sector in a detailed manner as well as catering for the needs of those charged with the implementation of the new structures. It is intended that the national youth work development plan will be implemented alongside the Youth Work Act.In September 2002, I launched the Code of Good Practice: Child Protection for the Youth Work Sector. In adult education, which is very important, the White Paper, Learning for Life, was launched in 2000. Investment in this area has increased 16-fold in the last five years. The back to education initiative is the second priority of the White Paper. It will start this year with 6,000 new places at a cost of €6.31 million. Within the further education sector there had been no guidance service for participants in adult literacy, VTOS, adult and community education programmes up to 1999. That has now been addressed. Unfortunately, I do not have time to address the many other issues involved in this debate. My concern has been to demonstrate the manifest commitment of the Government to improve and develop the education system on the basis of equality and social inclusion.

#LizMcManus	unknown-#LizMcManus-party	unknown-#LizMcManus-dob	unknown-#LizMcManus-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	402	I thank Deputy O'Sullivan and other contributors to this important debate. I do not have anything against the Minister of State, but I have just listened to the most excruciating example of the Government's approach to education, one that is mean-minded, short-sighted and woolly in its thinking. It is incredible that Fianna Fáil has sunk to this level when one considers the party's great tradition and record in this area, when it understood the value the people put on education.However, its approach today is typical of the party's right-wing bias we have seen since the general election. The first targets were the poor of the Third World with the ODA cuts. Education fees were hugely increased to the amazement of all, including the college authorities. Those seeking health care were then hit with charges in accident and emergency departments. ODA, education and health were the Government's targets, after it spent money like it was going out of fashion in an attempt to win votes in the general election.Education is perhaps the most crucial area in terms of securing our social and economic future. That was understood by Donough O'Malley. The legislation he introduced was among the most progressive of any Minister in the history of the State. He made a political choice. People would have understood if he had argued in favour of means testing for free second level education due to the lack of resources in making it universally accessible. However, he chose to deliver a universal system, unprecedented in this country, so that everybody could have access to free second level education regardless of their parents' income. It was an enlightened view, but there was a hard headed approach behind it.In view of decisions made by Donough O'Malley and others we were able to have a tiger economy that is an extraordinary example of the role of education in economic success. Now the inheritors of this legacy, the current Fianna Fáil Ministers, want to roll back on it. Niamh Bhreathnach built on the progress that was made by further developing the principle of universal access. It makes practical sense when it is considered that when Donough O'Malley introduced free second level education a leaving certificate opened doors and enabled people to have access to good, well paid jobs. Nowadays a primary degree is required to access similar employment. We must recognise this parallel.We cannot go backwards. We all know there is inequality in education and that it must be ensured that resources and funding directed to the education system are also used to support families, both when children are small and when they are at third level. However, that is not the approach taken by Fianna Fáil. It is taking a reactionary and conservative view and is concerned with rolling back people's rights. I am glad to hear the strong voices in the Labour Party that will ensure this does not happen.
#PatRabbitte	unknown-#PatRabbitte-party	unknown-#PatRabbitte-dob	unknown-#PatRabbitte-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	403	I thank my colleague, Deputy O'Sullivan, for moving this motion and for the support of the motion by my colleagues on the Opposition benches in the Fine Gael Party, the Green Party, Sinn Féin and a number of Independent Deputies. I heard the contributions of Deputies Harkin and Twomey. I wish to thank my Fianna Fáil constituency colleague, Deputy O'Connor, who also supported it. He reminds me of the corncrake in that I could hear him but I could not see which side of the fence he was on. As Deputy Breeda Moynihan-Cronin said, the issue for Deputy O'Connor now is if he will go into the lobby with us in support of this motion.Deputy O'Sullivan took some time to persuade me of the merits of this motion because since he became a Minister, Deputy Dempsey has behaved somewhat like a boy in the playground with a kite. In his ministerial career he has flown more kites than an entire playground of school boys. Apparently, on this occasion, incredible as it may appear, he is serious about wanting to reintroduce fees. I find that difficult to believe. The arguments that were advanced by Deputies O'Sullivan, Burton and Upton in terms of the Minister's action in grossly inflating the level of registration charges, and the likely consequences of a decision to reintroduce free fees on an argument of equity and resource constraint, is difficult to believe.I wish to deal, in particular, with a number of points made by the Minister in his reply to the Labour Party advocates of the motion. The first of these is the equity issue in the context of the increased earning power of graduates vis-à-vis non-graduates. On this aspect of the equity issue the Minister contended that: “Higher education benefits the individual far more than society”. In the course of his address he introduced the ESRI report, Living in Ireland Survey, and an OECD report, Education at a Glance, to show that the earning power of graduates compared with non-graduates is immensely different. I do not think anyone in this House disputes that. There is nothing new about the fact that, on average, the earnings of graduates are, generally speaking, higher than non-graduates. The point is that it is wrong to contend that the results show that the returns on third level investment are entirely or largely captured by individuals as opposed to society or the State. There are returns which accrue to society, the State and the Exchequer as well as to the individual. Society is enriched in a variety of ways, some of them perhaps difficult if not impossible to measure, by the existence within the population of a large and growing cohort of graduates.The economy gains in that Ireland's attractiveness to foreign investment is increased and the capacity of domestic industry to compete is enhanced through the effect of investment in third level education on the stock of human capital. The Exchequer gains through the increased tax yield, whether income tax or indirect taxes, compared with what it would otherwise be if, for example, we had no graduates. It is nonsense to say on the basis of studies that appear to concern themselves with attempting some quantification of the earnings premium that goes with higher qualification, that the premium represents the entire or most of the gain from the investment behind it. The Minister knows this because he acknowledged at an earlier point in his speech that there are wider gains. He talked of the increased expenditure over the past five years and critically, that:The manifestation of this increased investment can be seen on a number of fronts. The capacity of the sector to meet the skill needs of the economy has been developed through substantial targeted funding to provide new places in areas of identified need, such as ICT and health skills.There are also returns on the investment that accrue to the corporate sector; profits, exports and growth are higher than they would otherwise be, yet the Minister is not arguing for an increase in corporation tax to capture for the Exchequer and society an increased share of this corporate benefit or gain.Second, the Minister either misunderstands or deliberately misrepresents Deputy O'Sullivan in respect of the question of the number of years that it is likely to take for the full effect of the free fees initiative to work its way through. He stated that to argue that it will take several years for this psychological impact to take effect, "simply does not impress."  The problem is not a psychological one and Labour Party Deputies did not argue that. The point made was that the problem of access starts at a much earlier age than 17 or 18 and so it does take time for the free fees initiative to achieve its full effect. From this point of view it also requires significant and intensive interventions in primary and secondary education if free fees are to work to the fullest effect.Trees take time to grow to maturity but this Government is either climbing them or cutting them down. The reality appears to be that the picture regarding equality of access and the impact of free fees is somewhat like the curate's egg, good in parts. Some significant improvements have been identified by researchers, but as the Minister of State, Deputy de Valera, would say, more needs to be done.Whatever is to be done, the reintroduction of fees, or allowing for massive inflation in registration charges – effectively the reintroduction of fees by the back door – is not the answer. There is no single answer although there is currently a singular problem.No single answer is possible in response to what is a multifaceted problem. It calls for interventions at all stages of the education system, primary, secondary and third level. We need initiatives such as Breaking the Cycle, introduced by a former Minister for Education, Niamh Breathnach, and we need them mainstreamed. We need to address early leaving and non-completion in the secondary school system. We also need to tackle some serious problems in third level institutions. For example, just a couple of hundred metres down the road from this Chamber, an institution which has existed for the past 500 years or so effectively closes down at tea time and does not provide night courses for the immediate catchment area. The nearest education institute to me is the Tallaght Institute of Technology which is about seven years old and which already has more night students than Trinity College has put through its books in the past ten years.The Minister referred in his speech to: "the plain facts that continue to present in relation to rates of higher education participation among the lower socio-economic groups."  He also stated: "The progress we have made in this area has been painfully slow and has not had the meaningful impact I want to see on the basic inequity that has persisted under successive Governments."  There is a lot of truth in that but the problem is that, in the first instance, the mess that the Minister for Finance has overseen in the management of the nation's finances is the real reason for the Minister advancing the bogus argument that he is doing this in the interests of equity and equality of opportunity. He is doing nothing of the kind. He has cut back on critical interventions. He has effectively begun the reintroduction of college fees through inflationary increases in registration charges, which are a nonsense anyway. He is now apparently quite serious about reintroducing fees and bringing in means testing.A few years ago, before Niamh Breathnach's initiative, I recall being approached in my clinic by a man from County Kildare in the neighbouring constituency. He was a farm manager whose child was in the same class as the offspring of the farm owner. He found to his horror that he had exceeded the threshold of eligibility for a grant by a couple of hundred pounds. To his further horror he found that while his child was disqualified, the farm owner qualified. Under the concept of reckonable income, the farm owner could plan his affairs in such a fashion that he bought a combine harvester in the year that Natasha did the leaving certificate but the farm manager had no such facility open to him. That is the kind of inequity to which the Minister wants to return. I hope he is back at his favourite game of flying kites. He seems to be fascinated by them and not dimmed in the slightest by the fact that most of his previous kites have been shot down.
#GayMitchell	unknown-#GayMitchell-party	unknown-#GayMitchell-dob	unknown-#GayMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	404	I appreciate being selected to raise this important matter this evening. I hope the Dáil will be given an opportunity to consider the matter in detail before Ireland casts its vote at the UN Security Council on the proposed resolution or resolutions on the situation in Iraq.Speaking in the House on 23 October I set out Fine Gael's position for the record. I spoke about the fact that unilateral action was not acceptable and about the need for independent verification by Ireland of claims made in the Blair dossier and by the American Administration. I also set out sources where I believed we would find the possibility of such independent verification. I said we should stand up to terrorism, but also that we should tackle injustice in the world. I said we should avoid knee-jerk anti-Americanism, and I repeat that here this evening. I also said it was time to assess Irish security needs. I feel I am a lone voice in stating that we are not part of any alliance or that we have not provided the Irish Defence Forces with the necessary equipment to defend Ireland even from an attack of which we might be given notice.I said that we and our partners in the European Union should assess the contribution the European Union could make to rebuilding a free and democratic Iraq. I also said that we, as parliamentarians, must take our responsibilities in these matters more seriously. It is not sufficient for us to see which way the Government hops so that we can react to events by either criticising them or adopting a high moral tone and sitting in judgment of others. The House must be as informed as possible about developments so we can give the Government guidance and, if necessary, authorise decisions to be taken at the Security Council, and possibly at home, which are based on principles.I raise this issue again this evening and I will continue to seek to raise it under Standing Order 31. Following the elections to the Senate and the House of Representatives and other elections in the United States, the Republicans have a majority in both Houses as well as a Republican President. The situation is hardening at the UN Security Council. I was struck during the week by an article by Salman Rushdie in the Asian version of the International Herald Tribune in which he made a good case against the Iraqi regime. He did not do so for the reasons put forward by the British and American Administrations, but for what Saddam Hussein has done against his own people. I do not have sympathy or a flag to raise for Saddam Hussein or any other tinpot dictator – the sooner he is gone, the better. I have not uttered anti-American words during debates in the House and I have not said anything irrational about NATO. I have not been afraid to advocate that the State should take its responsibilities on security and defence more seriously.There is an important point in all the cases I have put forward, namely, that constitutionally Dáil Éireann has the function of declaring war. The Government does not have a right to declare war and our Ambassador to the UN Security Council does not have the power to declare war. The House must authorise whatever actions are taken by the Government and our Ambassador to the UN Security Council, and those actions may result in war. We must learn from the defeat of the first Nice treaty. People will not accept that the Government, the Minister or the Ambassador knows best. People want to be informed. The Minister must put before the House the basis on which he has sought to verify the claims being made by those who want tough action taken against Iraq. He should persuade the House about the legal and moral case for any decision he or the Government might instruct our Ambassador to take at the United Nations.I am not seeking to trip or embarrass the Minister or the Government or to make political capital. I believe in these issues about which I have been consistent. This is an important principle which will not go away and my party will not desist from prosecuting. It is a central and important constitutional, moral and legal point that the Minister and the Government explain to the House and, if necessary, seek the approval of the House for any instruction they might give to our Ambassador at the United Nations Security Council to vote for action which will result in war. These are my concerns and I will return to them because the issues to which they relate are imminent. I hope the Minister will take them to heart.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	405	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter. There is no question of any action being taken by Ireland in the coming days or weeks which would allow war to take place. We are trying to avert war. We are using the multilateral forum of the United Nations to find a diplomatic and political solution to an imminent threat to peace and security as defined by the Security Council, the body responsible for this matter in international law. While I understand the passion with which the Deputy makes his point, it is important to emphasise that there is no question of the Government giving anybody the means to prosecute a war. We are trying to avert circumstances in which pre-emptive, unilateral or other action is taken.The draft resolution under consideration in the Security Council is the latest in a series of resolutions to address the situation arising from Iraq's occupation of Kuwait in 1990, followed by its refusal to meet its disarmament obligations. Ireland strongly supports the system of collective international security enshrined in the United Nations Charter. The UN is the central forum for discussion and action on issues of global importance.The Security Council has primary responsibility under the UN Charter for the maintenance of international peace and security. It is for the Security Council to determine whether there exists a threat to the peace and then to decide what is to be done to remove the threat. Ireland shares in the growing international consensus that the Iraqi regime poses a potential threat to regional security. Iraq has so far consistently failed to meet its obligations under international law and the relevant Security Council resolutions.Nevertheless, we continue to believe that diplomatic means offer the best hope of resolving the crisis. We and other like-minded countries on the Security Council are concerned to ensure there will be no recourse to force, provided Iraq complies with its obligations under the charter. Every possible effort should be made to avoid the use of military force, which should remain a matter of last resort. All our efforts at the Security Council and in other contexts are aimed at a peaceful solution. It is clear, however, that a time is approaching when continued Iraqi defiance, if Baghdad should unwisely persist with its current course, will compel the Security Council to examine all the options available to it under the charter. We hope this can be avoided.The current resolution, as it is shaping up now, offers the best possibility of securing Iraqi compliance with its disarmament obligations and avoiding the use of force. The draft resolution before the Security Council – I stress it is still a draft resolution – is the result of almost two months of painstaking negotiations within the council. It recalls the council's previous resolutions and Iraq's record of non-compliance. It recognises the threat which Iraq's weapons of mass destruction pose to international peace and security. It states the Security Council's determination to secure full compliance with its decisions.In the early operative paragraphs, the Security Council decides, not for the first time, that Iraq is in material breach of its obligations, but decides to give it a final opportunity to comply. It also sets up an enhanced inspection regime. It requires Iraq to make a complete declaration of all aspects of its weapons programmes within 30 days and decides that false statements or omissions and failure to comply and co-operate shall constitute a further material breach of Iraq's obligations. This breach would be reported to the Security Council for assessment. It is important to note that it is the council which will carry out the assessment.The resolution provides that Iraq will give UNMOVIC and the International Atomic Energy Agency unconditional access to all weapons sites, including presidential sites. The resolution goes on to strengthen the arms inspectors' mandate. Three key paragraphs set out what will happen if Iraq interferes with inspection activities or fails to comply with its disarmament obligations. In this case, the heads of UNMOVIC and the IAEA will report immediately to the Security Council. Upon receipt of such a report, the Security Council will convene immediately in order to consider the situation and the need for full compliance with all of the relevant council resolutions in order to restore international peace and security. The resolution recalls that the Security Council has repeatedly warned Iraq that it will face serious consequences as a result of its continued violations of its obligations.What these paragraphs mean is that there is no automatic trigger for military action. Instead, there will be a two stage process in which, first, a material breach or failure to comply and co-operate would be reported to the Security Council. In a second stage, the council would consider the situation and any further steps to be taken. This could include the use of force, as is made clear by the paragraph warning of serious consequences. However, the purpose of the resolution is to bring about Iraqi co-operation with arms inspections, not to mandate a war.Ireland and other like-minded countries on the Security Council are concerned to ensure there will be no recourse to force, provided Iraq complies with its obligations under the charter. This is all Iraq has to do to bring both this crisis and economic sanctions to an end. Ireland does not agree with the view that war is inevitable. On the contrary, we believe military action can be averted by means of a strong Security Council resolution adopted with the widest possible consensus, which will send the arms inspectors back into Iraq with a reinforced mandate to complete their work. Our hope must be that Iraq will at last end its defiance of the international community and co-operate fully in the interest of securing peace and security.

Part of the function of that legislation was the establishment of a redress board, the function of which will be to conduct hearings of the people who were abused in institutions and schools and allocate them compensation on the basis of the case they make and the suffering they experienced.Hardly a day goes by in which we do not hear another horror story about some aspect of the abuse perpetrated against the children of the nation in the 1930s, 1940s, 1950s and 1960s until the abolition of the industrial and reformatory schools in 1970. Very little has been done to redress the issue and try to bring some form of closure to the sufferings experienced by the young people who were abused, many of whom are old or in ill health.What progress has been made with regard to the redress board? Have all its members been appointed and will additional members be appointed? What is it doing now? Has it secured premises and, if so, are they up and running? When will its funding, which will be substantial given the large numbers of people who have already indicated their intention to come forward, be allocated? The way in which the funding is made available is a key issue. When will the hearings take place? When will the advertisements be placed? I presume advertisements will be placed in the national media asking people who have been subjected to abuse, as defined in the legislation, to come forward and present their cases to the board in order that awards can be made on the basis of such hearings. My concern is that there is still no sign of action. The sooner we deal with this matter, which is within the jurisdiction of the Minister, the better. What is he doing about it?On a related issue, I recall complaints being made in the intense debates during the passage of the legislation through the Seanad that the list of institutions prescribed for the Act and included in the Schedule was far from comprehensive and that other areas should have been included. I was given to understand that this list would be drawn up and appended to the legislation or made available in some other form. There is provision in the Act for additional institutions which may be put on the list at the behest of the Minister and I would like to know what the Minister has done or is doing in that regard. At that time I wanted Bethany Home added to the list and I put down a question and received a reply to the effect that an institution of that nature could be added when identified. I want to know if that will happen in this case and how the additional list of institutions will be made available.The legislation is important, dealing with one of the most critical issues in our history and with something we swept under the carpet for far too long. It is now being covered by legislation which we have brought forward and it is important that we expedite it quickly.

The responsibilities of my Department in relation to the board are as follows.Following the Taoiseach's apology on 11 May 1999 my Department had to bring forward legislation to introduce a mechanism for victims to seek redress and, hopefully, enhance the quality of the remainder of their lives. The Residential Institutions Redress Act, 2002, was signed into law by the President on 10 April 2002 and its purpose is to set up a framework to enable victims to apply for compensation. The Act allows for the establishment of a residential institutions redress board. This board will administer a scheme to enable victims of institutional abuse to make applications for compensation. The provisions of the Act allow the board to make awards based on a lower threshold of proof than is required when taking a case through the courts. An applicant is expected to provide proof of identity, that he or she was resident in an institution, that he or she was injured while so resident and that the injury is consistent with any abuse that is alleged to have occurred while so resident.A premises for the board has been secured at Belfield Office Park at Clonskeagh. This accommodation is being adapted to suit the particular needs of the individual applicants who wish to have their cases heard. Judge Kieran O'Connor has been appointed as the board's chairman and he will be joined in his work by Professor Desmond Greer, Dr. Helen Cummiskey and Dr. Ruth Pilkington. Further appointments will be made as required. A secretary and registrar have also been appointed and the board's legal team is being assembled. In addition, a number of administrative staff were appointed recently to assist the board with its operations.It is important that the procedures and practices laid down by the board should be as sensitive and user friendly as possible. With this in mind, the board has taken the time to consult with a number of interested groups prior to the completion of the application form and the guide to the application procedure. The process is nearing completion and I have already given this House a commitment that once this has been finalised I will move immediately to formally establish the board. The chairman of the board has recently given me a provisional establishment date of 2 December 2002 and my Department will continue to assist the board in order to achieve this target.I am conscious that we are dealing with what is arguably the most controversial and sensitive issue to have arisen in the history of the State and we must approach the establishment of this scheme, as the board has done, in a careful and reflective manner. We must also endeavour to have the board fully operational as a matter of urgency. I do not foresee any delay beyond 2 December.
#JohnnyBrady	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-party	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnnyBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	408	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this important matter and I thank the Minister for coming to the House to reply. I take this opportunity to wish him well in his new position and to say that having known him for a long number of years and being aware of the mark he left on the Department of the Environment and Local Government I know he will do very well in it.Scoil Mhuire, Moynalty, is a four room, three teacher school with 91 pupils. It was built in 1938 and a temporary pre-fabricated building was acquired in 1976. As a result of pressure of space, the children of Moynalty and the surrounding area are not receiving the education they are entitled to, staff spend their days in an unsafe workplace and parents have nowhere suitable to discuss relevant matters with them. Classrooms are undersized which inhibits the full implementation of the curriculum. The former girls' cloakroom has been converted to a room catering for learning support and resource teaching and staff and general purpose rooms are needed urgently. Toilets and washbasins are designed for older children and younger children have to use a chair to access basins to wash their hands. Concrete blocks are used to assist younger ones use the toilet while there are no toilets for disabled pupils.In 2002 this already unsafe and dangerous premises faces even more pressure from an increasing population. The population in Moynalty is increasing in line with the trend across County Meath and several reports over the past number of years have agreed on the need for a new school. In 1998 an inspector's report stated "classrooms are undersized by present day standards, the school has no general purpose room or staff room, a factor which inhibits full implementation of the curriculum". A memo of the building unit of the Department of Education and Science said existing conditions were cramped, there was practically no storage or ancillary accommodation and that construction of a new school would provide the best value for money. The 2002 report of an acting chief fire officer states that classroom numbers represent a threat to fire safety and safe evacuation while a health and safety report, also from this year, recommends the provision of a new school as the only realistic option from an education and safety perspective.I do not have to tell the Minister anything about Moynalty because over the last five years as Minister for the Environment and Local Government he had the great honour of presenting prizes there. He and his Department will not be found wanting in trying to resolve this problem. I thank him for coming into the House and I wish him well once again.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	409	I take the opportunity to thank the Deputy for raising this matter and for his good wishes. He has conveyed them to me personally a long time previously. I am glad he has given me the opportunity to outline to this House my Department's position with regard to the building project for Scoil Mhuire in Moynalty, Kells, County Meath. Scoil Mhuire currently has a staffing level of a principal, two mainstream class teachers and a shared learning support teacher based at the school. The enrolment at 30 September 2002 was 91. As Deputy Brady outlined, the school's current facilities consist of three classrooms, some limited ancillary accommodation and a prefab.My Department currently has an extensive primary school building programme under way and it includes about 400 major building projects in architectural planning, details of which are available on the Department's website at www.education.ie.Decisions on additional projects proceeding to architectural planning are taken in light of the annual allocation for capital projects, the financial commitments to be met and the priority to be afforded to individual projects. The programme for 2002 is in place – I am not interfering with that – and the schools have been notified.The allocation for primary school buildings in 2002 is €172.6 million. Following completion of this year's Estimates process, I intend to frame a further programme and the needs of Scoil Mhuire, Moynalty, will be considered at that time in conjunction with the needs of all the other schools on the list.I stress that in the meantime it is the responsibility of the board of management and its individual members to ensure that the health and safety of the pupils is in no way compromised by ensuring that essential health and safety issues at the school are attended to. They should, therefore, continue to use the devolved grant for minor works, which amounted to approximately €25,000 for the school since its introduction in 1996. I repeat that if the cost of any works of an emergency nature exceeds the amount available under the devolved grant, the board of management may apply to my Department's building unit for additional grant aid.In that context, my Department wrote to the board of management on 17 June 2002 outlining that if the minor works grant was not sufficient to meet the urgent health and safety needs of the school, my Department would be prepared to consider an application for additional grant aid, but to date, my Department has received no such application. I indicate to Deputy Brady, who is concerned about this matter, that if such works are necessary to meet the health and safety needs of the pupils in the school and their cost would exceed the minor works grant and have to be paid for by the Department, that would not interfere with the school's place on the general building programme. If there are safety issues in this regard, I urge the board of management to take responsibility and make the necessary application if the cost cannot be met by the devolved works grant.It is my intention to bring greater transparency to the operation of the school building programme and I intend to publish it annually. I stress to boards of management that there will be no benefit just because they feel they have the ear of the Minister or lobby Deputies. The programme will be fair and transparent. If a school has a place on it, it will retain that place and projects will be delivered on merit from now on. I assure Scoil Mhuire, Moynalty, and its board of management that they will be treated fairly within the financial constraints under which I operate.
#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	410	Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leat as an ábhar tábhachtach seo a roghnú anocht. Gabhaim buíochas leis an Aire as teacht chun freagra a thabhairt air.The background to the proposal for a new northern parallel runway at Dublin Airport is rooted in the enormous distress it is causing in the communities of north County Dublin and north Dublin generally. The chairman of the board of management of St. Nicholas of Myra national school said on 6 October last – this will be of interest to the Minister for Education and Science who is present – that the problems currently caused by Dublin Airport due to exhaust fuel and noise pollution are already unbearable. Teachers must suspend activity as pupils cannot be heard when there is peak noise level when planes are taking off. This occurs about 15 times per hour. This noise level is stirring up the problem of deafness, which I presume will be of interest to the Minister.The Sunday Times recently reported a study of 350 children in Munich, Germany, which indicated that when the city airport closed, the performance of children in the vicinity improved significantly while those based near an airport that was being opened up disimproved significantly. Skills such as long-term memory, reading and speech perception were all affected, depending on proximity to the airport.The community school in Portmarnock, which has more than 800 pupils, has found that exams, particularly foreign language exams, have had to be interrupted because of the noise from the airport, particularly when planes are taking off. This noise level also affects schools in St. Margaret's, Rivermeade, Malahide and Swords and the flight path of the proposed new runway would go directly over those schools, which would make matters even worse.The proposal for a fourth runway would drown out the quality of life – the safeguarding of which should be uppermost in the Government's mind – of the more than 8,000 people in Portmarnock where, under the Fingal county development plan, the number of houses is set to double. Current runway capacity would allow expansion to 28 million passengers and even that would be enormous in terms of its impact. A cap is needed on the expansion of Dublin Airport, which should be a priority for the Government.There are plans to push passenger numbers from 14 million currently to over 40 million a year. That would be a nightmare scenario, not only in terms of noise pollution, but also in terms of congestion. The terminal built in 1972 would have to quadruple in size or four such terminals would have to be built. The current 18,000 car parking spaces would have to rise to 50,000. Such development would lead to a loss of population and depression in areas outside Dublin, which are crying out for the kind of economic engine an airport would provide, and to the devaluation in the price of surrounding property.A proposed new runway has far greater cost implications than Aer Rianta is currently considering. This Government and previous Governments have allowed Aer Rianta to overlook the associated problems of airport expansion. A previous Fianna Fáil-PD coalition Government gagged the Environmental Protection Agency in terms of addressing the problem of airport noise pollution and, as a result, residents are thwarted by the lack of legal obligations on Aer Rianta to provide, for example, housing insulation.I, and the people living near Dublin Airport, warn the Government that the health effects of airport noise will mean that the courts will hold Aer Rianta, or whoever may privately operate the airport, to account, even if the Government does not. Counsel in a future court case would no doubt ask the question as to why further congestion was allowed to be concentrated in north Dublin with the building of another enormous runway when areas to the south and west of Dublin, the centre of Ireland and along the west coast find Dublin Airport more and more inaccessible. Once the Dublin Port Tunnel opens a lane of the M50 will effectively become a truck-way further obstructing traffic to and from Dublin Airport. Even the shrewd Michael O'Leary of Ryanair thinks this proposed new runway is a foolish flight of fancy by Aer Rianta.Why has the Government, as the main shareholder on behalf of the people, been silent on this runway proposal? The most logical reason is that it wants to sell Dublin Airport as a potential mega airport, three or four times its current size, and its attitude is to hell with the chaos and havoc such a monstrosity would wreak on the nearby communities and, conversely, the isolation such development would cause to far off communities with no major airport within reach.When does the Government intend to cap the size of Dublin Airport and when will it ensure that there is balanced development countrywide so that air traffic is not centred at Collinstown? The airport was built at that location in the first instance to avoid difficulties because there were then no housing estates nearby. I also appeal to the Minister for good government and sustainable planning in relation to this trojan horse for privatisation, which will lead to the ruination of people's lives in the future.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	411	I convey the apologies of the Minister for Transport to Deputy Sargent. The Minister was present earlier but he was obliged to attend another engagement.As the House is aware, proposals on the development of the three State airports, including Dublin Airport, are in the first instance a matter for Aer Rianta which has statutory responsibility to manage, operate and develop the airports and to provide such facilities and services as it considers necessary for aircraft and passengers. In due course the Minister will consider the company's proposal for a new parallel runway from shareholder and policy perspectives.Dublin Airport is the country's main airport, serving the needs not just of the travelling public in our capital city and the surrounding counties but of the country's tourism and business sectors generally. Notwithstanding the greatly to be welcomed increase in traffic over recent years at Shannon and Cork airports and, to a lesser extent, the regional airports, Dublin airport will remain crucial to the national economy.Apart from being the country's main access point by air, Dublin Airport has been and remains highly significant in terms of the local economy of the north side of Dublin and provides substantial and valuable employment for the people of the surrounding areas, both directly and indirectly, through the multitude of service industries that have evolved over time in and around the facility. This, of course, is also true of the other two State airports at Shannon and Cork.Aer Rianta is currently engaged in a review of its long-term master plan for Dublin Airport. That review is being carried out in consultation with the stakeholders, including airlines and other business customers and local residents. The plan will determine the key requirements in terms of future development of infrastructural facilities so as to ensure that the airport has sufficient capacity to meet future demand.Aer Rianta forecasts that by the year 2020, passenger throughput at Dublin Airport will double to approximately 30 million passengers per annum and the company is engaged in an ongoing programme of capital works to ensure adequate capacity at the airport into the future. This programme envisages the need to have a second parallel runway in place before the end of this decade. The proposal to provide a second parallel runway at Dublin Airport is not new. Aer Rianta began acquiring the necessary lands involved in the late 1960s and as far back as 1972 the then county council included the runway in the country development plan.Aer Rianta proposes to apply for planning permission for the new runway to Fingal County Council next year. That planning process will provide a forum for all interested parties, including local communities, to have their views and concerns taken into account by the planning authorities. As part of the environmental impact statement which will be required to accompany the planning application for this new runway, Aer Rianta will resume its public exhibition at Dublin Airport for a further week, beginning on 11 November, to explain the project to the local community and the public in general. As part of this process, members of the public have been invited to put forward views to Aer Rianta on any matter they feel should be taken into account in the EIS.The other Irish airports are, of course, important to the regions they serve, but it is neither feasible nor realistic to propose that they could in some way cater for the traffic which wishes to fly into Dublin Airport. Dublin Airport, as well as the other airports, must be in a position to provide the facilities necessary to cater for fixture traffic growth and, accordingly, the Minister has no plans to cap the growth of Dublin Airport.The Minister is conscious that some interested parties, such as local communities around Dublin Airport, may have concerns about the future expansion of the airport. However, he must also bear in mind the needs of other sectors, such as the business and tourism sectors, manufacturing industry, international cargo operators, charter operators and their passengers. The continued growth of these sectors, which are vital for the country's future economic development and jobs, depends on adequate transport infrastructure being available to accommodate that growth. This is as true for airport infrastructure as it is for other modes of transport.

In this regard, Aer Rianta has installed and commissioned noise and flight track monitoring equipment which will provide precise measurements of the noise generated by all arriving and departing aircraft at Dublin Airport, as well as monitoring and recording the track or flight path flown by these aircraft. This equipment will facilitate the most affective management of runway operations at Dublin and assist in ensuring that local communities experience the least possible disturbance from aircraft noise. The Minister understands that Aer Rianta will make the data from this monitoring system available to the local communities and the planning authority.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	416	I propose to take Questions Nos. 63 and 90 together.The White Paper on Defence, published in February 2000, sets out a medium-term strategy for defence covering the period to 2010. A major objective of the strategy is to ensure that Ireland has a world class military organisation capable of carrying out the roles assigned to it by the Government, at home and abroad. This objective requires an ongoing modernisation process, including an investment programme to ensure that the Defence Forces are properly equipped for these roles.It would be wrong to suggest that expenditure in equipment designed to improve the efficiency, professionalism and safety of the Defence Forces results from our commitments to the Helsinki headline goal. Deputies will recall that the Helsinki headline goal, which is the more accurate description of what is commonly referred to as the Rapid Reaction Force, was developed in the light of the provisions of the Treaty of Amsterdam and derives from decisions taken by European Heads of State and Government at subsequent EU Councils. The headline goal in terms of military capabilities was set at the Helsinki European Council of December 1999. This means that the EU, by 2003, will be able to deploy within 60 days, and sustain for at least one year, up to 60,000 persons capable of carrying out the full range of Petersberg Tasks. It must be emphasised that the achievement of this goal does not involve the establishment of a European army. The commitment and deployment of national troops will be based on sovereign decisions taken by member states.

With the withdrawal of aircraft from Gormanston and the relocation of Air Corps headquarters to Baldonnel as outlined in the White Paper on Defence, the Air Corps has the basis for better management of its resources. Baldonnel will continue to be the centre of military aviation.During the last ten years or so, periodic interest has been expressed by the private sector in relation to the use of Casement Aerodrome for civil aviation purposes. Under the Irish Aviation Authority Act, 1993, however, aerodromes under the Minister's authority are precluded from regulation by the Irish Aviation Authority. Only the regulation of military aviation activities at military aerodromes comes within his or her remit. The establishment of facilities for civil aviation purposes is primarily a matter for the Minister for Transport.

Officers are assigned to and transferred between brigades by the authority of the chief of staff. Recruitment to officer rank is either through a cadetship competition, a direct entry competition, a potential officers course or a commissioning from the ranks competition. The cadetship competition is the entry level for the majority of officers of the Permanent Defence Force. A cadetship competition is held each year to select suitable candidates for the award of cadetship positions. This year a total of 70 cadets were recruited: 50 to the Army, four to the Air Corps and 16 to the Naval Service. In addition direct entry competitions are held from time to time to fill vacancies for a range of professionally qualified personnel. Potential officers courses and commissioning from the ranks competitions are held within the Permanent Defence Force from time to time and non-commissioned personnel who successfully complete such courses are commissioned as officers in the Permanent Defence Force.

It was purchased in December 2001 on termination of the lease. The Minister has no plans at present to replace this aircraft. Tenders were received in September 2002 for the lease of a ten to 12 seater executive jet aircraft for a year to support the ministerial air transport service as a replacement for the Beech Kingair in its MATS support role. Tenders are at present being evaluated and it is expected that a decision will be made in the near future.

The Department of Defence has no responsibility for the provision of accommodation for ex-members of the force or their families. On being discharged from the Permanent Defence Force, soldiers are obliged to vacate married quarters within a number of weeks and the vast majority of occupants comply with this requirement. On 26 August this year, the Department wrote to 54 occupants to request that they vacate the quarters in which they were residing. The Minister met representatives of those involved in the Curragh Camp on 2 October and departmental officials have since interviewed the persons concerned to establish the circumstances of each case.The Department intends to work with Kildare County Council, the statutory body responsible for housing in the area, with a view to resolving the problem and it is hoped to meet council officials in the near future. All options, including affordable housing, shared ownership and co-op housing schemes will be discussed at the meeting and every effort will be made to ensure that the council offers assistance in cases where individuals are eligible for local authority housing. Assistance will be given with mortgage grant applications in cases where overholders have been offered sale of the quarters. Each case will be considered on its own merits and the Department will be in further contact with each of the individuals concerned in due course. No further action will be taken in the interim.

This expenditure is additional to the normal level of investment in equipment and infrastructure. Five of the six barracks, the closure of which was announced in 1998, have been sold or are in the process of being sold. A number of other properties have been identified as surplus to military requirements. The total revenue from these sales is expected to be about €100 million and it is expected that the bulk of the revenue will be received by 2003.In anticipation of the receipt of revenue from property sales, substantial additional money has been provided in the Defence Estimate in recent years. This has resulted in an unprecedented level of investment in equipment and infrastructure in the Defence Forces. A total of €230 million has been invested in equipment since 1997 and the White Paper on Defence allows for an unprecedented €320 million investment programme in equipment and infrastructure over the next decade. This programme will ensure that Ireland has a modern, sustainable defence organisation, which is second to none, with the depth and flexibility to respond to future demands.Substantial programmes of investment are taking place in the Army, the Air Corps and the Naval Service. The initial contract for the supply of armoured personnel carriers to the Defence Forces is complete and all 40 carriers have been delivered to the Curragh Camp by the Swiss firm Mowag. Under the contract, we have the option of purchasing further APCs from Mowag and this option is under active consideration. There has been significant investment on new vehicles including specialist transport cargo vehicles, deployed to KFOR, and on new troop carrying vehicles such as 4x4s, and ¾-tonne trucks. Over €13 million has been expended on new tactical VHF radios for the Defence Forces in recent years. The acquisition of eight training aircraft for the Air Corps is regarded as a top priority by the Minister. The tender competition is progressing well and the Minister is optimistic that a contract will be in place before the end of the year.

Some 255 claims have been the subject of court awards and a further 11,981 were disposed of through out-of-court settlements. A further 601 claims were either withdrawn by plaintiffs or were dismissed by the courts.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	427	The decision last July to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps was taken due to budgetary constraints which meant that defence expenditure had to be reduced this year. The decision was an extremely difficult one. The Minister considered the acquisition of the helicopters for the Air Corps as a priority. He was aware of the effort that had been put into the tender process by Air Corps personnel and of their disappointment when the decision not to proceed was announced. When the decision was made, the Minister asked his officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's search and rescue obligations, while taking account of the current financial position. An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions and this work is at an early stage.The Minister is adamant that the Air Corps will be involved in search and rescue in the long-term. A decision has been taken, in consultation with the Irish Coast Guard, to lease a medium lift helicopter for three years. The helicopter will be operated by Air Corps pilots from Sligo Airport, beginning early next year, and the training of Air Corps personnel is under way in that regard. Despite the fact that expenditure programmes have to be prioritised, the Minister will not allow anything to take precedence over the long-term development of the Air Corps' most important resource, its pilots. The main priority for the Air Corps is the purchase of fixed wing training aircraft. The tender competition for the acquisition of eight trainer aircraft is going well and the Minister hopes to be in a position to make a substantive announcement on the award of the contract before the end of the year.

The meeting which took place in Crete on 4 and 5 October was chaired by the Greek Minister for Defence because of the Danish opt-out on European security and defence matters. The meeting was attended on behalf of the Minister for Defence, Deputy Michael Smith, by a senior official from his Department. As such meetings are informal, no decisions are reached and their main purpose is to provide an opportunity for Ministers to discuss progress made in relation to the European Security and Defence Policy (ESDP) and, in particular, the Helsinki headline goal.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	431	A total of 3,462 applications have been received for consideration for positions in the Permanent Defence Force since the beginning of the year. Of this figure, 2,000 applications related to general service recruitment. Some 381 general service recruits have enlisted so far, of whom 242 are in training at present. The remainder of the pool of general service applications together with any further applications will be used during the year to fill vacancies. The number of applications received for cadetships in 2002 was 1,047 and 143 applications were received for apprenticeships in the Air Corps. As a result of these competitions 70 cadets commenced cadet training in the Curragh on 30 September and 17 Air Corps apprentices were enlisted on 23 September 2002.Direct entry competitions for appointments including medical officers, engineers, ordnance corps officers, watchkeeping officers, engine room officers, electrical and engine room artificers in the Naval Service, as well as instrumentalists in the Army School of Music have been held. A total of 272 applications have been received for such competitions so far this year and 27 direct entry officers, 14 electrical and engine room artificers and seven instrumentalists have been appointed. The selection process in respect of these competitions is ongoing and it is expected that there will be further appointments before the end of the year. The established Government policy of continuous recruitment to the Defence Forces in 2002 to fill vacancies as required will be maintained.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	432	The Minister for Defence believes that an amendment to the Defence Act, to allow the provisions of the Industrial Relations Act, 1990, to apply to members of the Defence Forces would be wholly inappropriate. The Minister is aware that PDFORRA has placed a certain stress on the concept of the soldier as a "citizen in uniform" with the implication that the soldier's conditions of employment should largely replicate conditions in the civilian world. However, in a professional military organisation, this approach is simply not practical and this is widely recognised internationally. When an individual decides to join the Defence Forces, he or she voluntarily accepts a range of obligations and responsibilities which does not normally arise in the course of civilian employment. Taking any form of industrial action is irreconcilable with military service.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	433	The number of applications received in the past year for entry to the Naval Service, and the number of applicants who were found unsuitable, due to failing the medical examination are as follows:
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	434	The Department of Defence has operated an asbestos management programme in military posts through the agency of the Office of Public Works. A programme of works is being carried out at Gormanston, County Meath, to remove any asbestos materials. This programme of works is carried out by specialised contractors approved by the Health and Safety Authority, under the guidance of consultants appointed by the Office of Public Works. The area within which the works are carried out is handed over exclusively to the contractor for the duration of the contract and only the personnel of such contractors are allowed to examine or work with the asbestos material.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	435	The legislative implications of participation by the Defence Forces in the EU headline goal were discussed between the Department of Defence, the Department of Foreign Affairs and the Office of the Attorney General following the Government's decision in November 2000 to authorise commitment by Ireland of up to 850 members of the Defence Forces to the headline goal for the purpose of possible future Petersberg Tasks operations. The Minister for Defence was advised at that time that Ireland's political commitment to the EU headline goal did not give rise to any requirement to amend existing legislation. This remains the position.As regards any political EU Petersberg Task operation, I reiterate the policy of the Government that Ireland will approach each mission on a case by case basis and will participate only in operations authorised by the UN as comprehended by the appropriate legislation, that is, the Defence Act, 1954, the Defence (Amendment) (No. 2) Act, 1960, and the Defence (Amendment) Act, 1993. This means that each mission will require the approval of the Government and this House.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	436	Expenditure under the Defence Vote in the first nine months of 2002 was €41 million less than the original profile. At this stage the forecast for the year-end is for gross savings of €43.5 million, excesses on a number of subheads of €3.5 million and surplus appropriation-in-aid of €1 million giving overall net savings of €41 million against the Estimate provision. The main areas in which savings will arise are compensation, €14.5 million, Air Corps, €14 million and pay and allowance, €13 million.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	437	In common with other public sector health service providers, the medical corps encounters difficulty in the recruitment and retention of medical personnel. The Department of Defence, in consultation with the director of the medical corps, is endeavouring to seek ways to recruit additional medical personnel, notwithstanding these difficulties. Suitable local arrangements are made with civilian medical and dental practitioners to ensure that the appropriate level of professional care is available to members of the Defence Forces in cases where medical corps doctors or dentists are not available. The current establishment for medical officers, comprising doctors, dentists and pharmacists, in the medical corps is 61. At present, 33 of these positions are filled while there are vacancies for 23 doctors and five dentists.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	438	The Defence Forces have adopted a formalised healthy living, mental health and well-being awareness programme. It incorporates training modules in stress management skills, mental health well-being, post-traumatic stress disorder and suicide awareness and prevention. Emotional support and guidance is available to members of the Defence Forces from the personnel support service, the medical corps and the chaplaincy service. The military personnel support service employs seven professionally qualified civilian social workers and is staffed locally by barrack personnel support service officers. The personnel support service has trained and experienced stress defusion and critical incident stress debriefing facilitators and they conduct stress debriefings, in association with medical officers, as part of overseas units repatriation processing. The support service personnel have been trained in bereavement and basic counselling skills. A psychiatrist medical officer serves with the medical corps.A psychologist is employed in the personnel section of the Defence Forces headquarters. His work involves assessment and selection procedures for officers, cadets, apprentices and trainee technicians based on job analysis, psychometric tests and a personality questionnaire. He conducts lectures for courses on military psychology, stress management and critical incident stress management. In addition to these existing resources, a comprehensive mental health team is to be established within the Defence Forces consisting of two psychiatrists, a clinical psychologist, a mental health social worker, an occupational therapist and two community psychiatric nurses. With the exception of the community psychiatric nurses, who would be civilians, it is intended that the other persons appointed would be commissioned as direct entry officers. Conditions governing the appointments of the commissioned military personnel to the mental health team have been drawn up and are under consideration at present.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	439	On 26 July the Minister for Defence announced the cessation of the early settlement scheme for hearing loss claims received after that date. Claims initiated on or before that date are still eligible for settlement under the scheme. The Minister is happy at the success of the scheme and the results achieved in settling 4,682 claims and he hopes that the vast majority of the outstanding claims will be settled in this way. Early settlement negotiations are ongoing in several hundred of the remaining 2,749 claims of which only 61 were received after July. However, the issue has been in the public domain now for over ten years and it is time it was brought to a conclusion.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	440	I propose to take Questions Nos. 95 and 101 together.A draft integrated personnel management system, or IPMS, has been prepared by the military authorities and is under consideration by the Department's civil-military strategic management committee. The new career development plan is to be encompassed by the IPMS. When the strategic management committee has completed its deliberations, it is expected that a further draft of the IPMS will be submitted to the Minister for his consideration. Before any final decisions are made, it is the Minister's stated intention that PDFORRA and the RACO will be consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation.The requirements which the IPMS must meet are set out in section 4.5 of the White Paper on Defence. In simple terms, the IPMS will deal with the broad range of personnel and human resource management and development issues. These include manpower policy and planning, equality of opportunity and treatment and the right to dignity at work, recruitment, terms of enlistment, induction, training education and development, physical and medical fitness, career guidance management and development, promotion, the regulatory framework, retirement, and pensions.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	441	The Public Service Benchmarking Body, PSBB, established under the PPF, issued its report on 1 July 2002. The body linked the implementation of the report's recommendations to public service modernisation. Under the terms of the adjustment to the PPF agreed with public service unions in December 2000, one quarter of recommended increases would be paid with effect from 1 December 2001. The PSBB recommended that payment of the balance of the increases should depend on the achievement of real and verifiable outputs from modernisation, change, adaptability and flexibility. Discussions between the employers and the unions on the implementation of the recommendations are ongoing, with particular emphasis on change, modernisation and verification. In conjunction with this process, parallel talks are being held with the Permanent Defence Force's representative associations, PDFORRA and the RACO on the implementation of the PSBB's recommendations. The Deputy will appreciate that it would be premature for the Minister to comment on the outcome of those discussions at this stage.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	442	The Minister referred the draft proposals of the Chief of Staff to the civil-military strategic management committee for its consideration. That process has concluded and it is expected that the Minister will make his decision in the matter shortly. The representative associations will be consulted in a spirit of partnership in accordance with the system of representation.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	443	The Government moved quickly and decisively to respond to the evolving international situation in the aftermath of the events of 11 September 2001. The Government's objective is to ensure that all State bodies can react quickly and efficiently to a large scale emergency. The Minister for Defence, as chair of the Government task force on emergency planning, intends that such responses would be characterised by effective management of all aspects of emergency planning and by a high level of public confidence in the response arrangements. The task force continues to meet regularly to review emergency planning and response issues and its role is to ensure a co-ordinated and effective response to large scale emergencies. The emergency planning office continues to provide a key support to the task force and co-ordinates the work of the interdepartmental working group on emergency planning to meet the new threats arising from international terrorism. The existing lead role of Departments and agencies in respect of specific emergency planning arrangements continues.There continues to be a high level of co-operation between the Department of Defence and all other Departments and agencies through the new structures. These arrangements have provided the fora to significantly enhance the emergency planning process within all Departments and agencies and have helped to improve public confidence in the emergency planning process. As chair of the Government task force, I recently presented an annual report to Government on the work carried out since September 2001. On behalf of the Government, I thank those who have been actively involved across a range of disciplines, Departments and agencies in supporting the work of the task force. I will continue to report regularly to Government and to this House on the progress being made in this area.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	444	The Irish Coast Guard of the Department of Communications Marine and Natural Resources has over -all responsibility for the provision of marine search and rescue services. The Air Corps currently provides search and rescue services off the north west coast, while Canadian Helicopters Corporation Ireland is contracted to provide search and rescue services for the rest of the country. The Minister for Defence is committed to maintaining the Air Corps' role in the provision of search and rescue services and in this regard, the Air Corps is in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the north west region, to replace the existing Dauphin helicopter. Pilot training on the S61 is ongoing and it is planned that the helicopter will go operational in early 2003.The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from Canadian Helicopters pursuant to existing search and rescue contracts and has been tasked to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by Canadian Helicopters. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport. A review of the provision of helicopters services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, is ongoing, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position. In this regard, an interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternate solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. The PPP unit in the Department of Finance is also involved in assessing possible solutions and this work is at an early stage.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	445	Three separate investigations were commenced into the circumstances of the death of Private Ó Flaithearta in a shooting incident in East Timor. The three investigations were conducted by the New Zealand military police, the Irish military police and the Irish Defence Forces court of inquiry. I understand from the military authorities that the New Zealand military police investigation, which arises because the Irish contingent which served in East Timor formed part of a New Zealand battalion, has been completed and is included in the Irish military police investigation report. In relation to the investigations of the Irish Defence Forces, both the Irish military police and the court of inquiry have completed their investigations and the findings of the court are currently with the deputy chief of staff (support), as convening authority, for his consideration.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	446	The Minister for Defence met representatives of the Community Games earlier this year in connection with their interest in securing a permanent home for the games at Gormanston. The position in relation to Gormanston Military Camp was explained to them. It has been decided to dispose of some land at Gormanston Camp, County Meath, to fund essential equipment purchases for the Defence Forces. The precise area to be put on the market has yet to be finally determined but the military camp comprising approximately 58 acres will be retained. When the lands become available for disposal they will, in the normal course, be offered for sale by public tender and the Community Games will have an opportunity of submitting a tender.As the matter of a venue for the Community Games is one for the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, he was apprised of the approach by the Community Games in this matter. The Minister was again approached in recent weeks by the Community Games regarding a venue for the National Community Games finals which he understands as referring to those being held in 2003. The matter will be considered taking account of the likely position obtaining at that time in relation to the proposed disposal of the Gormanston lands.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	448	The principal objective of this directive was the incorporation into law of the provisions of the 1996 World Intellectual Property Organisation copyright treaty and the performances and phonograms treaty. As the provisions of the WIPO treaties were given effect in Irish law through the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, we are already in substantial compliance with the directive. The manner of transposition of outstanding requirements of the directive is currently under examination by my Department, in consultation with the Office of the Attorney General. While legislation will be required, the question as to whether implementation of the directive may be effected by regulation rather than primary legislation is still under consideration.
#MichaelAhern	unknown-#MichaelAhern-party	unknown-#MichaelAhern-dob	unknown-#MichaelAhern-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	449	I propose to take Questions Nos. 106 and 110 together.While I have no plans to develop on-line arbitration systems or an on-line ombudsman at this time, a number of potentially important projects in this field are ongoing. The Arbitration (International Commercial) Act, 1998, has considerably enhanced Ireland's attractiveness as an international centre for commercial arbitration. The American Arbitration Association established an international centre for dispute resolution in Ireland in 2001. The centre is the international division of the association, which is the world's largest provider of conflict management and dispute resolution services.
#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	450	I agree that the Copyright and Related Rights Act, 2000, needs to be kept under review to take account of new developments in the media for the generation, storage and transmission of protected materials. I would point out, however, that in adopting technology non-specific language, and in its specific underpinning of protection for digital representations of protected materials, the Act does effectively cater for situations in which works are generated, stored or transmitted in the "new media". This approach is, in general, preferred to more technology-specific options, which, precisely because of their technology-specific nature, are likely to require more frequent updating.Regarding a possible review of certain criminal provisions of the Act, the present provisions reflect a particular view as to the level and type of protection to which rightsholders are entitled with reference, in particular, to relevant international law (the TRIPs Agreement in particular).As the Deputy may be aware, this issue was raised in the recent Forfás report – Legislating for Competitive Advantage in e-Business and Information and Communications Technologies. This report contained several proposals, addressed to a number of Ministers, and will require detailed examination in this context.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	454	The ministerial air transport service (MATS) is primarily provided by the Air Corps using a Gulfstream IV aircraft which can carry up to 14 passengers. A Beech Super King Air turboprop aircraft, which was purchased in 1980, is also made available in support of the service, mainly to a limited number of hub destinations in Europe. Outside of this, air taxis can be chartered if the GIV is unavailable (either for maintenance or on other ministerial flights). However, the use of Air Corps aircraft and the chartering of air taxis must be approved in advance by The Taoiseach.It is the case that, from time to time, when the MATS aircraft are not available, the CASA aircraft and Air Corps helicopters have been used where they are not already tasked for other duties and are available. However, such situations arise only very infrequently.The total cost of the GIV, including the cost of lease payments during the period December, 1991 to December, 2001 amounted to €44.06 million (inclusive of VAT). The cost of the Beech Super King Air, when purchased in 1980, was approximately €1 million. The cost of the two CASA aircraft, which are primarily tasked on a full-time basis to fisheries protection duties, was €55.3 million (inclusive of VAT), when they were purchase in 1994, of which €22.9 million was refunded by the EU.

The main recommendation contained in the report of the task force is that a statutory body should be established under the aegis of the Department of Defence to manage the Curragh, with the exception of the Curragh Camp. The necessary legislation to give effect to this, and to the other recommendations of the task force report is being prepared at present and it is expected that heads of Bills will shortly be submitted for the approval of Government.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	457	The Irish Coast Guard of the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources has overall responsibility for the provision of marine search and rescue services in this country. However, one of the roles of the Defence Forces, as set out in the White Paper, is to carry out duties in relation to search and rescue as may be assigned to them from time to time. In this regard, the Air Corps is engaged in providing SAR off the north west coast and is in the process of acquiring an S61 helicopter to operate in the north west region. The initial air crew training has been completed and the Air Corps is now engaged in working up for this operation. It is anticipated that this helicopter will go operational in early 2003. The S61 helicopter has been leased by the Irish Coast Guard from Canadian Helicopter Corporation Ireland Limited (CHCI) pursuant to existing SAR contracts and has been tasked by the Irish Coast Guard to the Air Corps. The Air Corps will provide the flight crews and the aircraft will be maintained by CHCI. The S61 will operate out of Sligo Airport.Assistance is also provided by the Naval Service and the Army on a case by case basis as the needs arises. The Civil Defence organisation, which is controlled at national level by my Department, provides assistance when requested by the Coast Guard or the Garda Síochána. Following the difficult decision to cancel the tender competition for the acquisition of medium lift helicopters for the Air Corps last June, I asked my officials to initiate a review of the provision of helicopter services, in conjunction with the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources, to determine how best to meet the State's obligations in search and rescue, while taking account of the current financial position. An interdepartmental working group has been established to seek alternative solutions to the funding issue, such as public private partnerships or leasing arrangements, with a view to providing helicopters for the Air Corps by other means. This work is at an early stage. Outside of this, there is no current planned capital expenditure on search and rescue services by my Department and, as such, the question of curtailment does not arise.
#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	458	I propose to take Questions Nos. 122 and 124 together.Ireland's approach to participation in PfP was set out in our presentation document of 1 December, 1999, which outlined our five priority areas of participation as:Co-operation on International Peacekeeping;Humanitarian Operations;Search and Rescue;Co-operation in the protection of the Environment; and,Co-operation in Marine Matters.Ireland's first individual partnership programme (IPP) covered the period up to 31 December 2001 and included some 89 activities, consisting mainly of training courses, seminars, conferences and table top exercises. Ireland's second IPP, covering the period 2002-03 was drawn up on the basis of experience gained with the initial IPP and it continues to give practical content to the overall priorities identified in the presentation document. This second IPP contains a total of 125 activities aimed at participation by the Defence Forces, Civil Defence, civil staffs from the Department of Defence, Department of Foreign Affairs, Department of Communication, Marine and Natural Resources and the Department of the Environment and Local Government. Participation in PfP activities is entirely voluntary and is based on the principle of self-differentation, that is, a state selects for itself the nature and scope of its participation and therefore has no bearing on Ireland's commitment to the EU headline goal. In accordance with this fundamental principle, all decisions regarding the content and form of the IPP for 2002-03 have been made by the Irish authorities. The details of the IPP activities for 2002-03 have been placed in the Oireachtas Library. The training opportunities provided by Ireland's participation in Partnership for Peace will further enhance the development of the Defence Forces consistent with the objectives of the Government White Paper on Defence published in February, 2000.

There is ongoing and close liaison between the Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces in relation to security matters. The Garda Síochána keeps security matters under intensive and continuous review and takes all appropriate operational measures available to deal with threats emanating from international terrorism. Disclosure of particular measures taken would, of course be counterproductive. I also understand that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be bringing forward legislative proposals as soon as possible aimed at countering international terrorism.

#MichaelSmith	unknown-#MichaelSmith-party	unknown-#MichaelSmith-dob	unknown-#MichaelSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	460	The White Paper on Defence of February 2000 provides for a total PDF strength of 10,500 personnel with an additional 250 recruits in training at any time. Under the terms of the Defence Forces review implementation plan of February 1996, a voluntary early retirement scheme operated in the years 1996-98. This scheme combined with natural wastage trends over the period in question has resulted in a net strength reduction of 1,084 personnel. The total strength on 30 September, 1997 was 11,547 (excluding cadets) and on 30 September, 2002 was 10,463 (excluding cadets).The strength of the Army, Air Corps and Naval Service, as at 30 September, 2002, broken down by rank and gender, is as outlined in the following tables:Strength of Females in the Defence Forces30 September, 2002.

#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	463	Local staffing issues in the farm development service office in Sligo have recently had some impact on the time taken to process REPS payment applications. My Department has taken steps, by way of overtime working and redeployment of staff from other offices, to ensure that as far as possible all applications are processed within the targets set out in the protocol on direct payments to farmers.
#JoeWalsh	unknown-#JoeWalsh-party	unknown-#JoeWalsh-dob	unknown-#JoeWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	464	The position with regard to the 2003 national reserve was that there were only 1,500 suckler cow premium rights available for distribution. Since demand for reserve quota exceeded that figure, there were not enough rights available to satisfy all applicants. Consequently, quota had to be distributed in accordance with the priorities laid down by the quota review group and EU regulations as follows: (i) 5% of the reserve had to be reserved for category B applicants – farmers with holdings on offshore islands; (ii) 10% of the reserve had to be reserved for category C applicants – organic farmers and (iii) the remaining quota was distributed to qualifying applicants under category A – first time applicants under 35 years of age who, under EU rules, had to be given priority. As a result there was no quota left to allocate to any applicant under category D, that is, farmers who required additional quota to ensure viability of their holding. Since the person named applied for an allocation of quota under category D, it was therefore not possible to allocate quota to him from the 2003 national reserve.The person named established a quota in 1995 by purchasing 16 premium rights. He retained those rights in 1996 and furthermore he was provisionally allocated ten premium rights from the national reserve at that time, bringing his quota to 26 for the 1996 scheme year. The allocation was made on the basis that he would use his entire quota in 1996 by applying for and qualifying for 1996 suckler cow premium in respect of 26 suckler cows. Since he applied for premium in respect of only 22 suckler cows, that provisional allocation of ten quota rights was reduced to six giving him a quota of 22 rights for 1996. While the person named had his herd restricted under the TB disease eradication scheme in 1996, under no circumstances can a farmer retain reserve suckler cow quota that he does not require to ensure payment of the suckler cow premium for the year in question.In 1998, the person named purchased 4.7 premium rights which leaves his quota since then at 26.7 premium rights.

It was a requirement for all applicants to the reserve that their off-farm income for the nine month period 6 April 2001 to 31 December 2001 must not exceed €9,525. The person named did not submit a certificate of income for the period in question. However he did submit a certificate of income for the year ended 5 April 2001 showing a yearly income of €21,148. If his income did not change for 2001 then his income on a pro rata basis for a nine-month period would be €15,861 which exceeds the €9,525 level laid down by the quota review group. In the circumstances, he does not qualify for an allocation of suckler cow quota from the 2003 national reserve. However, if the person named submits a certificate of income for the required nine month period in 2001, my Department will re-examine his application.

All the Departments and offices listed above have been notified of this date. Hence overtime claims notified to my Department by Monday, 25 November 2002 will be paid in 2002 on either 13 or 19-20 December. Any overtime notified after Monday, 25 November will be paid at the first opportunity in the new year. This has been the practice for the past number of years.One other effect of these early deadlines for the Christmas and new year holiday period is that weekly paid staff are paid in advance in December, that is, the payroll payments due on 20 December and 27 December will each be paid one week in advance.

The south Galway flooding steering group was set up in 2000 to examine the feasibility of these potential localised schemes. One of these schemes involving the construction of a zoned low permeability embankment dam at Lackan has been implemented under the Lackan – Ardrahan – certified drainage scheme. Another local scheme involved the construction of a number of culverts in the Kinvara area and this work has also been completed.Another of the potential localised alleviation schemes considered by the steering group was Cregaclare, flood protection embankment and drainage channel to the Aggard stream. The Aggard stream – Cregaclare – certified drainage scheme was publicly exhibited earlier this year from 19 February to 8 March and Office of Public Works is currently considering all observations which were received from concerned parties. All observations will be responded to and alterations to the scheme, if any, arising from these observations will be examined and costed. At that point, the scheme will be considered for submission to the Minister for Finance for confirmation.

The other five are Mozambique, Zambia, Tanzania, Uganda and Ethiopia. The greater part of the bilateral aid programme is concentrated on these six countries. In the case of each of them the scope and scale of Irish engagement is determined by a three-year strategy negotiated with the African partner government. In Lesotho's case a new strategy was negotiated with the Government earlier this year and covers Irish engagement for 2002, 2003 and 2004. The budget for 2002 is €10.040 million and the budget for 2003 will be finalised when the annual Estimates process is completed.Ireland Aid follows a programme approach in Lesotho and the other programme countries in which government systems are used to deliver services and implement development strategies. We also, of course, strongly support the work of NGOs in that country. The focus of the programme in Lesotho is on good governance, HIV-AIDS, primary education, basic health care, rural access and the provision of accessible and clean water. On the promotion of good governance, Ireland Aid is assisting the Government of Lesotho with electoral and parliamentary reform, and with helping to build the administrative capacity of the judiciary, police and prison service. HIV-AIDS is a key focus of the Irish programme across all of the countries in which it is involved. In Lesotho, Ireland Aid is assisting in the co-ordination of central government policy and assisting with creating a sensitivity to the pandemic across all government policies.On education, Ireland Aid is working with the Government in implementing one of the millennium development goals, the introduction of universal primary education, UPE. This was introduced three years ago and the Irish programme is assisting the government in the development of capacity as UPE works its way through the system – training teachers, building classrooms, providing textbooks, increasing the capability of the Ministry of Education, etc.On health care, Ireland Aid is working with the Ministry of Health on building community-based healthcare and on developing the capacity to formulate policy and manage programmes.Ireland Aid has a long history of working in remote areas of Lesotho on both the provision of safe and accessible water, which brings about significant improvements in the lifestyle of women and the health of children, and on building dirt roads and footbridges using local labour. This engagement is continuing apace.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	474	In 1994 Ireland agreed to start a bilateral aid programme in South Africa for a transitional period of ten years with the specific aim of assisting those disadvantaged by apartheid. The focus of the programme was on encouraging support for the democratic transformation in South Africa and addressing the issue of deep poverty.The review of the Irish programme completed earlier this year recommended a broadening and deepening of the Irish engagement in the country because of South Africa's pivotal importance to the development of the whole southern African region. As a result, the current three year strategy agreed with the South African Government, which guides the Ireland Aid engagement in the country for the period 2001 to 2003, will be reviewed early in 2003 when, in negotiation with the South African authorities, a newly focused plan will be developed to underpin a longer involvement. The current programme is focused on education, health, HIV-AIDS, water and sanitation, and the promotion of good governance, democracy and respect for human rights.The focus of the education programme is in Limpopo – formerly Northern – Province where support has been provided since 1998 to teacher training and development. Ireland Aid is also involved in a programme of democracy and human rights training in schools. To address the major skills gap, support is given to disadvantaged students through a bursary programme. Health support is focused on Free State Province and involves the upgrading of clinics and the training of health workers.

It was initially decided, in 1978, to open an aid office there but, at the request of the Lesotho authorities, it was agreed to designate that office as a consulate general. At that time, there were only two other diplomatic missions in Lesotho.The question of changing the status of the consulate general to that of an embassy or, alternatively, accrediting the Ambassador in Pretoria to Lesotho, while retaining the consulate general there, has been under consideration for some time. I hope to reach a decision on this shortly, taking all relevant factors into consideration.

Approximately one quarter of these projects are at an advanced stage of architectural planning.My Department has approved in excess of 50 major primary building projects to proceed to construction in 2002. In addition, more than 3,000 capital grants for primary schools have been sanctioned to date this year. Many of these grants were approved for minor construction works to school buildings. A devolved grant is also paid to all primary schools on an annual basis at the rate of €3,809 per school plus €12.70 per pupil to enable school authorities to undertake minor improvement works at a local level. The allocation for primary school buildings in 2002 is €172.6 million.

This arose because of the sheer volume of demand which has been falling on the special education section of my Department in recent times. Measures have recently been introduced to address these difficulties and I am confident such delays will not arise in the future.With regard to the child in question, I am somewhat concerned that the needs of this child do not appear to be adequately addressed notwithstanding my Department's allocation of resource teacher support to meet the child's needs. I am therefore arranging for a member of my Department's inspectorate to call to the school to investigate whether additional special support is required in this case and the form such support might take.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	486	The new programme, Giving Children An Even Break, was launched last year to deal with educational disadvantage in primary schools. The schools targeted under the programme were identified through a comprehensive and objective survey of all primary schools carried out in March-April 2000 by the Educational Research Centre, Drumcondra, on my Department's behalf.Giving Children an Even Break subsumes the previous process of designation of schools that serve areas of educational disadvantage. My Department's approach is now refined to ensure that the individual at risk pupils are targeted. Rather than the old method of designating additional schools, my Department now provides support that is commensurate with the levels of concentration in schools of pupils with characteristics that are associated with educational disadvantage and early school leaving. There are separate urban and rural dimensions to the programme. Schools categorised as urban with the highest concentrations of at risk pupils are being supported, where necessary, over the three year period through staff allocations to implement a pupil teacher ratio of 20:1 in the junior classes – infants through second class – and a pupil teacher ratio of 27:1 in senior classes – third through sixth classes.Schools participating in Giving Children An Even Break are eligible to receive a range of additional supports including teacher posts and financial supports to be targeted at disadvantaged pupils. The additional supports to be provided reflect the level of concentration of pupils from educationally disadvantaged backgrounds in each school invited to participate in the programme.

The number of mainstream posts sanctioned is determined by reference to a staffing schedule and is agreed for a particular year following discussions with the education partners. The enrolment of Sacred Heart National School on 30 September 2001 was 108 pupils, which warrants a staffing of a teaching principal and three mainstream class teachers for the 2002-03 school year. As the agreed appointment figure for the fourth mainstream class teacher is 116 pupils, I regret that there is no basis on which I may sanction an additional post at Sacred Heart National School for the 2002-03 school year.The Deputy may be aware that I recently established an independent appeals board to adjudicate on appeals from boards of management on mainstream staffing allocations in primary schools. The appeals board will operate independently of the Minister and the Department and its decision will be final.

Projects must be directly related to the provision of sport and recreation facilities and be of a capital nature which, for the purpose of the programme, is defined as expenditure on the improvement or construction of an asset, including any costs directly incurred in this process and purchase of permanently based sports equipment if it is securely housed and will remain in use for five years or more.The programme is advertised on an annual basis. The closing date for the receipt of completed applications under the 2002 programme was 4 January last and provisional grant allocations under the programme were announced on 29 March. All funding under the 2002 programme has been allocated. It will be open to the organisations in question to apply under the 2003 sports capital programme when it is advertised. Guidelines, terms and conditions for the programme will be issued with the application forms.The Irish Sports Council administers a special programme, Go for Life, to promote and facilitate the involvement of older people in sport and physical activity. The council also provides funding to the Bowling League of Ireland, the national governing body of the sport, towards its administrative and programme costs. Details of these programmes are available from the Irish Sports Council.

These, in order of progress, are preliminary report, contract documents, tender and construction. My Department's technical advisors at the Office of Public Works evaluate each stage and local authorities cannot proceed to the next stage of a project unless prior approval issues from my Department. Grant aid is allocated only when tenders have been approved for the project and will be capped at the time of allocation.Under the programme, grants of up to a maximum of €3,809,214 are available towards both the refurbishment of existing pools and the provision of new pools, subject in both cases to the total grant not exceeding 80% of the eligible cost of the project or, in the case of projects located in designated disadvantaged areas, 90% of the eligible cost. Priority is given to projects based in RAPID areas. Support is available towards the cost of the swimming pool, toddler pool, sauna and steam room.The preliminary report in respect of the pool in Tuam was approved in March 2002. My Department is currently awaiting the contract documents for the project to be submitted by Galway County Council. The proposal will be considered further on receipt of this documentation. Galway County Council has given no indication to date to my Department that it wished to provide a six-lane swimming pool in Tuam. Should it wish to do so, it should bear in mind that this will add to the cost of the project and that, as already pointed out, there is a maximum grant available from my Department and that the balance of the cost of the project will have to be met by the local authority. The dimensions of the standard pool, as outlined in my Department's procedures for the planning, approval and financing of swimming pools and technical guidelines, specify a length of 25 metres and a width of 9 metres. A pool of 9 metres width normally accommodates five swimming lanes.

The number of places available for sponsorship was based on the board's workforce planning projections for 2003-04. Selection for sponsorship was made on the basis of competitive interview. Successful candidates were then placed on a panel in order of merit. Unfortunately, the individual concerned did not obtain a sufficient ranking to qualify for sponsorship from the North-Western Health Board. The individual then made a decision to accept a place on the course and to self-sponsor despite having been informed that there would be no funding available from the North-Western Health Board.

In particular, the Commission raised the following issues with regard to the European Communities (Amendment of Cruelty to Animals Act, 1876) Regulations, 1994: the need for a definition of ‘experiment'; the designation of a national competent authority to authorise the setting free of animals; procedures for advance notification of experiments and of details of persons conducting such experiments; appropriate penalties for non-compliance with the directive. The new regulations, which are currently being finalised by my Department in conjunction with the office of the Attorney General, will fully address the issues raised by the Commission.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	509	Entitlement to health services in Ireland is primarily based on means. Under the Health Act, 1970, the determination of eligibility for medical cards is the responsibility of the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board other than for persons aged 70 years and over, who are automatically eligible for a medical card. Medical cards are issued to persons who, in the opinion of the chief executive officer, are unable to provide general practitioner medical and surgical services for themselves and their dependants without undue hardship. Income guidelines are drawn up to assist in the determination of a person's eligibility and these are revised annually in line with the consumer price index. However, the guidelines are not statutorily binding and even though a person's income exceeds the guidelines, a medical card may still be awarded if the chief executive officer considers that his or her medical needs or other circumstances would justify this. It is open to all persons to apply to the chief executive officer of the appropriate health board if they are unable to provide health services for themselves or their dependants without hardship.The issue of eligibility was considered in the context of the National Health Strategy, Quality and Fairness. In the strategy, the Government signalled its intention to extend medical card coverage with a focus on people with low incomes and families with children, particularly those with a disability. Any extension of medical card coverage would be decided by Government in the context of the prevailing budgetary situation and other competing priorities for public investment in health and other sectors.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	510	Since 1996, more than €103 million has been invested in the development of cancer services under the National Cancer Strategy. In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the National Health Strategy has identified the need for the preparation of a revised implementation plan for the National Cancer Strategy. This plan is being prepared by my Department in conjunction with the National Cancer Forum and will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years. As part of this work, a subgroup of the National Cancer Forum has recently been established on generic screening. This group is currently reviewing all issues relating to screening, including looking at specific diseases such as prostate and colorectal cancer. The group's recommendations will inform the development of the new National Cancer Strategy 2003.

The work, which includes the provision of additional resuscitation cubicles, the development of a chest pain assessment unit and the establishment of a minor injury unit, will significantly improve facilities in the emergency department and will also have knock-on benefits in relieving bed capacity pressure. It is estimated that the improvements will be completed within six to nine months. The extension and refurbishment of the Mater hospital accident and emergency department will be an interim measure pending the completion of the major redevelopment project, incorporating the transfer of services from the Children's Hospital, Temple Street, which is currently in progress on the Mater campus.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	515	Under the Health (Nursing Homes) Act, 1990, health boards provide subventions to assist persons in meeting the costs of nursing home care. However, it was never intended that subventions would meet the full costs involved. Apart from contracts entered into under article 22.3 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, which allows a health board enter into an arrangement with a private nursing home, the placement of a person in a private nursing home and the fees charged is a private arrangement between the nursing home and the individual resident.The Nursing Homes (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, are administered by the health boards and the Eastern Regional Health Authority. There are currently three maximum rates of subvention payable, €114.28, €152.37 and €190.46, in accordance with three levels of dependency, medium, high and maximum, which are eligible for subvention. The First Schedule of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, sets out the general rules to be followed by all health boards in assessing the level of dependency of an applicant for a nursing home subvention and the Second Schedule sets out the general rules to be followed in assessing the means of an applicant. "Means" for the purposes of these regulations are the income and the imputed value of assets of a person in respect of whom a subvention is being sought and the income and imputed income of his or her spouse. Means are assessed for this scheme to ensure that the available funding is directed at those older people who have the greatest need of financial assistance.A health board may pay more than the maximum rate of subvention relative to an individual's level of dependency, for example in cases where personal funds are exhausted. Articles 22.3 and 22.4 of the Nursing Home (Subvention) Regulations, 1993, permit health boards to contract beds in private nursing homes and to pay more than the maximum rates of subvention in such cases. However, the application of these provisions is a matter for the health board concerned in the context of meeting increasing demands for subventions within the board's revenue allocation as notified annually in the letters of determination. This is in keeping with the provisions of the Health (Amendment) (No. 3) Act, 1996.

In addition, such lamps must be fitted with a dipping device so that the beam of light from the lamp, when dipped, is incapable of dazzling a person more than 25 feet away from the lamp and in a specified position, which approximates to that of the driver of an oncoming vehicle. Exceptions to the dipping device requirement are made for direction indicators and for one or more other lamps with a combined maximum power output of seven watts. Dipped headlamps must be used when a vehicle is either passing another vehicle or travelling close behind one. Within this framework a maximum power rating is not specified for vehicle lights. The Garda is responsible for the enforcement of these regulations.Checks on headlamp alignment and condition are carried out as part of both the national car test and commercial vehicle testing scheme. Standards for lighting for new vehicles are specified in EU type approval law. These standards have been adopted at EU level following extensive consultation with vehicle and lighting manufacturing interests and with member states. All new cars sold in Ireland are required to meet the standards, which are also deemed to comply with national vehicle lighting law. Within this framework, gas discharge headlamps and other headlamps that contain inert gases such as halogen have been type approved in accordance with European Union law and are consequently in compliance with Irish lighting law.

The Act provided in particular that the power to determine what speed limits are to be applied at particular locations on roads is vested in local authorities. This power is exercised through by-laws made by local authorities following consultation with the Garda Síochána, and with the consent of the National Roads Authority in respect of national roads. In exercising this function, local authorities may only apply speed limits that are established either directly in the Road Traffic Act, 1994, or in regulations made by me under that Act. Responsibility for the provision and maintenance of traffic signs, including speed limit signage, on the national road network and the funding of these works is a matter for the National Roads Authority.

Sub-committees will be established on agreed themes which include awareness raising; youth and disability; rights, responsibilities and partnership and employment.The NDA will administer funding for activities in the year, including EU funding of approximately €255,000 and matching funding. The launch plan for the year is at an advanced stage and preparations are in train to develop a programme of events throughout the year. In advance of the national co-ordinating committee finalising the programme for the year and finalisation of the Estimates for 2003 in this area, it is not possible to indicate the total funding available at this stage.Key Departments, local authorities and vocational education committees have all been appraised of the objectives of the year and are invited to share their ideas with the national co-ordinating committee to maximise its impact. A number of initiatives are already under development. The Equality Authority has indicated it will place particular emphasis on employment and reasonable accommodation. A campaign bus will tour participating countries over the course of 2003 following an itinerary managed by the European Disability Federation. People with Disabilities in Ireland Limited will co-ordinate the tour in Ireland to coincide with planned events.My Department will also undertake a number of initiatives designed to highlight the aims of the year. This includes an exhibition entitled Design for All aimed at planners, designers and developers, as well as the general public, particularly those with disabilities with a view to promoting a more inclusive built environment. This exhibition was recently opened in the offices of the Office of Public Works on St. Stephen's Green and will tour the country over the next 14 months.PWDI is an independent body representing people with disabilities. My Department is also providing financial support to enable it to host a series of regional seminars and this month the theme is Youth – Beyond Disability. The seminars are designed to facilitate consultation with young persons with disabilities so that their aspirations and views can be captured.Everyone has a role to play in making Ireland's participation in the year memorable. My Department is currently embarking on an advertising campaign to promote it to the public.

At that time the progress report showed that 20% of the recommendations had been implemented and that progress had been made in relation to a further 66% of them. The report was a benchmarking exercise. It reflected the state of play with regard to the implementation of the commission's recommendations as at the date of its publication, namely, 13 December 1999. The positions given in the report are not immutable and substantial progress has been made since the publication.Over recent years the Government and the previous Government have continued to advance the equality agenda to improve the position of people with disabilities across a range of policy areas. My Department has been responsible for ensuring that the necessary legislative and infrastructural framework is in place to support this agenda.

In the context of the courts, they offer the potential to maximise operational efficiencies, reduce paper log-jams, assist in reducing court waiting times and generally provide an enhanced level of service to all court users.In February 2001 the Courts Service published its five year strategy for information technology entitled e-courts. The key strategic business objectives detailed in the plan include the delivery of a range of electronic court initiatives which reflect its commitment to participate in the Government's initiative for the delivery of electronic services.

A preliminary examination of the requirements to enable Ireland to ratify the convention has been carried out and that examination shows that some legislative changes will be required. The extent and scope of these changes is still being considered in my Department. It is expected that legislative proposals which will enable Ireland to ratify it will be brought to Government in the first half of 2003.

The need to review local electoral areas will also be considered at that stage. If a review of local constituencies is decided upon the Local Government Act, 2001, requires that the Local Government Commission be requested to prepare a report on the matter.
#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	537	The Local Government Act, 2001, is being implemented on a phased basis. To date about three quarters of its provisions have been commenced by way of a series of commencement orders. This is as part of a structured implementation programme as necessary regulations, circulars and other preparatory work is completed. This process will continue and the remaining provisions of the Act, including Part 8 dealing with local authority boundary alteration, will be brought into operation on foot of further commencement orders to be made over the coming months.Pending the coming into operation of Part 8 the current law on local authority boundary alteration set out in the Local Government Act, 1991, continues to apply.

In 1999 and 2000, greenhouse gas emissions as reported by the EPA to the United Nations Framework Convention Secretariat and to the European Commission were 65.9 and 67.0 Mt CO2 equivalent respectively. Preliminary data for 2001 are being prepared by the EPA and, subject to finalisation following complete analysis, indicate a further increase in emissions. Preparation of 2002 data will begin following completion of the 2001 exercise. The sectoral data are set out in the following table:

The LEADER group was assigned an amount of €4,956,000 as public funding for the period to 2006.The main challenge of LEADER in Galway east is to address the fundamental need for employment and income outside agriculture. The programme is designed to promote community development as a basis for revitalisation of rural life in the county.Under the CLÁR programme, priority investments, as identified by the communities in all CLÁR areas, cover infrastructure, social and community services and are being dealt with under the following measures:– Non-National Roads– Class 111 Roads– L.I.S. Roads– Group Water Schemes– Group Sewerage Schemes– Small Public Water Schemes– Urban Enhancement Scheme– Village Enhancement Scheme– Bi-lingual Signage Scheme– Sports Capital Grant Scheme– Major and Minor Capital Health Projects– Telecommunications– Islands– 3-Phase electricity for small industries– Gaeltacht Top-Ups for Sports & Community Facilities– Community Initiatives of a Capital Nature.To date, I have committed €22.7 million to these measures, which are already under way or will commence in 2003.Other measures may be introduced later, depending on needs identified.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	544	Under the treatment benefits scheme insured persons and their dependent spouses can avail of benefit in respect of a certain range of dental, optical and aural services subject to satisfying certain PRSI contribution conditions. In the case of hearing aids, my Department pays half the cost subject to a maximum of €350 per hearing aid. The operation of the scheme is subject to ongoing monitoring by my Department.An increase to the maximum payment available for hearing aids under the scheme would have financial implications and would be a matter for consideration within the constraints of budgetary policy.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	545	I propose to take Questions Nos. 234 and 235 together.In general, pay related social insurance contributions are made by employers, employees and the self employed. The rate of contribution depends on the class of social insurance applicable which in turn determines the range of benefits to which contributors may, in due course, become entitled.Permanent and pensionable public servants employed before April 1995 are liable for Class D contributions. Class D contributors are insured for a limited range of social insurance benefits and the level of benefits available broadly reflects the level of contribution paid. It does not include cover for contributory old age or retirement pension.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	546	The free travel scheme is available to all people living in the State aged 66 years, or over, to all carers in receipt of carer's allowance and to carers of people in receipt of constant attendance or prescribed relative's allowance.The free travel scheme is also available to people under age 66 who are in receipt of certain disability type welfare payments, such as disability allowance, invalidity pension and blind person's pension. People who live in health board approved residential care who were previously receiving disability allowance from my Department or disabled person's maintenance allowance from a health board are also entitled to a free travel pass.The free schemes, including the free travel scheme, are highly valued and there are ongoing demands to make them available to other categories of people.Extending the schemes to people who are under 66 years of age and who do not have an attachment to a designated scheme within the social welfare system would have major implications for this set of schemes, the cost of which could only be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	547	The living alone allowance is an additional payment of €7.70 per week, to people who are in receipt of certain social welfare type payments and who reside alone. It is not a payment in its own right but an allowance which can only be paid as a supplement to an Irish social welfare payment. As such, it cannot be paid to people without a social welfare entitlement or to those whose pension payments are made under the social security regimes of other countries.Proposals by the Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament for increased payments and changes in eligibility conditions would have to be considered in a budgetary context.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-11-06 00:00:00	Prelude	548	The Irish Senior Citizens' Parliament has made a wide ranging submission in relation to surviving spouses covering income tax, child care training and social welfare payments. The position in relation to social welfare support for the group in question is as follows.The Government is committed to bringing the maximum rate of the widow-er's contributory pension for those over 66 years of age into line with that of the old age contributory pension, which now stands at €147.30 per week. Considerable progress has already been made in this regard over recent budgets. In the last budget, the widow-er's contributory pension rate for those aged over 66 was increased by €15.29 to €144.80 per week, i.e. €2.50 short of the target rate. Further developments in relation to payment rates for surviving spouses will be in line with overall targets contained in An Agreed Programme for Government for pensions and social welfare payments generally.
