I seek the Minister's views on the matter. I imagine Deputy Tóibín would agree with me in respect of my next question. With leniency from the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, I call on the Minister to update the House on the current situation at Bausch and Lomb. We have sought to raise this as a matter - I can speak for Deputy Tóibín - as a matter for the Topical Issue debate. We have applied again today but we have been unsuccessful. Will the Minister outline his involvement, his knowledge of the situation and when he became aware of it?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	We have made significant gains over the past two years and employment has now grown on an annual basis for six quarters in succession. By comparison, when this Government came into office the economy was losing an average of 1,600 jobs per week. Furthermore, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate has fallen from 15.1% at the start of 2012 to 12% in 2014. The quarterly national household survey headline figures show an annual increase of 42,700 people in employment in the 12 months ending in the first quarter of 2014. On a seasonally adjusted basis, employment in the first quarter of 2014 increased by 1,700 on the previous quarter. This represents a year-on-year increase of 2.3% in the number of people in employment and the highest percentage increase in employment in quarter one since 2007. Many indicators give grounds for confidence that job growth can be sustained. Nevertheless, the first quarter figures are a reminder that we need to work relentlessly to improve our competitiveness, increase productivity and develop sectoral opportunities where Ireland has particular strengths. We are doing this through the Action Plan for Jobs process, which this year places a particular focus on supporting entrepreneurship, manufacturing and strengthening our platform overseas for winning new business. The 2014 Action Plan for Jobs includes targets for the IDA Ireland, Enterprise Ireland and the new local enterprise offices to support a total of 30,500 direct new jobs during 2014. At this point in the year the indications are that these targets are on track. The work of the enterprise agencies will be supplemented by our efforts to support the recovery of the domestic economy in areas such as construction, retail and tourism. The action plan has also placed a strong emphasis on yielding job gains through new disruptive reforms introduced in 2014 and, as I have already mentioned, entrepreneurship, winning abroad and a national step-change in manufacturing. The Government recently published a new strategy for the construction sector and we are reviewing our national tourism policy following a public consultation process. The new retail consultation forum has been established and will hold its inaugural meeting next week.

It shows a particularly big hit for those aged under 35 years and the lowest age cohort. The Minister referred to retail. Fully 5,000 jobs were lost in retail in the first quarter. I got a sense during the election campaign - it was one of the lessons and was evident in the feedback - that despite all the talk of economic recovery, it is not being felt. The notion of more self-employed people has far more to do with a quirk in and a consequence of social welfare legislation than people actually setting up their own business. People are classifying themselves as self-employed to try to get benefits because the system is forcing them to do so. That is where the growth is coming from. When we speak to people away from the spin, action plans and task forces we can see that people are suffering the consequences of unemployment and they do not see these jobs or any job creation. The quarterly household survey is the broadest measure and shows that the reality is also relevant to that survey. Did the survey act as a wake-up call to the Department, the Minister and his colleagues in government? I realise it came on a day when people were distracted with other news and in that context I wish the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, every success in his quest for a new job. I remind the Minister that we asked about Bausch and Lomb as well.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	3	I assure Deputy Calleary that neither I nor my Department needs any wake-up call in terms of the scale of the employment challenge we face. One of the features of our work has been to systematically engage an all-of-Government focus on this singular national challenge. Let us consider the performance to date. We have in the past 18 months seen 70,000 extra people at work, the vast majority of whom are in full-time jobs. That puts us at the top of the OECD league in terms of jobs growth. Certainly, it is not enough to impact on the scale of the problems we face. I agree with the Deputy when he says that people do not yet feel the impact of this change. I agree that we need to continuously challenge the way in which we approach development in the jobs area. That is one of the merits of the Action Plan for Jobs process, in that every year we expose it to public consultation and every year we initiate new actions to respond to the challenges that different sectors are experiencing. On the positive side, we should recognise that various surveys of business confidence, business intention and order books show that there is still a positive direction in growth. We believe we can build on that positive thrust.

The difficulty is that people are getting very frustrated when they continue to read about it. There is also difficulty when the chief executive of a job creation agency, a man for whom I have a good deal of regard and an organisation for which I have superb regard, comes out as a rallying agent for pay and wage reductions. That represents money that will be taken out of the domestic economy. It will affect the jobs we are talking about, such as those in retail and services. Furthermore, it will affect the ability of Waterford to ride this wave of confidence of which the Minister speaks. When the chief executive of a State-funded agency is acting with a rallying call for that kind of decision being taken by corporate companies, it sends a rather poor message.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	The chief executive of any State agency must respond to the challenges that he experiences. I do not seek to control or influence that. We need to have people speaking honestly to power, as has been said often. Clearly, we need to improve our competitiveness all the time.This is not an optional add-on. We are competing in a tough global environment but this year we have put new people into the field in overseas markets through the IDA and Enterprise Ireland. We are on a journey to move away from an economy that became too dependent on property, which was underpinned by bad policies. It will take time for new policies to deliver results. The 70,000 jobs represents genuine progress and we want to build on it. I have set a target of 100,000 extra people at work by 2016.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	The question is in a similar vein. Over the past number of weeks, the Labour Party has said that 60,000 new jobs have been created and the Minister of State, Deputy Fergus O'Dowd, referred to 5,000 jobs every week being created. The reality is shockingly different. The job creation tentatively experienced last year has ground to a halt and a number of sectors are under fierce pressure. The question is how the Government seeks to reverse it.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	The question as tabled relates to the wholesale and retail sector. The latest quarterly national household survey published by the CSO on 26 May showed that the number of people employed in the wholesale and retail sector fell by 2,200 in the first quarter of this year. We acknowledge that fall. It is a very diverse sector and it appears the experience is different in different parts. In April, overall, the volumes and value of retail sales were up by 6.8% and 4.4% on the same period last year. Growth was concentrated in the motor, furniture, clothing, hardware and electrical sectors. By contrast, declines were recorded in the volume of activity in groceries, books and newspapers, and pharmacies.  Structural changes, such as trading online, are occurring in the sector and are undoubtedly playing a role. On the other hand, an increase in the KBC-ESRI consumer sentiment index for April, which put Irish consumer sentiment at its strongest level since January 2007, is encouraging. However, the key challenge is to translate these improvements into jobs in the retail sector.  This year’s Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of measures to support the retail sector. These measures include the establishment of a retail consultation forum to provide a platform for a structured engagement between the retail sector and relevant Departments and Government agencies. Its purpose is to allow key issues of relevance to the sector to be discussed, with a view to identifying practical actions which could be taken by the Government, or by industry itself, to support the sector. The first meeting of the forum will take place on 9 June.  The Action Plan for Jobs also includes measures to address issues that impact on cost competitiveness in the sector, the introduction of a number of structural measures to support the retail sector, and the continuation of the online trading initiative and the integrated licensing application system for the retail sector.

Until now, the retail industry has been the forgotten sector of society. Some 250,000 people work in it and it has lost 50,000 jobs in the past few years. It is the weathervane of the economy and it is very sensitive to expectations. I spoke to retailers who say that when the Government talks about cuts, property taxes and budgets, there is a fall in retail sales. With the property tax, it was evident. Retailers also tell me that all the talk about the water tax has lowered people's expectations of the level of disposable income they will have in the future, which leads to them changing their behaviour and their spending. There is a resultant effect of lowering jobs in the retail industry. If a policy has the effect of losing jobs in a specific area, it is an anti-jobs policy. Is the water charge not an anti-jobs policy? How will the Government, after listening to the election and the problems people have with water charges and the difficulty within the retail industry, ameliorate the issue?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	We must acknowledge that Irish shoppers spent €3.8 billion in online trading in 2012. Some 75% of the revenue goes outside the State. While I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy, we must tackle this through Deputy Tóibín's committee, which will do some work on town centre planning. If we are talking about retailers, which he mentioned, it is a question of how town centres are structured and how we encourage greater trading. I am sure the work of the Deputy's committee will feed into the retail consultation forum. It is important to state that the retail consultation forum comprises retail Retail Ireland, Retail Excellence Ireland, RGDATA, Chambers Ireland, the Small Firms Association and individual retail practitioners. Through that consultation process, we will address issues like town centre shopping, e-commerce, driving more business online from Irish retailers, and the cost to business of retail. There are specific issues in the grocery sector that require to be addressed. We must look at budget 2015 to see if there is any way of enhancing demand through the process. We must also look at the Action Plan for Jobs 2015, the home renovation incentive scheme and the impact of the 9% VAT rate.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I would like to focus the attention of the Minister of State on the accuracy of the figures. I raised this point in the first part of the question. The CSO figures released at the end of last month suggest the increase in employment was not as great as had been stated in March. A number of times, we have seen contradictory figures. Professor John FitzGerald of the ESRI said that this was the first time in 60 years that reliable sectoral employment figures are not available and that unfortunately this was happening just as we are experiencing major problems in a range of other data. That leaves the problem of the system being incorrect or the figures being massaged. The shocking truth is that three years into this Government we have figures that are hard to analyse, volatile jobs figures and where there are trends in job creation, they are, at best, anaemic. I would like to hear the views of the Minister of State. I am sure it is hard for him and his Department to analyse the effectiveness of policy when the sectoral information is, in many cases, untrue.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	The question tabled by the Deputy concerned the wholesale and retail sectors and I am confident that, through a process of consultation involving all the stakeholders, thorough engagement and giving effect to many initiatives that arise from the retail consultation forum, we can work towards increasing the number of people employed in the retail sector. We wholeheartedly acknowledge that, year-on-year between 2013 and 2014, there has been a drop of 5,900 in the number of people employed in the sectors. We must do something to address that decline and the decline of our towns through the doughnut effect. The Deputy referred to the retailers he is meeting and the level of confidence. Through engaging with those retailers and their representative organisations, we can arrest the decline. I am confident that, once the process starts on 9 June, we will take action.

We have been trying to raise the matter but it was too late to table a question for this morning's business. It is a serious industrial issue and perhaps the Minister can update the Chamber. With regard to the credit guarantee scheme, this is the baby of the Minister and he knows it is not working. It will take 48 years to reach the target on the basis of the current roll-out.It is indicated in the legislative programme that amending legislation is intended. Can the Minister provide us with a flavour of that legislation and the changes it will involve?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	I am quite happy to update the House on the situation in Bausch and Lomb, but I am not sure it is in order.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	I replied on an Adjournment matter in the Seanad last night. There is no reluctance on my part to respond. I have met Deputies and have been trying to accommodate the House. The SME credit guarantee scheme, or CGS, was established under the Credit Guarantee Act 2012 to address specific market failures in lending to SMEs and in response to calls from business interests. It is a novel scheme in an Irish context and is continuing to develop a position in the Irish financial arena. My Department, the CGS operator, Capita, and participating lenders have committed significant time and resources to the establishment and operation of the scheme. While demand for the scheme has been lower than anticipated, the figures as at 31 March 2014 show that it has nevertheless supported additional lending of some €11.7 million to 89 enterprises and supported 479 new jobs, while maintaining 255 jobs. This is lending and employment which would not be in place had the scheme not been implemented. The recently completed review of the scheme has recommended some changes which should lead to increased take-up. We are nearing completion of the review process, having consulted widely with stakeholders on the proposed changes. I will shortly bring a memorandum to Government seeking approval to amend the Credit Guarantee Act. I am confident that the necessary legislative amendments will be made by the Oireachtas in the coming months with a view to the earliest possible implementation of the necessary changes.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	We have been pointing out the difficulties with this programme for some time. The Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is currently discussing SME financing and had the pillar banks in a couple of weeks ago. We got the sense that this was an add-on and that the credit guarantee scheme was not being taken seriously. This was something that was there but the banks were not pushed by it. When one looks at the target announced in October 2012, it was €450 million over three years. We have got to €11.6 million since then. All the indications are that the scheme is not working and no amount of tweaking will change it. It sends a bad message about the new State investment bank announced in the run-up to the local elections. Does the Minister see the legislation being introduced before the recess? What was the flavour of the review? What weaknesses and difficulties were identified which will be reflected in the legislation?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I am happy to discuss this further with the joint committee. To be fair, this was something that was considered in the Department during the term of the previous Government and not implemented. We decided to take it on. It is novel. The changes people have spoken of involve looking at the range of lending products the scheme covers, the range of lenders who can participate, the duration of loans, the level of loans and the caps that operate. Those are the sort of changes that are being considered. I look at the experience of other countries with these schemes and they have had difficulties in implementing them. We are not alone in finding it difficult to roll out successful schemes of this nature. We are seeking, however, to improve it. It is fulfilling an important requirement and if we can expand it to make a greater impact, my ambition will be fulfilled. For those who have benefited, it has been useful.
#DaraCalleary	unknown-#DaraCalleary-party	unknown-#DaraCalleary-dob	unknown-#DaraCalleary-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I have no doubt people have benefited, but €450 million has been budgeted for the scheme. Another scheme I have pointed out to the Minister, which has the support of the joint committee and of many Members in the House, involves crowd or source financing. We have been encouraging the Minister to put a pilot scheme in place. Surely, money is going to waste while we wait for a review of the scheme. As it cannot now deliver €450 million, it would be sensible to put a source financing pilot scheme in place using some of the money from the credit guarantee scheme. That would probably have a greater impact on job creation and enterprise development.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	The budget in this regard is in respect of losses that might be incurred. We have not budgeted for the lending by the banks. We have budgeted for losses which might have to be met. Crowd-funded financing is certainly worth looking at. I understand the scale at the moment would be tiny, however, and much tinier in any event than the credit guarantee scheme. While there is merit and the matter is being examined in the context of the review of various seed capital and other schemes by the Department of Finance and my Department, we need to see many different instruments. We have been too reliant on a very narrow range of banking products and need to see a broader range of instruments to support business start-up and growth. Crowd funding can have a place in that.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	The question relates to the development of a framework for a regional development strategy and asks when the strategy will be finalised given its value for sustainable regional development.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	Economic success at regional level depends on all relevant Departments, agencies, and regional and local authorities collectively making strategic choices and working together with community and private sector interests to activate the key strengths of each region. In 2013, there was employment growth shown in all regions. The Action Plan for Jobs includes a commitment to develop a framework for a regional enterprise strategy to better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises. The aim is to build on the competitive strengths of the regions and the matters the Deputy referred to in his question, including language strengths, can be addressed. My intention is that the framework will be developed on a pilot basis initially in the midlands region, focusing, in particular, on co-ordinating the efforts of the agencies under the remit of my own Department. These include Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and the new local enterprise offices, or LEOs. The overarching objective of the framework is to enhance synergies between the agencies, their client companies and other key stakeholders to maximise the potential for job creation in the region. The pilot framework will identify the key assets and competitive strengths of the midlands region and look at opportunities for sectoral development. My Department’s officials are currently developing the regional enterprise strategy framework in collaboration with Enterprise Ireland, IDA Ireland and Forfás. I expect significant progress to be made by the end of this month. My aim is that the pilot framework for the midlands will serve as a model for other regions. In addition to the regional enterprise strategy framework, the Action Plan for Jobs includes a number of other measures to be taken in 2014 to support competitive regions. For example, each local enterprise office shall publish its enterprise plan and the IDA will commence building new advanced manufacturing facilities in Waterford and Athlone and office space in Letterkenny to help cater for FDI projects. The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government will develop integrated plans to promote economic and community development in each local authority area. LEOs are implementing a competition to find Ireland's best young entrepreneur at county and national level. In addition, many actions under the entrepreneurship pillar of the Action Plan for Jobs, such as Enterprise Ireland's competitive regional feasibility funds, will support enterprise development and job growth at regional level.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I thank the Minister for his reply. There are a number of aspects to this matter, one of which involves the IDA and the development of one region, as the Minister said. SMEs are also very important and the backbone of the rural economy. The Office of Government Procurement is involved in promoting what is available for SMEs in terms of public procurement not only here, but across the EU. There is approximately €2.4 trillion worth of EU tendering available. Does the Minister's Department liaise with the Office of Government Procurement on that? Will the planned socio-economic committees under local authorities be involved with the Leader elements of the rural development programme to progress regional development? In the context of working with the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, I note that broadband was an issue that came up continually during the recent canvassing and it was raised in regard to both businesses and households.It was outlined in the recent CEDRA report chaired by Pat Spillane. Will there be liaison with that Department as well?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	Our agencies support companies in accessing public procurement tenders. Both EI and InterTradeIreland have good programmes to support companies in preparing themselves to bid for public procurement contracts either at home or abroad. It is on supporting the enterprise side that we operate. The idea behind developing a regional enterprise strategy is to make sure that there is knowledge across all the stakeholders who can help build a competitive advantage in a region using the thinking of the IDA, EI and LEOs and identify a sector's strengths and what we are hoping to build on. The Rural Development Programme 2014-2020 will be rolled out under Leader companies. We do not seek to usurp to work they do but we need to have clear vision among all stakeholders about where the opportunities are and how we will develop them because that will give an opportunity to others to provide support. Clearly, the education sector in many regions plays a huge part. If it can build networks to support a particular sectoral project in a region where we are building to its strengths, that could immensely enhance the work of IDA and EI in delivering its sectoral ambitions. That is the type of collaboration we are seeking to develop.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	In the three years before the Government came into office, more than 300,000 jobs had been lost across the economy. The construction, retail and tourism sectors were particularly badly hit and collectively accounted for over two thirds of the job losses. Almost 150,000 jobs were lost in the construction sector alone between the beginning of 2008 and the beginning of 2011. In 2012, the Government introduced the Action Plan for Jobs as the main policy instrument to tackle the employment crisis and to assist job creation. Now in its third annual iteration, the action plan has set about transforming the operating environment for businesses by seeking to identify and remove barriers to competitiveness and by placing employment on the agenda of every Department. The latest employment figures published by the Central Statistics Office show there was an increase of 42,700 people in employment in the first quarter of 2014, compared to the first quarter of 2013. There was an increase of 63,200 in the numbers in employment in the last two years. These figures are net of reductions in public sector numbers. More than 67% of the jobs created since 2012 have been full time. In the last six months, almost all the jobs created in the economy were full time. The sectors that have consistently performed well are agriculture, food and fishing, accommodation and food services, tourism and professional, scientific and technical activities. These sectors have been the focus for attention under the Action Plan for Jobs. In 2013, Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland client companies had record years for employment creation, generating a total of 12,500 net new jobs in export-focused activities. These patterns suggest the jobs being created are adding value to the economy and have every potential to be sustainable. However, we must continue to focus on sectors that did not experience a jobs recovery over the past two years. The wholesale and retail sector, which we discussed earlier, continues to suffer job losses, while the pattern is similar in the construction sector. There are moves to intervene in both sectors.

The factory had been operating for almost 40 years, with some employees having worked there for the entire time. They were a wonderful staff and it was a huge blow to the eastern part of south Tipperary, where there is no industry whatsoever. How is the task force progressing? Has it met other agencies and interested parties?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	33	I understand from EI that it has been actively promoting the site concerned to a number of interested parties. I am not in a position to disclose the details of those interactions for commercially sensitive reasons. However, task forces have been used in the past as part of a response to a sudden loss of a large number of industrial jobs. More recently, other initiatives are increasingly used as an alternative to task forces. In this regard, the establishment of LEOs, recently announced by Government, means that all categories of business, including sole traders, micro businesses and SMEs have access to Government supports and advice. The LEO is the first-stop shop for anyone seeking information and support on starting or enhancing a business. The active promotion of the site is taking place. EI is actively engaged in seeking to ensure the jobs that were lost are replaced.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I acknowledge the sensitivities of negotiations and so on. However, I am seeking clarity about the make-up of the task force. The Minister of State mentioned EI. What other agencies are represented on it? It is almost a year since the factory closed. The Queally family gave wonderful service and they did their best but the factory was not viable, which is sad. I asked Coolmore representatives at the time if they would be interested because they are the only employer in the area of note. I take on board what the Minister of State said about the county enterprise boards and LEOs but I do not know whether the LEO in Tipperary is properly constituted yet. Will they be similar to Leader companies, which we are debating on Private Members' business?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	35	I acknowledge the points made by the Deputy in regard to the effect of the loss of a company like this to a town like Fethard. In south Tipperary, where Enterprise Ireland is the lead agency in efforts to ensure we replace and create jobs, there are 76 client companies employing more than 2,000 people in full-time jobs. These are the figures for 2013. In excess of €9 million worth of grants has been paid to client companies since 2011. I assure the Deputy that Enterprise Ireland is working actively as the representative State agency in seeking to ensure we can replace the jobs that have been lost. It is actively promoting the site to a number of interested parties as we speak.
#MattieMcGrath	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-party	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-dob	unknown-#MattieMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	36	The Minister of State has still not provided clarity on the task force. Much was made of the task force by a local Minister of State at the time, Deputy Tom Hayes, and we all welcomed it. I want to know if there is meat on the bones of this. Is there a task force or is there not? Will the task force meet the newly elected councillors for the area, including Councillor Kieran Bourke, who was mayor at the time and worked hard on this issue? Will some Members of the Oireachtas and local representatives from the area meet interested people from the town of Fethard and the factory?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	As far as I am aware, there is no formal task force working on this, such as the task force for the south east where all the agencies are working together. I assure the Deputy, however, that the local agencies are working together. Enterprise Ireland is the pre-eminent State agency and it is working proactively on this. It is promoting the site to a number of interested parties. I ask the Deputy to allow that process to take shape. I am sure he will acknowledge that Enterprise Ireland is working with interested parties to seek to replace the jobs that have been lost.

While I was listening to the speakers, I realised the Government is not friendly towards workers at all and those who thought that voting for Labour would take the extreme edges off Fine Gael have been sorely disappointed with regard to collective bargaining, which is a human right and is included in the programme for Government. Will the Government be clear about introducing collective bargaining?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	I do not know whether the Deputy wants me to address the question he has just asked or the one he submitted. The Government has responded to the needs of workers in many ways. We increased the minimum wage, introduced protections for agency workers and restored the system of wage setting for vulnerable workers that had been ruled unconstitutional by the courts. We continue to develop good labour relations legislation and will soon publish the WRC, workers rehabilitation and compensation Bill, a major reform which will deliver better conditions for both workers and employers. I do not accept, therefore, the premise of the Deputy's preamble to his question. On 13 September last, I obtained Cabinet approval to develop legislative proposals to reform the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001 to provide for an improved and modernised industrial relations framework that will provide more clarity for employers and more effectiveness for workers in employment where collective bargaining does not take place. When enacted, this legislation will mark the fulfilment of the commitment in the programme for Government to reform the current law on employees' right to engage in collective bargaining to ensure compliance by the State with recent judgments of the European Court of Human Rights. The legislation will provide a clear and balanced mechanism by which the fairness of the employment conditions of workers in their totality can be assessed where collective bargaining does not take place. It will provide clarity and certainty for employers in managing their workplaces over the years ahead. It will also explicitly prohibit the use of inducements by employers to persuade employees to forgo collective bargaining representation and will provide strong protections for workers who invoke the provisions of the 2001 to 2004 Acts or who have acted as a witness or a comparator for the purposes of those Acts. The proposals are derived from a lengthy consultation process involving extensive engagement with stakeholders with a view to arriving at broadly acceptable proposals that will operate effectively in practice. The proposals have been welcomed by stakeholders such as IBEC and ICTU. They will ensure the retention of our voluntary system of industrial relations, but also ensure workers have confidence that, where there is no collective bargaining, they have an effective system that ensures they can air problems about remuneration, terms and conditions and have these determined based on those in similar companies and not be victimised for doing so.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	I tabled the Protection of Employees (Amendment) Bill in 2012, but Labour and Fine Gael voted against it. This Bill would have prevented the situation we now have in regard to the Paris Bakery. Under the current Government, we have seen an increase in part-time, short-term and zero hours contracts and seen a reduction in Sunday premiums. Workers, therefore, have suffered under the Government. I note the Minister's promised reform on the Industrial Relations (Amendment) Act 2001, but the proposal is convoluted. The concern is that if the legislation does not require employers to recognise trade unions, it will not deliver in regard to Ireland's international commitments or the programme for Government. If we do not have union recognition, we do not have collective bargaining. It is as simple as that. Does the Minister intend to retain the voluntary system of industrial relations? If so, he is reneging on the commitment in the programme for Government. Workers deserve better. They should not have to jump through hoops to get to lengthy procedures. They should not have to stage sit-ins in the likes of the Paris Bakery, Vita Cortex, Lagan Bricks or any other company. These are outstanding issues that could be resolved if the Government grasped the opportunity facing it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	What is happening here is that we are respecting the voluntary system which has been important and successful in Ireland. However, where a company chooses not to engage in collective bargaining, we are providing a mechanism whereby workers can ensure they will not be victimised as a result of that practice and they can take their case under these Acts. This will provide clarity and provide clear definitions for accepted bodies, the bodies that constitute collective bargaining. There have been disputes as to whether these accepted bodies are genuinely independent and the legislation will clarify that. It will also protect workers from victimisation and ensure that only trade unions can take action under this measure. It also prohibits inducements, which have been found in conflict under the Wilson case. Our approach is entirely in line with our obligations under the various legal judgments.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	42	The key or crux is that if it is a voluntary system, we do not have collective bargaining. If, instead of having a voluntary system, the Minister is just substituting a convoluted, complex legal process through which workers are forced to use the courts to try to grab back their rights, this makes it more difficult for workers to ensure their rights are upheld. In all of this, there must be a fair balance between workers' and employers' rights. However, providing a voluntary system where employers can make the decision on whom they will negotiate with negates the heart of collective bargaining and of all the decisions taken by the International Labour Organization, the European Court of Human Rights, the Universal Declaration of Human Rights and the Constitution. All of these documents point to freedom of association, people being able to represent themselves as workers, and employers' recognition of workers in those efforts.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	The Constitution of course respects freedom of association, but it also respects the voluntary nature of these processes. The Deputy will be aware that our system has been examined by the ILO and found to be in conformity with the requirements. I agree with the Deputy that this is a balanced approach and that it does not fulfil all of the ambitions of either the employers' groups or the workers' groups. My officials and I have engaged over a lengthy time with both sides to find a solution that is fair and balanced. That is what we are delivering. It is not possible for a solution to suit only one side or the other. What is arrived at must be a balanced measure, which is what we have delivered.

I would like the Minister to outline his policies for the creation of rural industry and to say whether he believes it is not possible to create industry in rural Ireland.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	The Action Plan for Jobs is the Government's key policy instrument to assist job creation. Its aim is to support enterprises to create employment throughout the whole of the country and in all regions. The creation of jobs in rural areas in particular can be supported by strong co-ordinated policies at regional level across all of the relevant State bodies, working together with local stakeholders. The Deputy will be aware that in 2013 there was employment growth in all regions. In this context, the Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures to be taken in 2014 to support competitive regions. These include a commitment to develop a framework for a regional enterprise strategy, which will better integrate the efforts of the enterprise development agencies and other regional stakeholders in supporting enterprises.  A core element of the Action Plan for Jobs has been the reform of the system for delivery of support to micro and small enterprises by dissolving the county and city enterprise boards and replacing them with local enterprise offices within the local authority structure under a service level agreement with Enterprise Ireland. This reform offers a one-stop shop for start-ups and small business, introduces innovations for the promotion of start-ups, including the microfinance fund and the recently announced €2 million county-based competition to find Ireland's best young entrepreneur, and enlists the considerable strength of the local authority network behind the creation of jobs. Many local authorities have been innovative in creating opportunities for enterprise development, and the reform aims to build on this. Another important development this year will be the preparation of the operational programme for the new EU rural development programme period of 2014 to 2020. The local development and Leader element of this programme will fund initiatives to support the economic development of rural Ireland and address issues such as social inclusion and poverty reduction.  The Taoiseach recently launched the report of the commission for the economic development of rural areas, CEDRA, as per a commitment under the Action Plan for Jobs. This report contains a number of recommendations to support rural job creation and will be considered shortly by the Cabinet committee on economic recovery and jobs.
Additional information not given on the floor of the House
 Other measures which are being taken by Government that will have a positive impact on the jobs potential of rural areas include the national broadband plan, which includes a major fibre build-out to rural areas through investment by both the private and public sector, and the focus on supporting domestically trading sectors such as construction and retail. These sectors provide employment to almost every community in the country, and the Action Plan for Jobs contains a number of measures to support them as well as other sectors which have particular potential for rural job creation, including agriculture, food, the marine and tourism.

Has the Minister ever created jobs in a rural area and does he know how much investment is needed to create sustainable jobs? What is the maximum grant aid that can be provided by these new bodies, which are the former bodies under new names in an effort to play the quango game? What is the rationale behind the IDA owning all of the industrial land in rural Ireland while Enterprise Ireland is charged with creating jobs there? What is the average investment required to create 100 jobs in one setting in rural or urban Ireland? Does the Minister believe that the supports available in this regard are adequate? In my experience of creating jobs - I do have hands-on experience of creating jobs in rural Ireland - the type of supports being provided by the local authorities will not create significant employment.

Will he also accept that it is a little bit strange that Deputy Deasy continually complains in this House about the lack of jobs in the south east when, according to those statistics, that is the greatest growth area in the country, far exceeding growth in Dublin?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	The devastation of rural areas in this country was brought on by Fianna Fáil when in government through its creation of a construction boom which could not be sustained. Some 60% of construction employment in rural Ireland was lost in the space of three years. That is what created the huge vacuum in rural Ireland. The Government is now seeking to build sustainable and long-term sectors that are export-oriented into the future. We are building on core strengths in rural areas, such as food and tourism. We are seeing success in those sectors. I do not denigrate anyone who sets up a business and is deemed self employed, be that in agriculture or in related sectors. It is the 15,000 or so people who start up their own businesses each year who create most of the employment. Two thirds of all net employment is by new start-ups. Through the local enterprise offices, we are providing a suite of measures that allow instant access to all areas of support in respect of new business ideas from the Deputy or any of his colleagues. These businesses are supported by the State through mentoring and, where appropriate, grant aid, access to capital, microfinance and seed and venture capital. There are a suite of supports available.

Perhaps the Minister will also explain, in the context of the person seeking assistance, what is the significant difference between the new agencies and the former county and city enterprise boards. Does the Minister believe the rationale for the fact that the IDA is the landowner of rural industrial estates while Enterprise Ireland and the new local enterprise offices will be providing the support? For example, with regard to the IDA estate in Roundstone, there is a million to one chance that the IDA will bring foreign direct investment in there. What is the logic in the IDA rather than Enterprise Ireland having that portfolio?  The Minister referenced the work done by the previous Government in respect of rural development. Will he explain the logic behind this Government's abolition of the post of Minister with responsibility for rural development before, three years later, commissioning a report whose first recommendation was the establishment of a Minister with responsibility for rural development?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	In regard to the difference between the former county and city enterprise boards and the local enterprise offices, first, we have created a centre of excellence in Enterprise Ireland which, for the first time, will drive small business and start-ups. We will have a national policy for start-ups and micro-business, which will have service level agreements with the local enterprise offices. This means there will no longer be 35 independent boards in operation. New businesses will be subject to service level agreements, thus ensuring uniform quality and a maximisation of the resources of the network. The LEOs are located within the local authorities, which means they will have the might and heft of the local authorities, which provide many enterprise supports, behind them. The Deputy smirks. Perhaps he would consider reading the county and city managers' report on enterprise supports, which states that more than 2,000 of the measures being operated by local authorities are designed to support enterprise development.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The maximum grant depends on the merit of each proposal.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	There is no maximum for any proposal that emerges. State aid sets the maximum for those proposals suitable for development. Each proposal is considered on its merits. Grants are only available to export-oriented businesses and we have not changed policy in this respect. There is no ceiling on what can be done for any individual proposal made.

According to Karol Balfe of Christian Aid Ireland, Colombia has more internally displaced people than anywhere else on Earth, with an estimated 4.9 million to 5.5 million people displaced. The European Union is seeking the ratification of a trade agreement with Colombia and it is leaving it to the Government to ratify it. I call on the Minister not to ratify it and to ensure there is debate on the floor of the House about the ratification.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	65	The free trade agreement between the European Union and its member states on the one part and the Republic of Colombia and the Republic of Peru on the other is an agreement within the meaning of Article 29.5.2° of the Constitution. Ratification by Ireland is therefore subject to prior approval of the Dáil. It is my intention to seek the necessary approval of Dáil Éireann during the course of this year. While I am aware of the potential economic benefits of this agreement for Colombia and Peru, I am also aware there is a debate as to the value of these agreements to support and enhance human rights, labour rights, environmental protection and more broadly the sustainable development of these countries. I want to mention a few important points, especially in the context of Colombia. Sustainable development and concerns for social and human rights are at the heart of the sustainability chapter of the agreement with Colombia. This is emphasised by the fact that, from the outset, Article 1 of the agreement has stipulated that respect for democratic principles, fundamental human rights and the rule of law is an essential element of the agreement. During its negotiation, Ireland, including officials from the Department, strongly promoted the inclusion of provisions to reflect this essential element. The inclusion of a sustainable development chapter provides the EU with an important means to contribute to supporting positive social reforms and to the greater protection of human rights in Colombia. Furthermore, the establishment of a special committee, with representatives from Colombian civil society, to monitor implementation of the sustainability provisions demonstrates how the EU can develop real leverage for promoting its values and expectations through this agreement. The elaboration by Colombia and Peru in October 2012 of roadmaps on human rights, labour rights and environmental protection clearly demonstrates how the agreement can incentivise an agenda for change. Against this background, I believe the agreement with Colombia will be instrumental in encouraging economic and social progress reinforced by arrangements that strengthen the voice and role of civil society in favour of the progressive development of human and labour rights. This is also recognised by the European Parliament, which last year voted to approve the agreement.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	A total of 70,000 civilians have been killed in Colombia over 20 years and there are widespread systematic human rights violations. These are directly linked to the extremely unequal distribution of land, power and wealth. The Minister has a major opportunity to carry out very important leverage by not ratifying this trade agreement. The European Parliament previously refused to ratify the agreement and called for a binding roadmap on human rights, environmental rights and labour rights. Colombia is the most dangerous place in the world to be a trade unionist and hundreds are killed every decade. According to a number of human rights organisations, Colombia is not delivering with regard to a binding roadmap on human rights. There is no independent monitoring committee for which the European Parliament called. The EU strategic framework and action plans on rights and democracy called for European rights impact assessments to be carried out prior to trade agreements. All these organisations state the trade agreement is not strong enough to enforce the necessary improvements in human rights. Either we strengthen it or, if we cannot do so, we desist from ratification.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	My belief, which is shared by other European Union governments and the European Parliament, is that leverage will be achieved by operating this agreement to deliver the changes rather than refusing to ratify the agreement and sitting on our hands. The agreement provides respect for democratic principles and human rights as I outlined. It also includes public participation in these matters. A meeting between the EU and civil society took place earlier this year to open dialogue with citizens and other NGOs to examine how the sustainable development provisions are being implemented. This was the first open meeting of the sub-committee on trade and sustainable development established under Article 15 of the agreement. The sub-committee will report back on progress and this provides a tool with regard to whether the agreement progresses.
#PeadarToibin	unknown-#PeadarToibin-party	unknown-#PeadarToibin-dob	unknown-#PeadarToibin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	In 2012, the European Parliament called for the inclusion of a comprehensive human rights chapter in addition to the social and environmental chapters in all future trade agreements. There is no such chapter in this trade agreement. In 2013, there was an increase in social protests, which led to a peak in violence, as a result of the opposition by the people of Colombia to the trade agreement. Security forces in Colombia used excessive force during the protest by the people against this specific trade agreement, and 70 protesters, including community leaders, were killed. To state the trade agreement is a vehicle for positive change is nonsense. I commend the work of Christian Aid, Trócaire, the Latin America Solidarity Centre, ICTU, Justice for Colombia and all the other groups working to try to get the EU to desist from this. While the Chamber must ratify the agreement, Members should at least be given the ability and right to debate it before ratification. It will all sound very well when we pass a vote, but usually people come in here and do not know what they are voting for. We should be given an opportunity to debate this and the Teachtaí Dála who vote on it should educate themselves on the ramifications of its ratification.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	22362	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	The trade agreement between the EU and Colombia contains robust human rights provisions which permit unilateral and immediate suspension in the case of grave human rights violations. Ireland and the European Parliament played a significant role in encouraging strong measures in this regard. The agreement includes a number of binding commitments to implement core labour and environmental conventions. Human rights provisions have been elaborated further in roadmaps dealing with human, labour and environmental rights provided by Peru and Colombia at the request of the European Parliament. We have included these provisions, established oversight committees and we have committees engaging with civil society. We also have the right to withdraw if this does not leverage the type of change Europe seeks to achieve. This agreement provides commitments to deliver and leverage in the event it does not. The alternative outlined by the Deputy of not ratifying it and blocking all interaction does not offer the prospect for which he hopes.

That was on 23 January. It is now five and a half months later and we have had nothing. Will the Minister update us on the implementation of the recommendations and where the report is at?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	I thank the Deputy for tabling the question. In the Action Plan for Jobs 2014, developing a better environment for entrepreneurship is a key disruptive reform. The work of the Entrepreneurship Forum has been a valuable input to identify areas for fruitful initiative. The Department is developing a national policy statement on entrepreneurship. As part of this process, the forum’s recommendations are being evaluated with input from Departments and agencies. Already, a significant number of initiatives have been taken which respond to the forum’s evaluation.These include the launch of the local enterprise offices, LEOs, the initiation of a competition to find and to invest in the best young entrepreneurs at local and national level, the creation of a new ICT skills strategy 2014-18, the establishment of Knowledge Transfer Ireland and its online database of innovative ideas, as well as turning those ideas that come from intellectual property through the universities and institutes of technology into new companies. In addition, a review of mentoring is being prepared by Forfás and a review of tax supports is under way for entrepreneurs. The initiatives also include an assessment of how the agencies in the Department can deliver targeted improvements in the environment for business, particularly for start-ups, and the preparation of a strategy statement 2014-16 by Enterprise Ireland with new ambitions for high-potential start-ups. There is a strong belief that the start-ups area offers huge opportunity for enhanced performance and jobs growth by the Irish enterprise sector and the Government is determined to facilitate this through a national policy statement on entrepreneurship.

He can imagine the frustration of business people and entrepreneurs who are successful, who have created jobs, who have taken the risk and who put their valuable time, which they do not really have, into producing a report. The report was presented in a clear and cogent manner and there is no rubbish associated with it. However, they now are being told their views are being assessed. These are people who have walked the walk. This concerns the frustration of the business community in respect of getting involved in a project like this. The proposals probably now are being assessed by numerous interdepartmental committees in the traditional sense. Is there not an argument for implementing the report, given that the recommendations come from people who know what they are talking about and who have the experience? I have a number of specific queries in this regard. One recommendation was that sharing of maternity leave would be allowed between partners. However, this proposal was voted down by Government parties when Fianna Fáil introduced a Bill on this issue last year. Second, the report by the Entrepreneurship Forum was scathing in its remarks on personal guarantees and their use in lending. However, the pillar banks are still using and frankly abusing personal guarantees. Third, there was a specific recommendation that Ireland could become a European trade hub for China. What has happened since January to further this recommendation? In particular, I am anxious to ascertain what additional resources are being committed in the context of the remarks made earlier by the Minister, Deputy Bruton, regarding new IDA and Enterprise Ireland personnel. Have additional personnel been assigned to China to achieve the aim of enabling Ireland to become a European trade hub?
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	Many of the recommendations made actually cut across measures that are being implemented anyway. It is unfair to suggest that the Government is not engaging proactively with the recommendations. It acknowledges wholeheartedly the role played by the chairman and individual members in bringing forward these recommendations. I can tell the Deputy that, internally, there is no sense of lethargy about engaging properly. However, he must acknowledge that if one is to take all the recommendations, of which there are at least 69, one must have some sort of process to ensure the State agencies can respond and that there is an interdepartmental response. As I outlined already in my initial reply, the Government has launched the local enterprise offices, which will cut across a lot of the recommendations made. Similarly, the ICT skills strategy will cut across a lot of the recommendations that were made, as will the review by Forfás on mentoring. Consequently, there is no sense that the Department is not engaging with the recommendations. I assure the Deputy and those people who have been in contact with the Deputy and who may have expressed concerns that the Government is absolutely and utterly intent on ensuring that the national policy statement will reflect the views put forward and the recommendations proposed.

Any sense of entrepreneurship or ambition tends to get parked and choked within such a committee. Were there a commitment that this matter is being dealt with and led at ministerial level and that the Minister of State, together with the Minister, Deputy Bruton, and the Minister of State, Deputy Perry, intend to drive on this report themselves rather than parking it in the Amazonian wilderness of many interdepartmental committees, I might then have some faith in the process.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	15156	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	81	I did not answer the question on the number of people who have been assigned. A number of people have been appointed through Enterprise Ireland in Asia, comprising ten new people across Asia. I can get a specific figure for the Deputy in respect of China. To my mind, the interdepartmental approach works quite rapidly at present. If one examines again the recommendations made in the Entrepreneurship Forum report, it is evident that the Government is moving rapidly and actually was ahead of some of the recommendations in respect of outcomes, particularly, for example, with regard to the higher level sector where there is a strong move towards ensuring that research works in a way that turns those good ideas into good jobs. The Government has created Knowledge Transfer Ireland and has ensured there are more post-doctoral and PhD programmes. For instance, there are specific arrangements pertaining to the Irish Research Council on having more enterprise-facing PhD programmes. That is one recommendation that already is under way. The point must be made that while the Government acknowledges the recommendations and is working towards meeting them, it will reflect these outcomes through the national policy statement.

That said, in some ways it is not because this is a rushed item of legislation. It deals with approximately 14 different aspects of the social welfare and pension codes and, consequently, each change can have a profound effect on one or several individuals or, in some cases, thousands of people. As a result, while it is an important Bill in itself, many other issues could have been but have not been dealt with in this Bill. Many reversals of the Minister's cuts over the past three and a half years should have been contained in this Bill, given the current position in respect of social welfare expenditure and given how the public has suffered continuous cuts since this Government and Minister have been in charge. Another point on which I was concluding last night related to my concerns on section 3 of the Bill in respect of An Post. My concern is that, to date, An Post has been mentioned in legislation and, as such, has been the preferred bidder in every opportunity.

There are concerns about society, changes therein and the need to protect institutions that serve society best. I am aware there has been an ongoing exchange in the EU about postal workers. This is more a concern for the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources. The postal workers' unions across Europe have lobbied for protection of the services. In this instance it is not the personnel who deliver the post, the postman or post woman whose jobs are at risk, but rather the institution of the post office is at risk. There is a danger to the institution if the postal service is opened to competition and if the privileged position of An Post as stated in legislation is removed. This Bill proposes to remove the statutory protection of An Post which means the service will be open to competition. I will not go over all the arguments but in my view - which I have argued with this Minister and the previous Minister - the post office has a specific role in the distribution of social welfare payments and in implementing anti-fraud measures. The post office offers a personal service which should not be ignored in this era of open competition. It could result that a bank or other financial institution with no loyalty to Ireland or to anyone bar the money it earns would be contracted to supply these services and there could be a danger that society would not benefit. If the contract for delivery of social welfare payments is moved away from An Post to a bank, I am very concerned about the effects in many small towns and villages and some urban areas across the country. I have concerns about the move to pay social welfare payments directly to bank accounts which has been encouraged by the Department of Social Protection because the more people move away from the personal interaction in post offices, the greater the danger of fraud. It also poses a danger for society because the majority of people who depend on social welfare payments use the post office every week. If all social welfare payments, such as dole payments, child benefit and old age pensions, are to be paid electronically, many people will become more isolated from society as they will do all their business online and they may not have any reason to come out their front door. Everything can be ordered on the Internet and people need to be aware of the dangers as well as the benefits when making these decisions. I expect to return to this issue at a later date given that the changes in legislation are designed to facilitate a move away from An Post. If such a move is made, I presume tenders for the contract would be required and it would, hopefully, be discussed in this House in advance of any change. We will need to discuss the change and also the parameters for the contract other than the provision of commercial financial transactions. The social aspect of that contract will need to be borne in mind. I wish to address the legislation which deals with aspects of a 2010 EU directive which I believe need to be passed before the summer recess although I may be mistaken. There does not seem to be any urgency in passing this legislation or indeed the majority of it.

It is not the way to do business and there should be more time between publication and discussion. The Minister may remember one of the first Bills she brought to the House in July 2011 was to legislate for the minimum wage rate. We welcomed that Bill at the time but I argued that the Bill removed the need for all legislation to be translated into Irish. My argument has been that along with every other Deputy, I am hampered in my ability to address legislation through the medium of Irish because there is no provision for an explanatory memorandum as Gaeilge. This is not a criticism of the Minister because not one Minister has produced an explanatory memorandum as Gaeilge which would help to increase the use and level of Irish in debates on important issues such as this. It is not fair on me nor is it fair on the Minister if I attempt to engage with the Minister while we are both wearing headphones. I know this is the practice in the European Parliament and it succeeds very well but it is easier if at least the vocabulary used in the Bill is available to me and to the Minister and to the translators. We all have a level of Irish but we might not be able to follow the conversation without the services of a translator. I ask the Minister to raise this matter at Cabinet. Since the Minister took office there have been a series of cuts although she has made great play about avoiding cuts to core rates of social welfare. I have argued previously that she has in fact done so in many cases although some payments such as disability allowance and the old-age pension have been spared. Other core social welfare payment rates have been cut, including the jobseeker's allowance. The jobseeker's benefit by virtue of the reduction in months has also been cut substantially. Given the day that is in it, I remind the Minister that today is the day for payment of the respite care grant to thousands of carers all over the country. This year they will be short €325 which the Minister cut from that core rate in budget 2013.

#AengusOSnodaighSF	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-party	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-dob	unknown-#AengusOSnodaighSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	98	I agree there has been a range of cuts. However, given the day that is in it, it is worth reminding people that the Minister could reverse the cut to the respite care grant which was estimated at the time as €26 million or €27 million. Everyone on all sides of this House would urge the Minister to consider reversing the cut. It could have been contained in this Bill. She could have looked again at the cut in the fuel allowance which, at a cost to those families who were dependent on it, amounts to €24 million. I will deal with some of the range of other issues. We are half way through 2014 and already the PRSI yield is €100 million greater than the anticipated €138 million.This is a substantial and welcome boost to the coffers of the Department, which flags that the Minister has scope to reduce the effect of the cuts she has implemented in the past three years. Rather than passing on these savings to another Department or the Exchequer, it should be used to alleviate the hardship facing those who depend on social welfare payments. One of the key aspects of any stimulus package is that every cent in social welfare is spent, usually in the local economy. The Minister should consider the boost a reversal of cuts would give social welfare recipients and local economies. Having campaigned in Dublin and elsewhere during the recent elections, she will be aware of the many towns and villages which have become wastelands because shops and services have closed. If nothing else, she should consider reversing some of the cuts she implemented in recent years, including the changes to illness benefit, treatment benefit, the diet supplement scheme, the fuel allowance, the household benefits package and the telephone allowance, all of which have had a detrimental impact. The Minister also diminished entitlement to the State old age pension by hiking up the pension age and cut the bereavement grant, rent and mortgage interest supplement and the back to school clothing and footwear allowance.  The Labour Party promised during the general election campaign that, if elected, it would not interfere with child benefit rates. Child benefit payments for a family with four children have been reduced by €58 per month since the Minister came to power. In addition, the core rate of jobseeker's allowance for many young people has been cut by €44 per week, while the eligibility period for jobseeker's benefit has been cut by three months. I still cannot get to grips with the logic of cutting maternity benefit. Changes to the invalidity pension will result in a cut of €1,914 per annum for many people aged 65 years. I have set a number of areas that should have been addressed in the Bill. If the Minister had taken action on these issues, she would have reinforced the message she appears to be sending outside the Chamber in the leadership contest for the Labour Party. Members of her party are being offered a Hobson's choice of either the Minister for social welfare cuts or the Minister of State for medical card cuts. I welcome the Minister's conversion to the view that austerity does not work, which has been Sinn Féin's position for a number of years. She stated recently:Ireland has to move away from the current economic narrative of pain and penitence; we need to become a society again, not an economy... But this cannot be done under the austerity model.We have been shouting this message from the rooftops for years and the Labour Party has not listened. If the Minister's views become the new model for her party in government, my party and the electorate will measure it by its actions. I regret, however, that this Bill does not suggest it has adopted a new model. Most of the changes in the Bill are welcome, if not urgent. I referred to the change regarding An Post. Most of the other measures are minor changes aimed at tidying up various matters. Sinn Féin has some minor concerns about some technical aspects of the Bill. We will deal with these in greater detail on Committee Stage as we require additional information from the Department. At a minimum, the scope of the legislation should be widened.  As well as the change regarding An Post, the Bill introduces changes to PRSI and share based remuneration. Sinn Féin welcomes the proposed change regarding the recovery of PRSI from employers in respect of refunds. I tabled amendments previously to address an anomaly that arises when deductions are made to payments made to former employees in unfair dismissal cases. None of these deductions, which are made in lieu of social welfare payments, is transferred to the Department of Social Protection. Addressing this matter would require a minor change in the legislation in line with the tidying up being done elsewhere in the Bill. Under the current system, where €5,000 is deducted from an award of €10,000 for social welfare payments, the employer may get away with paying only €5,000. We should ensure all moneys employers owe the State are paid. Employers would think twice before unfairly dismissing an employee if, as I propose, many awards would double. Changes such as this should be made in miscellaneous provisions Bills aimed at tidying up matters.  While I have a few minor concerns about the proposals on family income supplement, the possibility of holding reviews halfway through the 52 week period is, in the main, a welcome change, which has been sought for some time.  I do not oppose the recovery of overpayments made by the Department, although I have raised concerns about this issue previously. While persons have only four years in which to claim back overpayments in tax, I am dealing with a case involving an overpayment by the Department that occurred 30 years ago. There is something of a disconnect in respect of the time permitted to recover overpayments. Fraud is a different matter and should be pursued. In the cases of overpayments made in error, the Department should write them off as hard luck after a certain period has elapsed. If the position were reversed, one would not have a hope in hell of claiming back a tax overpayment from Revenue because the onus is on individuals to ensure their tax affairs are in order and they do not overpay or underpay tax. Similarly, the onus should be on the Department to ensure it is not overpaying allowances.  It is damning that the respite care payment people receive today will be €325 lower than previously. Expenditure on social welfare has been reduced by €1.6 billion since the Minister took office, which is a substantial amount. As I stated, given the recent change in circumstances and the savings made in the Department, the Minister should start to reverse the reduction in her Department's expenditure by ensuring the savings made are redistributed to the most vulnerable.By virtue of that going back into a local economy, it comes back to Government in many ways, such as through the employers' PRSI, employees' PRSI, VAT and PAYE of workers in shops and factories. In fact, it is a stimulus. There is a model that is used by the Department of Finance which shows how a stimulus returns so much to Government over a period. I do not have the expertise to give the Minister the exact figures but I am aware that if the Minister had used €1.5 billion as a stimulus over a period of three or four years, she would have had a return of two or three times its size which would be sustainable because she would have created jobs. I welcome the changed circumstances in terms of the numbers working and the numbers who are no longer totally dependent on social welfare, but the major concern I have is the type of work that is being created. I refer to the significant numbers who will be dependent on family income supplement in the future because they are ending up in low paid jobs, with no permanency attaching in many cases. I have continually raised questions about the concentration on schemes that do not end up delivering full training or increasing suitability for employment, the keys ones being the likes of Tús, Gateway and JobBridge. The Minister and I will continue to disagree on those. I would encourage the Department to do a lot more in promoting the one job creation scheme that could be encouraged, that is, JobsPlus. That scheme is a model, where participants are in full-time employment, get a wage above the minimum wage and contribute PRSI and PAYE, and therefore their jobs are more sustainable because the grant to the employer is a lot larger. I will leave most of the discussion on the technicalities and the specific points of the Bill to Committee Stage, which will be next week, where we can tease out in greater detail the impact of some of the changes which may not be as positive as they seemed initially. Most of the changes are positive, but I will oppose any change to the designation or mention of An Post in the Bill.

I thank the Acting Chairman for the opportunity of speaking to this new Bill, the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014. I welcome the debate on this legislation as we all need to be solid on the core principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in activity in a self-employed capacity. Before I go into the details of the legislation, it is important to remind those listening, particularly Members of this House, that when discussing pensions and social welfare issues, there are many out there for whom these are very important matters in their daily lives and in them simply surviving. In this day and age, that is the reality for many living in poverty. Social welfare can be simply a matter of putting food on the table, particularly following years of austerity. Those who are flippant about it and those in the Government and on the extreme right in this country who constantly demand cuts to social welfare need to wake up to that reality. Recently, when knocking on the doors, they got a wake-up call from the people. They all thought they were so smug until they got the answers on the doors. In this debate on legislative reform, we should never forget those who must survive every day on social welfare, particularly senior citizens living on pensions. Those on social welfare, whether they are low paid workers or the unemployed, all have to be protected. That is the bottom line. I talk about low paid workers and the unemployed, but yesterday we heard the case of workers who are not getting any pay at all. Of course, I refer to day 14 of the sit-in of the Paris Bakery workers. They called yesterday at Leinster House, protesting about the way they are being treated. Twenty of the Paris Bakery workers held a rally with supporters outside Leinster House and I joined them. We all called on the Taoiseach to intervene urgently in their worsening situation. The workers were entering their 13th day of their Moore Street sit-in and are owed more than €100,000 in wages, holiday pay and redundancy pay. That is a scandal in 2014. Ms Anissa Hosany, a chef with the bakery for over three and a half years, said:The reason we began this sit-in was to get the money we are owed and make sure no more assets were removed by the owners. We feel like we are doing the job of the Revenue Commissioners, minding the assets of the company.Mr. Eduard Claihnet, another Paris Bakery worker, said:We are asking the Taoiseach to tell us how long the Government expects us to act on their behalf without stepping in. I want to go home, I want to sleep in my bed and not have the stress of this hanging over me.Mr. Claihnet continued:We want [the owners] to either pay us the wages we earned or agree in writing to wind up the company properly so we can access the insolvency fund. It is that simple. The Paris Bakery workers are also calling on the Taoiseach to change the law immediately, and I would ask the Minister, Deputy Burton, to get involved. This should not happen to any worker. The insolvency payment scheme should be immediately accessible to all workers to protect them in cases where employers cease trading without formally winding up the business. That is what is going on in this country today and it is not acceptable. I am glad to say that many Members of the Oireachtas attended the protest on this issue yesterday. In the Bill, we are talking about equality. I heard the Minister discuss in a recent interview the extremes that are popping up around Europe. My concern is the extreme right and the racism that is emerging right across Europe. Even up the road in Belfast in the North, we have seen in recent days the racism that is going on as well. We also have an added problem of sectarianism. It is important, regardless of political differences, that all Members of the House speak out on this issue. It is linked. If the Minister is serious about equality in society and in the Bill, she has to be serious about equality right across all sectors of society. The Bill proposes a number of changes to a range of social welfare payments and requirements, including changes to the habitual residence condition and to the family income supplement. It seeks to transpose certain aspects of Directive 2010/41/EU. It also proposes amendments to the Pensions Act 1990 in respect of notifying members of defined benefit schemes where scheme benefits are being restructured under section 50 of the 1990 Act. That, essentially, is what the Bill is about. It is important that we get the detail of it right. Another issue in dealing with this Bill on social welfare is the silent cuts over recent years to front-line services for those with disabilities. In that time, they have taken cuts of between 3% and 5%, but because of the rows about the salaries of the CEOs in Rehab and the CRC, the focus has been taken off the cuts to the front-line services. It is important that we highlight this issue in the debate as well. In social welfare, we talk about protecting senior citizens and the vulnerable, including children. Two recent examples in my constituency have really got up my nose and I would ask the Minister to intervene urgently. The Jigsaw child care centre in Darndale, which is an excellent centre for preschool children, has 260 preschool children and 99 staff. They all come from the Darndale-Moatview area in Dublin 17.They do an excellent job and I have been there to see the provision of front-line services. However, they are currently short €200,000 to keep the project up and running. We have asked the Taoiseach and the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Charles Flanagan, to intervene but everybody is sitting on the fence. If the Minister is serious about children's rights and social welfare, this particular project deserves support. We saw recently that €2 million was found overnight to have an inquiry into the Guerin report, the former Garda Commissioner and issues like that. In addition, €800,000 has been found to refurbish the Fine Gael headquarters, yet we cannot get €200,000 for an excellent service for children in Darndale, which employs 99 people. I have raised this hypocrisy because if one is changing society, one must start with these things. They might be small matters compared with the billions in bank debt both here and elsewhere in Europe, but €200,000 should be given now for that excellent service in Darndale. While the Minister is at it, she might also look at Darndale Park where there is a proposal for 14 jobs to clean it up and turn it into an excellent community park. Yesterday, however, I believe the Department of Social Protection turned down that proposal from the local residents' group. The directive is concerned with the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in a self-employed capacity. Currently in Ireland, certain people who assist their self-employed spouse or partner in a business but who are not a business partner or employee are excluded from social insurance cover. The Bill provides for their inclusion subject to certain entitlement conditions. I welcome this aspect of the legislation. Another section deals with family income supplement, FIS. Some 44,000 households are in receipt of FIS, while 98,679 children are included in the scheme. The average weekly FIS payment is €114.45. I welcome the broader debate on this legislation but there is no point in talking about social welfare unless we do something for the weaker sections of society.

Perhaps she will adapt a new slogan, "Joan's way and not Enda's way", instead of the current Tánaiste who said it was going to be "Labour's way or Frankfurt's way". Good luck to her agus go n-éirí an t-ádh léi. I welcome some measures in the Bill, including proposed changes. I think it is time for change. Like the previous speaker, we can never underestimate how difficult it is for people at the margins of society. They include elderly people on pensions, many of whom have only one pension in the household, as well as the sick and disabled. During the lifetime of this Government there have been three serious attacks on them, which caused protests. Family carers are taking an enormous burden off hospitals and the health system generally, which is creaking at the seams. They must always be at the forefront of our concerns as they are less well off. Over the years, they have paid into the system and have done the State some service by doing their best. We should try to intervene with the workers at the Paris Bakery who are engaged in a sit-in. The way they have been treated is unfair. As a self-employed person and an employer for more than 30 years, I understand how difficult it is for all sides, but when such companies go into liquidation, it is not fair if workers do not receive their due rights. They should, and must, get them. I disagree with section 7 which provides that increases in jobseekers' allowances, pre-retirement allowances, supplementary welfare allowances, disability allowances and farm assist payments in respect of the qualified adult recipient will not be payable for any period during which the qualified adult is resident, whether temporarily or permanently, outside the State or in prison or otherwise detained in legal custody. That is a bit harsh. The farm assist, for example, is a vital payment to keep families viable on agricultural smallholdings, particularly in disadvantaged areas. In addition, they might be trying to put children through college. I ask the Minister to make allowances for this. I know the Minister goes to visit her good friend in Tipperary and is aware of that countryside's difficult terrain. People from disadvantaged areas may have to go abroad for temporary work with a landscape company, for example, or for training or a medical procedure. We should ensure, therefore, there is allowance made for that. I am not talking about people who go abroad to work on a full-time job. I am talking about people who leave to upskill themselves and gain experience abroad.

I thank the Minister for that information. Clarity is required on the rules for entitlement to family income supplement. I ask the Minister to set out the circumstances in which a claimant who is living apart from his or her spouse or civil partner and children can still claim the supplement. That area needs to be clarified. I welcome changes in section 10 in respect of the application of an habitual residence condition for entitlement to certain social welfare payments. It is timely for this matter to be examined. Section 16 is a welcome measure for self-employed people as it extends social assistance cover to help spouses, civil partners or self-employed contributors. The social welfare code currently excludes from social insurance cover certain relatives, including spouses, civil partners or self-employed contributors who are participating in the person's business and performing the same or ancillary tasks. The Bill provides for the extension of social insurance to those spouses or civil partners where their annual self-employed income is within certain limits. The limits are small enough but that measure is important for family businesses where this matter is a huge issue. People may work night and day, using might and main, to try to keep a business afloat, although it is very difficult to do so. There should be, therefore, some cover for those people. I welcome the move concerning self-employed PRSI. People with a reckonable annual income in excess of €5,000 will pay class S PRSI of 4% on all income, including unearned income, subject to a minimum annual contribution of €500. It might be a big sum if one does not have a lot of work, but none the less the Minister's efforts to change that position is important. We have cried out for such a change since the onset of the recession as so many self-employed persons have gone out of business through no fault of their own. They might have been employing ten or 20 people in the good times. Their employees, including tradesmen, all receive PRSI cover, and rightly so. However, the employer who was brave enough to take the initiative and create work gets nothing. That is very unfair, so I am delighted to see that the 2010 review will now take that into account. It is a welcome step. I welcome the Bill's measures. The Minister has reassured me about the first issue I raised, so I thank her for that. I wish the Bill well in its passage through the House.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	107	I wish to raise something that is not directly related to the Bill, although others have rightly brought it up, which is the Paris Bakery situation. I know the Minister was down there this week and many of us joined the protest yesterday. We have had a litany of situations like the Paris Bakery, including Vita Cortex, La Senza, Jane Norman and Connolly Shoes. Time and again, employers are simply refusing to give workers their entitlements, including wages and holiday pay, yet they can get away with it.In the extraordinary case of Connolly Shoes, pickets have been in place for four years. The Government has been made aware of such situations time and again and nothing has been done. It is extraordinary that this can be allowed to continue. I can only assume it is due to Fine Gael's predilection for the idea that we must not do anything to hamper so-called enterprise, risk taking and entrepreneurialism, and if we took legislative measures to deal with this situation it might hamper so-called enterprise. It is unacceptable because this is enterprise where the workers take the risks. There is no risk to employers because they can walk away from their obligations to workers. The employers take risks on behalf of workers without their knowledge. The workers discover one day that the business has been wound up, changed its name or found some other mechanism by which it can evade its obligations to its workers, who are left high and dry without a penny. Although this unacceptable situation has been known to the Government for at least two years, it has done nothing. Where is the emergency legislation on it? Although, sadly, I very much doubt it will be forthcoming, it must be said again. There are three categories of provision regarding the Bill: positive provisions; provisions that are of deep concern or obnoxious; and provisions that should be there but are not. As one must put a positive foot forward in these often dark and grim times, I will begin with the positive elements. It is positive that equal treatment should be applied to self-employed people and particularly to their spouses and partners. For some time, self-employed people have been saying they would be happy to make the extra contributions that would mean their spouses and family members would be entitled to the same social welfare benefits as everybody else. This is a response by the Government to something self-employed people have been saying for some time, and I welcome it. Similarly, the moves on family income supplement, FIS, seem positive in that they take account of changes in family circumstances, such as people moving apart, and will not exclude people from entitlement to FIS because of such changes. Although not a very positive issue, it is a step forward that where pension schemes are being restructured people should be properly notified of it and have some recourse to the courts. Although the details need to be examined carefully, I broadly welcome these positive provisions, in case anybody ever says we on this side of the House are only negative.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	109	Some people do. I have major problems with a few elements of the legislation. The measures on recovery of overpayments are scraping the bottom of the barrel. I will give two cases without mentioning names lest the Acting Chairman jump down my throat. One mother, now a pensioner, told me her son, now in his mid-40s, was an apprentice chef when he was in his late teens or early 20s. At the time, 20 or 25 years ago, the Department of Social Welfare was paying his mother social welfare benefits for him on the basis that he was still in full-time education, but then told her he was no longer entitled to the money because he was an apprentice. She said he was in full-time education and therefore she had to look after him. The Department revoked the payment, she challenged it and it was restored. Although she thought it was resolved, 25 years later she received a letter informing her that two years of overpayments were to be deducted from her pension. That is outrageous and indicative of a Department that is scraping the bottom of the barrel. Somebody who is on a State pension, by definition living in poverty, will be driven further into poverty because of confusion and incompetence in the Department 25 years ago. She cannot even remember all the details. In another case, about which I have telephoned the Department, a youngish man, approximately my age, in his 40s had some sort of overpayment issue approximately 20 years ago. Although he cannot remember the details, in his mind the issue was resolved back then, but 20 years on he does not have any evidence. The Department says it has overpaid him and is demanding the money back, and he does not have a leg to stand on. While in the courts there is a statute of limitations on debt - I think it is six years - the Department can go back 20 years, and it has all the cards because it can produce the evidence. Any nuanced, personal, detailed knowledge is gone and we are dealing with just pieces of paper and boxes being ticked. The Government is scraping the bottom of the barrel to get money in while poor people on social welfare or pensions are being raided for lump sum payments, refunds or whatever the Department can get back. The victims of these raids can say or do nothing about it. It is unacceptable and brings to mind the question I have heard a lot on the doorsteps over the past few weeks as to how the Government can operate in terms of attacking the poor and the vulnerable. It seems there are no depths to which we will not sink to attack the poor and vulnerable in the money grab. We can contrast it with how the wealthy and powerful are dealt with in terms of moneys owed. The Paris Bakery is a good example. Although I have said it on two or three occasions here it still galls me that the richest man in the country, who took over Sierra Support Services Group, the company which has got the contract to install water meters, had €100 million of his debts written off, mostly by Anglo Irish Bank, a public bank. In other words, his debts were written off by the same poor people we are talking about and by ordinary workers who have been hammered. We gave him €100 million. He also has a controlling share in Independent News and Media, and we wrote off €90 million of its debts. It is unbelievable when the poor are being hammered and we are taking bread off their tables. When the Government takes €10 or €15 from somebody on €188 per week, it is driving somebody who is already poor further into poverty. It is unacceptable. I ask the Government to think about the idea of trawling back 20 years and taking money from people where there is no fraud. In the vast majority of these cases there was an overpayment due to the Department's incompetence.It is beyond belief, and it is one issue to which I am utterly opposed having included in the Bill. I am concerned about another area, although I do not fully understand it and I want to hear from the Minister about it. This is the so-called strengthening of the habitual residency rules. From what I understand in reading the Bill, which is quite complicated and detailed, this will essentially allow adjudicating officers to reconsider whether somebody who has been determined as habitually resident and therefore entitled to a social welfare payment can continue to receive the payment. The review would happen on the basis that the person in question was not subsequently habitually resident in the State. Perhaps the person left the country or had a bank account in England, as many do, given our relationship with Britain, which means there is much activity back and forth. This happens because of the location of extended families or people having to do bits of work, leading to bank accounts or connections elsewhere. I suspect this will be another excuse to deny people social welfare entitlements, and I am concerned about that. The detail of the issue must be examined thoroughly and perhaps the Minister will respond by telling me the process will be very fair. Excuse me if I am a little sceptical or concerned about that, given the issue I have just mentioned. There is a drive in the Department to scrape the bottom of the barrel looking for money and that often has pretty adverse consequences for people who really do not need the hassle of having payments cut off because of what is essentially bureaucratic box ticking. These are the two major issues about which I am concerned. There is another issue I have discussed on umpteen occasions with the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, the most recent of which was yesterday. It relates to rent allowance caps, provisions for which should be in the Bill but are not. I do not understand why that is so. I mentioned yesterday the case of a young woman in Bray with a severely autistic child who has been living in a hotel in Bray. As the summer holidays are approaching, the hotel can probably get tourist trade and it does not really want homeless people whose accommodation is paid by the Department, so it has engineered an excuse to kick out this woman. The woman has nowhere to go and having gone to the offices of Wicklow County Council, she was told it has nothing for her. This woman has a child with severe special needs and what will solve her problem? Reviews are wonderful and I hope we can have a major social housing programme as we need to start building straight away. None of this will solve this woman's problem next week or today. The only solution to her problem would be the Minister telling the community welfare officer, ideally in legislation, that if somebody is faced with homelessness as a result of being unable to source private rented accommodation, the community welfare officer would approve him or her for a higher rent allowance cap based on what is available in the area. The woman I mentioned would then be able to look at www.daft.ie and see what is available for a mother with one child, such as a two-bedroom house or flat. In Bray, any suitable property would probably cost approximately €1,200 or €1,300 per month in rent and she will have to pay that in order to get a roof over her head. The community welfare officer can check it by looking at the property website before deciding the rent is reasonable and she can find a place to live. Only properties for rent at €1,200 or €1,300 per month are available and there is nowhere available at €975 per month. Such a provision should be included in the Bill and it is not too late for the Government to put it in. This must happen as otherwise, over the summer the homelessness crisis will spiral completely out of control.

#NoelHarrington	unknown-#NoelHarrington-party	unknown-#NoelHarrington-dob	unknown-#NoelHarrington-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	111	I welcome the opportunity to speak on the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014. In discussing the Bill, one of the more important tenets to consider is how we can help people trapped in options where even if they are offered work, it would make little or no benefit financially to take it up. I realise the offer of work may not come as often as I would like. I would have preferred more provisions in this Bill with that aim. Any of us on the doorsteps over the past month or more would have realised that it was a major issue. People, often in single income households, are forced to contribute heavily under different headings in the State but may feel angry at neighbours, friends, associates or family members who in their mind receive much from the State but contribute little while still having options. Where people do not have options it is a different ball game. There could have been greater emphasis on encouraging clients of the Department of Social Protection to look more earnestly at accessing the workplace and incentivising people within those households to get back to work where it is offered. I welcome many of the provisions in the Bill, with one in section 16 essentially dealing with the protection of the interests of women under the social welfare code. An issue that has come before us many times is the example of a girl leaving school or college before entering the workplace and making contributions. When that woman gets married and rears a family, she would have worked in the home but she would have returned to work afterwards, continuing to make contributions. Such people may have expected to have contributed enough to earn a full rate contributory pension but unfortunately it may not be the case. Contributions are calculated but the manner in which the time worked at home is considered is unfair, and by assessing it over total years of work, the result is a small mean contribution over each year. The matter must be addressed because this issue of fairness greatly affects married women. It has come to light over the past few years and it will become a greater issue in the next couple of years. The previous speaker mentioned overpayments and claiming back payments. He mentioned two cases from the total overpayment amount in 2012 of €97 million. The idea that we can disregard the section of the Bill dealing with overpayments defies logic. Overpayments arising from suspected fraud or customer error must be dealt with. We have heard staggering figures almost on an annual basis of the money recovered through effective fraud control measures within the Department. In 2012 the estimate was €97 million, meaning the rate is far too high.Good fraud prevention measures will have to be a cornerstone of the work of the Department to make sure those entitled to benefits get the correct rate as set out in legislation. We have a relatively high rate of social protection within the European or OECD context. While that is good, it makes it harder for some families and parents to access the workplace. Almost 8% of overpayments are departmental errors, which is high, even in the context of the €97 billion budget. Every effort should be made to wipe this out and put systems into the social welfare offices to ensure there are no overpayment errors. If a client is overpaid through departmental error, whether for a year, a week or 20 years, he or she has a case and the Department puts the chance of reclaiming that money at risk.  Very few will ever be told until they retire or claim the State pension what they are due. They will be given a contribution history, or part of one. When they ask where they stand with respect to their own pension, it is difficult to get accurate information. I can understand the reticence among some officials to state an amount, but it would help people who have contributed throughout their working lives to know what likely pension they will receive and how they might increase or improve their contributory pension. Some may wish to continue to contribute after they reach 66. They may wish to retire at 70 and would like to engage with the Department about how to get a greater contributory pension. That could be considered. I welcome the development of the Intreo offices. More work needs to be done but the amalgamation of the social protection and community welfare office work and FÁS and An tSeirbhís Oideachais Leanúnaigh agus Scileanna, SOLAS, employees into a one-stop shop that brings people closer to the marketplace is very important. The Bill does not address this directly but I compliment the Department of Social Protection on taking that approach. It needs, however, to be rolled out further and faster throughout the State. It is an important initiative to get people back to work. Some concern has been raised about payments through An Post. I am a postmaster. There is genuine concern that the contract for social welfare payments is being neglected. The departmental officials should keep in mind the consequences of disregarding how payments are made in the post office, particularly when it comes to fraud prevention, security and offering a more holistic service to clients. Quite often officials within the post office network have the information to help clients maximise their social protection service. That is not being taken into account and it is a shame it is not mentioned in the Bill. I welcome the provisions in the Bill. There is work to be done to maximise the potential of social protection clients to get back into the workplace. That should be the objective of every Deputy as we move into a better economy.

I want to focus on Part 3 and an amendment I will table. Part 3 deals with notification to trustees of a change by the pensions authority to the members of the pension fund. My amendment will be on the definition of trustees, how they are elected and who has voting rights. This revolves around the deferred members who have no say in the election of trustees and therefore in the direction in which trustees take the pension fund. They might not get the information back from the pension authorities because they will have no rights as a body. All members of the pension fund, whether active, retired or deferred members, should have the right to elect trustees. Deferred members may not have left of their own accord but because a company has wound up or because they moved to other employment. They may have left shortly before receiving their pension. They have no rights in the election of their representatives. My amendment proposes that they should have a say in electing the trustees of the pension fund.

There is considerable concern about proposed changes to the contract with An Post. It is important for the viability of the rural post office network that it continues to have a role in the payment of social welfare. It would also be a control measure because the client must go in and collect the payment. Some €19.63 billion will be spent on social welfare in 2014 and €18.5 million on capital expenditure. It is the largest spending category; almost €2 out of every €5 of Government spending goes to social welfare. It is important to have correct controls and safeguards in place in respect of the spending of this money to ensure best value for taxpayers.It goes without saying that social welfare is an important safety net and provides support for a range of citizens, including jobseekers' supports and illness and disability supports. It is a safety net that most individuals and certainly most families at some stage in their life will rely upon. Such investment needs to be recognised. Ireland has one of the most substantial social welfare systems in the world and ensuring there is finance to underpin it is hugely important.

It is still not clear whether all people will have them returned and the process for return has not been clarified. This is a particularly dramatic U-turn for this Government, particularly when its members all spent 18 months denying that a cull was under way. I notice the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, was not in the House when the announcement was made and he is not here now. However, since the announcement was made, there still continues to be Government disarray on the issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Alex White, who told us a few weeks ago that there was no such thing as a discretionary medical card, has said it is a collective Cabinet responsibility, for which he had no part, and now we read reports in all of today's newspapers regarding last night's Fine Gael Parliamentary Party meeting where the Minister, Deputy Reilly, told the meeting that the handling of medical cards was a disaster. He further told those present that he sought repeatedly to address the medical card issue but apparently the political will from his Cabinet colleagues was not there until last week. We now have the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy White, who are the Laurel and Hardy of this Government, passing the buck rather than taking responsibility for the whole fiasco. The fiasco is outlined in this morning's edition of The Irish Times in its coverage of the case of a family in Wicklow where a father has a rare cancer and a son has cerebral palsy and the family have been asked once again to resubmit documentation in regard to their medical card, a case that has been repeated hundreds, if not thousands, of times across the country as a direct result of the handling of this issue by the Minister, Deputy Reilly, and the Minister of State, Deputy White. This is only one case and the Minister and Minister of State are blaming someone else, and that someone else is the Minister, Deputy Howlin. All of the Fine Gael sources today are saying the lack of political will goes back to his desk and that he seems to be the person to whom the Minister, Deputy Reilly, is referring in regard to his inability to get buy-in to the solution of this problem.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	This is an extremely serious matter. At the end of last year, there was 1.849 million medical cards; 42% of the population have medical cards. There are more medical cards in circulation now than at any time in our history.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	That is cold comfort.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	I am a former Minister for Health. Every Administration has issued medical cards on the basis of the 1970 Act. It was done on a local basis determined by ability to meet medical costs. There was always a local discretion. Medical cards have been centralised in recent times. That was a decision made by the previous Administration that has been carried out. One of the things that has come to light in that is the variety in terms of the exercise of that discretion. For example, in Cork 70% over the national average in terms of medical cards were given and in Meath 70% under the national average were given. That is not equitable or fair. We need to have a system that takes account of real hardship, that is compassionate and that understands that such cases, and Deputy Calleary has instanced another one today, are unacceptable and that people who are faced with that sort of medical need should be assisted by the State. That is why the Cabinet has decided to develop a policy framework to determine eligibility in a fair and open way-----

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	-----not on the basis of where one lives in the State, which has been the condition for the past number of decades, but on objective criteria. The criteria, however, must also be linked to some financial grounding because that is the basis of the 1970 Act, or we can have a broader debate about looking at how we can afford to ensure that everybody who is sick gets comprehensive medical care for free.
#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	Sending all the applications to Cork seems to be a good solution.

The Cabinet, according to the Minister, Deputy Noonan, had a long discussion on medical cards - as did all of the Members' parliamentary parties. Some 16,000 discretionary medical cards were cut from January 2013 to April 2014. That is a cull in any language. Those are discretionary cards taken from people in the case I described, taken from children with disabilities or families coping with serious illnesses and being asked to go through the rigamarole. Again, the Minister avoided the direct question I put to him. He has answered the other question because I judge from his attitude that he may be the block to some sort of justifiable resolution to this issue. Does he have confidence in the Minister, Deputy James Reilly's ability to continue as Minister for Health? A straight "Yes" or "No" answer will suffice; there is no need for a soliloquy.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	135	First, I have full confidence in the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, and every member of this Government and I have full confidence in every Minister of State to do the job, the most difficult, challenging job that faces us all. Every Department has been faced with very difficult economic decisions to make. This Government has worked as a collective-----

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	137	-----to solve the issues to bring us from a very difficult position to a position of solvency, which we have now arrived at. We have tried to do that and have done that in as compassionate and open a way as we can. Have we made mistakes? Yes, and I agree with Deputy Calleary that the handling in terms of the administration and some of the letters people got is unacceptable. It is unacceptable to every member of Government and we need to do better. If one looks at discretionary medical cards and the general review of medical cards, there is a normal turnover. One could instance thousands being changed. Out of 1.8 million, naturally people's circumstances change and there are people who losing medical cards and new people gaining them. What we have to do is to have an objective system that works wherever one lives in the country, that is compassionate and that takes account not only of financial means, but also of health criteria.

#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	140	News that the remains of some 800 babies have been found on convent grounds in Tuam has shocked the people of Ireland. Only for the efforts of a local historian, Catherine Corless, these children would forever remain nameless in the ground, forgotten in death as they were in life. This scandal of neglect and maltreatment causing the deaths of children has understandably made headlines across the world. Unfortunately and tragically, Tuam is not an isolated case. Dozens of these homes were in operation in Ireland from the late 1880s well into the 20th century.We simply do not know how many of these mass graves might exist. Church and State cannot be allowed to abdicate responsibility in this matter. The Government must face up to this shameful period of our recent history and shine a light on the dark secrets of mother and baby homes. Citizens need to know who died and why, and the locations of their remains. Will the Government initiate a full audit of the 25,000 files currently in the possession of the Health Service Executive? We need to know how many concern illegal adoptions, who was responsible, who knew about what was happening, and what they did or did not do. What is needed now is a full public inquiry into practices at all mother and baby homes across the State. It is time to shed light on what led to the shocking infant mortality rates, the burial of untold hundreds of babies in mass graves, and the routine illegal adoption and trafficking of an unknown number of the surviving children. Can the Minister tell us today whether the Government will initiate a full public inquiry into the practices at mother and baby homes across the State?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	141	Like every Member of this House and every citizen in the country, I thought we had become inured to the things that fall out of our dark past. However, the discovery of a mass grave of infants and children is something so shocking that it jars all of us to our core. The Government is determined to get to the bottom of what exactly is the situation in Tuam. All the questions the Deputy asked must be answered not only in regard to Tuam, but also the other centres. For that reason, we have established an interdepartmental group which has already begun to meet and will report back to Government as quickly as is practicable and possible, but certainly no later than the end of this month, on how we should proceed. This Government is ruling out nothing in terms of what needs to be done. The sense almost of revulsion of the people of Ireland at the callous disregard for the most innocent of our young people has to be met with openness and clarity, which is what the Government will do.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	142	Citizens have been confronted in recent years with one revelation after another regarding the abuse of people in religious-run institutions that were supported by this State. The scale of the abuse perpetrated against Irish women and children that has been exposed by these cases is absolutely horrific. In order to get to the truth of these scandals, it was necessary to have the Commission to Inquire into Child Abuse, generally known as the Ryan commission, whose report was published in 2009, the Ferns inquiry, the Cloyne report and the Murphy report. We also had the scandal of the Magdalen laundries. The State is still failing to face up to its responsibilities in regard to the Bethany Home or to apologise to its victims. If we were to have adopted the approach the Government is now advocating in regard to the Tuam babies scandal, the various inquiries and reports to which I referred would not have seen the light of day. Is it not crystal clear, therefore, that a full public inquiry is the only conceivable course of action when confronted with the gravity of the scandal that has now come to light in Tuam?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	143	The Deputy clearly prepared her second question before she heard my answer to the first one.
#SandraMcLellan	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-party	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-dob	unknown-#SandraMcLellan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	The Minister did not indicate in his reply whether the Government will initiate a full public inquiry. That is the question I asked.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	145	We need to get to the bottom of all these issues. In the early decades of this State, attitudes towards women, particularly unmarried women, and to the most vulnerable in our society revealed again and again a shocking litany of disregard for citizens. This Government was the first, after decades, to deal with the case of the Magdalen laundry women, and I am proud of our record in addressing it. We will address this issue, too. We will address it in a comprehensive way, because it is not, as the Deputy rightly says, confined to Tuam. We need to scope out exactly what questions must be answered. We are working at this time on the records; there has been no excavation and we do not yet know what is in those graves in Tuam. We need to scope out, in a comprehensive way, what exactly needs to be examined, and that is what the interdepartmental group is doing. Its report will come to Government in a matter of weeks. It has taken decades for our country to get to the level of maturity where we look back now in shock at what happened in the past. We will have to reveal the truth about those dark days with clarity and purpose, and that is what the Government will do.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	146	I wish to raise the same issue. Like everybody else, since the news broke last week I cannot get the image out of my head of 800 tiny babies and helpless children neglected, starved and eventually discarded. I respect and acknowledge the endeavours of Catherine Corless and her committee, who initially sought to erect a memorial to the children they knew had died in the home. The extent of what they discovered, however, was way beyond what was expected and now requires so much more than a memorial or indeed an apology. Today, finally, the atrocity is being openly discussed in the national media, but I am concerned about the sanitised language that is being used when discussing it. We are hearing references to "burials" when, in fact, we are talking about bodies being disposed of in a septic tank. The discovery in the 1970s by two boys revealed the nature of the disposal of the remains. Clearly, these were not respectful burials - they were disposals, as though these children were subhuman. It is stomach-churning. The UN pulled no punches recently when it described the Magdalen laundries as places of forced labour, with slavery-like conditions. There appears to be a type of reluctant acceptance of the reality of what happened here, but the UN was able to call it what it was. We need to call it what it is in this instance and that requires clarity. Tuam was not the only mother and baby home where this type of thing happened. We already know about the Bessborough case, for example, where there were horrific stories about the mortality rates. This morning, there were repeated references in the media to what the Archbishop had to say about the Tuam revelations. I have more interest at this time in hearing what the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner have to say about it. I agree with Deputy McLellan that a public inquiry is needed, and there must be an immediate acknowledgement of that from the Government. Will the Minister commit to holding such an inquiry? Does he agree that the nature of the disposal of the bodies suggests that the intention was that their disposal remain a secret? One has to ask why that would be the case. If this septic tank was discovered anywhere else in the country other than beside a religious institution, it would already have been declared a crime scene. It begs the question of why, in fact, it has not been declared as such, which it should and must be.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	147	I agree with much of what the Deputy has said. Characterising these children as being discarded is an accurate characterisation which goes to the attitude the State had over those decades to the children of unmarried mothers. It is shocking, unacceptable and appalling, and we have to meet that in our time, as we have met other awfulness from our past. Speaking on behalf of the Government, I am ruling nothing out as to how we should proceed. We are scoping out how far this went. Whether there are other locations we need to look at needs to be determined, as well as what records exist within the HSE or religious institutions. We will scope this out in the coming weeks and come back to the House with a proposal. We will then have a proper cross-party debate, as we all want, in order to have the full truth exposed in regard to these apparently horrific events which scar our past.
#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	148	An interdepartmental scoping exercise is fine, but it has to happen in parallel with this discovery being designated a crime scene. We know that in previous cases involving mother and baby homes, drug trials took place in some instances. Did that happen in this location? Such questions need to be part of the inquiry. Could such trials have accounted for the very high mortality rates? The persons who ran the homes clearly treated the women and children there as subhuman. Not to deal with this case in an equal manner to those of other unearthed human remains reaffirms that status posthumously. No Department and no set of paper records can reveal what the Garda, the State Pathologist or forensic anthropologists can reveal.They can tell us if crimes were committed at this scene. It is possible to fully understand and to know what went on here but for that to happen, the authorities must do what they did not do before. They must act. Could drug trials have contributed to the high death rates here? Is it known if inquests were held into these deaths? What exactly is the Government inquiring into? What Departments are involved? Will the Minister declare this, or seek to have this declared, a crime scene?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	149	It is not for me to declare a crime scene. That is a matter for the Garda Síochána, the independent investigator of crime in this country. All the data need to be looked at and that is what we are determined to do in a comprehensive way, as I have indicated to the House. The interdepartmental group is meeting. A range of Departments are involved, including the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Health and the Department of Justice and Equality. There may be other Departments involved and I will get a full list of the membership to the Deputy. We do not want to embark on a process that is not comprehensive and will leave things out. These things are decades in the making. This awfulness happened many decades ago but we will now, in our time, have a comprehensive look at what happened, reveal as much truth as we can from what lies within any official records and have such inquiries as are appropriate, including criminal inquiries if that is deemed appropriate by the Garda authorities, the investigators of crime.

Will the Minister give a commitment that the Minister for Justice and Equality will come into the House within two weeks to give an update on the work of that group and on its findings and that the Cabinet will impose some sort of deadline on the group finishing its scoping work so that we can a full debate, perhaps before the end of this month?

Last July, the Taoiseach told the Dáil that the Walsh report on symphysiotomy would be published soon. In November, Judge Yvonne Murphy was appointed to examine the issue of symphysiotomy and her report was to be completed in eight weeks but neither report has been published. In a letter to Teachta Adams on 15 May, the Taoiseach said that the Minister for Health would submit his proposals to the Government in a few weeks but that was three weeks ago. When will the Minister submit his proposals to Government and when can we expect the Government to decide on its response? In regard to the forthcoming health reform Bill, will the Minister confirm if this legislation will reinstate discretionary medical cards to all those who need them and who have had them removed?

The legislation proposes that no transport operator can demand that a qualifying person, such as a citizen of Ireland, the UK, or from elsewhere within the European Economic Area who travels within the common travel area needs a passport in order to do so. Currently, this is a grey area and can cause confusion to people travelling within the common travel area as to what forms of identification are required. The common travel area comprises the Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Great Britain, the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man. Such a move would be of great benefit, in particular to business travellers. I recently met a constituent who runs his own business. He was given the opportunity at short notice to present a business case to a company in the UK, which could have generated substantial revenue for his business, but unfortunately that was not to be as he could not make the meeting. He booked a last minute flight to Birmingham, and as he had travelled to the UK in the past with a different airline using his driving licence as an acceptable form of identification, he again brought his driving licence thinking it would suffice. Unfortunately for him and his business, that form of ID was deemed unacceptable by the airline in question. As the UK is our most important trading partner and the single most important market for Irish exports, with €1 billion of traded goods now crossing the Irish Sea each week, and in light of political relations being stronger than ever, freedom of travel between the two countries with less red tape is essential. An elderly married couple in my constituency who never availed of air travel raised with me the prohibitive cost of a ten year passport. It is €95 for a passport if a person presents himself or herself at the Passport Office. They intend to travel to the UK for a family member's wedding and they are being asked for passports which they might never use again. It is stressful for them to have to pay €190 because they had not budgeted for the cost and cannot afford it. The cost is very unfair and stressful on families. It is my hope that if enacted, the new legislation will make travel between Ireland and the UK much easier, and qualifying people will no longer be required to present a passport when visiting the areas in question. Instead, a valid driver's licence, a student card, a Garda age card or a work identification card including a photograph would be accepted by all airlines. At present, a number of carriers accept other forms of identification from passengers other than a passport when travelling within the common travel area, but unfortunately there is no legislation at present to prohibit a carrier from deciding which identification it requires from passengers travelling within the common travel area. The purpose of my legislation is to put an end to the prohibitive and confusing practice. If enacted, the law will continue to allow carriers to operate identification checks for passengers but will ultimately harmonise the identification that is needed within the common travel area, thus ensuring less frustration for passengers. This week I contacted Ryanair's chief executive, Michael O'Leary, to make him aware of my Bill and to ask for his support for what I propose in light of Ryanair's recent efforts to take a more customer-friendly approach. I am hopeful the airline will welcome the Bill and allow passengers travelling within the common travel area to use the recommended acceptable forms of photographic identification instead of allowing a passport only to be used. From the point of view of convenience for citizens, the current legislation does not prohibit any carrier involved in transporting people within the common travel area from seeking appropriate confirmation of the identity of the passenger in question. The conditions regarding identity documents are stipulated by carriers and their reasons for those conditions. If enacted, the Bill would allow carriers to operate identification checks for passengers. However, for travel within the common travel area, they would no longer be allowed to insist that persons permitted to avail of transit within the common travel area are compelled to present or carry their passport. The purpose of the legislation is to promote better relations and provide easier movement for people between the North of Ireland, the Republic of Ireland, Great Britain, the Isle of Man and the Channel Islands. We can all travel with ease to the North of Ireland currently and the legislation would ensure such ease of travel by aeroplane between North and South and between the islands. Thank you again, a Cheann Comhairle. I was a little anxious on my arrival in the Chamber as I was afraid of missing my slot.

They deliver programmes to tackle poverty and social exclusion, provide assistance for enterprise creation, support the long-term unemployed, and offer education and child support in partnership with Departments and agencies. The LDCs have 20 years' experience in implementing the programmes. They have employed 1,900 staff. The Government must be answerable on its role in dismantling the system and on the provision of badly needed social supports in communities. I wish to challenge the Government on two issues. The first relates to the EU procurement directive which will now apply to LDCs and the fact they will now be put out to tender to for-profit organisations for the provision of important social services. The austerity of the past six years has taken €30 billion out of the economy and that is having a huge impact on people's lives and their communities. I question the shift in the operation of the LDCs by the Government. I question the opposition of many Labour Party Deputies to the move as they expressed support for workers in LDCs. It is disgraceful that the Government is supporting the tendering of public services to the for-profit sector. That should not happen. I would have presumed the measure would have been totally opposed by the Labour Party. The Minister responded in yesterday's debate to accusations of a lack of consultation. He said: "Any suggestion that I or my Department have not engaged in consultation simply does not stand up to scrutiny." I challenge that. SIPTU has said there were no serious, tangible discussions, debate or consultation with the SIPTU workers involved. One meeting took place in September and from then on the workers were not involved in a consultation process. Many Labour Party Deputies attended the meetings with workers and said there should be no lock-out of workers from consultation, but that is what happened. The workers were locked out and there was no serious consultation with them. The Minister should not be allowed to say otherwise.
#SeamusHealy	unknown-#SeamusHealy-party	unknown-#SeamusHealy-dob	unknown-#SeamusHealy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	If it is not broken, why fix it, is a generally accepted common sense principle which particularly applies to local development companies which have been doing Trojan work over the years. They have played a central role in developing and supporting local enterprises while sustaining jobs. They have provided local services across the country, including social inclusion programmes, while directly employing 2,000 people and supporting thousands of ancillary positions through schemes. In 2014, local development companies are expected to spend up to €50 million. There is no need whatever to change a successful system that works well. We should also extend these companies' remit into the area of RAPID funding, which the Government abolished, for disadvantaged communities which did not benefit from the so-called Celtic tiger years such as Carrick-on-Suir, Tipperary town and significant parts of Clonmel. RAPID funding for these areas has effectively been abolished. It should be put back in place and operated through the local development companies. Such funding allowed for community programmes, supports for youth services and programmes and community policing to be put in place in disadvantaged areas. The changes proposed to the delivery of local development companies will be detrimental to social inclusion and local development. I particularly object to the tendering of these services to for-profit organisations. This is an area that should be exclusively operated through local community organisations.

I know from talking to the Donegal local community development companies that they were very unsatisfied with the so-called consultation that took place with the Department and the Minister in advance of this alignment being announced. They were practically presented with a done deal and told by the Minister this is what would happen with no consultation at all. It smacks of arrogance from the Government to go ahead with these decisions that will affect 1,900 workers throughout the country and the delivery of local community development programmes. Not having any consultation makes a mockery of the whole system. A local authority being responsible for local development is a good principle if it is done properly and correctly. When the local development companies were established over 20 years ago, they should have been delivered through the local authorities which would have made them more responsive to the needs of local communities rather than having duplication. The Minister’s plan is that local authorities will not deliver local community development programmes. Instead, local authorities will just be putting out to tender the delivery of community development in their administrative areas to organisations that will be delivering the programme on a profit basis. There is no doubt the Government will go ahead with this realignment. However, it must ensure that only non-profit, locally based companies can apply for the tenders. This is the only way we can preserve the ethos of the local development companies which have so far not been operating for profit while looking to the benefit of the communities they serve rather than lining the pockets of the owners of those companies.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	185	I thank the Technical Group for giving me a few minutes to speak on this motion and I thank Fianna Fáil for putting it forward. There have been long discussions about so-called alignment between local development companies and local government. However, there has always been a grave concern about this area. Why were these local entrepreneurial companies established in the first place? They were established because local government just did not deliver. That was certainly my experience in the north side of Dublin when ordinary volunteers created bodies like the Northside Community Law Centre, the Northside Centre for the Unemployed and, in my own case, when Pat Daly and I founded the Coolock Development Council. We saw there was a significant necessity for an entrepreneurial culture to be fostered in our community to help people lift themselves up by their bootstraps and create jobs for themselves, particularly when this function was not carried out by national or local government. Accordingly, I strongly share the reservations listed in the motion. In July 2013, Smith Everett & Associates produced a useful analysis for the Irish Local Development Network which showed, for example, that between 2010 and 2012, LDCs provided a net gain for the Exchequer of more than €311 million, €7.8 million per company. LDCs have provided a range of services besides the enterprise function and job creation such as local transport initiatives, local security companies, child care and youth facilities. Up to 23,828 people were employed by LDCs in 2012, making it an important part of local development. I share the concerns expressed in this debate about for-profit, private sector companies in direct competition with LDCs which have emerged from local initiatives. The trade union movement, particularly the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and Peter Cassells, played a fundamental role in the late 1980s and early 1990s in responding to people like me who were on the ground involved in local development companies and who came forward with the process of creating Leader and other partnership programmes. We need to tread carefully in this area.

#ArthurSpring	unknown-#ArthurSpring-party	unknown-#ArthurSpring-dob	unknown-#ArthurSpring-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	187	I welcome this Fianna Fáil motion. I have been a director of the North and East Kerry Leader Partnership in the past. At the height of my community activity, I was on the board of more than 30 organisations, but I have always said the Leader partnership was the best organisation in which I was involved for three reasons, namely, unity, community and funding. It had the capacity to achieve in areas where local authorities could not. There is an inverse relationship between responsibility and having access to funding to getting projects completed. Members find it frustrating that we do not have much funding as councillors. Councillors were left with less funding than people who were on local authority organisations. My main concern is for the services provided by local development companies and the positioning of staff in the event tendering takes place. I understand this is an EU requirement in providing some of the rural development funds.Deputy Thomas Pringle made a very valid point when he stated in the event that tendering must take place, why not limit it to just not-for-profit organisations? The service provided is so community based and necessary to communities that it is better people do it because they care about their community rather than to line their pockets also. I acknowledge there is duplication in the LDCs at present. I was on the county enterprise board and many people approached us seeking information on accessing funding. We suggested that in the event that they did not get funding from the county enterprise board, they should try the north and east Kerry partnership companies. Both organisations were doing much the same thing. A greater and more transparent level of responsibility was given to the county enterprise board but neither organisation was doing anything wrong so why would one have duplication? I can see the method in trying to consolidate these issues. There is concern that local authorities would get their hands on this. I have made representations to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, on a number of occasions that if local authority members and management decide that spending this funding is at their discretion, we will lose the initiative established when the Labour Party was in government 20 years ago. It is imperative to keep the community base. There should be involvement with local authorities but the funding needs to be completely separate from what local authorities have for projects. The GoKerry tourism initiative was started in Tralee with a view to developing it throughout the county and the first place we could access funding for stimulus and moving forward was the local partnership company. At the same time the local authority was not in a position to provide any funding or to endorse it because it saw it as doing something which a State agency, Bord Fáilte, was doing at the time. There are contradictions in what is being done at present. I would prefer to see the funding isolated as much as possible. We must also consider best practice. The European Union Committee of the Regions has stated that Ireland has a very good LDC system at present. The UK implemented a tendering process and I have met people involved in trying to correct it afterwards. They felt the community was ripped out when it became a private tendering process. I urge local authorities and the Department to ensure as much as possible that the local community is at the heart of it at all times and that the funds are isolated. A total of 1,700 people are directly and indirectly employed in this and they fear for their jobs. The tendering process must be fair and transparent but it can be done in a way which recognises what is being achieved at present, and the best people to meet these requirements are the existing organisations. It is incumbent that funding is provided in a transparent way and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has a hands-on role in this regard. From what I know, it has been prescribed that the people elected from local authorities to these organisations will receive no funding, which is welcome. At least it will be community based and will not be for the profit of local authorities and their members. This is a good issue to discuss and I am delighted to have had an opportunity to contribute to the debate.
#AnthonyLawlor	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-party	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-dob	unknown-#AnthonyLawlor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	188	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this topic. Deputy Ó Fearghaíl is from the same constituency as me, where we have had a chequered history with Leader partnerships. Years back, there were three companies in Kildare, and when three companies are putting out the same pot, there are three sets of administration. Most of the money ended up going on administration. They amalgamated but the sad part about this amalgamation was that the three CEOs of the three individual companies all became part and parcel of the new amalgamation and we had another issue with regard to administration costs. I still have an issue with administration costs because up to 20% of the €250 million being allocated can be spent on administration costs. If we are really speaking about where funding should be going in communities, we should examine this area because it means €50 million is automatically taken out of the initial €250 million to be spent on administrative costs and not allocated to communities. I have reservations about this; the fund has been established to assist communities but one fifth of it will be spent on administration costs, which somewhat defeats the purpose. I very much welcome the fact that it is being brought under the auspices of the local authorities. This gives an opportunity for the public to have better scrutiny. Who has ever read in the newspapers about any Leader company meetings or reports? Journalists generally report on local authority activities so there is a better opportunity for oversight. I welcome the fact that the oversight body which will look after it has a wide variety of groups involved, not only community groups, but also educational groups, local authority management and elected members. There is a huge delay between a project being initiated and getting a grant and this puts off groups proposing projects. I welcome the fact they will all be under the one body, so assistance can be given to community groups not only with applying for funding, but also with planning permission and any environmental issues which involves dealing with the local authority. This is a positive. I would welcome a unified system throughout the country whereby the processes are similar for community groups applying for projects in various areas. We are still waiting for some projects, which applied and were passed by boards in May or June 2013, to be approved by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. This is unacceptable. If a project is worthy of funding, then whatever assistance can be given by whoever gets the tender should be speeded up as quickly as possible. There is also a need for checks and balances. We see ridiculous projects being allocated huge amounts of money which have no bearing on why the overall scheme was established. I have seen it in County Kildare. There does not seem to be any logic and we need more checks and balances. I hope the overarching body in the local authorities will have a major say in this. I welcome this measure because amalgamation within local authorities will assist community groups. Those applying for tenders will more than likely have experience and I agree such experience should be taken on board. It is important the projects are processed as quickly as possible.

Putting People First, the action programme for effective local government, aims to institute a system of local government which will drive economic, social and community development, while at the same time representing value for money and representing citizens fairly. Key changes envisioned include the establishment of local community development committees and a new role for local development companies as part of these revised arrangements. With €250 million to be spent between now and 2020, it is imperative that the new structures are fit for purpose and achieve the required results for local communities. I welcome the artisan food scheme which will be operated by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but the vast bulk of the expenditure, €235 million of the €250 million, will be spent under the Leader element of the programme.The local community development programmes have been at the heart of the delivery of social and economic recovery programmes, including innovative and invaluable social services, as well as supports for enterprise and job creation. This programme will continue to be delivered by a partnership between community representatives, local authorities, local development bodies and State agencies. Local government has been central in delivering local community development programmes. However, in the current economic climate, it is imperative that each arm of Government is as streamlined and effective as possible. Recent changes in local government structures saw the number of councillors in the country reduced from slightly more than 1,600 to slightly fewer than 950 and the number of local authorities from 114 to 31. Similarly, in the past five years, the number of partnership and Leader companies has reduced from almost 100 to 50. Ongoing evaluations of the various programmes such as the local development social inclusion programme and the community development programme resulted in changes that aimed to reduce overhead costs while maximising money available for front-line delivery. I understand that the past two years have been times of great uncertainty in partnership companies across the State. The four-year local community development programme came to an end in December 2013 and a one-year transitional extension was put in place until the new social inclusion programme gets under way in 2015. However, the uncertainty that surrounded the future of the local community development programme and the transitional phase until the social inclusion programme gets under way has caused huge difficulties for local communities seeking to get projects completed under the old plan. In County Galway, community groups, such as those in Barnadearg and Ballyglunin, found it almost impossible to get information on the prospects of their projects receiving funding and still are experiencing significant difficulties in accessing information about their applications. I believe the experience of community groups in the past two years will put off many groups from applying for funding in future and there is a real danger that the communities most in need of help, sometimes also those with least resources at their disposal, will lose out in terms of funding, while the larger community groups, now established on a semi-professional footing, will be better placed to find their way through the maze of bureaucracy that faces groups seeking funding. I am sure these issues will be discussed fully in the new public participation networks but there is a danger that these will turn into talking shops for the most voluble and visible community groups and that the voice of very small communities will be lost in the din. In my experience, lack of communication with groups who have made applications for funding has been a real problem and a cause of great anxiety for community groups fearful that if their project is not completed by the year end, it may not fit the parameters of the new programme and they could be left in a very difficult position with a half-finished project and little prospect of further funding. The cumbersome nature of the system is another frustration for local groups, especially the delay between the time the group incurs the expenditure and receives payment. I am aware of instances in which small community groups were presented with a checklist of more that 120 items before a grant could be paid. While I understand the need to ensure value for money in the delivery of grants, there is a tipping point beyond which it becomes too difficult for a small community group to meet the many and varied requirements of the local partnership company in accessing grants. I believe the vision of Putting People First is commendable but Members must ensure that those words are reflected in the everyday operations of the various programmes and that local communities, not bureaucratic systems, are paramount in the local development systems.
#MichelleMulherin	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-party	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-dob	unknown-#MichelleMulherin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	190	First, I welcome the €250 million that has been provided under the Leader element of the rural development programme between 2014 and 2020. This Leader programme will have a significant impact on and provide potential benefit to the region I serve, County Mayo, as well as for the west and for rural areas in particular. As the money is there, it is a question of it being used and applied in the right way in order to derive the maximum return therefrom. The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas chaired by Pat Spillane issued its report a number of weeks ago. While it set out a stark picture regarding the challenges facing rural Ireland, it also set out, very hopefully, means and methods that might be tried to address the decline of rural Ireland and that might enable the creation now of a sustainable future for the peoples of rural Ireland. It also set out that this is an element of our country, including these people and this lifestyle, that we cherish. The Leader programme can be one strand used to ensure a sustainable future for rural Ireland and I welcome this. It is evident in the areas of economic and social development in rural areas such as tourism. In my experience, however, it is about building up communities, making sure they are viable and that such communities frequently act together in concert to deliver a project or an activity in their area and this funding allows them to do that. While preparatory work on the new Leader programme is well under way, I acknowledge the significant reduction in funding available in this round of Leader funding will pose its own challenges, adjustments and changes, which are required to draw up a programme. This will mean, first and foremost, the maximum benefit for the front-line services that the Leader programme is required to deliver for the people living in rural areas and for economic development in those areas. As this plan is fleshed out and as the preparatory work formalises further, it must examine the essence of what worked in Leader. I am referring here to local knowledge and staff in Leader companies who were prepared to visit and work with communities that were operating on a voluntary basis, to animate them, get them interested and see the results on the ground. One major challenge for the local authority in respect of alignment is that it too must go to the same extremes or ends to engage with those communities. However, it is welcome that by bringing in the local authority, one in effect is introducing the democratically-elected representatives, coupled with community input, into the decision-making process. There is potential there and it would be a shame not to get it right and for the skills and experience that have been amassed, as well as those links deep into the community, not to be preserved as the form of the delivery of the Leader programme changes. More particularly, in line with references made by previous speakers, I refer to delays in the payment of Leader grants. I ask the Minister, Deputy Hogan, to refer in particular to the Mayo North East Leader Partnership Company. I have made scores of representations on behalf of individuals, community organisations and businesses that are trying to get funds which, they believe, have been sanctioned. On the one hand, they are being told by the company that the delay is with the Department while on the other hand, the Department has told them it is the responsibility of the company. It is like ping-pong and some of this has been going on since the company was placed under the supervision of the Department in February 2013. I still cannot get answers and would like the Minister to take a particular interest in this regard. There are businesses that are out on a limb and which need that funding to grow their business. This is what the money is for and the position is highly unsatisfactory. Issues such as this and this blockage in particular must be addressed.
#SeanKyne	unknown-#SeanKyne-party	unknown-#SeanKyne-dob	unknown-#SeanKyne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	191	I welcome this debate on the future of the Leader programme. In common with many former members of local authorities, I have served on the board of a number of Leader companies, including the Galway Rural Development Company and Forum Connemara. My experience of both companies but particularly Forum Connemara, on the board of which I served latterly, was that they were exceptional companies, doing great work with great staff and which were involved in the community approach from the bottom up. They involved themselves in support, in identifying and promoting projects and I certainly hope this will continue, whatever reform takes place. I welcome the allocation of 7% of the rural development programme to Leader, which is 2% over the minimum. This will allow €235 million to be spent in the period up to 2020. In addition, two schemes will be funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, which will bring total expenditure to €250 million. As I stated, the Leader companies have provided great support to projects but I can perceive a role for the local authorities in trying to ensure better value for money and that more money will be available for the projects themselves, rather than on their administration.Many details remain to be ironed out on the role of the SECs and the future and still undecided role of elected members who, like me, used to serve on the board of Leader companies and whether they will have an oversight role. In their view, they have been elected and as such have a greater insight into the needs of their communities. Will the role of elected members be confined to an audit role? I am interested to know the final details which will be ironed out in the negotiations with the ILD and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. I refer to issues in the past in my area of Connemara with Meitheal Forbartha na Gaeltachta which went into liquidation. Its role was taken over by Comhar na nOileán which is doing a good job. There was an unfortunate time lag with regard to the provision of funding in the Gaeltacht area. The Department and the Minister is anxious that all funding is expended but, unfortunately, in my view, there was an over-redistribution of funds from the Gaeltacht areas to other areas in the country which has not been addressed. I have identified to the Minister this issue of a funding shortfall in the Gaeltacht area which, in my view, needs to be investigated. I appreciate what happened was outside the control of the Minister and the Department but the time lag was unfortunate and by the time Comhar na nOileán was up and running, the scheme was put into abeyance pending the review. Unfortunately, the allocations were redistributed. Other speakers have mentioned that there should be an allocation over and above the 100% allocation to ensure that those projects which fall by the wayside will have sufficient funding to spend. Another issue of concern raised at meetings is that the Leader companies are private companies which cannot be scrapped by the Minister. They carry out a range of services under the auspices of the HSE and the Department of Social Protection, such as meals on wheels and rural social schemes, and these will not be affected by any changes enacted by the realignment. This is an important point which is not widely publicised and concerns about the realignment are being expressed by elderly people and participants in the schemes. Letterfrack is more than one hour away from County Buildings in Galway, the same distance as Dublin to Dundalk or to Gorey, and it would not happen in that case. There is a concern that the local structure, the bottom-up approach which has served Connemara and the Letterfrack area well, needs to be retained. The islands have been served by Comhar na nOileán. Those who live on the islands believe they have more in common with other islands than with the people living on the mainland. For example, the Aran islands and Inishbofin would have more in common with each other than with Connemara. Their existing structures should be maintained and they should be able to engage at board level for the good of all the islands.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	192	This Government is reforming the delivery of our local and community development agenda, a process that has been greatly needed for a number of years. We had a stale system and now we need a more joined-up approach to the delivery of supports and services to local communities in the context of reducing resources. Over the years and particularly since we joined the EU, rural Ireland's farms, villages and towns have increasingly lost autonomy. The face-to-face human interaction is nearly gone with the co-ordinates of community nearly a thing of the past. A wide range of factors have caused the diminishing of local communities, such as the ban on turf cutting. Post offices, police stations, small schools and many other central aspects of vibrant local life are being centralised, with even water services being centralised under Irish Water. At the root of the profound malaise in Irish society is, as the first director of the Institute of Public Administration, the late Tom Barrington, identified back in 1992, the "civic deficit" in Ireland, which involves the leaching away of people power in its transfer to the power hoarders of central government. The civic deficit is not a single thing; it is the accumulation of the deficits and liabilities over the assets in our civic culture. The civic culture contains in itself a number of intertwining subcultures, the civic, the democratic, the institutional and the moral. At the root of this civic deficit is our very impoverished view of what it means to be an Irish citizen. It is, therefore, a very challenging task to analyse and combat the causes of the malaise in Irish local communities and in our bounded places, those places in which we feel known and know, where we experience connection and draw nourishment, where we feel at home and from which we have something to offer the wider world because the universal truths concerning humankind are to be discovered in the local and the parochial. In this task, Leader boards and Leader funding are vitally important and relevant. Last April, the Taoiseach launched a new report entitled, Energising Ireland's Rural Economy, by the Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas. The commission is chaired by Mr. Pat Spillane and was established in 2012 to make recommendations on ways to revive rural Ireland. It showed that Irish towns and villages and their rural hinterlands have never before been under such threat. We need debate and action for rural Ireland which needs to look at itself and to see what it can do to stem the tide of decline. In rural towns and villages 100 Garda stations, 200 banks, 100 schools and 1,300 pubs have closed. In addition to these closures, emigration and unemployment have contributed much to rural decline with organisations like the GAA being badly affected. We are on the cusp of a new digital era and we are strategically placed from a geographic, infrastructural and knowledge perspective to herald the dawn of the next phase of Ireland's economic growth. If we do not take urgent action, such as the appointment of a Minister for rural affairs, a two-tier nation is developing in Ireland where young vibrant cities sit uneasily beside ageing rural communities increasingly reliant on State supports to survive. We need to confront very realistically the factors influencing rural decline today. We know about the high number of suicides in rural areas which are caused by rural isolation. All those issues and many more need to be addressed by the Government. I hope that when the Taoiseach is reshuffling his Cabinet he will see fit to appoint-----

The Taoiseach is a rural Taoiseach and we should not take our eye off the ball because rural Ireland is in serious decline and action needs to be taken urgently to rectify this situation. We all hear those stories. We have seen the dreadful situation across the country whereby local government was reformed. All the least populated counties across the western seaboard lost a great number of public representatives. County Longford has had a council since the foundation of the State, with 21 members plus nine town councillors, but this has been reduced to 18. The same applies in Westmeath, Roscommon, Leitrim and elsewhere. In the interests of rural Ireland we cannot allow this situation to continue.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	I agree with Deputy Bannon that the so-called reform of local government has been a disaster for rural areas. The number of councillors in County Cavan has been reduced from 25 to 18, leaving the county with the same number of councillors as other counties with less than half its population. The Government's decision to abolish town councils was also disgraceful. Moreover, the number of councillors representing less populated areas has declined, leaving large rural areas without any public representative, whether from a political party or an independent. The core community partnership ethos of community development companies in providing Leader companies must be maintained. Local community development companies have played an important role in supporting local enterprise and providing services nationwide. Government decisions are leading to the dismantling of local decision making in the statutory and community sectors. Local development companies have been in place for upwards of 20 years. Their origins lie in the original 12 employment partnerships, the pilot areas for the first Leader programme, integrated resource development, IRD, groups and the subsequent extension of these programmes in the period from 1994 to 1999. Subsequent restructuring processes resulted in a reduction in the number of companies through amalgamations and the integration of the former community development programme into this structure. This was a welcome development as the Leader programme evolved.  In all of that time, the local development companies have continued to provide a range of valuable services to their local communities, whether in the rural context through the delivery of the Leader programme, which has been successfully rolled out throughout rural areas by the local development companies, or in the local and community development programme, which targets disadvantage wherever it is found and has, particularly in this round, focused its response on the unemployed and people on low incomes generally.  Local development companies also provide a range of services to the Department of Social Protection, focusing on those who are hardest to reach and, by definition, in most need of assistance. The Tús initiative works with unemployed people in all areas of the State, providing them with valuable employment and skills retention opportunities, while enabling them to undertake worthwhile work in local communities. Up to 7,500 people are engaged in this activity at any time.  The local development companies contribute to local economies in many different ways, for example, through enterprise and other development work via the Leader programme, which provides grant aid for bottom up development initiatives in the community and business sectors of the local economy. This is enhanced through the local and community development programme which promotes learning, training, job-seeking skills and supports unemployed people to become self-employed. Last year alone in my county, Breffni Integrated Limited recorded 132 fully completed business start-ups, which were fully established and registered tax compliant businesses with research and written business plans. Local development companies are also significant local employers, providing employment to close to 2,000 people in the sector nationally in addition to those participating in employment schemes. In County Cavan, for instance, almost 300 people are employed under the auspices of Breffni Integrated Limited.  Despite embracing the alignment process, local development companies have been frustrated by the lack of real engagement or progress made during their participation. I recall a meeting with representatives of the Monaghan and Cavan integrated development groups last August, at which they expressed serious frustration at the lack of consultation by the Minister and Department in the new alignment process. Local development companies have significant concerns about the process. It appears, for example, that it is not necessary under European Union regulations due to the nature of the work concerned regarding tendering. Furthermore, recently supplied information indicates that each county is to be treated as one lot for tendering purposes, despite some local development companies in larger urban and rural counties covering only part of their respective counties. Notwithstanding extensive and ongoing participation at national level and the processes in place to progress the alignment process, the local development companies have not been able to establish the role intended for them in Leader programme delivery in the period from 2015 onwards. The position of the local development companies remains that they are the local action groups.  It is important to compliment all those who have served on local development companies since their establishment in the 1990s. The companies are managed by voluntary boards, which have come together at the behest of the Government to deliver a range of programmes. They have standard memorandums and articles of association, which have been prescribed by government and can only be changed with the prior approval of the Minister. It is important to maintain the continuity and successful structures of programmes that have been shown to work. I refer, in particular, to the Cavan-Monaghan Leader programme and the Monaghan and Breffni integrated companies.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	196	I thank Deputy Éamon Ó Cuív for tabling the motion and making a number of proposals in his contribution yesterday. Local development companies have played a critical role in supporting local enterprise and providing services in communities nationwide, particularly in rural areas. Many people in rural areas are concerned about the practice of placing certain programmes within the remit of local authorities and contracting out other programmes. The Dáil must defend the core community partnership ethos of the local development companies. When Deputies raise with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government issues related to rural social schemes, the Tús scheme or community employment schemes, they receive a standard reply to the effect that the matter raised is one for the Minister for Social Protection. These schemes form part of a core group that comes within a single umbrella. Various communities have organised the schemes in such a way as to ensure they deliver significant benefits in the locality. The one-size-fits-all approach will not work in large counties such as Cork, Galway, Donegal and Mayo. Moreover, Gaeltacht areas and island communities present particular challenges. The Great Western Greenway is a good example of a successful project that has been developed by communities which have worked together. The greenway is used by thousands of people every year and those involved are looking forward to the summer season. Communities in County Galway are considering making applications for funding for new greenways which offer great potential and scope for development. Community centres are also being provided in rural areas. In March last, the Tánaiste opened a new community centre in my parish of Caltra for which €500,000 had been allocated by the Galway Rural Development Company. These are examples of positive developments in rural areas that face many difficulties. As many of us heard during the recent elections, there has been a downturn in economic activity. Rural development companies have greatly helped to address this problem.  On the issue of alternative sources of funding, I approached the Arts Council seeking funding for various projects. Although restricted in terms of the types of projects it can fund, the Arts Council provided welcome assistance to various arts groups in Galway city. However, it did not provide any funding for various festivals held in smaller towns in County Galway. I am sure the same applies in other areas. It is instructive that when Deputy Éamon Ó Cuiv was Minister for Rural, Community and Gaeltacht Affairs, he provided additional funding for the CLÁR and RAPID programmes. The level of flexibility that applied to this funding reassured people. Under a special strategy, towns such as Tuam were designated hubs and health, education and transport services benefited. Communities that bought into this approach are now worried about the funding being allocated to hubs. Sport in rural areas has benefited greatly from funding under the various programmes.This weekend the senior football championship starts off in Galway, with ten games over Friday, Saturday and Sunday. Twenty teams, through their voluntary input, will be putting their best players forward, and I would say every one of those clubs has got help through the community employment schemes, the rural social schemes, the Tús schemes and job initiative schemes. That is the kind of assistance that I like to see happening. It is happening for a co-operative mart that might need a road into its premises. It is happening for projects, such as, hopefully, "The Quiet Man" project in Ballyglunin where a railway station and a theatre is being provided, and in Barnaderg where a community fighting for its post office also has an ambitious project in under the rural development programme. That is the way to go. It is frustrating to hear Leader companies have not enough funding, even at the start of the year, where they are told that they will be losing funding. I wonder, if something is working well, why should the Minister change it. I cannot agree that we should have development companies in competition with each other. There are great volunteers in all of these organisations. There should be more progress made by these companies. If they were told how their applications are progressing, it would help greatly.

Like others, I thank Deputy Ó Cuív for his foresight in bringing to the floor of this House the concerns of many communities and enterprises across the country and in providing an opportunity to put the case to the Minister, Deputy Hogan, and the Government that at this late stage it is not too late to pull back, turn around and come forward with a different proposal. It is clear that the vast majority of those involved in the distribution of Leader funds and those who receive them believe what the Minister is doing is wrong and it is not too late to change. It is not broken and I cannot understand why the Minister is trying to fix a system that has worked exceptionally well. I, too, reject the approach that the Minister or the Department has taken in trying to undermine the Leader companies by publishing their expenses and salaries in a way to somehow suggest that the administrative costs are out of kilter with the work that is being done.

#TimDooley	unknown-#TimDooley-party	unknown-#TimDooley-dob	unknown-#TimDooley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	199	That press release and briefing failed to take cognisance of the huge knock-on effect of those who work in the administration of these companies, their efforts and their work in bringing volunteers together. If one took the entire sum of the activity of the paid and the voluntary together, it would be minuscule by comparison to the way in which other entities of State operate based on output and return. It was a low point by the Government in an effort to undermine the work that was done to put it down to cost and present some of the figures without really recognising the immense amount of work that is done. I am aware at first hand of the work that the Clare Local Development Company does and the voluntary effort that is put in by so many and I can tell the Minister without fear of contradiction that the costs are minuscule by comparison to the voluntary effort that is energised as a result of these professionals working in their community. In County Clare alone, in the past five years 722 enterprises have been supported, 517 jobs have been created, 1,657 persons have been trained and 119 communities have been supported. That is a significant body of vitally important work that cannot be done by any other State organisation. Deputy Bannon makes an impassioned plea to the Taoiseach, who is a rural man and needs to recognise that rural communities need support. Deputy Bannon is correct; they do. Step by step, rural communities are being eroded by the policies being implemented by the Government. If Deputy Bannon is true to his word and true to what he stated here today, which will be for transmission to his local community, he should have the confidence of his conviction, walk through the lobbies with us today and send a message to the Minister and the Taoiseach that he is not prepared to see his community isolated in the way that will result from this decision. Then Deputy Bannon will be standing up for his community. Then his words will not be hollow. They will not be meaningless. However, if Deputy Bannon expects to be reported on local radio or in his local newspaper tomorrow as having made a great stand for his local community and he still votes the Government amendment through, that is farcical.

He is a bright and intelligent man. His community is bright and intelligent and it will respect him if he supports our effort to reject a proposal that goes too far. The alignment process is all fine on paper but the fact is that the Minister will lose the voluntary input. The Minister should point out to me where else local authorities are involved in community activity where they have all that voluntary support. He knows it does not happen. It will not happen and it will be eroded here. The Minister need only look to his own councillors, and councillors across the country. In the county I know best, the Fine Gael, Labour, Independent and Fianna Fáil councillors who were there at the time all rejected out of hand these proposals and they voted against them in their own chamber. That sends a strong message. It is unusual for politicians to state that they do not want the power. Quite the contrary, if they thought that they could do it better, they would have grabbed it and they would have got involved in it. However, they see that it would remove the voluntary effort and it would ultimately lead to a reduction in the service and an erosion of the good work that is being done. Councillors and those involved in the communities believe that, ultimately, the Leader funding will find its way into the general Local Government Fund and Leader funding will be used for services that are already being provided. It is difficult to convince them otherwise. They paid a property tax this year.

It was collected on the basis that it was going to provide services to local communities - they talked about street lights, footpaths and green areas - and the entirety of the tax was used to establish Irish Water. Deputy Hogan's Department has history on this and, unfortunately, it is difficult to convince people that there is not the same smash-and-grab approach here to smash what is working and grab the funding used to fund other services. I am disappointed in the Minister. I am very disappointed in Deputy Bannon if he is not prepared to support us on this.

I thank my party's agriculture spokesman, An Teachta Ó Cuív, for putting down the motion because it affords us the opportunity to debate in the House what is a very important issue at this time. I am sure there was opposition to the concept of Leader companies and partnerships and their establishment a number of years ago simply for the sake of opposition but their track record of performance in the intervening time has demonstrated how wise was the decision to set up such a structure. Particularly with the Common Agricultural Policy Pillar 2 funding, which is an integral part of the support for agriculture and rural areas in the country, we need a specific agency that is able to cater for the types of projects which would be eligible to apply for such grant aid. The idea of subsuming these partnership companies under the general umbrella of the local authorities needs to be reconsidered. It is entirely undesirable to have them as part of the local authority administrative structure where issues relating to development proposals in a functional area can become the subject of a motion of censure or criticism at local authority meetings. The potential for undermining the entrepreneurial spirit across the rural parts, and, indeed, urban parts, of the country is real and potentially damaging, and needs to be considered. The administrative cultures that one will get with partnership companies and local authorities are diametrically different. Development officers who have to interview individuals in their communities, who invite in individuals with their different entrepreneurial and development projects, have to meet them to consider matters. They must look to see what sort of support is available to them. One should look at the statistics for any of the areas across Ireland today. I am looking at those of my county in the constituency of Louth-East Meath.I requested these statistics in recent days. In the period from 2009 to 2010, approximately 700 people either gained employment or became self-employed. That was at a time when the economy was labouring; the recession had hit us and the potential for creating jobs was at a low ebb. Those statistics tell us about the work the Louth Leader Partnership was doing during that period.  From 2011 to 2013, some 3,716 individuals were supported, while 17,082 young people were engaged in particular programmes. In addition, some 540 local community groups were supported, while 815 people participated in education courses. Some 2,690 people participated in labour market training, while 933 people were supported into employment or self-employment. Those statistics graphically underline the importance of maintaining the status quo as regards this developmental administration structure which has a successful track record. I am sure there were individual circumstances around the country whereby, due to a combination of other elements, some companies were not as successful as others. However, we now need to examine best practice templates for running such development programmes. It is not a good idea to bring them under the umbrella of local authorities, so the matter needs to be reconsidered. At a time when we require change and need to be seen to take political action in particular areas, the whole idea of quango hunting should be reconsidered. There may be small, cost-effective companies that are doing an excellent job of work, but an annual value-for-money assessment of them is needed. Those are the criteria to be used in order to decide what structures will be required in future.
#MichaelMoynihan	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-party	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-dob	unknown-#MichaelMoynihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	211	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate. Local and community development programmes constitute a major issue for rural Ireland. There is concern among many such companies across the spectrum regarding the realignment process. It goes back nearly 25 years to when the integrated development companies and, later, the Leader companies were being set up. Suspicions were raised at the time by local authorities with the Department of the Environment and since then local councils have been trying to get local development companies under their wings. The proposal is a retrograde step because local development companies have done excellent work across the country. This is borne out by the amount of work they have done in rural communities, including the rural community I serve. The companies have established a standard of excellence in the services they provide in my area, including Duhollow and Ballyhoura, which is second to none. They deal with a raft of issues. The debate on the realignment process has been going on since the end of 2012. I am disappointed that the Minister, Deputy Hogan, has left the Chamber because I wanted to put some points clearly to him. Will he ensure that the criteria for selection of local action groups to develop local strategic plans will be drawn up so that existing Leader groups are neither disadvantaged, constrained nor prevented from winning any Leader tendering or selection process? That is the fundamental issue. Will existing Leader groups that have operated successfully as local action groups for the past 20 or 25 years be supported to draw up their community-based local strategy plans for Leader and submit them to the Department for approval? Will they be allowed to implement and administer the delivery of all aspects of those plans? That question is fundamental to this debate.  Every Deputy knows at first hand the work undertaken by Leader companies. We can look back to the 1960s with the start of urbanisation in Irish society, but the Leader companies came from the EU and adopted a bottom-up approach which was applauded across the country. That approach has also been praised across the continent as being the best model to deliver funding. Ireland has now decided, however, that local development programmes will be centralised and realigned within local authorities. Under the proposed new system, parts of Cork and Kerry could not be realigned under any local authorities. The same applies to Ballyhoura which will be covering Cork and Limerick. European funding of Leader programmes has been of great benefit to communities across the country, with regard to enterprise, job protection and community-based facilities and groups. People working in Leader companies go out at night to meet local community representatives and discuss plans with them. With the greatest respect to local authorities, I cannot see their staff doing the donkey work that Leader staff have been doing over the years. It is as if there are no boundaries within Leader companies when they examine issues and try to develop projects for funding. They deliver such projects extremely well.  The Minister should examine the proposed plans. Earlier in the debate we were told of what has happened to local representation with people moving eastwards, including in County Cork. There is a centralisation process under way, whether or not it is intentional. The abolition of town councils and the reduction of seats in Cavan, north Cork, west Cork and parts of Kerry and Clare are putting those people last because their representation has been reduced. We must be serious about this because I do not think the realignment will achieve anything. There is a constant drive towards centralisation by policy-makers and departmental staff. We centralised the medical card applications and made an utter mess of them. We also centralised the student support grant scheme and it took nearly two years to correct it. The best possible way to organise the work of such action groups is to have them locally based. They are challenged daily on the work they are doing. People may ask if policies are correct but local people are on the boards, so they know what is best for their communities. Those people are working on a voluntary basis and are best placed to make decisions on local projects.  Some parts of the Duhallow region are 45 miles from county hall. My fear is that if such programmes are centralised those at the periphery will be looked after last. Local Leader groups and other community action groups can look after people's needs.  Issues arose recently about the rural transport scheme but the Department is now rowing back on it somewhat, saying that a mistake was made. This is particularly so in County Cork which is a giant administrative area. If this realignment of development programmes goes ahead, within four or five years or even less, people will realise the damage that was done. Leader is working and the European Court of Auditors has said it is a great scheme. Many new EU accession countries are looking at Ireland as the best model for delivering Leader funding, but in our wisdom we have decided to realign it under the aegis of local authorities.In 1988 and 1989, when this first came into vogue, it was to be under the local authorities and was to be a ground-up approach. I appeal to the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, who is here on behalf of the Department. In the response she is to give I would like her to address those issues, because they are fundamental to how we progress. Questions have been asked about a raft of issues, and the Leader funding approach has been best practice. It has been an outstanding advocate for small, rural communities. I am not just talking about my area. In recent months I had reason to travel around the country and met people in Mayo, Cavan and Sligo. I saw communities that were almost dead, had lost the post office and the pub, but where a community hall had been built. It has also happened in my area. The Department closed some schools due to insufficient numbers, realignment or centralisation. In my area, Glosh, some schools were closed 40 years ago. They have gone in there and are revitalising the community by putting in a fundamental, community-based structure. I appeal to the Minister to revoke these points. Some three or four weeks ago I raised it on Leaders' Questions and there was a discussion about whether the Leader network was negotiating with the Department. The Department knows the Leader companies' position on this and need not wait for any further submissions. The Department knows they are at loggerheads. It is time to step back with cool heads and ensure we do not lose what has been so vital to rural communities in the past 25 years.

It has allowed the Government clearly to explain its position and deal with the inaccuracies in the public domain. The Government is committed to delivering effective local and community development for all rural and urban communities. As detailed by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Hogan, in his contribution to the House yesterday evening, he continues to value the contribution of local development companies throughout Ireland and looks forward to supporting their continuing role within a more joined-up approach to local development. The Minister believes the companies’ strength lies in their ability very directly to support and build the capacity of their communities - many speakers gave examples of this in their areas - and he sees this role continuing into the future. The Minister’s local government reforms are not about playing to the gallery but creating sustainable models of local and community development where all participants, whether local government or local development, work in partnership to serve the communities. The Minister is dismayed at the level of misinformation and apparent misunderstanding that appears to prevail regarding his plans to reform both local government and the local development sector. If we do not modernise and support a local government system with a mandate and role that allows it to lead development activity, we will be prioritising structures over people and the delivery of effective services. The new local community development committees will comprise stakeholders from local government, local development, State agencies and the community and voluntary sector. Nominees will be sought by the chief officer of the committee working alongside the council’s corporate policy group, and will be sought from the nominating bodies themselves, for example, the new public participation networks. Contrary to what was stated last night, the county manager cannot choose the members himself or herself. One of the primary reasons for reforming the delivery of local development support is to address corporate governance and value for money concerns at a local level. The new systems will ensure the maximum proportion of the funding available to local communities goes to provide support for projects in those communities and is not directed towards administration and management costs. The local community and development programme, LCDP, successor programme, the social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, is one of the Department’s key priorities and is required to be subject to a public procurement process. This will be competitive and open to all local development companies, other not-for-profit community groups and commercial firms. Each local authority area will represent a separate lot. In particular, the process will ensure that there is an initial pre-qualification process or stage one. The objective of this is to identify all potential entities interested and eligible to deliver the new programme irrespective of the location of where tendering companies are headquartered. Again, contrary to what was stated in the House yesterday evening, the SICAP development process included a consultation process in April 2014 on the SICAP framework and included stakeholder meetings and an online survey. The local development strategy selection process for Leader will be an open process. The decision-making component of Leader implementation will be constituted so that neither public authorities nor any single interest group can represent more than 49% of the voting rights. In addition, funding which is designated for local and community development initiatives will be ring-fenced and will not be used for any other purpose. I will ask the Minister to respond directly to Deputy Moynihan's questions to which he needs very clear answers. The Minister is working with representatives of the island communities to ensure their unique needs are recognised. I reject the notion that local authorities cannot engage with communities. Elected members are the essence of representative democracy and are perfectly prepared to work in partnership with representatives of participative democracy, which we are enabling. The Minister also wishes to convey his overall determination to ensure the support for local and community development will be effective, efficient and, most importantly, centred on the needs of local communities.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	213	While some of the Minister of State's points answered some of the points I made, she was told the SICAP would have to go out to tender, and that is why I did not raise the issue yesterday. Leader also had to be put out to tender last time, and we did so. The problem is this will never capture the public imagination because the devil is in the detail. The last time, the winning companies had to have a partnership board under EU rules because the decision making was staying with the board. While we could go to tender, the only people who could win the tenders were those who could prove they had a partnership board. Therefore, contrary to what can happen under SICAP, it was impossible for a private company with a non-partnership board to win the tender. It had to have community representatives such as social partners and statutory agencies. Although it must go out to tender, it does not have to do so in its current form. I am disappointed in the reply, since I led with a detailed speech that dealt with many matters last night. The tendering process was not dealt with last night. People are being asked to tender for lots when they do not know what they are - "lot" is a technical term to describe the geographic area in which the service will be provided. The tendering companies are not being told what the breakdown of the lots within an area will be and, therefore, companies are submitting imaginary, fantasy tenders, trying to out-think the Department. This is the antithesis of openness and transparency. Last night, I suggested that rather than bulldoze ahead we pause for a moment. Reluctantly, I accept the LCDPs are there, under legislation passed by the House. Nevertheless, there are ever-growing problems with the mechanics of the process we are following. As I said, the tender requirements will make it virtually impossible for the island companies to bid because they do not have the numbers of employees required by the tender documents to make a bid. We are talking about 3,000 people spread across four counties. In other cases, people do not know what they are bidding for because they do not know what the lots are. I have suggested we suspend the tendering process and, like in the game of "Monopoly", we return to "Go", and start again at the point of tendering. We should bring before an Oireachtas committee for detailed scrutiny the breakdown of the areas that will have companies and agree them before going to tender. Where necessary, we should allow cross-county companies to exist if that is the best arrangement for geographic reasons. We should sort out how many local community development committees will be used and that should not be the decision of either a majority of a council or a county manager. I have pointed out the very obvious case of County Galway. The east of the county has fertile and flat land, with English-speaking locals, whereas half the locals in the west of the county speak Irish and the terrain is mountainous and rough. The topography is as different as two parts of any county can be. The west's population ratio compared with that of the east is 9:30, and 50% of the people in the west of the county speak Irish. The county stretches from the River Suck in Ballinasloe through to Slyne Head, and when we tried to amalgamate the county, it did not work and the western part of the county lost out. The Government should have decided to treat the west of Galway separately from the east. It is extraordinary as Galway is the only county in Ireland where one cannot drive from one part of the functional area to another - from the west to the east - without going through another local authority area. One either has to go through Galway city, which is a local authority in its own right, or through County Mayo. The other option is to take a boat. That is the extent of the geographic separation. Somebody made a decision that a county so big and diverse should be one LCDC, and I understand that is the preference of the county manager. If it went before councillors, why would the 30 vote against the nine? There is a successful company in Duhallow which has expanded into different counties. Why break this if it is working? We must decide where the LCDCs and companies are before going to tender. With regard to tender documents, it is not always true that small is inefficient or does not suit and everything must be a standard size in this country. Counties are an asymmetrical group of historical entities but we still accept them for what they are. Companies delivering the services should be partnerships, and it is not good enough that we could wind up with service delivery for social inclusion, Leader, Tús or the rural social scheme that is owned by a private multinational company which has a headquarters anywhere it wants. The process would no longer be embedded in the community if such a company made a successful bid. Many professional so-called charity companies and service providers have a particular expertise in filling out tender forms, and such expertise may be missing from some much more grounded companies. I used to rail against this when I was a Minister, as local people may not have the correct experience of filling out tender documents, which are getting ever more technical and complicated, to the satisfaction of the people who will adjudicate the tender on an objective scoring basis. I hated what I termed the essay question and I tried to eliminate them as far as I could when I was a Minister. The form would ask why a club needed a new dressing room or if an applicant could point out social exclusion in a community. Some people knew the formula and officials told me what was the correct information to give, such as that a club would give a football team free meals or gear. I have never seen a GAA club that would have a child without a pair of boots or a jersey if he or she wanted to play. I have more experience with GAA clubs than others but I presume the same applies to soccer and other clubs. Many applicants did not realise that this had to go on the form, which had to be filled with grá mo chroí stuff. The experts knew what to do and they kept winning the funding. This is likely to continue as some very professional outfits will outbid more grounded local organisations in a tendering process. We must be careful about change. Although it is good when it improves matters, change merely for its own sake is not good. The Government made promises about quangos and so on and it is performing optical illusions to prove it has eliminated some of them. That is instead of admitting that changing certain bodies which it looked to amalgamate or eliminate would not save a significant amount of money or bring improvement. For example, it took a long struggle to persuade the Minister responsible for the Gaeltacht not to try to amalgamate An Coimisinéir Teanga. I am glad that after 10,000 people took to the streets, he changed his mind, as there were very good reasons we set up that office. We looked at the other option initially and we decided for very good reasons that have now been accepted by the Minister that it was not a good arrangement. For example, the Coimisinéir Teanga once found against the Ombudsman with regard to language issues. There is a fair bit of change taking place for change's sake and it is not necessarily delivering on a coherent vision. We had come to the idea that if local services are provided at one remove from the State, rather than having a plethora of companies operating in the same area, as we had in the past, one company should provide the full suite of services so that the citizen would know where to go. Deputies and even the Minister of State have experience of people coming to a clinic asking whether there are five enterprise agencies from which they might get a few bob. Instead, if people are looking for an enterprise grant, they should be sent to one agency with a full suite of options, taking in sites, grants and so on. We wanted to create a process involving all services, taking in rural transport, Tús and the rural social scheme. I would have eliminated the 1,000 FÁS companies as well, leaving only 53 limited companies with employment responsibilities rather than 1,000 community employment companies. We would have rationalised the process. Many people know that to provide good rural transport services, a Tús scheme can be used, along with a community employment and rural social scheme. The process could be brought together to provide good value for money. It seems that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is now saying that it does not want to know about anything involving the Departments of Social Protection or Health. That means there is no joined-up thinking or a whole-of-government view. When we were in Government I attended meetings with departmental officials, and as there is a natural tendency to look after the interests of a Department, I tried to remind them that the Government was to serve the people and not the interests of individual Departments. The public cannot understand Departments at war and selfishly fighting over their domain rather than considering the big picture and the good of society. We were trying to implement a grand vision, with a wide range of services provided in each area by a locally based company with a local board and representation, complete with a sense of ownership. As in any system, such as local authority elections, there were aspects of the way the boards were put together that I was not happy with. There were issues to be dealt with between the voluntary and community sectors. They could have been honed. If I was doing it again I would lay down stricter guidelines to ensure true community participation and that certain stronger voices in the community sector did not dominate. Everybody should go back to the beginning of this tendering process and reorganise it, having discussed it with the appropriate Oireachtas committee. We should then move forward together on this process in a way that protects the community ethos in the delivery of services, something many of us fear for. Last night, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government said: "The system also proposes to delegate the administrative checks required to verify expenditure to an independent entity with the capacity to ensure these checks are carried out to a consistently high standard at all times". Are we being told that for the Leader companies the inspection regime is being taken out of the Department and given to a private entity? Perhaps the Minister of State would ask the Minister to give me a specific reply. I welcome the reference made by the Minister of State at the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Jan O’Sullivan, to the Minister’s interest in the islands. He has expressed that to me. The present tendering arrangement, however, is very island-unfriendly. I hope the Minister will decide to pull the islands out of the present tendering process because there is no way under the present criteria they can enter that process on a level playing pitch with the much larger companies around the country.

In the time available to me, I will refer briefly to some of its important provisions. There is an acknowledgement in the Bill that work needs to pay and there must be a reward for those in employment. There are different models of social welfare in operation in different countries, with comparisons often drawn between those in operation in the United States and in the Scandinavian countries, respectively. We must ensure that our own unique system rewards those who go out to work, as well as ensuring safeguards are in place for taxpayers' money. The Bill acknowledges that overpayments can happen within our social welfare system, some of which arise from administrative errors within the Department and some as a result of errors by individuals. In that context, I welcome the provisions dealing with recovery of overpayments. The Bill provides for the transposition of aspects of EU Directive 2010/41 regarding the equal treatment of men and women who are self-employed. The deadline for transposition of this directive is August, so its inclusion in the Bill is welcome. I also welcome the amendment to the rules regarding habitual residency. I have come across cases where individuals who were born in this country and spent most of their working life in Britain, for example, have returned home to find they must be resident in the State for two years before becoming eligible for social welfare. Under the new provision, the requirement will be for a person to be habitually resident in the State on the date of making an application for social welfare and to remain habitually resident in order for the entitlement to subsist. I welcome that change. Another welcome amendment relates to family income supplement, FIS, which is vital in assisting people to remain in work. The Bill provides that where a person qualifies for the payment, that entitlement will continue for 52 weeks regardless of any change in his or her circumstances. The Bill also allows for the use of PPS numbers by Irish Water for determining free water allowances for household members aged under 18. There is potential for liaison with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government regarding the mapping of PPS numbers to the electoral register. PPS numbers are a unique identifier for every citizen and have obvious potential in terms of tidying up the register and making our democratic process more secure.
#JoeOReilly	unknown-#JoeOReilly-party	unknown-#JoeOReilly-dob	unknown-#JoeOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	218	I welcome this legislation, which attempts to tidy up, reorganise and improve the method by which we make transfers of payments and thereby look after the people who need to be looked after. The first objective of the Bill is to effect the transposition of certain aspects of EU Directive 2010/41 to ensure that a spouse or civil partner of a self-employed person can benefit from social protection. To achieve this, the spouse or civil partner must be earning in excess of €5,000 and be a participant in the business. This rightly accrues a benefit to the partner that did not previously exist. It is a welcome dimension of the legislation. I also welcome the changes the Bill makes to the rules regarding habitual residency. All Members of this House will be aware from their clinic or constituency work of the huge difficulties that have arisen around the question of habitual residency. Currently, a person must prove that he or she has been resident in the State for two years to be eligible for a social welfare payment. The requirement now, under these provisions, is that a person must be in residency when he or she makes an application for benefit and remain in residency while in receipt of that benefit. That is perfectly reasonable. The objective of the habitual residency clause is laudatory to the extent that it is obviously intended to prevent welfare tourism, fraud, etc., which nobody likes to contemplate. We all have a responsibility for public money. It is not our money but the public's and it must be dispensed with probity, prudence and good sense and to the benefit of those who need it. Consequently, the habitual residency dimension is necessary but I have found it to be unduly difficult in its application. I have found a number of cases where people have proved it by having a child in a local crèche, for example, which would indicate they are resident and yet they failed to pass the habitual residency test. The bar was too high in some respects. Now a person must establish that he or she is resident at the time of the application and that he or she remains resident subsequent to it. That is a reasonable and welcome reform. There is a shift, not so much legislatively but in policy and approach, to electronic payments. While that has advantages in terms of risks of robbery, for example, it raises a couple of issues. There is a greater risk of fraud with electronic payments. Electronic payments automatically go into somebody's account and he or she can be absent or can be working in the black economy. I bring to the Minister's attention the importance of small post offices. Post offices had a huge role in the administration of social welfare and in dispensing moneys. There were a number of merits to the post office performing that function. The post office was the hub of the community. It provided employment, continues to do so and must be preserved, but in addition it was a disincentive to fraud as someone had to turn up at the post office for payment. While one cannot hold back modernity, the Minister should look at the role of the post office. If the Department is going to farm out the administration of social welfare, it should be parked nowhere other than in the post office network. I would think that would be a very important piece of social engineering for the country in general. Improvements have been made to the administration of family income supplement in this Bill. A separated spouse or partner can get family income supplement but, quite reasonably, he or she can only get it if there is tangible evidence that he or she is contributing to the upkeep of the home and to the children and to the partner from whom he or she is separated. It would be preposterous at a time of scare resources and when people are experiencing hardship around things like telephone allowances and so forth if we were to give family income supplement to people who were absent from the home and making no real contribution to it. That is worthwhile measure. What is also worthwhile in the legislation is that a person who is in receipt of family income supplement can remain on it for 52 weeks after a change in circumstances. The merit in that is that it allows people to take up better jobs, gives them opportunities to move up the jobs ladder and provides a sort of transitory phase, which is worthwhile. There is much in the legislation on the recovery of overpayments, which is very important, in particular where they arise as a result of fraud. It is very important that someone does not get a payment which is denied to somebody with a real need. The Minister brought in a provision a couple of years ago where up to 15% of a social welfare payment could be taken in lieu of an overpayment or a payment arising from fraud. That is reasonable to the extent that 15% is manageable. A person is paying back the money but is not left with insufficient money on which to live. Now overpayments can be recouped through refunds of PRSI, from lump sums and through tax rebates, which is a reasonable and good reform. The elimination of fraud is central. All of us in a civilised, caring and Christian society, and we have a particularly good social model in Ireland, want people who need payments to get them, but we also want to eliminate fraud. In September 2011, the Minister launched the Department of Social Protection fraud initiative. At the end of 2012, €669 million was saved. The target for 2013 was €710 million. The overview would suggest that up to €1.9 billion will have been saved in the years since this Government came into office, which is particularly useful. I would like to see much more use being made of the personal public service number in the elimination of fraud. Linking the work of social welfare officers and community welfare officers is welcome. Some people are working in the black economy because they are not accounted for and if we engage in enough job activation and have routine contact with people, their capacity to work outside the social welfare system will be eliminated. It is wonderful if they are working outside the social welfare system but they must forgo the relevant social welfare payment. The Minister's initiatives around job activation are marvellous and need to be brought fully to fruition. As she said, for every 10,000 people who come off the live register, there is a €95 million dividend to the State, which is huge and welcome. Obviously, there are issues for the person and his or her family and well-being. The one-stop shop idea and job activation, where people are offered training and opportunities and where jobseekers are seen as such and are not given a paternalistic handout and left in limbo, is a really welcome change in the Government's thinking. I salute and admire it. I look forward to the proper rolling out of the youth guarantee because it has enormous potential and has proved to be a great success in Finland. That scheme will provide training and work opportunities for young people and it is proved to work. The Minister of State with responsibility for European affairs, Deputy Donohoe, is in the House and it is great that our Government could negotiate the €6 billion from Europe to fund that scheme. We need to continue to eliminate fraud, to work on job activation and to get the resources to those who need them as it is a pleasure to give them to those people. However, it is equally necessary to deny them to people who should not get them.
#CatherineByrne	unknown-#CatherineByrne-party	unknown-#CatherineByrne-dob	unknown-#CatherineByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	219	I will try to be brief and not go over some of what has already been said. I welcome the introduction of the Bill which amends two previous Acts and introduces changes to the areas such as habitual residency, family income supplements, overpayments and pensions. Ireland, compared with many other EU countries, has a relatively generous welfare system. Almost 1.5 million people received a weekly social welfare payment in 2013 and when spouses, partners and children are included, this figure rises to 2.3 million people benefiting from social welfare payments. Approximately 600,000 families received child benefit payments in respect of almost 1.2 million children each month last year. In 2013, the Department spent approximately €20 billion and the largest portion of this went on pensions. I welcome the change to the habitual residency requirement for making social welfare claims. This will strengthen the residence requirements relating to entitlement to means-assessed social welfare payments. This relates in particular to child benefit, which a parent can claim if living here and the child or children are resident in another EU member state.They are relevant in particular to child benefit where a parent can claim if he or she is living in the country and the child or children are resident in another EU member state. In 2012 the total cost of paying child benefit in respect of children resident in other EU countries was approximately €13 million, which represents
0.65%
of the total cost of child benefit expenditure. The Bill will change the qualifying criteria. Current legislation only requires a claimant to be habitually resident at the date of claim but not thereafter, which can result in the State continuing to pay social assistance to claimants who may no longer have an entitlement, for example, by losing their status as a migrant worker.
I compliment the approach in the Bill to tackling fraud. The Government is committed to maintaining core welfare rates, while at the same time taking a zero-tolerance approach towards welfare fraud. The vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming their payment correctly. However, a small group of people are not, and therefore the Department has set down a range of measures to reduce social welfare fraud. Approximately 1.1 million reviews were carried out in 2012 and 2013 and a considerable amount of money was returned. In April, the Minister, Deputy Burton, published the Department’s compliance and anti-fraud strategy for the period 2014 to 2018. I welcome that. I thank the approximately 24,700 people who reported possible fraud. They are our eyes and ears on the ground. Many people want to ensure that those receiving benefit are entitled to do so. I will now skip forward to the area of equality for self employment. I am pleased the Bill provides for the abolition of the exclusion of spouses and civil partners from self-employed social insurance. It is very important to ensure that those who work together have an opportunity to gain some benefits in the event of a company being dissolved. It is a pity that when their business ceases operation people are not entitled to seek jobseeker's benefit or to pay a stamp which would entitle them to receive social assistance. I met many people in recent weeks and thought it very unfair that they could not avail of State support when they have paid their dues all their lives. I am most concerned about those who I call the undocumented, the many people who worked in construction and other areas during the boom but who do not qualify for social welfare. Many of them are in their 50s and 60s and have not been able to find work since they were made redundant or lost their jobs. Many are not entitled to claim jobseeker's supports as their spouse or partner works, and they are assessed on their income. If they are not in receipt of a welfare payment they cannot return to education or training. It is a vicious circle for many people. All they can do is sign on for credits every three years; otherwise, they do not exist in the system. The situation is very frustrating for people who have worked all their life and paid their dues and that the only place they are registered in the State is on the register of electors. The situation must be examined. I welcome the changes to family income supplement, FIS, which will benefit many families, who might now have the opportunity for one parent to go to work and to receive the benefit of FIS for 52 weeks. That could help many people to get back into the workforce and also encourage them to stay in it. I compliment the Minister on the Bill. I do not have much time remaining but I hope she will consider one or two of the points I have made.
#EoghanMurphy	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-party	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-dob	unknown-#EoghanMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	220	I welcome this important Bill. Many elements are necessary, in particular in the areas of fraud and control, recovery of overpayments, and entitlement to family income supplement. Deputy Byrne spoke eloquently on the reason the latter is important and why it is a necessary measure. Other areas addressed include the extension of social insurance cover and pensions. In my brief contribution I wish to focus on the last two areas. Extending social insurance cover to assist spouses and civil partners of self-employed contributors is very welcome. We talk about widening the national effects of the economic recovery that is now under way into the towns and villages throughout the country and the need to grow the domestic economy. We can only do that by incentivising new businesses, helping small businesses that are struggling to stay in business or in some cases to grow. Small businesses are net job creators in the domestic economy as opposed to the larger companies that come here which provide welcome employment and a financial stimulus. Small businesses create jobs in communities around the country. As a result, self-employed people are the lifeblood of the economy. It is only right that the social protection net would apply to self-employed people and their partners as is the case for employed people. Perhaps we should not seek strict equality in that regard because the financial risks for the self-employed person are so much greater personally and financially in the event of failure. One could ask whether we should tip the balance in the other direction and encourage self-employed people to take risks because the potential gains for the economy are great. We should assure people who seek to contribute that the State will be there to provide support where that is needed and to protect people if they fail. We are trying to use State resources as an insurance guarantee in order that should people take the risk but not be successful the State will be there for them. The intention is that they would take a risk and that we would all benefit as a result. The legislation is an important step, in particular when one considers the increasing number of women starting up businesses employing themselves and others. In the work I have done in the past three years I have been fortunate to meet many people, especially in the technology space, who are starting up new companies. I am amazed at the number of women involved in starting new businesses,especially given that traditionally women were not associated with the technology sector. I have also encountered people at business fairs and expos who are seeking to start businesses. Given that it is so important to the economy, in everything we do as a Government we should seek to use the resources of the State as a form of guarantee in terms of a social protection net to help people. We must let them know it is there should they not be successful so that they will take a risk and we can all then benefit from that. The second area on which I wish to focus is pensions. The Bill provides for an amendment to the Pensions Act on the notification the authority may make to trustees of schemes. In so far as the wider context of pensions is concerned, I welcome all the efforts the Department has made in that regard. We recently debated Second Stage of the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Bill which related to the double insolvency of pension funds but there is much more to do. I have raised the matter on a number of occasions in the Chamber and I have also raised it in the Committee of Public Accounts, as did the Minister of State, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, who is present, when he was a member of the committee. The looming pensions crisis is significant and if it were not for the financial disaster we encountered in the past decade and from which we are still recovering, it would be the crisis we discuss in the Chamber on a regular basis. The matter cannot be solved overnight but the work to resolve the situation needs to start today as a matter of urgency because we are dealing with a long-term problem. Part of the problem is that the pensions issue covers a number of Departments and I fear that as a result it might fall between administrative stools. There has been some talk from the industry and others who are interested in the sector of the need for a Minister of State exclusively committed to pensions in the public sector and the private sector and the problems they are both facing, in addition to the problems we as a country face into the next 30 years or more. I support those calls. At the moment we know from the leadership of both parties in the coalition that there will be a reshuffle at the Executive level. That has been flagged and it provides an opportunity for a new impetus in this area. It is not about new people, it is about restructuring the Executive in order to find a new focus on those important areas and potential crisis flashpoint areas that will arise over the coming decades. I urge the Minister to consider that following the enactment of the Bill. I welcome the amendments the Minister has flagged she will table on Committee Stage to allow the secondment of gardaí to the Department of Social Protection and also to allow Irish Water to use PPS numbers. I support the call by Deputies Kyne, Byrne and O’Reilly to allow the use of the information more widely in the administration of Government.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	221	I welcome the opportunity to contribute to the Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014, which will focus on effecting remedies and I hope address the various anomalies which have been identified in a number of areas relating to welfare and pensions. It is important that the social welfare system must provide better services and deal with poverty traps that become apparent. They must be eliminated. Opportunities must be facilitated for jobseekers, which to date have involved structural reforms. That will also be the case in the future. We must also acknowledge that almost nine out of ten households in the country receive some form of social transfers.It is important we strive to maintain the strongest form of support for those who lose their job, fall ill or are dependent on a fixed income to get by. It is also the focal point of ensuring there is an effective system of social welfare transfers in place to tackle and eradicate poverty. We should never make an apology for having this as a central objective and thrust of social policy. We should always continue to do so to ensure a level of social support is available to people at times of need. The best and most effective way to combat and eradicate poverty, of course, is to get people back to work. The Minister has devised several initiatives to help get people back into employment. Some of them have been harshly criticised, however. Last weekend, I spoke to a director of an indigenous meat processing company who availed of some of these initiatives and, as a result, an additional 20 people are employed in the plant. The more we can get off the unemployment register, the more savings can be achieved. Every 20,000 people removed from the register means savings of €95 million on social welfare expenditure. Further savings could be effected throughout the year by creating more job opportunities and combating welfare fraud through effective control measures. I urge the Government to bring back the Christmas bonus for social welfare recipients. It is probably not possible to re-introduce the full week’s additional payment but at least a decent portion of the bonus should be paid to defined householders and individuals who are often put to the pin of their collar to survive the demanding period during Christmas. It would also be very important in make a positive contribution to the family environment during the Christmas. The bonus was well availed of and used over the years when it was in place. It is often thrown into the mix that this Government did away with the bonus when, in fact, it was the previous Administration. I know from sitting at Cabinet for ten months that this Government faced a financial abyss and straitened economic circumstances. However, restoring the bonus would help.  This Bill aims to improve the administration of the social welfare system and safeguard its sustainability. Several new initiatives focus on debt recovery for people who have been overpaid social welfare benefits. The Department now has extensive powers to recover moneys which have been erroneously paid out or claimed fraudulently. These powers were first introduced in 2012 and permit up to 15% of a person’s social welfare entitlement to be deducted where there is an outstanding overpayment. There are also facilities to put in place detachment from earnings in such cases. I would sound a word of caution in cases where a person or people in genuine error believed they were entitled to a payment. For example, there could be a case of a widow’s pension which the recipient would have been entitled to, based on the deceased spouse’s contribution. However, she subsequently cohabits but does not realise she is no longer entitled to the payment. These people are now being focused on when it comes to overclaims by the Department with significant amounts demanded from them. I know of cases involving over €100,000. I advocate a reasonable approach to be taken in such cases, notwithstanding there may never be a full recovery of the outstanding amount. A demand should never be greater than 15% of a current social welfare payment. We must not hound these people who genuinely believed in their original entitlement and place stress on those who may be advanced in years, particularly when they may remain dependent on social welfare payments in the future. Where genuine errors are made and where the Department ought to have been aware of the circumstances that prevailed when the person when made their application, then the Department should not pursue or penalise these people now. With cross-referencing between various Departments, it is unlikely this will happen in the future. I note the extension of the attachment provision in this Bill to payments to be made in the future by public bodies or Departments. This makes sense but, again, a reasonable approach must be adopted in cases where a recipient may have committed irrevocably to another creditor or is ill and requires the moneys for health care payments. Individual circumstances must be taken into account and a reasonable approach adopted. The heavy hand of the law approach cannot be used in this regard. The Bill allows for the Minister to pay an employee a lump sum payment following redundancy, in circumstances where the payment has not been made by the employer to the employee. Any refund of PRSI contributions due to an employer in such a case will be subject to a deduction in the amount of the redundancy lump sum payment. That is a fair clause. Up to €70 million was recovered in overpayments which goes close to paying for the free travel scheme, an essential and vital scheme which enables older people, especially in rural areas to travel, playing an important and pivotal role in combating rural isolation and exclusion. Savings and effective recovery mechanisms are important ways of ensuring funding is available to ensure the continuation of so many vital schemes such as free travel. The habitual residence condition may be reviewed after date of award of a payment to ensure it is being satisfied. I recall when I was spokesperson on social welfare that many Irish clerics, priests, nuns and brothers, who returned from missionary work abroad to retire in Ireland were denied welfare payments because of the habitual residence condition. While it was subsequently modified, that is the type of anomaly and consequence that was not envisaged when the condition was introduced. It is important these conditions are continuously reviewed to ensure no hardship or imposition arises as a result. The extension of social insurance cover has been achieved in this legislation by transposing the relevant provisions of the directive 2010/41/EU which focused on the equal treatment of men and women engaged in a self-employed capacity. Over the past 50 years, many farmers’ spouses, led by Mrs. Murphy of the Wexford IFA, argued for this provision which will benefit 6,000 of them. Many people will regret this is not retroactive but it is still an improvement. A civil partner participating in his or her partner’s business must earn at least €5,000. Up to now only one of the couple could be insured as a self-employed worker for social insurance benefits. The spouse or civil partner will now be entitled to benefits, subject to the contribution requirements, such as maternity payment of 26 weeks, widow’s pension, civil partner’s contributory pension or the State contributory pension in their own right. The equal treatment directive will make an important contribution in this regard. I am disappointed with the reaction of some of the self-employed representative bodies to the need to extend social insurance coverage for the self-employed. I have been self-employed for the most part for many years. I know the Minister received a report 12 months ago from the advisory group on tax and social welfare, chaired by Ita Mangan. It recommendations, despite being meritorious, were flatly rejected by spokespersons for various employers organisations. Some of their utterances in this regard are at variance with what I hear from so many self-employed people. In the course of canvassing during the recent local and European elections, a recurring theme was why are the self-employed left out of the social insurance loop. Many self-employed said they were willing to pay extra to ensure they will be covered in the event of another economic crash or, more immediately, if they fall ill and have no means of earning a crust to sustain themselves or their families. They have been treated as non-statistics for the purpose of social welfare claims, falling through the cracks of the system. We can no longer behave like ostriches. We must grab the bull by the horns. If these organisations persist in their objections, we should introduce a voluntary contribution mechanism for the many thousands who wish to contribute and gain subsequent coverage. Having such peace of mind is very important to the self-employed. I do not like the voluntary nature of such a proposal but, as some say, half a loaf is better than no bread. We should give people the opportunity to participate in such a scheme. If they have a choice there will be no point in crying wolf afterwards. A mandatory scheme is the right and proper way to proceed and I firmly believe this because ultimately they will be the people who will benefit. Many people suffered during the course of the recent crash. I met many families of people who were self-employed in various areas of trade and they certainly took a hammering. Look at what happened to people in the recession. Many workers, particularly in the construction sector, operated on a self-employed basis, making class S PRSI contributions. These included roofers, joiners, plumbers and electricians. As a result, these workers had no entitlement to insurance-based jobseeker's benefit. Likewise, they still do not have an entitlement to invalidity pension or occupational injury payments which are available to employers contributing to the class A PRSI rate. Many people argue that they are entitled to jobseeker's allowance. This is true, and a significant number have received it, but by hell, were they put through the loops and hoops. The process was very demanding and stringent, and one can understand this. It is all right to base a benefit on past income, but the snow that fell last winter is gone, as is the money they earned. Often, the assessment was based on the previous 12 months, which was ludicrous. Christ almighty, it would drive one to distraction to see such measures. Self-employed people will grab this lifeboat and make contributions. We are all acutely aware of how self-employed persons have a perception that they cannot access means-tested supports. When they go to apply they are put through the wringer. The Citizens' Information Board and MABS have reported on the difficulties faced by people. I am not making it up. It has been acknowledged in the Dáil, particularly by Deputy Ray Butler, that the Minister has tried to improve access to these payments for the self-employed. This is acknowledged and we accept it, but we must look at where it is. Given that the self-employed are subject to insecurity of income, there is no valid reason they should not benefit from and contribute to the system on the same basis as others. Approximately 280,000 or 290,000 people are self-employed, which is approximately 15% of the overall employment figures. It is time we addressed this issue once and for all. At present, self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate, which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as the contributory State pension and widow's, widower's and surviving civil partner's contributory pension. It also provides cover for maternity and adoptive benefits. The rate is 4% of all income and the minimum contribution is €500. It was €286 for donkey's years. Self-employed people are eligible for means-tested payments, but the assessment of income is convoluted and it is difficult for people to qualify. I stand over this statement. Extending social insurance coverage to the self-employed, as pointed out in the expert group's report, would bring the Irish social security system closer to the levels in other countries. In many EU member states coverage is more comprehensive, particularly with regard to work-acquired injuries. Eligibility, qualifying criteria and payment conditions vary from country to country, as do contribution rates. A total of 25 member states provide cover for illness or invalidity, 18 member states provide cover in some way for occupational injury or disease, and 12 member states offer cover in the case of unemployment. Only Ireland and the Netherlands do not have any cover of this nature. Belgium has a separate social insurance scheme for self-employed workers. In the majority of EU member states social protection for the self-employed is provided through general social security arrangements. It is clear that the extension of social insurance coverage to the self-employed would bring the Irish social security system closer to that which prevails in other EU member states. It is fair to say that ordinary self-employed people do not need actuarial assessments to realise that in order to be eligible for illness, incapacity or jobseeker's benefit they would have to contribute substantially more than 4% of their income. From my experience and discussions with them, they are prepared to make a contribution because ultimately it would be a self-serving and worthwhile exercise to do so. The expert group did not recommend extension of the PRSI system to provide jobseeker's benefit to the self-employed, but it had no qualms in recommending that social insurance for the self-employed should be extended to provide cover for contingencies for long-term sickness or illness. This should be provided irrespective of whether the sickness or illness was acquired through work. It should be limited to longer-term illness and disability support such as invalidity pension and partial capacity benefit. We have a template from the report issued in May 2013. Like many reports, it has been allowed to gather dust. I appeal to IBEC, ISME and other such groups to discuss this. Everybody here was on the hustings in recent weeks. I was amazed at the number of people who raised this issue with me. I raised it as a Topical Issue several years ago, so it is not an issue to which I have come recently. I believe in it strongly. It is apposite to note that the group recommended extending social insurance to the self-employed to provide cover for long-term ill-health or incapacity on a compulsory basis, as application on a voluntary basis through opt-in or opt-out could lead to selection of bad risk and would undermine the social solidarity and contributory principles which underpin the social insurance system. The group was strongly in the mandatory camp rather than supporting an opt-in or opt-out system. To get it up and running, it is important to examine opt-in and opt-out and conduct a trial for 12 for 24 months to see how it would work. Perhaps a trial would have to be for a longer time, such as five years, because one must contribute for a minimum time to obtain benefits. I hope there will not be any need for it, but it is a fallback position and a safety net. Every self-employed person knows it will cost more; they all live in the real world. There will be more automation because of the prevalence of electronic funds transfers and efforts to combat fraud, but we should hasten slowly. The sustainability of post offices is important. When people go into post offices they have personal contact. They are identified and are known well by the postmaster or postmistress, and this is a strong secure element. There is also the transactional value it brings to post offices. We should slow down the rush towards electronic funds transfers, because many people do not want them. I deal with many elderly people who are happier with a face-to-face transaction and with the money being handed out. They may buy other things in the post office which will contribute to its long-term sustainability and viability. The post office serves as a very important bulwark in rural and urban Ireland and it is recognised as such. Some people just raise their head for an electoral opportunity because they think there is something in it, but for the past 25 years I have been a strong advocate of the importance of rural sustainability. Everybody is rushing to the cheap shops and the big out-of-town stores. Soon there will not be one shop in a village in my area which now has four shops. It will happen with post offices and corner stores. Efficiency, effectiveness, computerisation and technology are all right, but Padraic Neary from Tubbercurry, whose letters to the editor I always read, states that we should slow down and think because, while technology is great, it will mean fewer people involved, which in turn will mean shops will disappear. Is this the society we want? It is not one to which I subscribe or one that I want. People should take note of this, be cognisant of the situation and slow down before we wipe out shops in rural areas and rural infrastructure altogether.

The Bill makes changes, some of which could have far-reaching implications for some people who depend on social welfare. In my contribution, I wish to cover three aspects: the self-employed, the habitual residence condition, HRC, and family income supplement. However, although I had not intended to address this issue, I must comment on changes the Bill will make in respect of fraud and fraud detection. It always interests me that whenever Fine Gael Deputies in particular contribute on social welfare legislation, they always bring up the issue of fraud and how it must be dealt with. As far as I can discern, the only thing that fraud within the social welfare code has going for it is that it makes for nice sexy attractive headlines in the newspapers when someone is caught defrauding the system. However, when one examines the actual figures for fraud within the social welfare system from the Department's own website, in 2010, fraud represented 0.4% of the total revenue expenditure by the Department. As for the Department's own studies on particular benefits and payments and the fraud elements thereof, a study carried out in 2012 on payments in respect of jobseekers detected that 1.6% of expenditure was through fraud. However, the Department also detected that 1.5% of expenditure was incurred on foot of administrative error, which is a similar percentage. As for disability allowance, the Department detected that 1.2% of expenditure was through fraud, whereas 0.9% of expenditure was through administrative error. I wish to put the extent to which social welfare fraud is an issue into some perspective and context. If one considers the Department's target figures for 2014, it is interesting that it always puts fraud target figures alongside administrative error figures in order to make it look more shocking than might actually be the case. However, the Department has targeted €700 million in either savings, which is probably what it is, or recovery of money. This represents approximately 3.5% of the entire social welfare budget. If one examines the studies the Department has carried out in this regard, one can estimate that approximately half of that, or 1.75%, will relate to administrative errors rather than actual fraud. In reality, fraud comprises less than 2% of the overall social welfare budget, and I wonder about the amount of time and energy that is put into its detection. Obviously, fraud must be detected, and no one will condone somebody who is defrauding the system. However, too great a focus on fraud promulgates the image that everyone in receipt of social welfare benefits is a potential fraudster and is a person who is taking something to which he or she is not entitled. On the self-employed, the transposition of Directive 2010/41/EU extends PRSI cover to spouses and certain people related to self-employed people. This is welcome, and it is interesting that it is European law that is making it happen here. However, it does not go anywhere near far enough in terms of self-employed people. I listened to other Deputies state that this is a great progressive step, whereby social welfare coverage is being extended to the spouses of self-employed people, but all they are being given is the opportunity to avail of the contributory old age pension when they reach the age of 66 or 68, as the case may be, in the years to come. There actually is no benefit accruable to people who start up businesses that may end up folding. They have no safety net and there is no provision made for them in this Bill. Some Deputies have suggested that a voluntary system is the way to go when extending cover for self-employed people, and that it should be tried out on a voluntary basis first and then assessed as to how it works in the years thereafter. However, a voluntary system already is in place within the PRSI system, namely, a class P contribution for share fishermen. They make a voluntary additional payment that entitles them to 13 weeks of jobseeker's benefit annually and gives them other provisions and cover. In order to avail of this, they must make an additional voluntary contribution of 3% on their gross income. I believe there are approximately 1,400 share fishermen nationwide and the number of those who avail of these contributions is approximately 16. For each year during which the system has been in place, fewer than 20 fishermen have actually availed of it. The problem with it is that it is a voluntary scheme. Consequently, I do not believe that any voluntary scheme being put in place for self-employed people will have the desired effect. It basically would be a waste of time because nobody will pay tax voluntarily. Nobody wishes to give over his or her income, and if someone is working and doing reasonably well and is making a living, he or she does not wish to give up a further 3%, because questions regarding something goes wrong are in the abstract. If any changes are to be made, it must be a compulsory scheme. I cannot envisage how it will work otherwise. I have raised this with the Minister a number of times but unfortunately, the same old thing keeps getting trotted out about how self-employed people benefit far more actuarially from their contributions than do employed people, that self-employed people pay so much less and so on and that these are all the reasons for not doing it. However, as Deputy Penrose outlined earlier, for all benefits within the social welfare system, one must have a qualifying period in which one makes contributions before one is entitled to benefit from it, and if it was made compulsory with an increased contribution from self-employed people, this measure would actually bring in money to the Social Insurance Fund. If the period was equivalent to that for entitlement to jobseeker's benefit, it would be two years before there was any draw-down on such contributions. It would help with the balance of the Social Insurance Fund were this measure to be implemented in that way. I drafted and tried to publish legislation to implement a system of compulsory contributions for self-employed people but unfortunately, because of a rule in this House, the Office of the Ceann Comhairle ruled it out of order. The legislation could not be published because Opposition Deputies cannot introduce legislation that could incur a cost on the Exchequer and Members unfortunately have not been able to debate legislation or the potential for such legislation in this House for of those reasons. On the habitual residence condition, I note that the change being made within the Bill is that the presumption regarding continuous residence for two years prior to making an application is being removed. On the face of it Members probably will welcome this, and I do so myself because, from dealing with cases involving HRC, I am aware that it is extremely difficult for genuine applicants to satisfy the condition. I believe this is because of the arbitrary nature of decisions being made by departmental officials in respect of HRC. While consideration is meant to be given to five factors, I have seen reports by inspectors and deciding officers that have not taken into account these five factors. Perhaps a decision on HRC was made based on one or two of them and someone was refused a payment and the associated protection, of which he or she was desperately in need, when the case had not even been examined properly. While this might be an unintended consequence, will the removal of the condition of continuous residence for two years give an open-ended view to departmental officials to examine people's habitual residence, centre of economic activity and centre of economic interest? Will its removal actually open it up? If consideration is to be given to the future intentions of an applicant, I believe this will allow for even more arbitrary decisions to be made within the habitual residence condition that will penalise people who are entitled to and should be in receipt of a social welfare payment. The reason given by the Department for introducing this provision in the legislation is that it relates mainly to people here who have work visas but whose visas have expired. They therefore are not entitled to be in the State and, consequently, should not be entitled to a social welfare payment. The danger is how these things actually will be worked out in the future after this legislation has been changed. The manner in which the habitual residence condition is being examined, considered and decided on at present is flawed and I believe this change will increase that and will increase hardship for many people. Finally, on the changes in respect of family income supplement, I note that the Bill proposes that if a family is in receipt of family income supplement and its situation changes - for example, there is a job loss - the payment stops, which is fair enough, but that the rate of payment will remain for 52 weeks. I refer to a scenario in which someone is working and a decision is made granting family income supplement to that person.The individual may lose his or her job and then, if very lucky, may quickly get another job, which, more than likely will be for lower wages. The family income supplement cannot be reviewed and must remain the same for 52 weeks. This will penalise families even more. It could mean that people will be unable to take up a job or it would not be in their interest to look for work because they would be penalised on the basis of a decision made previously. Has this been decided for ease of administration or is there a rationale for the decision other than saving the Department a few euro in the administration of the system? That seems to me to be the only rationale for it.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	224	This legislation has many aspects to be considered but I will concentrate on the changes to the Pensions Act rather than the social welfare provisions which have been addressed by other Deputies. I agree with the points made by Deputy Pringle about our obsession with alleged social welfare fraud which has been shown in most cases to be incidents of error when it occurs. The Minister proposes to second 20 gardaí into a virtual hit squad to pursue social welfare fraudsters. This is unbelievable when white collar crime is one of the biggest problems in our society. This is an attempt to scape-goat some of the most vulnerable sections of society by turning these allegations of fraud into something they are not because the statistics show that the instances of fraud are quite minor. In any case, we can deal with that issue later. I will concentrate in my contribution on the amendments to the Pensions Act. Pensions have become a very important issue. There is an expectation that in retirement one will be able to live out one's life comfortably, to attain a certain standard of living, something to which we should all aspire. However, this expectation has been undermined by pension insecurity in many of the schemes. This Bill will introduce amendments to the provisions dealing with defined benefit pension schemes. We need to sound a note of warning. The problems in those schemes are not caused, as we have been told before, by people living longer, as if that was somehow a bad thing when it is a very good thing. The reasons these schemes were under-funded have been as a consequence of the casualisation of labour, the undermining of the idea of a secure permanent pensionable job and instead those jobs being replaced by outsourced contracts and so on, with the result that the lifeblood of pension schemes has been eroded. A number of management decisions also undermined that system. While recognising that there have been problems with defined benefit schemes, I am very worried about the volume of piecemeal changes to the Pensions Act impacting on pensioners. I do not think we are taking a holistic or a proper view on it. Less than six months ago in the run-up to Christmas, radical changes were implemented to defined benefit pension-holders and which were rushed through in the final sitting week before Christmas, with the consequence that existing pensioners of defined benefit schemes experienced a huge reduction in their standard of living in some of those schemes. I refer to the scheme to which I belong which is a major defined benefit scheme, the Irish Airlines Superannuation Scheme, IASS, which has 15,000 members, roughly divided between active, deferred and existing pensioners. As a result of the changes put forward, the pensioners in that group took a hit of €7 million which was taken out of the pockets of thousands of pensioners. This has an immediate impact on the surrounding areas and the purchasing power of those individuals. That legislation failed to take into account employer responsibility and the Bill is not doing enough in this regard either. In the UK, people who formerly worked for Aer Lingus and what was formerly Aer Rianta, will have all their pension benefits secured but their Irish counterparts who worked in the same companies will not and are experiencing major losses in that regard. I do not have time to deal with all the details but the Minister is aware that many of the groups in similar schemes have had to organise and seek recourse to legislation and potentially to the courts, to exercise their rights. We should not be tinkering with pensions legislation while significant changes are taking place behind the scenes because it is not desirable to do it in that way. The Minister is probably aware of a very important UK case which last month defined in law the notion of a reasonable expectation. This case related to a defined benefit scheme in IBM and it is deemed potentially to have a significant impact on Irish pension schemes. The UK High Court ruled that the changes proposed by IBM to its pension scheme confounded the reasonable expectations of the scheme's members which were for benefit accrual to continue into the future. The judge in that case said that the key aspect of the decision was the development of the concept of reasonable expectations of employers and scheme members and that this would potentially affect an employer's duty of care. This case law has the potential to have an impact on the scenario here in Ireland. It is interesting that we are discussing this legislation after the Queen's speech to Parliament yesterday in Britain which announced major changes to the UK's pension scheme, a new idea to deal with defined benefit schemes for the modern era which is called Dutch-style collective pension funds. Rather than workers saving into individual pots which are more vulnerable to variations on the Stock Exchange, it is proposed that workers would pool their investments into a mega-fund which would then pay them an income in retirement. It has been alleged that these changes could, by minimising the risks, see pensioners secure a post-retirement income of greater than 30% of current levels. I note that critics will issue a caution and the Dutch are looking at ways of moving away from that scenario. I am not saying it is a panacea but it is interesting that different methods of dealing with the pensions crisis in a more holistic way are being put forward in other jurisdictions. It is ironic that we are discussing legislation to unilaterally restructure defined benefit schemes at the direction of the Pensions Authority, yet it has sounded warnings about over-reliance on investment in equities. I ask why we do not consider a plan similar to the British model and why we do not consider the taking over of schemes such as the IASS by the NTMA, as is the case with some public service pensions. I ask why we are not exploring the concept of pooling risk rather than some of the changes being put forward. Alarm bells are ringing about some of these changes. Why is the onus on trustees in the schemes? Does this not allow the Pensions Authority off the hook? How will the trustees inform all the members? The IASS has 15,000 members. While pushing through this legislation, the Government has not yet introduced the changes suggested by us during the discussions on the previous Bill, about giving the deferred pensioners groups and the existing pensioners groups a right to sit at the table and to be consulted on these changes. The argument is made that pensioners have the right to go to the High Court in these cases, as if that is somehow a bonus - I do not think that is a bonus. Most pensioners are on average 72 years of age and their average pension is approximately €16,000 a year. It is not that easy at that age on such an income to access the High Court to get justice. The experience has not been that favourable. Why are we not looking at different ways, such as allowing the industrial relations machinery of the State to be accessed by people who have left their employment? We have raised these issues previously. During the discussion on the previous Bill, the Minister said she would deal with some of these issues in the guidance notes but they were not dealt with. Here is another legislative change which also impinges on the State Airports (Shannon Group) Bill. There are too many things happening on the sidelines which will undermine the integrity of these schemes and they are not being properly examined. We will pay a heavy price for this. We are moving legislation to allow existing pensioners and deferred groups to have a seat at the table which they should have anyway.Many other issues should have been addressed in the Bill. Unfortunately, I do not have time to discuss them. People are asking why the Minister is not looking at the bigger picture and introducing pension legislation to address the issues I have raised and provide for greater protection. One of the key flaws in the current arrangements is that the pension pots into which people have paid can be eroded and reduced. While the legislation purportedly gives such persons access to a remedy, in reality it erects another barrier. Tens of thousands of workers have retired from the companies to which I referred and many others continue to pay into the pension funds of these companies. This is creating a minefield for the future. I will table amendments to give pensioners greater access to justice in this regard. I appeal to the Minister to step back and take a much more holistic and planned approach to pensions because the current arrangements open the floodgates to further legal cases. Only recently, hundreds of airport workers attended a meeting in a hotel at which they collected tens of thousands of euro for a fund that will enable them to take a legal challenge against pensions legislation. They have a reasonable expectation that was the subject of a ruling in case law in the Commercial Court last year. The Government is making a serious mistake in failing to take account of a number of rulings in legislation.
#SeanKenny	unknown-#SeanKenny-party	unknown-#SeanKenny-dob	unknown-#SeanKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	The Social Welfare and Pensions Bill 2014 will give effect to a number of important social welfare and pension reforms. The Bill amends the Social Welfare Consolidation Act of 2005 to provide for the transposition of certain aspects of EU Directive 2010/41/EU dealing with the principle of equal treatment between men and women engaged in an activity in a self-employed capacity and ensuring that the spouse or civil partner of a self-employed worker can benefit from social protection in accordance with national law. This is a very important reform and essentially means that a group of people who had previously been excluded from contributory State pensions will be able to qualify, over time, for pension cover in their own right. This will ensure equality of access to social insurance cover for the self-employed and assisting spouses and civil partners, as required under EU law. In the case of women, they will also be able to qualify over time for maternity benefit. I welcome this legislative development and I am very pleased it is proceeding. The Minister deserves considerable credit for ensuring it is being provided. Amendments to the existing legislation are also being made to strengthen the residence requirements relating to entitlement to social assistance payments and child benefit, strengthen control of social welfare expenditure by extending the powers to recover social welfare overpayments, and make a number of other changes to the social welfare code. In terms of the EU directive, the Bill will extend social insurance cover to spouses and civil partners of a self-employed contributor in cases in which the spouse or civil partner is participating in the person's business and earning more than €5,000 per annum. This means the spouse or civil partner will, under the social insurance system, be able to establish entitlement to maternity benefit, widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's contributory pension and contributory State pension in his or her own right. In terms of amending and strengthening the residence requirements relating to entitlement to means-assessed social welfare payments and child benefit, under the amended legislation, a person must be habitually resident at the date of application for the relevant social welfare payment and throughout the period that payment is being claimed to remain entitled to the payment. This will mean that the person is residing in Ireland and has a proven close link to the State. This measure is being taken to preclude any possibility that individuals no longer resident in Ireland will be able to continue to claim social welfare payments after they have left the country. The vast majority of people are honest, regardless of where they come from, and this type of welfare fraud is not widespread. Nevertheless, it is best to ensure it can never occur because the social protection budget needs to be protected to the greatest possible extent to ensure it serves those who need it most. Separately, the Bill will ensure that, in general, once a family qualifies for family income supplement, payment of the supplement will continue for 52 weeks, regardless of any change in circumstances that may arise, including where weekly earnings increase. Family income supplement is highly important to working families and the purpose of the measure is to ensure that families in receipt of the supplement have security and peace of mind about the length of their payment. It is a weekly tax-free, top-up payment for workers on low pay with children. More than 44,000 working families, including more than 98,000 children, benefit from the scheme. The Department's expenditure on family income supplement will increase to more than €280 million this year, bringing the increase since 2012 to 25%. The Bill also extends the powers of the Department to recover social welfare overpayments. The vast majority of those in receipt of payments receive only the payment to which they are entitled. However, cases of overpayment arise through error and, in a small number of cases, fraud. It is important that these moneys are recovered in order that the social welfare budget is managed appropriately and the money is spent on those who need it.
#TerenceFlanagan	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-party	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-dob	unknown-#TerenceFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	226	Like most Deputies, I strongly welcome the Bill, which gives effect to a number of social welfare and pension reforms. These changes will deliver savings to the Department of Social Protection, whose budget has been under serious pressure recently as a result of our economic circumstances. The Department has made substantial savings this year and hopes to achieve net savings of €390 million in the year ahead. The Bill has two objectives, both of which will be welcomed by members of the public. I refer in particular to public concerns about the residence status of some of those who claim social welfare payments. The legislation proposes to address the problem of social welfare payments being fraudulently claimed by people who are not entitled to benefits. This type of fraud affects genuine recipients of social welfare benefits who need these payments to support themselves and their families. I was pleased to note a recent media report that 100 people were stopped at Dublin Airport on the basis that they were flying into the State to sign on and claim social welfare payments. This issue of welfare tourism was also highlighted some years ago when the ash cloud grounded aeroplanes throughout Europe and prevented people from overseas from travelling here to sign on. With economic circumstances so tight, it is vital that only those in need of assistance receive social welfare payments. Abuse of the system cannot be tolerated in any shape or form. I am concerned by a report that the Department detected 1,400 fraudulent claims made by people living outside Ireland in 2012. Perhaps the Minister will indicate how many such cases were detected in 2013. This is a serious issue on which Deputies receive many representations. The second objective of the Bill is to strengthen control of social welfare overpayments and extend the powers to recover such overpayments. Any moneys that can be reclaimed by the State or savings made by the Department are very welcome, provided they are ring-fenced to provide assistance and relief to people who are on the poverty line. This money could be used in a clever manner, for example, to reinstate the Christmas bonus or extend the period for which fuel allowance is paid. Pensioners and senior citizens, many of whom rely solely on the State pension for an income, are facing additional pressure, with those who do not have an additional source of private income finding it increasingly difficult to make ends meet.If the moneys are ring-fenced, that would be a good initiative on the part of the Government. Benefits fraud is a major issue. I note the Department is constantly setting targets. A target of €710 million in control measures has been proposed for this year, and all of us in this House hope that figure will be achieved. I am glad to see that the area of identification by social welfare recipients has been improved upon and that photo identification and a signature are captured on the computer system of the Department rather than the old system where a person needed merely a PPS number or a public service card to confirm his or her identity. Clearly, the new improvements will make a difference to ensure those who need help and support and are genuine are the ones who get it. The figures reported for fraud in social welfare have doubled from 2011 to 2012, with 28,000 reports being made to the Department in 2012 by members of the public. Figures show there are significant savings being made. The Department saved €91 million in misspent jobseeker's benefits, €173 million in one-parent family payments and €83 million in child benefits in 2012, and it is continuing along the same lines. Constituents have come to us who have noted that they know of people who are claiming for benefits to which they are not entitled. Confidence will be restored when all these cases are individually reviewed, which is an ongoing issue with the Department where it is constantly trying to identify the areas which could be at high risk and prone to fraud. No doubt the new welfare card system will contribute to decreasing the amount of benefit fraud. Recipients will have their photograph and signature recorded electronically. Under the Bill, the identify authentication requirements have been extended to those already in receipt of welfare payments, with those who refuse to comply with the new requirements putting themselves at risk of having their benefits stopped. That is significant. As I stated, there are people in this country who are genuinely in need of financial support where social welfare acts as a safety net. There are many who are genuinely looking for employment but who have difficulty in finding it because of the current economic situation. Perhaps they are not qualified enough in the line of work for which vacancies are available and they are trying to retrain to get themselves up to the suitable standard, for which they must be supported and applauded. The Government must support the unemployed in any way it can, particularly those who are genuine in their search for work. I think everyone in this House agrees that those who are claiming multiple benefit payments or falsely claiming benefits under someone else's identity should be stopped from doing so. Benefit fraud not only has a financial effect, but also does a disservice to those genuinely in receipt of welfare payments. The Bill also deals with the transition of those in receipt of one-parent family payment to jobseeker's allowance whereby parents with a child over the age of seven will be placed on a targeted version of jobseeker's allowance called jobseeker's transition. The transition period will allow lone parents who have been out of the job market for some time and who may have difficulty in securing child care for their children to seek work on a part-time rather than a full-time basis, and they will be exempt as well from a number of conditions for jobseeker's allowance for a transitional period. Lone parents who may find it difficult to meet the new requirements that have been set for the payment and who are genuinely trying to seek full-time work will not have to meet this requirement, especially if their children are between the ages of seven and 14. Instead, they will be able to take part in training and education opportunities to help them become ready for employment when their parenting obligations are less intense in the future. It is my understanding that there will be public information meetings and a letter sent to these lone parents regarding the changes that are being made here. Perhaps that has already happened. There are other measures in the Bill, including changes to the Pensions Board, which aims to increase consumer trust in the area of pensions and understanding of the role of the Pensions Board and pensions generally. It is very important that anyone of working age provides for his or her retirement and is not totally dependent on the State pension because nobody knows the amount it will be in the future as the population naturally increases and the demand on pensions increases. There is much talk of a pensions time-bomb in the future as well. Pensions are a topical issue. The Bill also includes changes in liability for PRSI to broaden the PRSI base, thus supporting the Social Insurance Fund to continue paying pensions and benefits to those who need them. There is also reference to index information being made available online, particularly in the area of births, deaths, marriages and civil partnerships. Historical indices now will be online and the public will be able to search them and look for such information in a more timely manner. In the area of genealogy and research, where the diaspora and others are interested in knowing who they are and where they have come from, such information will be available online. That is a good development and is to be welcomed. Another area dealt with in the Bill is redundancy payments. There are employers who, where businesses fail, are not in a position to pay a redundancy lump sum in a timely manner, and in that case it is the Department of Social Protection that makes those payments upfront. It is important to ensure those moneys continue to be paid in a timely manner to those who rely on them, particularly where they lose a job suddenly. I welcome the Bill. No doubt it will make a positive impact on people's lives. The public welcome the tightening up of benefit fraud and the new checks and balances that will be put in place.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	227	I thank all the Deputies, including Deputy Terence Flanagan, for their contributions and constructive approach to this debate and I will try to cover as many of the key issues as possible in the time available. I listened closely to the debate around the concerns of Deputies about the position of An Post and social welfare payments. I categorically refute the argument that the proposals before the Dáil will in some way diminish the position of An Post in society. On the contrary, these proposals will strengthen the position of An Post in the delivery of cash payment services for my Department. This is particularly important in rural areas, but it is also important in many suburbs and towns. The measure in the Bill provides added and necessary protections, both to me, as Minister, and to An Post, in relation to the contract now in place. The awarding of an open-ended contract to An Post to provide cash payment services for the Department is incompatible with EU competition law. The European Commission had made it quite clear to us that we could not extend our contractual arrangement with An Post.My Department must comply with EU procurement law or otherwise face fines and-or penalties. That is why the Department went to the market to procure cash payment services. This requirement for competitive procurement and formal contracting provided all potential market providers with the opportunity to compete for the business, and the services are procured and delivered to give best value for money to the taxpayer. I am glad to say that An Post was the successful bidder and won the tender to provide cash payment services for my Department. The contract has been awarded for two years commencing on 2 January 2014 with the potential to extend the contract annually for up to four years thereafter – an accumulated period of up to six years in total. This contract gives certainty to An Post in the delivery of cash services, enabling An Post to build on its payment services provision for potential future contracts. No other arm of Government has given any such certainty to An Post. I have to emphasise that the absence of a formal procurement competition would have left the Department and the country exposed again to the potential for another legal challenge, as happened previously. The ruling from the European Court of Justice, in 2007, made it clear that any further contract without a formal and public competition would put us in breach of EU directives. The current legislation was not updated after that ruling. Not updating it left an exposure in the Statute Book, which left my Department open to some future challenge from third parties who might feel aggrieved about existing legal provisions and may wish to argue that it reflects a denial of opportunity for them to compete on a level playing field. I am sure Deputies will appreciate that across our economy more and more financial transactions are carried out by electronic fund transfers, rather than through cash payments. Customers of my Department are no different and are increasingly seeking to elect to receive their payments from my Department via electronic fund transfer to their bank accounts. This is a reality that we cannot ignore. The position of An Post as a provider of cash payments is set out in regulations. It is also a definite option for a significant number of people. Some people go for EFT, while others opt for cash. As Minister, I have been committed to seeing An Post being involved in making the personal cash service available. Amendments to these regulations in respect of payment service providers will continue to reflect the position of An Post as a provider of cash payments. In addition, given that people have to turn up to receive certain social welfare payments, An Post provides a significantly important service in the control of fraud detection.  What has not been mentioned in the debate thus far is that the legislative amendments provide An Post with the power to withhold a payment to a customer who has not authenticated his or her identity to the standard required. These authentication requirements are agreed between the Department and An Post, understood by the client, and are applied on each and every occasion a client presents for a cash payment. The proposed legislative amendment also strengthens the capacity for an exchange of information between the Minister and An Post concerning payment transactions. Examples of these new arrangements being put in place include information on the documentation provided by the client to authenticate him or herself before payment, or the provision of a copy of a signed receipt by a client in order to verify receipt of that payment. This information is invaluable where a case is being prepared for prosecution. Furthermore, provision is being made to enable An Post to confiscate the public services card or social services card presented, and surrender it to the Minister in instances of fraud where the cards are being used unlawfully. In this way, the role of An Post as a partner in combatting welfare fraud is secured and our control regime is made more robust and resilient. Many of the opposition Deputies who raised this matter during the debate are not present in the Chamber now. I hope, however, they will get a chance to read my remarks. If so, they will see that this is a key area of our relationship in terms of the critical services provided by An Post. The Department is already a significant customer of An Post's services both in terms of mail delivery and through the contract for the delivery of welfare payments in cash. This is reflected in the scale and volume of business during 2013 with 14 million mail items to a value of over €11.5 million and some 43.7 million over-the-counter cash payment transactions with a value of over €57 million. Additional business is generated by way of secondary selling and additional services such as household budgeting services, and more recently the deduction of rents when customers are in the post offices transacting welfare business. The Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources is currently undertaking an examination of the scope for new businesses which An Post is well placed to deliver to ensure their continued viability in the towns and villages throughout Ireland. My officials are engaging with officials from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to contribute to that review. The prevention of fraud and abuse of the social welfare system is an integral part of the day-to-day work of the Department of Social Protection. As Deputies will know, it is one of the largest spending Departments in the State with a budget of some €20.3 billion in 2013. The Department processes in excess of 2 million applications each year and makes payments to some 1.4 million people every week. Given the scale of its expenditure, a key priority for the Department is to ensure that resources are targeted at the people who need them most. As it currently stands, where fraud or error is discovered and when there is sufficient evidence available, an overpayment is raised. This is only right and proper. This approach creates a climate where people who are being overpaid know that they have a responsibility to repay the monies concerned and that the Department will take appropriate steps to effect recovery of the monies involved. Effective debt recovery is an integral part of the deterrent to fraudulent claiming. All debts owing to the Department, as a result of benefits received in excess of entitlement, are repayable in full. The Department does not apply interest or penalties on the amounts owing, unlike other Government agencies. All overpayments, regardless of the cause, must be repaid. It should be noted that almost 50% of the value of the overpayments raised in 2013 were as a result of fraud and less than 5% were as a result of departmental error. The overall objective of the Department’s debt recovery policy is to maximise the recovery of overpayments to protect public money at a time of scarce resources. The Social Welfare Act 2012 introduced a provision allowing the Department to make a recovery from an individual’s social welfare payment of up to 15% of their personal weekly rate. That means that if there are other payments into the household, regarding a dependent spouse or children, for example, including child benefit, those payments are not affected in any way. It is only the personal rate that is affected, so if a person is on €188 per week, it is 15% of that. The legislation enacted preserves a minimum entitlement of 85% of a beneficiary’s personal payment in all cases of overpayment, leaving increases for dependants and rent supplements completely intact. In addition to the legislation regarding deductions from social welfare payments, I also introduced measures in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 to allow for the recovery of social welfare overpayments by way of notice of attachment to earnings and-or money held by an overpaid person in a financial institution. The measures were designed to improve the Department’s ability to recover overpayments from persons with disposable assets or earned income, and who generally are no longer dependent on social welfare payments. In all cases of overpayment the debt holder is given the opportunity to engage with the Department with regard to their particular circumstances.In general, the recovery amount proposed would be the maximum repayment the person can afford in order to pay back the overpayment as quickly as possible. The new provision in the Bill will allow for the existing powers of recovery by way of a notice of attachment to be extended to other State payments. This will allow the Department to consider recovering social welfare debts from amounts due to be paid to its debtors from State funds. Given that State payments are ultimately financed by the taxpayer, it does not make sense that the taxpayer would give money to a person who has an outstanding overpayment without seeking the repayment of the debt. As is already the case with my Department’s current powers of attachment, the thrust of this provision is not aimed at persons who make a genuine attempt to discharge an overpayment due to the Department, but specifically at those who fail on a continuing basis to fulfil their obligations to repay what is legally due to the State. As I said at the outset, total social welfare expenditure in 2014 will account for some 40% of gross current Government expenditure. Protecting the integrity of this expenditure must be a top priority of this Government, and key to this is tackling fraud and abuse within the social welfare system. I gave the Deputies the recovery figures for last year, €73 million, and pointed out that this is almost as much as the annual cost of the much-valued free travel for our pensioners, which costs approximately €77 million. The Department has not received any applications for redundancy payments or insolvency payments in respect of the employees of the Paris Bakery. I have made arrangements that employees of the business can contact the community welfare service to assist them with their immediate needs and every assistance is being given to those who have approached the Department. There are cases in which companies have ceased trading without engaging in a formal winding-up process, and in some such cases those employers owe money to their employees. Such employees are not eligible for payments under the insolvency payments scheme. My Department is reviewing the position to establish what, if anything, can be done to progress payments to individuals in these situations. As Minister for Social Protection, I am in favour of ensuring the comprehensiveness of our social insurance system. Following the extension of social insurance to part-time and self-employed workers, spouses of self-employed workers constitute one of the few categories of worker not covered by social insurance. This measure will give those who work alongside their spouses or civil partners in a self-employed capacity the right to access social insurance. Up to now, only one of the couple could be insured as a self-employed worker for social insurance benefits. The spouses and civil partners who will now have to access social insurance will be required to make a return and pay PRSI where their annual income exceeds €5,000, similarly to other self-employed workers. This will give them an entitlement in their own right to maternity benefit and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner’s contributory pension as well as the State contributory pension. Exact numbers of those affected by the current exclusion are difficult to estimate, as this group is outside the social insurance system. Census 2011 data suggest the current exclusion from social insurance affects fewer than 6,000 spouses or civil partners who assist in family businesses. The 2011 data indicate that there are 5,872 “assisting relatives”, of whom 3,315 are female and 2,557 are male. Some of these assisting relatives could be family members other than spouses or civil partners. This provision will extend the possibility to spouses of self-employed people such as farmers to enter the social insurance system and be fully insured. I thank all the Deputies who welcomed this progressive measure for spouses of the self-employed. I am glad so many Deputies have welcomed the changes in the provisions relating to family income supplement. Deputy O’Dea raised the issue of the requirement for a certain number of hours to be worked to qualify for payment of this supplement. The full-time employment condition has been a fundamental part of the FIS payment since its introduction in 1984, although the number of hours worked in order to satisfy this condition has been reduced considerably. When the scheme was established, a minimum of 30 hours of work per week was required to qualify. This was subsequently reduced to 24 hours in 1986, 20 hours in 1989 and 38 a fortnight or 19 hours a week in 1996. Further reducing the hours worked requirement would have expenditure implications and could be decided on only in a budgetary context. It is also important that FIS does not inadvertently subsidise unsustainably low earnings or encourage employers to offer minimal hours of employment. Some Deputies outlined a scenario of zero-hour contracts in which employment in some cases would have amounted to one or two hours per day, with social welfare paying for the rest of the time. Some of the Deputies must think through their proposals on this. FIS provides an important support in reducing poverty in working households. FIS also provides an incentive to remain in employment in circumstances in which the employee might be only marginally better off than if he or she were unemployed and claiming social welfare. This year we will spend €280 million on FIS, a very considerable increase in expenditure. FIS benefits 44,000 families and 98,000 children, which is a very significant assistance to families in work on low incomes. It is important that we support such families. Deputy Ó Snodaigh asked why the Bill needs to be enacted before the summer recess. The main reason is the need to comply with the 5 August 2014 deadline for the transposition of Articles 7 and 8 of EU Directive 2010/41/EU, which gives the right to spouses of the self-employed to participate in the social insurance system. While the transposition of the main provisions of this directive was required by 5 August 2012, Ireland availed of a two-year derogation on the transposition of Articles 7 and 8 of the directive. Article 7 requires that member states take the necessary measures to ensure spouses and civil partners of self-employed workers who participate in the business of the self-employed worker have access to social protection. Article 8 requires that member states take the necessary measures to ensure that female self-employed workers, spouses and civil partners be granted sufficient maternity allowance cover during periods of interruption of their occupational activity due to pregnancy or motherhood.

I add my voice to the shock and, frankly, the disgust which so many people feel over this discovery. I pay particular tribute to two individuals, local historian Catherine Corless, who has done such assiduous work in uncovering the facts of this horrific case in Tuam, and Alison O'Reilly for her journalistic work and endeavour. Thanks to those two individuals, we know that between 1925 and 1961, the home in Tuam was recorded as the place of death for 796 babies and children, which is a shocking and deeply disturbing discovery. There was no information relating to the burial of these children in any graveyard or cemetery, and one possible explanation for the discrepancy is that the bodies were buried on grounds of the home without any record or documentation. The lack of a national outcry initially is perhaps, sadly, an indication of the way in which Irish people have been desensitised to this sort of discovery and how the church and State has let down some of the most vulnerable people in our society. We all need to reflect on that, as it is quite sad and shocking. The discovery is a damning indictment of the maternity care provided both by the church and State.During this period infant mortality was significantly higher than it is today. It was also much higher among so-called illegitimate children than in the rest of society. We need to reflect on that in terms of how we cherish our children equally or otherwise.
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	237	For anybody to say that these events are surprising would be untrue. The scandals of the mother and baby homes have long been an open secret. The horrors of Tuam were investigated in 1944, when children were found to be emaciated, pot-bellied and uncared for, and there were a far greater number of them than there should have been. The records from that home were handed over to Galway City Council in 1961 and the grave was found in 1971. Now in 2014 people are throwing up their hands and saying they knew nothing about this. Irish society knew full well about the scandals in the mother and baby homes where women were exploited for unpaid labour and half starved. Everybody knew that one went in there to have a baby but never left with one. The child either died in there or was forcibly and often illegally adopted in those institutions. That is why the State has failed to acknowledge what went on in them. Last year, I gave the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs’ predecessor a study and report commissioned by Adoption Rights Now on similar scandals in Sean Ross Abbey, Castlepollard and Bessborough mother and baby homes. That organisation did clinical research which showed that almost 50% of the children there died. Hundreds died and were buried in angels plots to which people have no access. The State knew about these things. The remedy we need is that the denial must stop. There must be a full inquiry into the treatment of women, the forcible removal of their children and an opening of the books to assist those people in getting the information and records they desire. The plots must be handed over and access given to parents and family members. Ideas such as justice, accountability and compensation have to be dealt with or we have learnt nothing from the past.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	238	I support the call for an independent inquiry into the deaths in the mother and baby homes. As someone who has represented east Galway and Tuam for over three decades, I am very saddened by and horrified at the information on the large number of deceased children involved. I have spoken to the Minister about this and thank him for giving me a hearing. I understand there could be four Departments in the cross-departmental response to examine the situation and particularly the burial of children in the mass grave. Donal O’Keeffe, writing in journal.ie quotes the historian Catherine Corless describing the mass grave as "filled to the brim with tiny bones and skulls". It is a terrible indictment of how we cherish children. The Minister would probably agree that the Bon Secours sisters must act on their responsibility in this matter as they ran the home for mothers and babies. I understand the sisters and the members of the local children's home graveyard committee have met to discuss a memorial of the unmarked children's grave in Tuam and that the names will be recorded. I ask the Minister and the Government to work with the local committee in Tuam and the families of the deceased to have a dignified re-interment of the remains of the children. When one thinks of children being discarded, it is time to find out exactly what records existed in the old health board, which preceded the Health Service Executive, HSE, and in Galway County Council because according to media reports there is some dispute about where the records are held. I hope the Minister will be able to give us some of this information. I hope to have a minute later to ask further questions.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	239	Reports over recent days have once again reminded us of how religious and State institutions, and society failed women and children. The horrific revelations of the appalling treatment of thousands of babies and their mothers have not received the urgent attention of Government and State authorities that they warrant. The Government has confirmed the establishment of an interdepartmental initiative. I do not believe this goes far enough and neither does the Adoption Rights Alliance. It is an ad hoc response to media reports although the Government received a report from Adoption Rights Now in July 2013. While, quite rightly, Tuam has received much attention in recent days, this report by Adoption Rights Now confirms this is a much wider issue. Between 300 and 500 babies are buried in Castlepollard. There are also Sean Ross Abbey in Roscrea and Bessborough in Cork. Reading the report over recent days, I was horrified to learn about the brutal, barbaric and inhumane treatment of innocent babies and their mothers. Nothing short of a full apology from the Taoiseach and a full independent investigation are needed and deserved by these women and the families of these babies given what they were subjected to. We need to ensure the Garda Síochána and the forensic experts are involved in the investigation. We must not forget about the living adopted who are in identity limbo. Unlike the anonymous dead, they have an opportunity to reconnect with their families. The Minister needs to put in place a parallel process to deal with both without any further delay.

The Tuam home operated from the 1920s until its closure in 1961. During that time there was a memorable phrase in my town of which one constituent continues to remind me, that there was "a deliberate unknowing" of what was going on there and in other institutions at the time. One of the aims of understanding the past is to better understand how to approach the future. I am sure the Minister would share my concerns about families being evicted today in Dublin and children as young as three and four being holed up in a hotel. There are children in the care of the HSE who go missing. We need to be concerned about the welfare of children in direct provision under the auspices of the State. There are many examples on which we could focus given the dark warnings of history presented to the House this week. It is evident that the public is very concerned about the reports emerging about the home in Tuam. They are outraged by the different sides of the story being presented. While I welcome the steps announced to proceed with a preliminary scoping of facts, the public will not be codded. I know the Minister is not that type of politician. We cannot fall victim to a territorial dispute between Departments. What authority does the Minister have to bring them together? Has he contacted the Garda Síochána in respect of any potential criminal investigation of this matter?What measures has the Garda Síochána taken to secure the site in question since the announcement was made this morning and to ensure that all records from the home have been secured and that the site is secured, as we speak? If no such actions have been taken with respect to the last two points, can we expect that they will take place immediately? Has the Government been in contact with the Garda Síochána since the announcement that was made during Leaders' Questions this morning?
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	241	I wish to thank the Deputies for raising this important issue which has been met with shock and horror over the past few days. The situation in Tuam, in particular, is almost too graphic and horrible to believe - young, innocent children, their lives so short and harrowing were, it seems, even in death not even given a proper, decent or humane burial. While the revelations in Tuam are indeed graphic and appalling they are a reminder of a wider and darker past where our children were far from cherished. The history of mother and baby homes in Ireland in the early and middle decades of the 20th century reflects a brutally, unforgiving response by society, religious and State institutions and, in many cases, even families to young women and children when they were in most need and most vulnerable. Tuam was not unique in Ireland as a mother and baby home. Mother and baby homes were not unique in Ireland as cold and brutal places of refuge from an unforgiving society. Ireland was, at least in some respects, not entirely unique among countries in dealing with its most vulnerable citizens in a manner that would not be countenanced in a civilised democracy. However, in Ireland today we are confronted by the fact that as a newly established State we besmirched our lofty ambitions and made hollow our promise to cherish all the children of the nation equally. Whereas in their day these women and children were unjustly made to feel so much shame, we must now carry this shame for how this country dealt with them in their time of need. The revelations in Tuam, County Galway have brought to the fore the situation in other mother and baby homes throughout the country. The practices in mother and baby homes have to date not featured prominently in the various reviews and investigations which have dealt with many of the past abuses which were inflicted on vulnerable citizens, many of them women and children. It is fully recognised by me and my Government colleagues that we need to establish the truth. As has been announced, consideration is being given to the best means of addressing the harrowing details emerging regarding the children who died some years ago in mother and baby homes and the many questions raised regarding these deaths. We will properly review these issues. We will not confine this review to Tuam. My colleagues and I have tasked officials from key Departments with scoping these issues so that the Government can make decisions on the precise content, format and method of organising this review. Relevant Departments have met today and are working together in preparation for the Government's early consideration and determination of the best course of action. The cross-departmental initiative under way is examining these matters and will report to Government on how they might be addressed. Departments involved include the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government. Among the decisions to be made by the Government in finalising arrangements as part of its overall deliberations on the format and conduct of the review will be the assignment of lead responsibility for implementation. Such scoping work is essential if fully informed decisions are to be made and matters are to be dealt with in an effective way. This is the experience in effectively initiating successful review processes in recent years. The work is proceeding speedily and promptly. It will consider all of the issues which have arisen and the particular factors which the review will need to take into account including, for example, the passage of time. The Government will be kept up to date and expects to have the product of this consideration before the end of this month. Fortunately, I can state that much has changed in Irish society in regard to the rights of mothers and children. In the domain of my own responsibilities I can point to legislative changes to reflect greater regard for children's welfare and rights. However, in saying this, I in no way want to detract from the pain and hurt that was caused to so many woman and children by the events of the past. The Government is committed to ensuring that the most appropriate action is taken to ensure that the concerns with regard to these deeply tragic and disturbing past events can be addressed and addressed in a prompt and swift manner.

The interdepartmental group will have a good deal of work to do and I welcome the early deadline in terms of reporting back to Government. That is essential because, as we know from previous bitter experience, these things can drag on. I urge the Minister to stick to the deadline of the end of the month. That is extremely important. Following on from Deputy Keaveney's questions relating to securing the site and so on, I consider some of the remarks, which have been attributed to members of An Garda Síochána, where they said that there was no suggestion of impropriety was premature in the extreme, presumptuous and not appropriate. I hope that the Minister or figures in Government have communicated that to An Garda Síochána. Does the Minister expect that there will now be a criminal investigation into events in the home in Tuam because, clearly, there is an abundance of evidence to suggest that there was impropriety? It is important not only for there to be an official investigation but also a Garda criminal investigation into activities there.

The scoping exercise would pale into irrelevance if we do not take immediate steps with the co-operation of the Garda Síochána to secure the site. If we are going to establish the truth and the facts, we could be on the edge of something incredibly serious for Irish society and for the Irish people with respect to the emergence of truth. We need to take whatever steps are necessary to ensure that the outcome of this investigation cannot be prejudiced. We need to secure the site as soon as possible. Has the Minister contacted the Garda Síochána with respect to taking action to secure the site? On the conclusion of this debate, will every action be taken by the Government to ensure that the quality of this investigation cannot be challenged by any third party or the courts?
#ClareDaly	unknown-#ClareDaly-party	unknown-#ClareDaly-dob	unknown-#ClareDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	244	The report which the Minister's Department has had for almost a year concluded by referring to the children who died, who had never had a name, a birth certificate, a death certificate or a baptism. It concluded that the adoption regime in Ireland was directly responsible for and guilty of the most truly evil crimes against humanity, a slaughter of innocence, a war waged against pregnant girls as young as 12 years of age, including the victims of rape and incest and their babies. It states that if these cold facts do not warrant a public inquiry, what does? The Minister's Department did not carry out a public inquiry. I have raised this issue many times in this House and nobody really wanted to know about them when the facts were known and made available. If we are serious about learning the lesson, that wrong must be acknowledged first. The State was quite happy to banish pregnant girls, who had the cheek to get pregnant outside marriage, and their babies and make them disappear. The religious ran the institutions and an adoption racket was carried out by this State with the religious orders involved. What we need for closure on this is a full acknowledgment by the State of its role, the holding of those responsible accountable for their actions, compensation, and particularly a handing over of the records and the addresses of the missing identities of thousands of Irish children, many of them adults now, with their history stolen because of an institutional discrimination against women and their children. Dealing with the rights of those people who were illegally adopted has been ignored far too long and is at the centre of this issue also.
#MichaelKitt	unknown-#MichaelKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	245	I thank the Minister for his assurance that there will be a report to Government on this matter before the end of the month. I hope we will have an opportunity to debate that report in the House. I commend the local historian, Catherine Corless, on the work she has done in bringing forward these revelations. As I said, there is some confusion as to where the relevant records and other material were filed, whether with the local authority or the former Western Health Board. Will the Minister clarify that issue, if not today then as soon as possible? The issue of the cruelty and indifference shown to vulnerable children and mothers in Ireland was raised by a man who has been called the most famous priest in the world, Fr. Edward Flanagan, back in 1946, when he travelled from Nebraska to Ireland. He described the treatment of children in church and State care in this country as "a scandal, un-Christlike and wrong". Today, Fr. Peter McVerry, who has championed Fr. Flanagan as one of the people who inspired him in his own work, is a strong champion of the homeless. As we know, youth homelessness is on the rise and increasing numbers of families, as well as individuals, are finding themselves on the streets. These types of issues are coming back to haunt us, some 70 years after the neglect and mistreatment described by Fr. Flanagan. I hope the Minister will report back to us as soon as possible on all the issues that were raised today.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	246	I thank the Minister for his reply. Unfortunately, I do not have full confidence in the interdepartmental initiative that has been established. I assume his Department will lead it, the same Department that sat on a report for almost 12 months. Were it not for the efforts of a local historian and investigative journalists, we might not be discussing this issue today. It is an extremely time sensitive issue and must be given the priority it deserves. Will the Minister agree, at a minimum, that when he receives the report of the interdepartmental group, he will explore the possibility of a full independent inquiry? That is what is needed. We also need all adoption records to be opened immediately, in line with international best practice. A similar scenario to what we are dealing with here, involving forced adoptions, unfolded in Australia last year. The then Prime Minister of that country, Julia Gillard, offered a full and frank apology for the state's role in those events and put in place proper, robust channels to ensure people could obtain the details of their identity. We do not have to reinvent the wheel here. We must act in accordance with international best practice and in a humane and compassionate manner.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2014-06-05 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	247	I thank the Deputies again for raising this important issue. The object of the interdepartmental exercise is to seek and uncover the truth, which is not something that can be done overnight. The deadlines we have imposed will ensure there is no delay in dealing with this issue. Deputies Creighton and Keaveney asked about my contact with the Garda Síochána. I have not initiated any such contact on this matter. The Garda Síochána is an independent State policing and investigative organisation. I do not direct it on matters of crime or seek to initiate criminal investigations. The force will be expected to exercise judgment with regard to alleged criminal activity in this case, in the same way as it does in respect of any criminal investigation. It is important that each Department with any involvement in the issues surrounding this case is not only consulted, but activated to take appropriate action. That is the basis of the interdepartmental approach we are taking. This obviously will include the Department of Justice and Equality, my own Department, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health. There may also be a role for the Department of Social Protection, with particular reference to the records to which Deputy Clare Daly referred, as well as the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade. In fact, most Departments will have an involvement in this issue. I will be keeping Government informed as to the progress of the interdepartmental group's work. Its report will be presented to Cabinet by the end of this month, after which we will decide, at the earliest opportunity, on the extent and scope of further investigation and inquiry. The House will have an opportunity to debate the issues at that stage. I assure Deputy Clare Daly that the issues she raised, including the document she mentioned, will be examined by the interdepartmental group and form part of the current scoping exercise. I reiterate that I am not ruling anything out in terms of Government action on this issue. I ask the Deputies to allow time and space for the various interests in the various Departments to do the work that needs to be done. They have already had their first meeting and a timeframe is in place. I will keep the House informed as matters progress in the coming weeks.
