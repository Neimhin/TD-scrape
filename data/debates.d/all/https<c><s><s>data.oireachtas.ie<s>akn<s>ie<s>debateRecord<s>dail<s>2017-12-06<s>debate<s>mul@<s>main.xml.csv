#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	0	Tá áthas orm bheith anseo chun an cheist seo a chuir ar an Aire ar maidin. The question might appear to be somewhat moot but I do not believe it is. It asks when primary schools will be notified of a payment date for funding. I believed it was necessary to table a question on the minor works grant because of the incredible delays in that respect this year and the stress caused to principles because of that. The Minister will not mind my expanding it to encompass the press release issued yesterday regarding the minor works grant which contained the bombshell of an indication that the grant may not be paid in 2018. I ask the Minister what was meant by that statement in the press release.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	1	As the Deputy knows, this issue has been raised in the House in the past few weeks, including by members of his party, and I explained at that stage that money was very tight but we were reviewing the capital position for the end of the year and I was endeavouring to find a solution. I am pleased to tell the House that I yesterday announced that €28.8 million minor works grant funding for primary schools throughout the country will be paid next week. The applicable rates are €5,500 per school plus €18.50 per mainstream pupil and €74 per special needs pupil attending the school. The grant allows schools to carry out minor works without needing to deal directly with the Department by way of capital application. This has always been a residual sum. There is no annual provision for the grant and it has always been set out in the circular that it depends on the availability of resources. I appreciate that many people believe that is unsatisfactory. The Deputy asked whether the grant will be paid next year. In view of the flow of new school commitments we will need to meet, it is currently unlikely that we will be in a position to pay a minor works grant during calendar year 2018 and it will probably have to be paid early in 2019. I make that announcement in order to give schools adequate notice of our position. People will appreciate that there has been a strong surge in the number of pupils in the school system and that the priority for the Department must be to ensure that those children have a school to which to go each September. That has been the focus of our provision and we successfully delivered 19,000 permanent places this year.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	2	I am grateful that the Minister has confirmed the information contained in yesterday's press release. It will come as a bombshell to schools throughout the country that there will be no minor works grant next year and that it is likely to be paid in January 2019. According to the press release, the Minister will decide in January 2019 whether money is available to pay the grant but the Minister has said it will be paid at that stage. That would be utterly unsatisfactory for the House. The Minister must tell his Cabinet colleagues, including the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that this is not a discretionary grant but, rather, money on which schools have come to depend toward the back end of every year to do necessary minor works and without which they could not function. What should happen and what Fianna Fáil advocates is that the scheme and others like it should be put on a statutory footing such that Ministers would not have discretion over them. It is noteworthy that the grant was not paid in only one year during the recession. I ask the Minister to confirm that. It would be bizarre if, as the economy starts to turn, this were to be the key turning point at which the grant would not be paid. This relates to issues I have previously discussed with the Minister such as his capital budget being under severe pressure due to various factors, including the price of land. I hope that as part of the national capital plan he will highlight to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, that the grant is absolutely necessary for schools.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	4	It is a discretionary grant, not a permanent one and is not part of the first call on a capital budget. As the Deputy recognised, it has not been paid every year. Nonetheless, I recognise the point he has made and am very keen that as we shape our ten-year long-term capital plan schemes such as this would become a permanent fixture and I will be putting that case to the Government. However, I have to manage the budget available to me as prudently as possible in order to deliver the needs of the education system. The Deputy knows, as do all Members, that during the crash capital budgets dropped to one third of what they were, which has put pressure on meeting demands in an area such as this wherein there are increasing needs in terms of demographics, special education and so on. A balance must be struck and I believe that my decision is reasonable and I am accomodating the needs of all stakeholders in the system as best I can.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	5	It would be unthinkable for the grant not to be paid next year. I hope that the Minister's press release turns out to be wrong and that he revises his ambition regarding the minor works grant for next year. Schools will not function without it and repairs will go undone. This week, principals were preparing to go to banks to seek overdrafts to fund projects it had been intended to fund out of the grant. The Minister said it has not been paid every year. However, it was not paid in only one year, which was in the depths of the recession and caused considerable controversy, difficulty and hardship. That cannot be allowed to happen as the economy begins to turn. The grant must be paid and put on a statutory footing, as Fianna Fáíl is seeking, such that schools can have certainty on how they will be funded. The back end of the year would be a financial black hole for schools if they did not have the grant. They have come to depend on the Government for this funding and rightly so because they are publicly funded schools.They should not have to reach into their own pockets or opt for further fundraising on top of the burdens they place on parents already.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	6	I understand what the Deputy said. I will seek to have this incorporated in a ten-year plan but I have no doubt that if Deputy Barry Cowen was here he would be demanding extra capital spending on housing and if Deputy Kelleher was here he would be demanding extra capital spending on health-----
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	7	Those Departments are not cutting capital spending. The Minister is cutting a project.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	8	-----but the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has to add up all those demands and ensure a balance is achieved in terms of what is affordable. That is the exercise that has to be done each year at budget time but I take the point the Deputy is making. I would certainly like to see this being put on a permanent footing over time but this is a reasonable arrangement for the schools.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	9	My question relates to the current homeless crisis and how that is impacting children who are currently homeless and living in unsuitable hotels and bed and breakfast accommodation. What plans does the Department of Education and Skills have to give teachers and schools the necessary skills to deal with children who are experiencing a very difficult time of crisis in their lives? Would the Minister comment on that?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	10	I thank Deputy Funchion for her question. The entire House acknowledges that we are dealing with unprecedented levels of homelessness and the Government is seeking to respond to that. My Department has a number of schemes that support the position of children who are homeless but the first point of call would be the Tusla educational welfare service.  The Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness includes specific actions for delivery by Tusla. They include that home school community liaison and school completion staff will assist children and families experiencing homelessness to maintain regular school attendance. Children in homeless accommodation will be prioritised within the school completion programme for services such as breakfast and homework clubs. Additional resources will be put in place to strengthen inter-agency arrangements with Tusla including family support, social work and education welfare. Tusla will appoint specific staff to assist in accessing requisite family support and child welfare services and managing any difficulties that arise for children in relation to school participation. A joined-up approach will be promoted between education, health and Tusla to meet the needs of homeless families using the existing children and young people’s services committees. Access to free public transport will be provided for school journeys and outings away from the emergency accommodation. The staff of schools are very sensitive to the needs of children who are experiencing disruption in their lives and make every effort to support the additional needs they experience. In this regard, they have the support of the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which works with schools through the continuum of support model it has developed. I have strengthened the provision of NEPS staff. In addition, we have the professional development service for teachers, PDST, well-being team, which provides support to teachers and schools. DEIS, which is our main policy initiative for disadvantaged areas, has the scope to cater to children with particular needs as a result of homelessness.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	11	I raise this issue because there are 1,200 children in homeless accommodation who are attending primary school and 600 children who are attending secondary school. Those figures are from Focus Ireland. I was glad to hear the Minister mention school completion. I am a big advocate of that programme but its funding has been cut massively in recent years. It is struggling as it is so I do not see how it would be able to take on the extra burden of dealing with children in homeless accommodation unless its funding is increased. If that is the case it would be a welcome statement. I am well aware of the position with regard to DEIS but only 55% of children in this situation are in DEIS schools, which means that 45% - nearly half - fall out of that system. The Minister mentioned Tusla and NEPS but not everything will fall within their remit. I cannot see Tusla dealing with practical situations such as children trying to get to and from school or children being unable to concentrate because they are not getting adequate sleep due to living in one room with their family, not getting an opportunity to complete work and being completely exhausted from the experience. I do not see Tusla playing a role in that. If it is, I would welcome that and the Minister might provide further information on it.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	12	I outlined in the reply the role Tusla plays, in particular using its home school community liaison service, its support for public transport, the additional resources for family support, social work and education and welfare. As the Deputy is aware, that whole element has been transferred to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. My Department's national educational psychological service, NEPS, provides support to schools to allow them have the capacity to deal with well-being problems presented by all students. Children who are homeless are likely to present with particular problems so we have strengthened that service. It has a model where individual children can be referred but also it tends to work more to build the capacity of schools to deal with problems they encounter. Across the range we are very sensitive to the needs. There is no doubt that children who are homeless present particular problems but as the Deputy knows, there are many children who present problems to which we have to cater. The build up of the well-being programme and the NEPS and the Tusla services are designed to be flexible and respond to the needs as they arise.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	13	The Minister mentioned that there is a support programme for teachers. Could he expand on that? Are there guidelines or some sort of guidance for schools? I ask this because many of the teachers I deal with are not aware of any supports for them to deal with children living in emergency accommodation. In terms of what the Minister said about Tusla, I was not aware it had a role. My understanding was that it passed that on to another service. If that is the case, are there guidelines that can be issued to schools, particularly those that have a high volume of children living in emergency accommodation? That would be very helpful for teachers in terms of counselling services for them. This is a new phenomena that has developed in recent years and it is a major issue for teachers to try to deal with, particularly the more recently qualified teachers who are trying to get to grips with all the issues that present in a classroom but particularly those to do with children living in emergency accommodation.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	14	I assure the Deputy that Tusla has a service to every school in the country. It is responsible for monitoring school attendance. It deals with schools on a very regular basis to understand the problems it is encountering, monitor difficulties and provide supports as appropriate. The same is true of the National Educational Psychological Service. It has a capacity building service to every school in the country. It responds flexibly to acute cases in terms of referrals but provides a more capacity building service to schools. Both those services are well known to schools and are available to assist in any individual case.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	15	Does the Minister agree with concerns being expressed that there are more special needs assistants than members of An Garda Síochána, and will he make a statement on the matter?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	16	No. I would not agree with any such concerns being expressed. It has been a core goal of our Action Plan for Education that every child will have an equal opportunity to fulfil their potential in school. That has had strong legislative support from the Oireachtas when as far back as 2004 we passed the Education of Persons with Special Educational Needs Act, which set out the inclusive approach to education of children with special educational needs. The consequence of that is that we have had an enormous growth in both resource teaching and special needs assistants, SNAs, and that has a knock-on effect. The number of SNAs is currently 13,990, which represents an increase of 32% since 2011. There are over 34,000 children receiving the support of SNAs. That figure is up dramatically in that same period, more or less proportionately. Almost 60% of those children are supported in mainstream schools, 20% in special classes and the remainder in special schools. It is provided to ensure that all pupils have the care needs to allow them participate in education. It has resulted in a dramatic improvement in the completion of children with special needs in school so we are seeing children with special needs getting to fulfil their potential in the school. The allocation is done entirely independently by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. It assesses objectively the needs of each child and decides against criteria where they are allocated. The NCSE is carrying out a comprehensive assessment of the SNA scheme aimed at providing better outcomes for students and ensuring we are making the best additional investment for children with special educational needs. The Government is committed to ensuring the best possible results for children and students in this area. This process is the best way to deliver that. I have therefore asked the NCSE to conduct a comprehensive review of the SNA scheme and this review is due to be completed early next year.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	17	As a former SNA, I acknowledge the fantastic work SNAs do. They are a huge part of the education system. I welcome the increase in special needs provision in recent years. The transformation of special education over the past 20 years, in which successive Governments have played a part, has been remarkable. We can all be very proud of this. Nonetheless, parents of children with special needs were shocked to hear a senior Government Minister say that there are now more SNAs than there are gardaí. There is concern that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, believes this is a bad thing as he is reported as having expressed alarm about the sharp increase in the cost of education for children with special needs - our most vulnerable children - which is costing the State more than the higher education system. It is reported that the Minister, Deputy Donohoe, has commissioned a review of the special needs assistance scheme. The Minister, Deputy Bruton, referenced this review in his reply. According to Lorraine Dempsey of the Special Needs Parents Association rising costs are more than justified and what is alarming is that the Department of Education and Skills has not anticipated these increases. I would like the Minister to comment on the matter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	18	I can assure the Deputy that the Minister for Finance is one of the strongest supporters of investment in special education needs, in respect of which provision has increased since 2011. Even in the most difficult times, in 2011 22,000 children were provided with SNA support. SNA provision now stands at 34,000, which means an additional 12,000 children are now in receipt of SNA support. Also, with the agreement of the Minister for Finance, into the future the provision of SNAs will be provided for in the Estimates such that schools will no longer have to wait until late in the year for know their allocations. We have already made provision for the appointment of SNAs for September 2018 in this year's budget. This is the first time this has been done and this has been facilitated by the Minister for Finance. In response to the Deputy's question, we will be in a position to allow parents and schools know earlier of their allocations. A review of this scheme is really important. We did a similar review in respect of resource teaching and it resulted in the development of a model that I believe is much better than the previous model.
#MargaretMurphyOMahony	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-party	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-dob	unknown-#MargaretMurphyOMahony-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	19	I welcome that into the future everyone will know earlier where they stand with regard to the allocation of hours. The Minister mentioned the review. Have the terms of reference for this review been agreed? Will the emphasis be on short-term financial sustainability or the long-term social and individual good of enabling children to realise their full potential, which is more important? Will the terms of reference acknowledge that, as stated by the special education supports groups, costs are rising owing to better diagnosis, additional medical complexities and the growth in child population?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	20	I can assure the Deputy that there is wide consultation on this review. The Deputy will be aware that the chairman of the NCSE, Mr. Eamon Stack, is a former inspector of the Department of Education and Skills and a man of high reputation. The review is being conducted to ensure that the full potential of each child is secured. Great care will be taken to ensure that all evidence on need in this area, international and domestic, will be gathered. Having had sight of the work done on the resource teaching model, which I believe is a much better model as a result of the review, I look forward to the findings and recommendations of the new review early in the new year.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	21	I have raised with the Minister on several occasions, including by way of meeting, the fate of the playing pitches at Clonkeen College. As the Minister is aware, the Christian Brothers are planning to sell 7.5 acres of land used as playing pitches by Clonkeen College. Seven members of the board of management have been forced to take High Court proceedings to prevent this sale, which will rob the current 500 students and future generations of students of playing fields, from proceeding. Will the Minister help to secure the future of these pitches or will he take a hands-off attitude and force the board of management members to take very expensive legal proceedings, with uncertain outcomes, to save them?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	22	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. The Minister of State, Deputy Mitchell O'Connor, organised the deputation of which Deputy Boyd Barrett was a member. The Deputy and I have had frequent conversations about the issue since.  The difficulty is that the fields in question are owned by the Congregation of Christian Brothers. The decision by the Congregation of Christian Brothers, which is a private entity, to dispose of land owned by the congregation is a matter for it.  My Department understands that the board of management or members of the board of management are taking legal proceedings against the Congregation of Christian Brothers relating to the sale of the fields. My Department has no role in such proceedings. I wish to clarify for the Deputy that the Congregation of the Christian Brothers wrote to my Department in early May in regard to the disposal of part of the lands at Clonkeen College and it stated that this disposal was the subject of contractual arrangements between the congregation and a builder. The Brothers indicated that 7.5 acres of land currently licensed to Clonkeen College, together with the Edmund Rice School Trust, ERST, head offices, which borders Clonkeen College, are involved in the sale. 
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	23	I have tabled several parliamentary questions to the Minister on this issue. In the most recent parliamentary question I asked the Minister for the details of the so-called binding agreement referenced by the Christian Brothers and recycled by him in various responses. The Minister's response was that the Department has not seen the contacts for sale. In regard to the case being taken to the courts, the details of which I cannot comment on, the Christian Brothers have indicated that this will delay the sale which suggests there is no binding contract and the sale is not complete. There is time to intervene. The members of the board of management and the wider Clonkeen College community cannot afford to raise the type of money necessary to take a case to the High Court to secure these pitches. What they and I want to know is how the Minister can say a school in which there has been massive public investment is not his business but is a private matter for the Christian Brothers. It is bizarre that facilities in which there has been major public investment are going to be substantially degraded to the detriment of 570 students.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	24	The congregation has informed the Department that the lands concerned have been sold, that it has signed and exchanged legally binding contracts with the purchasers and that it cannot reverse this transaction. If a legal challenge is made to those contracts, which like the Deputy I am not in a position to comment on, it will be for the courts to determine the matter. Where my Department invests in property, there is a lean on those properties to ensure they are used for the educational purpose. This is true of anything the State has invested in these properties and they are protected. In this instance, we are speaking about land adjacent to Clonkeen College which has been in the use of students. The Christian Brothers as the legal owners of that land have the right to dispose of it. That is the legal position that I cannot alter.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	25	The Minister could alter it, for example, by subjecting it to compulsory purchase order. When I previously suggested this to the Minister his response was that the Department cannot do that but it can and does do so by asking local authorities to compulsorily purchase land for school building. I would suggest that the Minister do that in this instance and thus save the board of management and the wider Clonkeen College community the hardship of having to raise vast amounts to take a case to the High Court to save these pitches. The Department has invested in these pitches. They were upgraded and fenced with departmental funding. The sale of this land will impact on the capacity of the school to deliver recreational and sports facilities which matter. This provision is not an optional extra in education: it is critical in the context of the proper development of young people and in terms of tackling obesity by encouraging healthy exercise and so on. For these pitches to be sold and the Minister to stand idly by is unconscionable in terms of his responsibilities as Minister for Education and Skills for the education of these young people.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	26	The patron, which in this case is ERST, has, of course, the responsibility to provide for the students in the school. It is making provision and I understand the Christian Brothers have made arrangements for the transfer of some of the land. However, they own other land which they have made a decision to dispose of. I am not in a position to purchase it from them or to block the sale. This is a decision they have made and we have no role in the proceedings being taken by an entity to challenge the sale. I regret that this is the situation and that I cannot give the Deputy more reassurance.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	27	I am afraid I have no choice but to follow up on the Caranua situation. My specific question is on the number of outstanding appeals at Caranua, the length of time they have been outstanding and clarification on the nature of the delay in relation to the High Court action. Is the delay because Caranua is not dealing with appeals while a High Court action on a specific issue? Is it because the appeals officer has refused to deal with them or is it because the decisions have been made and Caranua is using a blanket decision not to deal with this? Can the Minister clarify what correspondence exists to tell the clients of Caranua what is happening, in particular in relation to the appeals process?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	28	The Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 provides for the appointment of suitably qualified persons who will consider appeals made by persons against decisions of Caranua. As I explained to the Deputy in response to her question of 25 October, I appointed two new appeals officers earlier this year, there having been one appeals officer prior to then. The 2012 Act provides that appeals officers shall be independent in the performance of their functions. While my Department provides administrative support to the appeals officers, I have no role in relation to individual appeals or the management of appeals generally. It is a matter for the appeals officers to plan their work as they see fit having regard to all relevant considerations. I am advised that there are currently 57 cases outstanding with the appeals officers, which is half as many as there were when I appointed them. There are seven cases which have been active for less than one month, 22 cases which have been active for between one and three months, 17 cases which have been active for between three and six months, one case which has been active for between nine and 12 months and four cases which have been active for over 12 months. I am aware that the initiation of legal action by Caranua has meant a number of cases have been held by the appeals officers pending resolution of the matter. I understand that some 12 cases are involved. I understand also that a number of new appeals cases that raise similar issues are awaiting responses from Caranua. The 2012 Act provides that a person affected by a decision of an appeals officer, including Caranua itself, may appeal that decision to the High Court on a point of law. I am aware that one such case has been initiated by Caranua and is currently before the High Court. In the circumstances, it would not be appropriate for me to comment further.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	29	I thank the Minister for the clarification and for confirming that the number of outstanding cases has reduced. In fact, there were 148 cases outstanding in June. By October, it was 76 and it is now 57. However, I ask the Minister to clarify what is happening in the High Court. I am not asking for details but about the status of the proceedings and, more particularly, how they are affecting the outstanding appeals. Significantly, there has been no report from the appeals officer. In response to a question, the Minister said it would be published shortly. We have no report to look at in relation to the 2016 appeals. Can the Minister clarify why that has not been published? I have the 2015 report before me. All the appeals were dealt with in that year and no case went to the High Court. Specifically, the appeals officer pointed out that there was a serious deficit in the notification of decisions. I asked in my question today what notification has been provided to the clients of Caranua on their cases and the High Court action. How has what is happening been spelt out for them?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	30	As I said in the reply, I understand both an individual and Caranua have the right to appeal a decision of an appeals officer. An appeals officer made a decision challenging the approach Caranua had taken and I understand an appeal was lodged this year. Obviously, the outcome of the decision of the High Court is awaited. I am told the 2016 annual report was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 10 November in fulfilment of the requirement laid down in the Act.
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	31	There are two distinct matters. There is the annual report from Caranua and there is the annual report from the appeals officer. Is the Minister saying the appeals officer's report has been laid before the Oireachtas and is now available for us? I have not seen it. I would like some clarity on the High Court action. At this point, I do not know if Caranua is bringing the case or if it is the independent appeals officer. It is a sorry state of affairs which reflects on Caranua and the Department. While I welcome the appointment of two appeals officers and the fact the number of outstanding appeals has reduced, we have appeals which have been waiting an extraordinary length of time. Where there is a huge defect is that decisions are not being notified in writing. In his 2015 report, the appeals officer said he could not deal with an appeal if there was no written decision. We highlighted this at the Committee of Public Accounts and it was highlighted at the education committee also. How many times must it be highlighted to ensure that the most basic and fundamental requirement of due process, namely, a written letter on a decision, is observed?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	32	I understand the report of the outgoing appeals officer, Mr. Patrick Whelan, was lodged, as I said, on 10 November. Since then, I have appointed two appeals officers and, as the Deputy has acknowledged, it has helped to clear the backlog. The appeal to the High Court is, as I understand it, an appeal by Caranua on a point of law, which it is entitled to bring. Caranua is entirely independent and I am not party to the reasons it made that decision. It has meant 12 cases are held up while other cases challenging the same point are potentially held up also.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	34	I do not have a supplementary on the issue of written decisions, but I will get back to the Deputy on that.

Building has been taking place for the last number of years and a lot more land is zoned for construction. The number of children in the area is phenomenal. At the last census, hundreds of children under six were recorded. Nevertheless, there has been no proper planning, once again, for Pelletstown Educate Together national school which has not even reached the prefab state and must bus children to a neighbouring school down the road. Can the Minister update the House on the latest position?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	37	My Department's capital programme continues to address the challenge posed by a rapidly increasing school population. To meet this challenge, my Department's capital investment programme for 2016 to 2021 details the school projects that are being progressed to meet this need. The capital programme also provides for devolved funding for additional classrooms for schools where an immediate enrolment need has been identified or where an additional teacher has been appointed. Since 2015, three new primary schools, namely, Pelletstown Educate Together national school, Scoil Sinéad national school and Broombridge Educate Together national school, have been established in the areas referred to by the Deputy to meet demographic growth. The six-year construction programme also includes building projects at five further schools in the area, namely, Mary Help of Christians national school, St. John Bosco junior and senior boys' national schools, North Dublin Muslim school and Holy Family school for the deaf. While there was no requirement for a new post-primary school in the area referred to by the Deputy, a new 1,000 pupil post-primary school opened in September 2017 in temporary accommodation in the adjoining school planning area of Carpenterstown-Castleknock. Nationwide demographic exercises for all school planning areas at primary and post-primary level, including the area referred to by the Deputy, are ongoing.The outcome will determine where additional school accommodation will be needed in the future. It is anticipated that decisions based on this exercise will be announced shortly.

Once again, it seems many houses and apartments have been put in an area, without thinking that a school might be needed. Pelletstown Educate Together national school was established three years ago. I went to see the basement of the building those children were being educated in, and my view is that if it were my child I would have protested about a building with no windows and fresh air. The parents went ahead on the promise that buildings would be ready. Now, the prefabs are not even fully ready. A permanent school building was promised to local people by the Taoiseach when he was a Minister, on 17 November 2015, and the then Minister, Deputy Burton, and that construction would start on permanent buildings for Pelletstown Educate Together national school in Ashtown, which operates from temporary premises. Two years on, there is no sign of a permanent building, or a site never mind a building.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	39	There are a number of schools involved in the area. The position, as I understand, with Pelletstown Educate Together is that it has three grades to date. The Department has reached agreement with the landowner of a preferred site and the acquisition is progressing through the conveyancing stage. Following completion of the acquisition, the architectural planning process for the provision of a new permanent building for the school will commence. Scoil Sinead has just one infant class at this stage. A potential site to facilitate this building project has been identified and is being progressed. Again, when this process has concluded the architectural planning will commence. The school in Broombridge is in a permanent site. These are the three immediate schools. There are five other schools and I outlined where extensions are being planned.
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	40	Five months ago it was progressing at conveyancing stage. The point is that more than two years ago two Ministers made pre-election promises and told the people of the area these schools were in the bag. Two years on, first class pupils have to be bussed up to Broombridge. Broombridge is not in this area. The other schools the Minister has spoken about are not in Ashtown either and many of them are Catholic schools. I am asking what is the plan to get Pelletstown Education Together national school out of the buildings it is in and not into temporary prefabs but the permanent school promised to it more than two years ago. In fact, people are now concerned about secondary schools, and that there is none in the area. Castleknock is being cited, which is now a Christian Brothers school thanks to the Department of Education and Skills not seeing fit to have a more non-denominational school. There is no school planned for the area. It is a bit disappointing. The principal, the parents and others would be very disappointed that here we are at the end of 2017 and there does not seem to have been any progress on acquiring the site and moving the school into a permanent building.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	41	I hate to witness a situation where a Deputy is not allowing facts to confuse her determination to state nothing is happening on this. I just read out that a site is required for this purpose, the landowner of the preferred site has been identified, agreement has been reached and the acquisition is progressing through the conveyancing stage-----

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	43	This school will be built. The Deputy tries to spread confusion. This school will be built. The Deputy also raised a question on how the Department selects schools. It selects schools on the basis of parental preference. This system has been run independently of the Department. It is not run by me. It is run by selection based on parents' preferences within the catchment area. That is a fair way of dealing with the issue.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	45	The Deputy may have one view, but parents have to be consulted. It is parents who, ultimately, are the primary educators and they have a role in deciding what school is selected. In Pelletstown, an Educate Together school was successfully selected. In another area, Scoil Sinead was selected. This is the people's choice in the area where the Deputy lives.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	48	Will the Minister send to each Deputy representing the area a detailed update? Like the previous speaker, I have submitted many questions to the Minister on this. I have to say, without going into the detail, some of the facts that have just been given are inaccurate and incorrect. The Minister needs to go back to the file and give us a detailed report on where it is at present. By the way, Pelletstown Educate Together is an absolutely first-class and an excellent school, which is well supported by the parents and I want to make this clear.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	49	I am quite happy to provide the Deputies with a position. We recognise it will take longer and, as a result, planning permission was granted on 11 October for a single-storey prefab building comprising four classrooms with other ancillary facilities. The expected completion date for the installation of the prefab is early December 2017. Work is going on to ensure children are accommodated while, at the same time, a longer term project is being advanced.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	51	I know this school well. The major project for Rosmini Community School is included in the six year construction programme, announced on 17 November 2015. The building project will provide a new 350 student post primary school with an multiple disability and visual impairment unit on the site of existing school building. Planning permission for this new school was lodged with Dublin City Council at the end of January 2017. Notification of decision to grant planning permission was received on 18 Aug 2017 from Dublin City Council. There has been a third party planning appeal to An Bord Pleanála, which has significantly delayed this project from progressing to tender stage. The design team appointed by my Department has submitted a detailed rebuttal of this appeal and a decision from An Bord Pleanála is awaited. This project is currently at stage 2B of architectural planning, which is detailed design. The design team is preparing the stage 2B submission, which will be submitted to my Department following the conclusion of the appeal to An Bord Pleanála. When the stage 2B submission has been received and reviewed, my Department will be in contact with the school authorities as regards the further progression of this project to tender and construction stages.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	52	I take it from the Minister's reply that its status and designation will continue. I know the school very well, I know its current and former staff and I know the current and former staff in ChildVision. They share the same campus and there has been a long tradition of children moving from one to the other. This is reflected in the ethos of Rosmini. Traditionally, it was inclusive of those children with a visual impairment and with other needs. When St. Mary's school for blind girls in Merrion closed quite a number went over to Rosmini. The reality now is there seems to be an effort to undermine its status. For example, transport has been refused to certain students with special needs. There is also the loss of a number of special needs assistants in the school. The Minister knows the school is in the prefabs on the grounds of All Hallows. There is concern that its status may not be recognised because of various things happening with the Department regarding the students who attend there and who have special needs.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	53	I know of no change in any policy on either transport or the provision of special needs assistants for children. Each case is examined on its merits. The status of Rosmini remains the same. It adjoins the campus managed by ChildVision in which St. Joseph's school for the visually impaired is located. Pupils graduate from St. Joseph's to Rosmini community school.The new school will have a multiple disability and visual impairment unit. I do not know what is the implication of the Deputy's question. I do not believe that there is any attempt to change the status of the school, but if the Deputy wishes to send me something under separate cover I will have it checked out.
#MaureenOSullivan	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-party	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-dob	unknown-#MaureenOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	54	I will certainly get back to the principal. I encourage the Minister to do that. They were very happy with the design of the new school, which is taking the wider corridors, the two lifts and tactile surfaces into account. The reality is that the school was turned down for transport for children with an impairment of one sort or another. The Department only backtracked when it acknowledged that the parents had bought uniforms for those children and that they could get transport there. I will take the Minister up on his offer and ask the principal of the school to contact him directly because there are concerns that the Department was rowing back on the tradition of looking after children with a visual impairment and special needs and that the status the school has had up to now will not continue. As the Minister knows, that tradition has developed between ChildVision and the community school. We hope to see the community school back on its original campus beside ChildVision.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	55	I will arrange to have my officials contact the school on that matter. It is a school that was formerly within my constituency, but in the future it will be represented by Deputy O'Sullivan. We have a mutual interest in the excellent work that was done and continues to be done in that school. I will ensure that contact is made.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	56	My question concerns STEM subjects and the current and potential teacher shortages in those subjects. I know that the Minister has many ambitious plans around these subjects, but there is clearly an issue with the amount of teachers available to teach them. I would like to hear his thoughts on the matter.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	57	In the last two years I have provided for the recruitment of in the region of 3,000 teachers at post-primary level. All of those posts for 2016-17 have been successfully filled and the process of filling the additional posts for the current year is almost complete. We are successfully filling the posts that we are making available. As the Deputy knows, last week I launched a STEM policy statement and implementation plan which aims to make Ireland the best in Europe in STEM by 2026. This policy statement focusses on the many strengths in science, technology, engineering and mathematics education in Ireland while providing a roadmap to address the areas for development.  Some schools have reported shortages in recruiting teachers in specific subjects at post-primary level, including in STEM. The reasons for this are complex. Part of the reason is due to an imbalance in the availability of teachers in certain subjects; for example, a large proportion of teachers training as geography teachers and a small proportion choosing to train in subjects such as physics.  As part of the implementation of the STEM strategy I am determined to deliver increased teacher supply in key priority areas. My officials are gathering and analysing baseline data. We are also assessing specific policy initiatives which can accelerate supply in critical areas. This would include measures to deliver a higher proportion of those entering initial teacher education at undergraduate or masters level in the priority areas, to upgrade the skills of existing teachers and to identify possible sources of qualified persons who are not now teaching.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	58	I want to make a suggestion on the matter. I welcome some of the suggestions, especially of increasing the number of female students taking STEM for the leaving certificate by 40%. However, we need to start at post-primary level, because nobody is going to teach chemistry, physics or the other subjects if they have not studied those subjects at secondary school level. We need to incentivise those subjects so that people are studying at secondary school level and will progress into college and postgraduate level. That is an area where we need to go back to the drawing board and incentivise those subjects at that stage, because there is clearly a general issue of accessing teachers, particularly teachers who are qualified for the subject they end up teaching. It will become a crisis in the STEM subjects and while the plan is ambitious I fear that it will remain only a plan because it will be impossible to achieve if we do not increase the amount of teachers available to teach STEM subjects. Another area we should look at is pay for new entrants to teaching. I am sure that many new entrants are discouraged at the moment, given the level of pay available. I encourage the Minister to look at it at post-primary level and see if we can start to encourage people to take on the subjects at that stage. If one has not had a grounding in particular subjects, by the time a person gets to college it is too late.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	59	I do not disagree with anything the Deputy says. We have set an ambition to increase the uptake at leaving certificate level. I believe that the new way of teaching science at junior cycle will encourage more people into it. Our promotion of extra-curricular science, through supporting the expansion of SciFest, the BT Young Scientist exhibition awards and CoderDojo has had a proven impact, particularly on girls choosing science subjects. There is clearly a need to have a very focused look at supply in areas such as physics and chemistry where we need people who graduate in these subjects to move into the teaching profession. I will be taking a hard look at how we can incentivise that move to make sure that our ambitions are not held up by needs of that nature. There is a tightness of supply in other subjects as well, as we have discussed at committee. A range of methods have been used in the past that have been successful. We will review the subjects in total to make sure that we have a suite of measures that will have an impact on this.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	60	I welcome that response. I have another suggestion which applies to the entirety of our education system and that concerns the whole idea of continuous assessment. Perhaps we can encourage students into these subjects by seeking to introduce a continuous assessment model. The subjects are quite difficult and are perhaps a bit more intimidating than other subjects. The idea of taking on chemistry or physics is not always a student's first choice. We need to be more creative in general when it comes to our education system and if there is such a big shortage in these STEM subject areas we should look at continuous assessment as part of the grading process in those subjects. This might encourage more students to take on those subjects.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	61	The Deputy has another question later on. The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA, is looking at this matter. I agree that it is hard to teach science on the basis of a memory retention exam at the end. It is very much suited to continuous assessment. There are issues around continuous assessment, with teachers' unions and teachers themselves concerned with judging their own students. That has resulted in the framework that we now have in the junior cycle where there is separate portfolio of achievement and SEC supervised exams. I hope that model will have a very good impact on the junior cycle. Science in particular does lend itself to a different approach. Hopefully some consensus will emerge which will lead to different formats of assessment in the future. We will await the NCCA's report.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	62	To continue on the question of Clonkeen College, I find the Minister's hands-off approach on this matter somewhat difficult to understand. I remind him that the Christian Brothers is selling Clonkeen's lands to pay redress for child abuse. I ask the Minister if he thinks that it is acceptable that the Christian Brothers discharges its debt for historic child abuse by taking pitches from current and future generations of children, compounding the crimes against young people. If the Minister believes it is wrong, is he seriously suggesting that there is nothing he can do?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	63	The position is, as I said in the previous reply, that a decision has been taken by the Congregation of Christian Brothers to dispose of land. That is a matter for the Christian Brothers. It has entered into an agreement to sell that land and that is a legally binding contract. I am not in a position to alter that. Separately the Christian Brothers has indicated that the proceeds of that sale will supplement the €21.2 million it has already paid to Caranua to date by the tune of some €8.8 million. Caranua, as Deputy Connolly said, is providing for a very vulnerable group of people. This means that we will have the full €110 million that was committed.However, that is an entirely separate process from the decision of the Christian Brothers to do what they have done in this case. As Deputy Boyd Barrett knows, they have made an arrangement with the Edmund Rice Schools Trust, ERST, which will continue to run the school, and they have made a decision to dispose of lands to which the school previously had access. That is the position, there is a legal challenge to that position and I, like the Deputy, will await the outcome of that legal challenge.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	64	The first point is that it is not about waiting, but doing. The Christian Brothers claim the contract is legally binding; the school disputes that. Second, whether it is legally binding or not, there are things the Minister could do. Has he told the Christian Brothers that what they are doing is wrong? Of course they should pay their debts, but this sale will raise €18 million, while their debt is only €8 million. How is that fair? They will make money out of the sale. Has the Minister told them it is wrong to steal the pitches of a school and the 500 pupils in that school? Furthermore, the Minister has not answered the question. Why can he not put a compulsory purchase order on the land or tell the Christian Brothers to bestow the land in lieu of the money and tell the Christian Brothers the sale is not acceptable? One could only get this in Ireland: the Minister for Education and Skills says the fate of a school and its pitches is nothing to do with him and that it is up to the Christian Brothers. That is bizarre. That this could be the case just shows what a dysfunctional education system we have. For the Minister to just stand by and say there is nothing he can do about the matter, that the Christian Brothers own the land and are going to sell it, is really shocking.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	66	We have developed our schools, as the Deputy knows, according to a patronage model whereby patrons provide the land and the Department builds the school, often with some support from the patron, often without. The Department has a lien on the property in which we invest and the patron has an obligation to ensure that the school continues to operate and to meet needs. However, the owner of the land, in this case the Christian Brothers, has a right under the Constitution to dispose of the land. The Christian Brothers have done so and have entered a binding contract-----
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	67	So they say.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	68	-----and that has been conveyed to us. The question the Deputy raises, whether this issue can be challenged in the courts, will be adjudicated on in the courts. In meeting their responsibilities to Caranua, the position is that the Christian Brothers have an obligation and they are meeting that obligation. That is a separate responsibility. We expect more from the Christian Brothers, as from other religious institutions. The State has said repeatedly that we believe a fair share of the €1.5 billion paid to date would be 50:50. We are a long way short of that and the State continues to pursue that but we do not have a legal lever over the Christian Brothers or any other congregation. As the Deputy knows, when the Ryan report was published, the Christian Brothers entered a voluntary agreement to pay sums, not all of which has yet been fulfilled. Unfortunately, in 2002 an agreement was made that indemnified the religious orders and limited the amount they were to pay. That is the legal position and we are working within its parameters. However, like I think most Members of the House, I believe the religious congregations should be paying more in this situation to meet the legacy issues that are so real for so many people.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	69	God almighty, if ever there were an argument for separation of church and State, we really have it here. That the Christian Brothers can do this to school students to pay a debt for the crimes they committed against previous generations of school students and the Minister says there is nothing he can do is pathetic. The Minister has not answered the question why he could not put a compulsory purchase order on the land. He should request the local authority to do so in order to secure the land. As I said to the Minister, of course the Christian Brothers should pay their debts for historic child abuse, and the school understands that, but they do not need to sell €18 million worth of land in order to pay an €8 million debt they owe in their "voluntary pledge" over historic child abuse. They have vast amounts of land and assets all over the country, so why is it acceptable for them to flog off this land for €18 million to a private developer and rob this school of all its pitches and why do we just stand by while they do so and say there is nothing we can do? They do not need to sell that much land to pay their debt to the redress scheme.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	70	The position is that the Christian Brothers have the same constitutional rights and are protected in the same way as any other group. They have a right to dispose of their land in the way in which they have done so and there is not an opportunity to alter that. The route of compulsory purchase order, CPO, as the Deputy knows, can only be taken in certain circumstances and still involves 100% compensation of those involved for any loss they would incur, so that is not a case of "with one leap our hero is free". The reality is that the Christian Brothers have made a decision to dispose of this land for the enormous sum the Deputy mentioned and it is their legal right to do so. They have a binding legal contract and that is being challenged in the courts and we await the outcome of that challenge.

I would like to see the scheme back in the education portfolio, and I think many people would agree because it is much more suited to that area. Can this be examined?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	72	The school completion programme is an integral part of Tusla's educational welfare service. While it is a key support for schools under the DEIS programme, my Department does not have responsibility for the programme. As the Deputy will appreciate, proposals for the reassignment of ministerial and administrative policy areas are a collective function of the Government. There is no current proposal to reassign ministerial responsibility for this brief. In 2011, following a decision of the Government, a suite of educational welfare functions, including the school completion programme, transferred to the remit of the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs and later, in 2014, on the enactment of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, transferred to Tusla, the Child and Family Agency. Because of the key role played by the school completion programme in DEIS, my Department has maintained a close working relationship with both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and Tusla regarding the latter's work programme to support schools. Both the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, DCYA, and Tusla were closely involved in the review of DEIS and the DEIS plan of 2017, published earlier this year, which contains a number of key actions for delivery on an inter-agency basis by Tusla's educational welfare service in collaboration with my Department, including specific actions relating to the school completion programme. In 2015 the then Minister for Children and Youth Affairs commissioned the ESRI to conduct a review of the school completion programme and it is my understanding that Tusla is in the process of implementing the recommendations of that review. I should add that Tusla sits with us on an implementation group on DEIS, so it is represented and there is close collaboration between the two Departments and agencies.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	73	I raise this matter because, as I said earlier, I am a huge advocate for the school completion programme. It is excellent. The general public probably does not know enough about it and all the good work it does because it is under the radar. That is what makes it so successful. While it is predominantly in DEIS schools, one does not have to be in a DEIS school to qualify for the school completion programme. A number of schools a number of years ago applied for the school completion programme and were successful and they take in children who would otherwise fall through the cracks and who would not necessarily qualify for other services, for example Tusla services. That is what is so vital about the programme falling back within the remit of the Department of Education and Skills. I understand it is not a decision for the Minister to make alone and perhaps this is a little unfair, but I would like to know his own opinion on this. Tusla is not the appropriate body for the programme because, while Tusla does good work in other areas, the key for school completion is to be tied in with the education system. The programme is focused on education, keeping kids in school and identifying why children might not complete school. While Tusla might have a role in that, many children will not get to the stage at which they come to the attention of Tusla but they might come to the attention of the school completion programme. They might have very minor difficulties or what we would see as minor difficulties for our children but what are major difficulties in their lives. The school completion programme can often intervene in many different scenarios and be very helpful. Since the move has been made, the co-ordinators have been falling through the cracks and they do not necessarily have a forum or a body to feed into through the Department any more.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	74	I am not a direct party to it but a lot of work has been done on the school completion programme. The ESRI carried out a review, as did another body. They came up with recommendations to improve it. They in no way diluted the objective or tried to roll back on what the role and purpose of the school completion programme was. We have to acknowledge that we have had a huge surge in school completion with much improved school completion numbers. They have halved over the past decade and there are fewer people dropping out so this is working. The Deputy is right. When they are in separate Departments, we must make sure there is co-ordination but I am satisfied that this is there. Noel Kelly has taken over the school completion programme. He is now working to implement improved governance, an improved standard of delivery and all those good things that will ensure that children get an excellent service.

That would have been a better model to look at rather than moving it to the Department of Children and Youth Affairs. What are the Minister's views on that? Is he aware of that proposal? What does he think of it?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	76	Ultimately, the Department responsible will have to look at what is the best governance structure. It might be better if the Deputy put a question to the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs. It will want to put in place the best structure to ensure the best delivery of service. We will support it in its choice but it will make a choice based on a matrix of criteria which I have not seen so I am not in a position to say who would be best placed.

It was not available on the website. The Minister is correct with regard to that. Question No. 39 is a specific question about Galway University Foundation. The matter arose earlier this year at the Committee of Public Accounts. An outstanding sum of €17.5 million was due about which I would like clarity. Has this money been paid over? It was due from the foundation to the university since 2011. 
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	78	My Department allocates recurrent funding to the Higher Education Authority, HEA, for direct disbursement to the HEA-designated higher education institutions, including the universities. The HEA allocates this funding to the institutions. The internal disbursement of that funding is then a matter for the individual institution. Universities are autonomous bodies as set out in the Universities Act 1997 and are responsible for their own day-to-day affairs, including the allocation of all of its income, both public and private, and with regard to their own financial affairs. Officials of my Department have sought details regarding the issue referred to by the Deputy. Based on information provided by NUIG, I can confirm the figure of €17.48 million related to funding due from the foundation to the university at 30 September 2014 regarding capital projects in 2011. This represents philanthropic donations as contributions to the development of the engineering building and extensions to the arts-science building at NUIG. To date, €15.56 million of this has been repaid to NUIG by the foundation. The current balance outstanding is €1.92 million, which is scheduled for payment on 31 December 2017. 
#CatherineConnolly	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-party	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-dob	unknown-#CatherineConnolly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	79	I thank the Minister of State for that clarification. I welcome the fact that €15.56 million has been paid over and that there is a date for the payment of the remaining €1.92 million. This has been outstanding since 2011. I am fully aware that the universities are independent. I am a very proud Galwegian and went to college in Galway. However, in respect of the foundation, the reason I raised this issue is because it was highlighted by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report in April 2017. He pointed out that it went back to 2011. That foundation has a board composed of members in Galway and the US. If one looks at the board and foundation members, one can see that one will take an interest because of the nature of members of that board, including Goldman Sachs, Coca-Cola and Morgan Stanley. One can see where the foundation is pushing education, which is the bigger issue. The specific issue for today is that most of the money has been paid over. My supplementary question concerns the reason for this delay. Why did it take from 2011 to 2017 - six years - for this money to be paid over?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	80	I have confirmed that the sum of €15.56 million has been repaid and the outstanding sum of €1.92 million will be paid on 31 December 2017. Philanthropic funding is an important resource in helping to widen the funding base for third-level education. The accounts of Galway University Foundation Limited for the end of June 2016 were attached to the 2016 accounts of NUIG. These accounts were received in the Department on 19 October last.

That is the specific issue. When was it paid over? Does the Minister of State have the date when the €15.56 million was paid over? While I welcome philanthropic aid, there must be openness and accountability with regard to it. I have always had serious concerns about openness and accountability, and not just with this foundation. The matter has come up repeatedly with other third-level institutions. The accounts generally of foundations and third-level institutions have never been consolidated. The reason for this in Galway is because it says it does not have control over it. However, the president of the university sits on the foundation, as do other serious members. There are issues here for us later on. When was the money paid over?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	82	I do not have that specific date with me. The Department supports the proposals that emerged during the discussions at meetings of the Committee of Public Accounts earlier this year, which are that the latest available audited accounts for trusts and foundations should be made available with the main financial statements laid before the Oireachtas. The HEA wrote to all institutions in June and July 2017 requiring this approach. I can confirm that NUIG has complied with this request in the 2016 accounts, which have been received in the Department. The HEA will continue to work with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General and the universities to ensure best practice in this regard is maintained with a view of ensuring transparency and accountability in respect of foundation activities.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	83	The planned amalgamation of Waterford Institute of Technology and Institute of Technology Carlow into a technological university of the south east has been slowly plodding and going nowhere for two or three decades. I am sure the Minister of State might want to tell me about the progression of the Technological Universities Bill but the truth is that even a technological university will do little to address educational deficits faced by people in Wexford. Earlier this week, we learned that the proposed acquisition of land for a new Institute of Technology Carlow campus in Wexford has fallen through. Can the Minister explain what happened to this land deal given that the HEA paid a deposit 12 months ago?
#MaryMitchellOConnor	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-party	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-dob	unknown-#MaryMitchellOConnor-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	84	The Technological University of the South East, TUSE, consortium has received total funding of some €0.57 million to date.Last month a further €0.15 million was allocated to the consortium. Specific activities being progressed currently include a review of human resources processes, etc. The Deputy is aware that the Institute of Technology Carlow has a campus based in Wexford town, which offers an extensive range of award qualifications from level 6 through to postgraduate level 9 on the National Framework of Qualifications. It is important to note that the number of students enrolled at the Wexford campus in 2016 was 766. This figure should not be dismissed in any way. In addition to programmes run by Waterford IT and Carlow IT, learners can access online programmes provided by other institutions. The Department has been very supportive of the proposed acquisition by IT Carlow of a particular site in Wexford for the development of a new purpose-built campus. Funding has been allocated to enable IT Carlow to acquire this site. The Department has now been informed, however, of a decision by the vendor to withdraw from the sale of that site. The Department is assessing the situation and will work with IT Carlow on how best to progress its development needs in Wexford. 
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	85	I believe this land was with my good friends in NAMA. A price was agreed and a deposit was paid. A deal was done but somewhere along the route the loans got shifted to a vulture fund. NAMA literally sold the land to a vulture fund, despite a deal having been done with the Higher Education Authority, HEA. How can the Government allow this to happen? It is madness. Carlow IT has gone on the record to say that since the official confirmation of the cancellation of the sale, it has been formally approached through intermediaries for almost double the agreed price for the site. A deal was done with NAMA but then NAMA said it would sell to a vulture fund and ignored the HEA. The new buyers now want double the price for the land. The Minister of State spoke about the campus in Wexford with 766 students in 2016. It is better than nothing. This is why we were eager for an extension to the campus. How can the Government allow NAMA to sell this land to a vulture fund, which is now looking for double the price? It is only recently-----

I acknowledge the frustration but, as the Deputy is aware from his background, if the deal was not signed then there was no deal. The vendor, unfortunately, has pulled out. That is where it is currently at. There is a commitment of an investment of €47.9 million, which would have 19,206 planned beneficiaries, for the Waterford and Wexford education and training boards. It is disappointing. We have put that money into further education and into the ETBs. We are committed to a campus in Wexford. We know how important it is for the area and we know how important it is to attract companies and foreign direct investment and for our own indigenous companies to have confidence to ensure they have the staff and skills available. It is disappointing, but as I have said, the Department is assessing the situation and we will work with IT Carlow on how best to progress from now.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	88	This is ten years in the making. Is there a back-up plan? The HSE recently sold a huge tract of land in Enniscorthy at the old St. Senan's Hospital. I believe it is more than 40 acres. They sold it to a private developer for peanuts. Why did the State not look at that? Will the Minister of State find out for me if the HSE deal was done with NAMA or was it done with the vulture fund? Who gazumped them? Was it NAMA or was it a vulture fund? They paid a deposit. The second contract was not signed, but a deal was done. Were they gazumped by NAMA or a vulture fund? I remind the Minister of State that the numbers of students from Wexford who go to third level education is falling and is getting worse. The area is the second worst county in Ireland in educational performance. It is a black spot. Some weeks ago the Central Statistics Office released figures that show Wexford and Longford - areas of huge disadvantage - at the bottom of the table. Just 32% of second level students go on to third level, which is a long way behind the national average of 42%. The Minister of State is aware that in her own constituency the figure is about 61%. Something has to be done.

With regard to the Wexford campus I am disappointed also, but I know the importance of making sure that we have higher education institutions in the regions. This is why I am pushing the Technological Universities Bill. We are supporting IT Carlow to assess the situation in Wexford. I am aware that there are 766 students currently enrolled at the Wexford campus. We value education. Deputy Wallace does not need to convince me about the importance of education - I know exactly how important it is. We want all students right across the State, in every region and every county, to get the very best from education.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	91	A review of senior cycle programmes and vocational pathways is a key action in my Department’s Action Plan for Education 2016-19. This review has been commenced by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, NCCA with a view to recommending areas for development. The senior cycle review will consider all assessment approaches. Specifically, it will consider if the range of assessment approaches is most appropriate to meet the purposes of senior cycle education and the wide range of needs of students at senior cycle. In this context, assessment approaches adopted must be diverse and fit-for-purpose. All specifications for leaving certificate subjects and courses developed in recent years identify the development of students who are confident, engaged, resourceful and active learners as a priority. All specifications identify five key skills: information processing; communicating; being personally effective; working with others; and critical and creative thinking. These key skills are embedded in the learning outcomes of each subject and in the learning activity that are used to realise those outcomes. In recent years there has been a strong convergence in the views of business and educationalists as to the skills that are most important for young people at this time, with both sectors agreeing that generic skills of the kind above should be prioritised. I am committed to student well-being and life skills, and my Department will shortly publish a policy statement on well-being.  This policy statement will set out key elements and actions considered necessary to achieve an improved well-being experience in schools.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	92	I have raised this issue because I believe that the current system is very unfair and inequitable. It is designed to be one size fits all. This is not the reality in the context of learning and education. Many Deputies will remember with dread the leaving certificate exam and the whole process around it. If we are considering reform of the leaving certificate programme we have an opportunity to make it real and meaningful. Continuous assessment is a common sense and practical aspect that could be introduced, alongside a life skills class with lessons in basic nutrition and mental health. These are basic skills that many people leave school not knowing how to do. It would be invaluable for students. I wish to emphasise the whole area of continuous assessment. It is so unfair at the moment. A person studies for six years in second level school and then everything is based on a two week exam. If a student is having some difficulty or panics during exams, or if a student is sick for those two weeks, it can affect everything and there is no opportunity to repeat the leaving certificate later that summer. The student must wait a whole year and then go back though the whole system again. It is currently not fit for purpose and if we are talking about reform then we should make it real and meaningful.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23642	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	93	I believe the Deputy will agree that the roll-out of the junior cycle has been significant nick in the post in that we now ask students to put together a portfolio of achievement and do their exam. This process is not yet embedded at junior cycle. We are only two thirds of the way through and there are still subjects to come on board next year.The NCCA is looking at the senior cycle in the context and its clear assessment is a core issue. Of course, one must balance, and they will have to consult. A lot of people have faith in the objectivity and fairness of the leaving certificate but as the Deputy correctly states, it does not suit everyone. We must value a wider range of experiences in school. Hopefully, we are on a journey that will see the sort of vision that the Deputy has develop over time.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	95	I do not know whether the Taoiseach saw the "Prime Time" special programme last evening which revealed the appalling and heart-rending situation facing many carers across this country. If the Taoiseach did not watch it, and he may not have had the time, I would recommend that he watch it fairly quickly because it revealed the appalling lack of sufficient State resources to carers. That lack of resources was laid bare, as was the enormity of the challenges that they face and the scale of the crisis. The disability sector is in crisis. Last night's focus was very much on the lack of any horizons, of any plans and of any clear pathways, in particular, for parents with adult children with intellectual disability. We thank all of those who contributed to the programme and who gave us their stories. There was Jack Brennan, who is nearly 85 years of age, caring for his wife Bernie, who has Alzheimer's disease, at home. Since the programme, Jack had a stroke and his beloved wife, Bernie, is in a home. She got two and a half hours a day in home care and home help. Jacinta Walsh from Drogheda, aged 51, is caring for her 18 year old son, Sam, with autism. There is no respite care in the entirety of County Louth for adult children with autism or with intellectual disability. Teresa Kinsella's was one of the most heart-rending of all presentations. Diagnosed with early stage Alzheimer's disease, she is looking after her daughter, Fiona, not knowing what lies in store. There was Mary McDonnell from Cork whom many of us would be aware of in terms of her life-long care for her beautiful daughter, Sinéad. Since the programme, her daughter passed away. For many of these parents, the appalling vista visits them every day that they do not know who they wish would die first. That was said last night on the programme, in many ways revealing the appalling dilemma, plight and lack of any certainty in their lives. The lack of respite care is shocking. We all encounter this across the country. Only last week in my clinic, a gentleman came in to make representations because he is currently looking after three older siblings in their 60s with intellectual disability. When I contact the service provider, I am told that the family situation is indicative of the growing crisis in the disability sector. I could detail many more cases where there is real risk of tragedy occurring because of the lack of supports being provided. Such safety concerns were reiterated last evening, as was the real sense that there is no grasp of the reality at Government or HSE level that families across the country are in crisis.

From what I have heard, and the briefing note that I have been given, I am familiar with two of the five families that were featured, one being a constituent who we have been trying to assist through my constituency clinic for a number of years without success to date and the other being a person I met when I opened a special school in County Louth only a few weeks ago. The experience of the five families that were featured on "Prime Time" last night is not unique. It is an experience shared by hundreds, if not thousands, of families around the country. We are all familiar with carers and their families and the enormous challenges that they face. Everyone in this Government is full of concern and respect for the enormous and important work that family carers do and but for luck or the grace of God, we could find ourselves in the same position with a loved one, a brother, a sister, a child or maybe a parent who needs care. That is why we as a society need to support family carers much more than we currently do. It is important to acknowledge some of the significant actions that have taken place since this Government, involving Fine Gael, Independents and the Independent Alliance, took office. We have fully restored the carer support grant, which is very important. It allows carers themselves to take a break or in some cases, purchase respite care. We have increased the Christmas bonus. As Minister for Health, I brought in the 12-week rule, which means that if the person the carer is caring for dies or if he or she goes into long-term care, the carer continues to receive the carer's allowance for 12 weeks so that the carer can get his or her own affairs in order. Deputy Micheál Martin will recall that when he was last in Government the carer's allowance and carer's benefit were cut by €16.50 a week. We have restored the first €5 of that, we will restore the next €5 of it in March and we will restore it fully in the term of this Government. In terms of what is provide, there are 10.5 million home-help hours provided, 16,750 home-care packages and 190 intensive home-care packages. Roughly 161,000 respite nights are provided every year. Some 2,000 people receive holiday respite so that their family carer can take some time off. There are 42,000 respite days provided. Some 128 new residential placements will happen this year for those who do not have them currently and 75 people will receive in-home respite where somebody comes into their home and provides respite in the home thus allowing the carer to take a break or take a holiday. The budget for disability services, as Deputy Micheál Martin will be aware, has increased dramatically in the past number of years, from €1.4 million in 2014 to €1.76 million now. That does not even include the budget for education, which is similar, and income supports through social welfare. For the first time, we have a Minister at the Cabinet table who reminds us about disability all the time.I absolutely acknowledge that much more needs to be done, particularly in four areas, the areas on which the Government will focus in the months and years ahead. The first is respite care, an area in which there is a desperate shortage. I know of the needs of families and respite care provision keeps them going. It is the hope on the horizon. The fact that they might be able to take a week or an evening off and get a break is what keeps people going. Respite care provision is an area in which we need to do much more. The second area in which more needs to be done is the provision of residential places, of which there are not enough. We are trying to decongregate people from institutions, but at the same time we have people in their homes who need placements. We also need to do more in that space. Personalised budgeting is very important, a matter about which I will speak more later.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	114	I think it was Johanna Powell, one of the carers on the programme shown last evening, who said she did not want politicians to say anymore that they were full of respect, concern and admiration for her. She wants people to get angry and action. She does not want to hear more statistics and announcements that bear no relationship with reality. It is not that there are not sufficient respite care services; there are no respite care services. That came across clearly last evening and we all know it. We cannot get a respite care service for people who are in dire situations. I am not talking about those who need routine respite care - I hate using that phrase - but about emergency cases. Every case I have itemised is an emergency case. The service providers are now only dealing with emergency cases. The absence of respite care services is a shocking indictment of us all. As I said, there are almost 5,000 people with intellectual disabilities who will require new residential, day and respite care services in the period from 2018 to 2021. A further 10,500 people who are availing of existing services will require different services in that period. It is estimated that up to €200 million in additional funding will be required, but the Minister for Health only received €75 million in additional funding. That covers Lansdowne Road agreement and service developments in the previous year and leaves very little for new, additional services. If the Government does not acknowledge that there is a crisis, it makes the challenge of dealing with it all the more difficult. I put it to the Taoiseach that it is about priorities. I acknowledge that we cannot do everything for everybody, but perhaps we should think again before we start saying we can give hundreds of millions of euro in tax relief to high income earners as opposed to looking after those who need us to look after them. Instead of leading on the former as a budgetary strategy for next year, how about leading on proper investment in public services of this kind? In the last two months I have identified quite a lot of services which are woefully lacking. No family should have to go through the distress they have gone and are going through and the programme last night was only an example of the crises families are going through.

The Government is absolutely committed to doing this. The next budget will prioritise services and investment in infrastructure over tax cuts, as the last one did and the one before it. It is very much the position of the Government that for every euro we give back to working people in tax reductions, two or three will be spent in the provision of better services and making improvements to infrastructure. I absolutely acknowledge that even though there are 160,000 respite care nights, 2,000 holiday respite care placements and 42,000 respite care days provided every year, it is far short of what is required. As a Government, we are determined, in working with the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to increase the availability of respite care in the months and years ahead to give families what they need, which is hope on the horizon and the possibility of being able to carry on. Respite care is a lifeline for them which makes it possible.
#PatTheCopeGallagher	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-party	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-dob	unknown-#PatTheCopeGallagher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	125	Before we proceed to the next question, on my own behalf and that of the Members of Dáil Éireann, I offer a céad míle fáilte and a most sincere welcome to Dr. Milan Brglez, President of the Slovenian National Assembly, who is joined by his fellow MPs, Aja Bah Žibert and Branko Zorman, with the Slovenian ambassador to Ireland. They are most welcome to Ireland and I hope they will have a very fruitful stay.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	126	I also want to refer to last night's "Prime Time" harrowing programme which focused on family members who were providing care for their loved ones. It highlighted the fact that the Government was failing in a very profound way those in need of care. It also painted a stark picture of the incredible stress and distress experienced by many families who were struggling to provide care with little or no support from the State. Today one in 20 people is a family carer, but that figure is set to rise to one in five by 2030. According to Family Carers Ireland, carers provide €10 billion in unpaid care each year. Census data show that there are 3,800 young carers under the age of 15 years and 29,000 over the age of 65. The human cost of the State's failure was evident for all to see and those of us who run constituency clinics see it every single day.  I have been raising with the Taoiseach for some time the case of Sam O'Carroll from County Louth. He is autistic and incontinent at night. He bangs his head, has broken his bed three times and can hurt himself. He had been receiving respite care from the age of 13 years, but lost this service on turning 18. Speaking about the loss of this service, Sam's mother said, "I can’t tell you the difference it makes having respite. If you know you are getting a break in two or three weeks time, you can carry on in between but if there is no break on the horizon ... That’s where we are now – there is nothing – that’s really really hard.” Sam has taken to having violent episodes and recently seriously assaulted his mother. A social care worker has stated he is a risk to his mother and that appropriate funding should be provided to ensure he receivess safe, secure levels of care, but that has not happened.  Brendan is 13 years old and has a diagnosis of cerebral palsy, which condition is life-limiting. He has profound and significant medical needs and is bedridden with bed sores. His mother has not had a break for weeks. I spoke to her on Saturday or Sunday last. Brendan has not received respite care for months.  The Taoiseach has a duty to ensure these citizens and their families will receive the necessary supports and services. I have a proposal for his consideration. A 20% increase in the number of respite care hours would cost €13 million and meet the expected demand. The provision of 2 million additional home help hours and 2,500 extra home care packages would cost €72 million. These are very modest proposals, but they would make a huge difference to the lives of these citizens. I, therefore, ask the Taoiseach to take and implement them as a matter of urgency. I ask him to make this a republic of opportunity for these citizens. Will he do what I ask?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	127	As I acknowledged in my earlier contribution, I understand, as does everyone on this side of the House, the value and importance of respite care. It is hope on the horizon; it gives family carers the hope they need to continue doing what they are doing, knowing that they will get an evening or a weekend off. It is also very important for other members of the family. Often if there is one person in a family who needs care and attention, other children do not receive the attention they deserve. The fact that respite care is provided allows parents to give other members of the family the attention they need.I can guarantee the Deputy there is no lack of understanding from this Government or on this side of the House of the value of respite and the need to make it more available. In terms of the specific proposals made by the president of Sinn Féin, we are certainly happy to consider them in the context of the HSE service plan for 2018. As I have mentioned before, the budget for disability services, out of which respite is funded, has increased dramatically in recent years, from €1.4 billion in 2014 up to €1.59 billion the year after that, then to €1.558 billion after that, and it will rise to €1.763 billion next year. Therefore, there is a very significant increase in the budget for these services, and I understand there is a €75 million increase in the budget for next year. Exactly how that will be broken down in terms of additional home care packages, additional home help hours and additional respite provision has to be determined but we will certainly take into account any considered proposals that people have.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	128	I expect the Taoiseach to come back to me on that, in his own time. Some 643,000 citizens are recorded as having a disability. Budget 2018 had no commitment to increase personal assistant hours or respite care services, despite the increased need for support. In fact, overnight hours of respite care for children with disabilities have dropped from 44,000 overnight hours to 40,000. Therefore, the Government is providing less despite the fact there are more requests for overnight respite care than ever before. There is no real, fit-for-purpose way of getting these necessary and proper services for citizens with disabilities. It is chaotic and disorganised and is left to the endeavours of individual families. Parents have to become activists, campaigners and advocates on top of everything else. Sam and Brendan are citizens. Sam and Brendan have rights and it is our duty to uphold their rights. Their families have rights and it is our duty to uphold their rights also, but we are not doing it. Results count. I made a very modest proposal to the Taoiseach and he said he is going to come back to me. I will be back to ask him for a positive answer to that in the time ahead.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	129	I will absolutely consider the proposal the Deputy has made. It has to be done in the context of the budget and the HSE service plan, and we will have to see whether his costings are correct because proposals that do not stand up and costings that are not correct do not merit much consideration. We will certainly examine what is being proposed. In terms of what was announced in the budget, as the Deputy mentioned it, the budget provides an extra €75 million for disability services next year. A reduction in the prescription charge of 50 cent for everyone under 65 kicks in in a few weeks' time. An additional 1,000 special needs assistants will ensure that people with disabilities get the educational opportunities they deserve and there will be 100 extra special education teachers. A €5 increase in disability allowance and a €5 increase in the carer's allowance are kicking in in March. We have secured additional funding for the decision support service, empowering people with disabilities to make their own decisions, so they do not have others making decisions for them. There will also be an extra €5 million for housing adaptation grants because, if people are going to stay in their own homes. Very often those homes need to be adapted to enable them to do so, and there was an announcement on that recently. In addition, in the next few weeks the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will make an announcement on personalised budgeting and the progress we are making on that, giving more families the power to decide how the money is spent on their own care. Issues such as the number of home help hours, home care packages and personal assistant hours are all matters for the HSE service plan, which is yet to be finalised.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	130	The Council of the European Union press release on PESCO has a promotional video that opens with the line, "In a troubled world, citizens want the EU to offer them more protection", followed by images of fighter jets, drones, Apache helicopters, armed troops running off military transport helicopters, aircraft carriers and warships, all to the tune of the kind of aspirational and emotive modern classical one would get on an advertisement for a new Mercedes car. Apart from that, there is no detail as to what exactly it will mean for those who sign up, especially in terms of actual warfare. The only thing that is obvious is that the arms industry is about to make even more money because, for some vague reason, we all need to be stocking up on guns and locking up our borders. What is this vague threat? Why does the EU need all these warships, fighter jets and aircraft carriers? The EU was set up with the aim of ending the frequent and bloody wars between neighbours which culminated in the Second World War, or so it says on the European Union website. Now, it seems that if one wants to stay on the right side of the EU, one must sign up to enrich its arms producers. The German Defence Minister, Ms Von der Leyen, the main driver behind PESCO along with the French, said in 2014, "I believe that joint armed forces would be a logical consequence of an increasingly close military co-operation in Europe". After PESCO was set up in November, she said this was, "another step in the direction of the army of Europeans". We seem to be the only country that is in denial and refusing to acknowledge that an EU army is being created. We are struggling to pay members of the Defence Forces a proper wage and some 335 Army personnel left voluntarily in 2017 alone, yet we are now going to join PESCO, which states that members must commit to year-on-year real increases in defence spending and investment. The speed at which the Council of the European Union has made this turn towards beefing up EU defence capabilities is frightening. In the space of seven months we have gone from arguing about €90 million of EU money being spent on defence research over a period of three years to the European Commission in June proposing the mobilisation of €40 billion by 2027 for research and development of weapons and military hardware through the European Defence Fund. Our neutral status is already on a shaky footing. The lack of warning, debate and detail around joining this new military group, when we can join any time in the future, give us good grounds for fearing that this could be the final nail in the last notions of Irish neutrality. This matter is going to committee today and will be debated and voted on tomorrow. I did not hear one radio station mention it this morning and the public does not even know this is happening. There should be a proper debate in the public realm as well. Given that should take some time, I do not believe there should be a vote before Christmas. It is unfair to do so, given the people are, generally, unaware it is even taking place.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	131	I have a clear view on this matter. My view is that a Europe that is worth building is a Europe that is worth defending. For a very long time, all of Europe has relied on the United States to provide for its defence. There are real threats to European security and, over time, rather than relying on the United States to defend Europe and pay for European defence, Europe should provide and pay for its own defence and not be dependent on the United States in the way it has been since 1945. That is what PESCO and European security and defence co-operation are all about. It is Europe starting to take responsibility for and control over its own defence, not relying on the United States in the way it has done until now. In Ireland, however, we have a particular, different view. We have a long-standing tradition of non-alignment and neutrality, one that I and this Government will defend because we believe our non-alignment and neutrality makes us stronger and gives us more influence around the world. PESCO, for us, is going to be something different than it perhaps is for other countries. The reason we want to join PESCO is precisely because it is not what the Deputy says it is for us, because we are going to join it on an opt-in, opt-out basis. We will only opt in to certain programmes and certain parts of PESCO that we want to be involved in, for example, counter-terrorism, given all European countries need to work together to defeat terrorism. Cyber-security and peacekeeping are further examples of areas we are going to opt into. I can assure the Deputy we are not going to be buying aircraft carriers, we are not going to be buying fighter jets and we are not going to be shopping around military trade fairs for any of these things, as that is not in our interest. Defence spending will rise. We have already committed to an increase in defence spending that has been set out in the White Paper since long before PESCO. That increase in defence spending will go into bringing our Defence Forces up to the level we want them to be at, that is, between 9,000 and 10,000. It will go into pay increases, which have already started but which will kick in across January and through to October of next year. It will go into new equipment because we need new equipment for our Defence Forces.Yes, we are going to increase defence spending, but we are going to increase it moderately and we are going to increase it so that our Defence Forces can carry out the job that we want them to do. When it comes to PESCO, we are proposing to join on an opt-in, opt-out basis, only opting into the particular operations and programmes that we want to be a part of. In doing so, we are joining three other neutral countries that have already decided to join - Sweden, Austria and Finland, countries with long-standing traditions of neutrality and of not being members of NATO and that have already made the decision to join. I think we should, too.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	132	If the Taoiseach is so hawkish and so confident that this is good for us, I do not understand why he is not prepared to allow for a more public debate on it outside the House. Did the Lisbon and Nice treaties teach the State about allowing people to think too much about these issues? For a number of years, we have witnessed the increased militarisation of Europe. The Taoiseach can say that what is happening now does not affect our neutrality, but there are few neutral observers who would share that view. The Taoiseach says that we have relied for too long on the US to defend us. We are a small island. We have no intention of attacking anyone and no one will attack us. Why do we need the American military to defend us? We do not need it. Neither do we need a European army or to be a part of one for this island to be protected. I will tell the Taoiseach how to keep peace - do not bother anyone else and do not go to war with others. We should also stop allowing Shannon to be used as a US military base and a stopover point for the US to cause destruction, which has created many problems in the past 16 years. Do we not accept the fact that, even though the world is a less safe place today because the amount of arms has increased, we are now going to sign up to arrangements that will make us a part of that?

It is part of our obligations as global citizens and I think it is the right thing to do in the interests of our country. We want to be involved in PESCO.

For other countries in Europe, PESCO is going to be something different. They are going to opt as a bloc, en masse, into everything because they want Europe to be able to defend itself. France is in a different place than us, for example. So is Germany. Even now 70 years after the Second World War, there are American troops in Germany as part of Europe's defence. Europe as a continent needs to move away from that. We should be able to defend ourselves and not rely on Americans to do so, but that is not why we are joining. We are joining coming from a particularly distinct Irish perspective, where we are a neutral non-aligned country joining on the same basis as Austria, Sweden and Finland, opting into programmes as we wish to do so. On this particular issue, and as we are mentioning the Defence Forces, it is worth informing the House that a Defence Forces exercise is taking place today in the Dublin area that will allow them to practice various operational and tactical procedures. Approximately 500 members of the Defence Forces, including the Army Ranger Wing, explosive ordnance disposal team and specialist search engineering team will be in Dublin today. In addition, the Air Corps and the Naval Service will provide support. The Defence Forces are working closely with the Garda in this exercise. The exercise will also help them to develop their procedures with An Garda Síochána and other emergency services and build their preparedness. The Defence Forces constantly prepare on an ongoing basis to support the civil authorities in the event of a national security incident. This exercise today is a part of our preparations for that.

I mention this because of the lessons that were learned. We got the market over the line by saying nothing in public, by building trust and by doing the work behind the scenes. Does the Taoiseach regret that we were not slightly quieter and that we did not say less on Monday? Did our commentary throughout the day aggravate the difficult circumstances that were playing out? What did the Taoiseach say to Ms Foster that day in Enniskillen or subsequently? Did he set out the broad approach that we were following with our European partners? The second lesson from the energy market process was that we got it over the line because we were committed to working east-west as well as North-South. Similarly, there is some agreement in the Brexit talks. I listened to Mr. David Davis, the UK's Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, saying something yesterday that every Member of the House of Commons in Westminster said, namely, that the UK was seeking a regulatory alignment that would apply to all of it. Yesterday, the Taoiseach articulated that that was the first default position. Some sort of trade deal that would avoid a border with friction, be it east-west or North-South, would be delivered, although the Lord knows how. The Taoiseach stated that, failing this, the second option would be a technological solution. We do not know what that would be, but we would be willing for the UK Government to propose ideas. That is a concession, given that there are no specifics. As I understand it, the key element of the text related to something that the Government was seeking and on which we received agreement, namely, if those two options failed, there would be a backstop guarantee to the effect that, in the absence of agreed solutions, the UK would ensure full alignment with the rules of the Single Market and customs union and protect the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. This morning in London, the British Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, Mr. Boris Johnson, stated that the Border issue could "only be discovered in the context" of the second phase of the negotiations and that we should grate on through. On Question Time, the Prime Minister of Britain is making a cast iron commitment that it will leave the customs union and Single Market. Is the Taoiseach's backline issue that, at the Council meeting on Thursday of next week, he will apply a veto to the talks progressing to the second phase if that backstop guarantee, which is not necessarily our desired solution or, as the Taoiseach stated yesterday, a nationalist grab, but is rather about trying to protect both communities on either side of the Border, is not given? Is that the key element that would stop the Taoiseach from allowing the talks going to phase two? Will the Taoiseach apply a veto or, if not, what is the way out of the impasse that has opened up before us?

He will appreciate that this is still an evolving situation and it would be unwise and undiplomatic of me to answer his question as fully as I might like to in this Chamber, given that many people are paying attention to what we say here, and not just in this country. Regarding last Monday, if the Deputy checks the record, he will see that I actually said nothing at all all day. I maintained a studied silence throughout Monday. The press conference, which I had arranged for 2.30 p.m. Irish time and choreographed for 3.30 p.m. Brussels time after the lunch was supposed to finish, was deferred precisely for that reason. I only spoke that evening after things had gone awry in Brussels. I was in Enniskillen for the entire day, as the Deputy knows, on 11 or 12 November attending the events there, visiting the local hospital, speaking at the Royal British Legion and also having a bilateral meeting with Ms Foster, where we discussed, of course, all of these matters and the future. It is important, though, to remind the House that this is a structured negotiation. We are not negotiating with a political party in the North, in Britain or anywhere else. This is a structured negotiation - on the one side the EU task force, led by Mr. Michel Barnier and into which we have a very strong input, and, on the other side, the UK Government. This is how this will be concluded. We are in a much stronger position being part of the European negotiating team and being represented by the task force as a Union of 27 countries and 440 million people negotiating with the UK than we would be in some sort of trilateral negotiation involving the Irish Government, the British Government and one of the parties in Northern Ireland. We are not going to do that. We are going to continue to negotiate as we have been up until now. It is important to bear one thing in mind. I would like to quote something said in the House of Commons yesterday by a British MP or, rather, an MP from Northern Ireland who is British, Lady Sylvia Hermon, who is a unionist MP from North Down.She stated:Although I readily accept that there are 10 duly elected DUP Members in this House, nevertheless the DUP does not speak for or represent all the people of Northern Ireland. Will the Secretary of State therefore take a few moments to explain to the House, and particularly all of the people of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom, the benefits to the whole country of the proposals the Prime Minister took to Brussels yesterday?We should remember that there are many voices in Northern Ireland. Even some unionist voices are very much behind the proposals taken to Brussels in recent days. We need to listen to all voices and parties in Northern Ireland, not just one.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	142	I accept that the Taoiseach cannot answer the latter part of my question. I accept the import of what he said about having to conduct business in private to a certain extent. In my first question I referred to our relationship with the North. I agree with the Taoiseach that it is vital for us to maintain good relationships with the unionist community in the North which we have built in the past 20 years, as difficult as that is on a day-to-day basis. I would love to see the Assembly return to help that process, but we also need to play our part. I agree that we do not want to get into a trilateral debate in the talks. However, at some point the Taoiseach will have to pick up the telephone to talk to Arlene Foster. Does he have plans to do so? In recent days she seemed to indicate that the DUP had been completely outside the loop for five weeks and did not know what the text or structure was. Surely in Enniskillen or at other meetings we have had on an ongoing basis during that five-week period we broadly outlined the strategy and the backstop guarantees for which we were looking, but that is history. The key question is where we do go from here to try to restore good relations North and South. Whenever the Brexiteers sail off to a future on the Cayman Islands, we will be left together on this island and have to try to work, co-operate and build trust and relationships together. How does the Taoiseach think we can do that?

I think it would be appropriate for all parties to see the text at the same time. Obviously, the European Commission, with our involvement, negotiates on one side, with the UK Government on the other. At the point at which texts are being shared with political parties, I do not see why the Green Party which operates North and South should not see the text at the same time as Sinn Féin, Fianna Fáil and the DUP. We should listen to all parties in Northern Ireland and not accept the idea which seems to be gaining prevalence in some parts of London and perhaps other places that there is only one party in Northern Ireland which speaks for everybody there. I intend to speak to the Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May, in the coming days. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands, Mr. Mark Rutte, is coming here today to meet me. There will, of course, be ongoing contacts at European level. As has been the case, the negotiations will happen between the Commission task force on the one side and the UK Government on the other. It is now the role of the United Kingdom to come back to us. I understand the Prime Minister is managing difficult issues. There are different views within her party on Brexit and she also has to manage a confidence and supply agreement with the DUP. I accept that she wants to come to an agreement and is acting in good faith. I want to give her time to speak to her party and partners in the confidence and supply agreement before we move things forward. I restate that it is the desire, ambition and wish of the Government to move to the phase 2 talks. We want to move to phase 2 and approve that move next Thursday and Friday in Brussels because it is in our interests to move to phase 2. That is when we will talk about the transition period we need in order that individuals and businesses will be able to prepare for long-term changes. It is also when we will talk about the new trading arrangements which will be so important for Irish importers and exporters, the agrifood industry and anyone whose job in Ireland depends on trade with Britain. We want to move to phase 2, but if that is not possible next week, given the problems which have arisen, we can pick it up in the new year. I have received confirmation from the Commission which is meeting now that we stand by the text which had been agreed to on Monday.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	144	As the Taoiseach knows, for a number of months I have been raising the issue of the lack of funding for section 39 bodies to restore pay in line with HSE employees. Many such organisations are involved in disability service provision, hospices and so on. Yesterday the Taoiseach told me that the Ministers for Finance and Health were working out which organisations had cut pay in line with the FEMPI legislation and those which had not. I have been raising this issue for months and would have thought the Ministers for Finance and Health would have been able to resolve the issue. It is with great disappointment that I heard today that SIPTU had run out of patience and announced an intention to ballot on industrial action. It is to ballot workers in RehabCare, the Cheshire Foundation, Western Care Mayo, St. Joseph's Foundation in Cork, SOS Kilkenny, the Cork Association for Autism, Ability West and St. Aidan's Hospital in Wexford This is a national issue. Why the allocation could not have been made in the original Estimates when the public service pay agreement was realised baffles me. There has been too much cynicism and too many delays in doing what is right and just in this case.

We will work through this issue. The Ministers, Deputies Paschal Donohoe and Simon Harris, are working through the process and we will come to a resolution which is fair and just. As the Deputy said, the issue involves other sectors besides hospitals and concerns section 39 bodies more generally, including in the disability sector and other areas. What makes section 39 bodies different from section 38 bodies is that those working for them are not public sector employees or public servants. We are carrying out an exercise to understand how pay levels went up and down across the sector. Some bodies are compliant-----

Today President Trump is expected to announce his intention to formally recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and move the US embassy there. That is in flagrant breach of the international consensus on a two-state solution. Will the Taoiseach urge President Trump not to take this provocative decision? The French President did so in a telephone call and has insisted on the status of Jerusalem being part of the peace negotiations and a two-state solution. The situation of the Palestinian people gets worse every single day. Their lives are rooted in deepening fear and constantly changing at the whim of the Israeli authorities. In keeping with the decision of the Oireachtas three years ago, will the Government agree to formally recognise the state of Palestine? Will it also move to upgrade the Palestinian mission to that of a full embassy?
#SimonCoveney	unknown-#SimonCoveney-party	unknown-#SimonCoveney-dob	unknown-#SimonCoveney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	150	The House might be interested in noting that I made direct contact yesterday with the US embassy to express our real concern at the suggestion of the US President to formally recognise Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. I made the point very clearly that, in our view, such a decision would be very unhelpful in trying to progress a stable peace process in the Middle East and also cause a lot of unnecessary tension. The messages which have come from much of the Arab world and a number of European countries reinforce that view. I reassure the Deputy that we have made the Irish view on this issue very clear. Ireland is very interested in being constructive and helpful in supporting a new initiative in the Middle East, should that happen. If the reports are true and confirmed today, it would be a step backwards. We have made the view of the Irish Government very clear.

Many parents across Ireland have since seen their child care costs increase well above any subsidy provided by the State. As the Taoiseach knows, the universal subsidy is worth about €80 per month. I know of one example where parents faced an increase of €100 in their bill last August and were told that it would go up by a further €100 a month from January.This is in response to the need for the retention of trained staff. There is no effort to cap costs for parents or subsidise the crèche costs of trained staff. The heads of the Bill and its general scheme were published in January 2017 and we have yet to see any substantial progress on the legislation. When will the legislation be advanced? Does the Taoiseach accept that child care costs have risen well above any subsidy now provided by the State?

There has certainly been an increase in child care costs and I know the enormous cost of child care for many young couples, which can be as much as the rent or mortgage, if not more. I would have to check the statistics to verify if the increase has been greater than the subsidy provided.

I am happy to say the document will be inclusive of all cultures. The decision of this Government to recognise the distinct ethnicity of the Irish Traveller culture must be realised in many ways, and one of these is to ensure we include the expression of Traveller culture in that document when it is published.

The grant is capped at €5,500 but is vital to small schools across the country, although I am speaking specifically about Tipperary. The capitation grant has been cut severely and the difficult economic conditions made it very hard to fund-raise. This funding is badly needed by some schools and it is the difference between keeping them running and having them closed. It is not fair to boards of management, principals, staff or pupils and their families. Will the Taoiseach please ask the Minister for Education and Skills when these will be paid?

That is absolutely unacceptable as schools are reliant on it. It is no longer a grant and it never was such a grant; it should never have been called a grant. This concerns moneys vital to the running of schools. I ask the Taoiseach and his Government to make it clear that these moneys should be available on a statutory basis to all schools. In only one school year of 2012 to 2013 since the scheme's introduction in 1997 was no money made available to schools. Schools rely on this and they cannot exist without it.

There is a visiting delegation from Slovenia, which last year introduced a change to its constitution to ensure its water resources remain in public ownership. This is not because of a direct threat but rather so that in future big corporations would not have an interest in its citizens' water. I advise the Taoiseach to perhaps have a chat with the delegation about that while they are here. He could get some good advice from them.

I do not see the urgency in it. I do not know how Slovenia changes its constitution but in Ireland, a referendum is required. Even if it is not a standalone question, the cost of carrying out the referendum would be between €10 million and €12 million. I know it is a core principle of socialism to waste as much taxpayers' money as possible but there are so many ways one could spend €12 million than on a wasteful and pointless referendum.

It calls for a completely different approach in the power generation sector. The Government has argued we should have 40% renewables by 2030 but we think it could be 75%. The council argues the transport budget must be changed in favour of public transport but the Government's national planning framework is about inter-urban motorways. The council has indicated that we must change agriculture, echoing what Commissioner Phil Hogan, of all people, said on Monday. The argument is we have got it wrong and we must change and start greening Irish agriculture. Rather than proposing that we raise carbon tax to pay fines, which is all I have heard the Taoiseach say, will he admit that what the Government is doing is not working, it is not ambitious enough and it must change? What will the Government change and what will happen to take the Government off the path it is on? It should not respond by saying we have a national mitigation plan. The Climate Change Advisory Council has said it is not right and it will not work.

The only guarantee I can give the Taoiseach is that if he or any politicians or Ministers ever support the banning of the burning of the burning of coal in this country, they will be faced with every type of fire and brimstone and hell will be brought down upon them. Please allow me an indulgence.

Neither my brother nor I would be here if it was not for turf, as our grandmother went to the bog barefoot when people had nothing and she cut turf. Our father sold turf in our village of Kilgarvan with a horse and rail to make a couple of pounds to keep the house going. That is where we came from. We came from nowhere else. Nobody should listen to advisers - I do not care who they are - who believe they can introduce a ban on the cutting of turf.

We debated climate change during questions to the Taoiseach last week and I laid out a number of actions being taken by the Government and referred to many things other than carbon tax. I refer Deputy Ryan to the answers I gave to his question yesterday, which was the same.

I raised with the Taoiseach a month ago that Letterkenny University Hospital applied for funding in the summer for 20 additional beds and the staff required for them. I raised this with the Minister for Health and a junior Minister for Health. A month later, there have been 500 cases of people on trolleys since I first raised the matter.Will the Taoiseach agree to take control of the situation and ensure the 20 beds are opened immediately? Yesterday 30 patients were waiting on trolleys at Letterkenny University Hospital. The Government must get a grip on the situation without delay.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	182	Will the Taoiseach confirm that it is the Government's intention to extend the compulsory retirement age for public servants to 70 years? If legislation is required to effect this change, when is it proposed to publish it? Will the Taoiseach further indicate when it is intended to do something for people working in the private sector, many of whom are locked into contracts that force them to retire at 65 years of age?
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	183	Last December I introduced a Bill in the House to abolish the mandatory retirement age. That Bill received cross-party support on Second Stage in February this year. We have been waiting since for a money message, although it is questionable as to whether such is needed. I have written numerous times to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, requesting an update on the progression of that process, but I have received no response. The announcement of the raising of the compulsory retirement age in the public sector is a welcome step in the right direction, but it falls short of the total abolition of mandatory retirement which we are seeking. Without that abolition, we will see a continuation of the current discriminatory practice whereby private sector workers are still being forced out of employment at the age of 65 years. When will the money message that is delaying the total prohibition on mandatory retirement be produced to allow us to proceed with ensuring workers across the board will be treated equally?
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	184	Yesterday, on the proposal of the Minister for Finance, the Cabinet approved the preparation of legislation necessary to raise the compulsory retirement age from 65 years of age to 70 for public servants who were recruited before 1 April 2004. Public servants recruited after that date are not required to retire at 65 years of age, but many of those recruited before then are subject to that obligation. The legislation will be introduced as soon as possible. It will not, of course, be a requirement for employees to remain in work until they are 70 years of age, but they will now have a choice to stay on, by mutual agreement with the employer. I do not have plans to move the money message in respect of Deputy John Brady's Bill. His proposals are problematic, not least because there is no money allocated for them in the budget and, second, because there is no mandatory retirement age in the private sector. There is significant case law on how employees may challenge their contract. A compulsory retirement age may be included in a contract, but it is not a statutory provision.

I have raised this issue on several occasions in the House. At the start of the year we were told that the facility would be shut down and the service provided by an outside agency from the end of September or early October. Unfortunately, that service is not yet in place. In fact, I understand the provider has not yet identified a building from which it can be delivered. The area encompassing Sligo, Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan is massive, with a broad spread of patients who require respite care. Everybody was very happy with the service provided at the Solas centre before it was shut down under the decongregation model. That policy amounts to a false economy. Those who require emergency respite care, including people in wheelchairs, must now make a round trip of 240 km from Sligo to Monaghan. That is neither fair nor humane.

I am working through a very serious case on behalf of a constituent where problems have emerged as consequence of the backlog in the Property Registration Authority. We have fought might and main to get the case through but to no avail. Is the Taoiseach aware of the shortage of staff in the Property Registration Authority and that the delays in processing documents are causing untold hardship? In the case to which I am referring it looks like the family home will be lost because of the delay in getting documentation through the registration process.

On 30 November, however, people suffering pain were dealt an awful blow when lidocaine patches, also known as Versatis patches, were withdrawn from coverage under the medical card scheme. The patches cost up to €150 per month to purchase privately. Was this change ordered by the HSE or the Government? Will the Taoiseach agree to reverse this dreadful act that was imposed on people who are vulnerable and in pain?

Where the HSE removes a particular item, it is generally done for a good reason, often because of issues related to the availability of alternatives. I do not know the reason for withdrawal in this case.
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	193	The programme for Government included a clear commitment on balanced regional development, with an undertaking to create 175,000 jobs in the regions. The Taoiseach knows as well as I do that there is a serious issue with the availability of jobs in rural areas of the midlands and the west. It is almost easier to find a needle in a haystack than to secure a Government-backed job in counties such as Roscommon and Leitrim. Last year IDA Ireland paid out €93 million in grants, not one cent of which went to counties Roscommon, Longford and Meath. How often does the economic unit in the Department of the Taoiseach meet and does its agenda include discussion of the commitment to balanced regional development on which so much emphasis was placed in the programme for Government? Government supported jobs are badly needed in the region.

In addition, there is a Cabinet sub-committee which meets once every six weeks or so. While acknowledging the significant variation between counties, it is important to emphasise that unemployment has fallen in every county. Between 60% and 80% of all jobs created in the past year were based outside Dublin. There is a lot more to job creation than the activities of IDA Ireland. That body tends to bring in large foreign direct investors, most of whom are only interested in locating in places where they will have access to 1 million people within a short distance and where there are universities and other facilities in close proximity. However, Enterprise Ireland and the local employment offices provide a large number of State-backed jobs in all counties.
#DessieEllis	unknown-#DessieEllis-party	unknown-#DessieEllis-dob	unknown-#DessieEllis-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	195	The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Catherine Byrne, indicated she was setting up a working group to look at alternative approaches to the possession of drugs for personal use. The Oireachtas justice committee also recommended decriminalisation of small amounts of drugs for personal use. A review is badly needed and long overdue. Can the Taoiseach outline when this working group will meet? What are the criteria for selecting the group and does he envisage that legislation will be required? Currently, possession is an offence.

Its establishment is imminent but I am not sure if it will be this week or next week. It is the Minister's intention to establish it before the end of the year and it will have about a year to do its work, after which it will make a recommendation. Legislation may be required but only if the group recommends it.
#RobertTroy	unknown-#RobertTroy-party	unknown-#RobertTroy-dob	unknown-#RobertTroy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	197	Yesterday, the Minister for Health gave an indication that the Government is finally going to sign the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. Are there any plans to review primary medical certificate applications under regulation SI 353/1994? In the past week alone two people presented to me in my constituency office. One has lost full power on the right side of his body while the other is a young man with very aggressive MS and but for his determination he would be in a wheelchair. Both have been refused primary medical certificates. I contacted the office and was told the existing statutory instrument is not fit for purpose. It is too restrictive and prevents the office from helping people who need help. Will the Taoiseach give an undertaking to raise this matter with the Minister for Health with a view to reviewing the statutory instrument?

The Deputy is right about the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities. The Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Finian McGrath, received approval yesterday from Cabinet to proceed to ratification, with reservations. It will require a memo to Cabinet in January and a debate and vote in both the Dáil and Seanad in January or February to allow us to do it.

Absenteeism levels among drivers in Bus Éireann have reached 14%, which shows a significant level of dysfunction. As a former Minister for Transport, the Taoiseach will know that funding has collapsed in the past ten years. People are emerging from long-term unemployment and have difficulties with mortgages and rents. They have finally got jobs and want to use buses to get to their jobs but those buses are letting them down. These jobs are under threat and other people are looking to get to hospitals for procedures, operations and appointments but are late for them. There is a commitment in the programme for Government regarding public services. Is it not true that this commitment lives in rhetoric alone rather than in the practical experience of commuters?

I do not have the figures in front of me but there has been a very significant increase in the public service obligation, PSO, levy paid to CIÉ companies in the past three years and there will be a further increase next year.

Is there any update relating to the €4 million investment needed in Tallaght hospital to provide the much needed operating theatres there? It takes referrals from Dublin hospitals, from the midlands and from Naas hospital in my constituency. The waiting list for adult spinal surgery has been going up for three years and is growing all the time. I raised this issue with the Minister for Health in a meeting back in July. This has been requested by management and the senior spinal surgeon in Tallaght hospital so I appreciate if the Taoiseach could give me an update.

In regard to overall waiting lists for surgery, the number of people waiting for inpatient or day case procedures and operations has been falling for three months. I do not have the figures for November but I hope they will continue to go down. If they do go down, we will see four months in a row where there have been shorter waiting lists for people waiting for operations and procedures.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	204	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to amend the Harbours Act 1996 and the Harbours Act 2015 with regard to the maximum term of office allowed to certain directors of harbours and to provide for connected matters.When introducing the Harbours Act 2015 the former Minister for Transport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, included a provision to restrict to ten years the period of service directors can serve on port company boards. This restriction makes sense for appointed directors but very little in the case of employee or worker directors who are elected by their colleagues. There are many Members of this Dáil who were elected by the people and who have served in excess of ten years. This begs the question as to why Government deemed it appropriate to intrude on the internal democracy of harbour companies. This Bill corrects this anomaly and recognises the distinct position of elected worker or employee directors. Employees should be able to vote for the candidate of their choice. Shannon-Foynes staff elected a colleague earlier this year as a worker director but he is excluded from the board due to this arbitrary ten-year rule. That makes absolutely no sense and it is most unfair. I would like to put on record that I have sought a meeting with the current Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport on a number of occasions to discuss this legislative anomaly but to no avail. I believe it has been remiss of the Minister not to engage on this issue. Employee directors play a valuable role on semi-State company boards but their numbers have diminished. A TASC report in 2012 noted that the reorganisation and privatisation of the commercial semi-State companies has led to a slow erosion of the prevalence of worker directors. In other countries, employee directors are the norm in both the public and private sectors. In northern European countries employees have board representation in the private sector and in Sweden, for example, employees are represented on the boards of almost all companies with more than 25 employees, while in Norway employee representation at board level starts with companies having 30 employees. Diversity in the boardroom is widely acknowledged as essential to the healthy functioning of an organisation. It is my strong view that the State must lead from the front, setting the bar on delivering such diversity of board membership. However this Government, like the ones that have gone before it, does not have a great track record in this regard. Gender balance on State boards still varies across Departments, with just over half of boards under the remit of Departments failing to meet the existing 40% gender quota. The Public Appointments Service board has just 33% female representation and this body has a significant role in preparing lists of candidates for State board appointments. Diversity of State board membership, including gender parity and employee directors, must become the new norm in the interest of good governance. We need to see boards with more worker directors not fewer and employees should be enabled to re-elect women and men who have served them well in the past. I urge the Government and its partners in Fianna Fáil to support the progress of this Bill through the House.

The sole purpose of this Bill is to remove the Money Advice and Budgeting Service, MABS, from the remit of the Citizens Information Board, CIB, which is attempting to restructure MABS, which will have a detrimental impact on the service. This restructuring comes without any proper consultation, without the support of the majority of MABS across the State and in direct conflict with the recent recommendations from the former Joint Committee on Social Protection which recommended unanimously halting the restructuring programme. Not only is CIB intent on progressing with its restructuring plans without proper consultation with MABS but it has shown utter contempt for the Oireachtas committee. This is an issue I have been working on over the last nine months since the restructuring plans first came to my attention. My colleague, Deputy Martin Kenny, and I invited MABS into Leinster House earlier this year to provide Members with a briefing to outline what was being proposed and to share its concerns about the changes. The issue of the proposed restructuring was then examined by the Joint Committee on Social Protection. The committee worked extensively on the issue over a number of committee meetings which included listening to all stakeholders involved and publishing a comprehensive report on our findings and recommendations. CIB has reluctantly engaged with the committee on two occasions so far, which we had sought in good faith to assist us in our work. Unfortunately, we have now reached the end of the road. Every Member in this House and indeed the general public know the excellent service provided by MABS in our towns and communities across the State. At a time when so many people are in mortgage distress, in danger of losing their homes, left to battle with banks and in debt, the MABS service is needed now more than ever. The regionalisation model put forward by CIB is not welcome by MABS yet its views are going ignored and the restructuring process is unfortunately underway. For that reason, we are left with no option other than to remove MABS from CIB and to return it to the remit of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection. We cannot allow this restructuring process to bulldoze ahead without consultation and without the consent of MABS. If we truly respect and acknowledge the unique work carried out by MABS across the State then we need to remove it from CIB. I ask for support for this Bill from across the House.

Having been on Twitter since 2008 myself, I am familiar with the cut and thrust of online political debate. I recognise the strengths of the platform, including citizen journalism and wider engagement but it is also a challenge for accuracy, integrity and the truth. Identification and verification are far more difficult online and many actors may not be who they appear to be. False flag accounts and mass, orchestrated political campaigns which do not disclose their true purpose defraud us all and threaten our hard won democracy. We have all heard of fake news and even of alternative facts. Bunreacht na hÉireann and the European Convention on Human Rights defend the right to free speech which includes the right to "shock, offend and disturb". They do not include a right to distort and conceal information and defraud the electorate, particularly when attempted in a systematic, large-scale way. We saw evidence in US congressional hearings on the last presidential election of what is alleged to have been a widespread, organised attempt at what amounts to voter fraud on social media. Congressional hearings heard how 126 million Facebook users in the United States were served content masquerading as local campaign websites but which allegedly emanated from Russia. We also have seen reports that similar tactics emerged during the recent Brexit debates and there is evidence that such activity is gathering pace here. Many well-known figures, including broadcasters and politicians, have seen their followings multiply in recent months, due to bots or unidentified accounts, presumably ahead of the next election or referendum. It is not difficult to game these platforms by generating what is called "fake organic" where multiple users make a post appear more popular than it really is by liking or retweeting it. There is a multiplier effect that is quite easy to control if one knows what one is doing. These not only influence public opinion but can form an echo chamber, reinforcing a particular view for decision-makers and indeed broadcasters and falsely representing the public mood.

#JamesLawless	unknown-#JamesLawless-party	unknown-#JamesLawless-dob	unknown-#JamesLawless-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	216	In case we think that we are immune in this jurisdiction, remember that six years ago, an eternity in politics and technology, in the 2011 presidential election, the "Frontline" programme saw an acrimonious debacle which led to much recrimination and arguably altered the course of the Irish presidential campaign. It is too late afterwards to address it when the damage has been done. We have also seen the rise of online advertising, an extremely useful and progressive tool which I imagine most practicing politicians in this House, including myself, use regularly but without the checks and balances which traditional political advertising is subject to. If an anonymous organisation was to erect 1,000 posters in a village or town without a hint as to who funded, sponsored or published them, they would rightly be in breach of the electoral Acts. They would be subject to civil investigation and possibly to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, the same thing can be done online in an instant with practically no safeguards. It would be possible right now for an international lobby group to purchase thousands of euro worth of advertisements on online social media and run advertising under a series of false flag accounts. This is clearly an affront to our democratic process. It is not yet illegal, but it is certainly dishonest. As we approach a busy period of referendums and elections, while we welcome the opportunities for wider debate and citizen engagement, we must ensure a robustness of content, safeguard our integrity and protect our democracy against those who would subvert it in organised, systematic and sinister ways. The Bill recognises the large corpus of law that emanates from decades of referendums, in particular the McKenna judgments which state that public money cannot be used to sway either side in an electoral contest. The State is strictly neutral and this prohibition is restated in this legislation. The proposed measures are ideologically neutral. They apply equally to the left and to the right. Transparency takes no sides in electoral contests. It merely requires a standard of disclosure so that we know those who seek to influence our electoral outcomes are who they claim to be. On the specifics of the Bill, it contains a number of definitions, including the definition of political advertising as advertising which seeks to direct the outcome of a referendum or election, to increase the popularity of a particular party or candidate for office, to influence the outcome of an industrial dispute or to influence a vote before the Oireachtas. The Bill contains a number of offences for failure to disclose the publisher or source of that information and a requirement to carry a transparency notice along with any online advertisements in the same manner that existing literature, posters and paraphernalia already require in the traditional world. It includes an offence of operating a bot, which is to have multiple fake accounts masquerading as individual entities which are actually deliberately controlled by a single user or single organisation to perpetrate political fraud. To quote the words of the poet John Keats: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". I hope the Bill will enjoy cross-party support and I look forward to the wider debate.

This would allow the committee to decide how to proceed with the consideration. Full and detailed consideration is the equivalent of pre-legislative scrutiny. It would require a full hearing rather than a limited two-hour exchange of views on the proposal which would have no bearing on the fact that this is an attempt to ram it through the House tomorrow, with no proper notice or recourse to extending this beyond the three and a half hours which are now being offered for debate. Originally it was two hours.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	225	Yesterday I proposed to the House that this matter would be referred to the defence committee, and I understood there was broad agreement on it, so that it would be capable of calling witnesses and the Army would be able to present at it, but now I understand that a joke is being made of that proposal. It is going to the defence committee but it is coming back here tomorrow, so there is no time to call witnesses. If we have learned anything on issues such as the Lisbon treaty, where afterwards we did a lot of analysis, it is that people wanted to know what was going on. I listened to the Taoiseach's argument of support. Let that be made. Let the Chief of Staff of the Army come in and make his point. Let those with reservations ask their questions in an open forum. Let others who have reservations about our participation in PESCO state their case. Let the committee of the House then report back to us. As I said yesterday, there is no urgency to this matter. Should it be the decision of the House, we can join at any time. There is no timeline. I raised the issue on 28 June last and in October, yet, as of yesterday, it all had to be truncated into a two-hour debate and now it is proposed to allow three and a half hours. However, we have the nonsense of a committee consideration when the committee will not have time to call any witnesses, probe any of the issues or answer any of the legitimate questions which people in the House or outside it might have. In reasonableness, so that we can build consensus about these matters rather than divide and create conspiracy theories about them, can we not have an open and proper parliamentary debate that would occur in any normal democratic parliament in the world? Will the Taoiseach consider that and allow the committee to meet, call witnesses and make a recommendation to us? Let us then have a vote in the new year, one way or the other.

It achieves exactly what Deputy Howlin is saying. In voting on this amendment, we are not voting on the actual issue of whether we should join. We are voting on whether we should have proper debate on it. Whatever their view on the issue, it would be a missed opportunity if parties refused the opportunity of debate. I heard the Taoiseach, who is clear in his view that we should join and that military co-operation is a central part to our new future European development. However, this is not a small issue to be decided in such a rushed way. It is a critical strategic issue in terms of our relationship with the European Union and it deserves time, debate and consideration. It should not be rushed through in two days. Nothing that I have read in the provisions establishing PESCO states that we have to agree this by Monday, 11 December. I see no reason it could not return to the Foreign Affairs Council in the new year. This would give us time to hear different views and have a public debate. It is not just this House but our public that deserves the debate. If we as a nation are going to take this role in Europe with greater military integration and investment in armaments and so on, our public deserves for it to be debated at some length and not in a rushed manner. I agree with Deputy Ó Snodaigh's proposed amendment. In particular, I ask Fianna Fáil in its republican tradition to ask for that debate as well.

#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	229	What has gone on here stinks to high heaven. Something of absolutely eIn case we think that we are immune in this jurisdiction, remember that six years ago, an eternity in politics and technology, in the 2011 presidential election, the "Frontline" programme saw an acrimonious debacle which led to much recrimination and arguably altered the course of the Irish presidential campaign. It is too late afterwards to address it when the damage has been done. We have also seen the rise of online advertising, an extremely useful and progressive tool which I imagine most practicing politicians in this House, including myself, use regularly but without the checks and balances which traditional political advertising is subject to. If an anonymous organisation was to erect 1,000 posters in a village or town without a hint as to who funded, sponsored or published them, they would rightly be in breach of the electoral Acts. They would be subject to civil investigation and possibly to the Director of Public Prosecutions. However, the same thing can be done online in an instant with practically no safeguards. It would be possible right now for an international lobby group to purchase thousands of euro worth of advertisements on online social media and run advertising under a series of false flag accounts. This is clearly an affront to our democratic process. It is not yet illegal, but it is certainly dishonest. As we approach a busy period of referendums and elections, while we welcome the opportunities for wider debate and citizen engagement, we must ensure a robustness of content, safeguard our integrity and protect our democracy against those who would subvert it in organised, systematic and sinister ways. The Bill recognises the large corpus of law that emanates from decades of referendums, in particular the McKenna judgments which state that public money cannot be used to sway either side in an electoral contest. The State is strictly neutral and this prohibition is restated in this legislation. The proposed measures are ideologically neutral. They apply equally to the left and to the right. Transparency takes no sides in electoral contests. It merely requires a standard of disclosure so that we know those who seek to influence our electoral outcomes are who they claim to be. On the specifics of the Bill, it contains a number of definitions, including the definition of political advertising as advertising which seeks to direct the outcome of a referendum or election, to increase the popularity of a particular party or candidate for office, to influence the outcome of an industrial dispute or to influence a vote before the Oireachtas. The Bill contains a number of offences for failure to disclose the publisher or source of that information and a requirement to carry a transparency notice along with any online advertisements in the same manner that existing literature, posters and paraphernalia already require in the traditional world. It includes an offence of operating a bot, which is to have multiple fake accounts masquerading as individual entities which are actually deliberately controlled by a single user or single organisation to perpetrate political fraud. To quote the words of the poet John Keats: "Beauty is truth, truth beauty". I hope the Bill will enjoy cross-party support and I look forward to the wider debate.normous significance about advanced co-operation across Europe to progress the militarisation of Europe and ramp up the arms industry was not notified to the Business Committee and is being pushed through at a few days' notice. A vote is to be taken which, when one looks at the 20 different commitments under the PESCO arrangement, would include increasing defence budgets in real terms and increasing defence investment expenditure. It sets out targets in terms of percentage of GDP to be spent on arms which will be a significant increase on current levels of expenditure and a whole range of other commitments, yet the Government wants to ram it through with a few days' notice while the public does not have a clue about its implications. The Government knows that there is massive opposition in this country to any move away from our military neutrality. The Government may say that it is not a move but I beg to differ and many other people would like to know the facts before they make their own judgment on it. However, given the timescale being proposed none of the stakeholder groups which have an interest or expertise in this matter will have an opportunity to give their opinions. Basically, this is a con. I believe that there is a quid pro quo with EU support for Ireland's position on Brexit. This is the deal.

There is no deadline for joining PESCO. We can apply at any time in the future following a proper debate and consideration. That was simply misleading the Business Committee and it is misleading the Dáil. There is no deadline. The Government is imposing that deadline because it wants to rush it through without public debate or consultation. We will be absolutely opposing it.

It is an attempt to rush the matter through the House and present the public with a fait accompli. Although obviously an issue for the House, as I said yesterday it is not just an issue for the House. It is also an issue for the public. There needs to be full public debate, discussion and scrutiny on the issue which cannot be done in the parameters set out by the Chief Whip. It is quite clear to everyone that there is no deadline of any kind and no necessity to rush the matter through the Houses of the Oireachtas. Participation in PESCO undermines Irish neutrality and sends us in the direction of a European army. We all raised issues in this regard during the debate on the Lisbon treaty when we were told nothing like it would happen but here it is before us. It also raises the issue of additional expenditure in this area. The figure of 2% of GDP would be at least double, if not more, of our current spending in this area.Given the issues that arise regarding housing, health and other public services, those services could well do with the money rather than having it paid to the arms industry. I oppose this. It is only fair and reasonable that the public have its say, be made knowledgeable and be allowed to scrutinise this issue over time. I expect that this matter will be deferred until the new year to allow for the public discussion and debate.

There has been plenty of debate about this matter since the Lisbon treaty was ratified in 2009. There is a time for debate and there is a time for a decision.

The members of Cabinet committee F are as follows: the Taoiseach; the Tánaiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Minister for Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform; the Minister for Justice and Equality; the Minister for Business, Enterprise and Innovation; the Minister for Health; the Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport; the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Minister of State at the Department of the Taoiseach with responsibility for defence. The Garda Commissioner and Chief of Staff of the Defence Forces also attend. Other Ministers may be invited to attend, as appropriate, depending on the business in hand. The committee last met on 7 November. That meeting was attended by: the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade; Minister for Justice and Equality; Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment; Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government; and the Minister of State with responsibility for defence. Also in attendance were key personnel from the Defence Forces and An Garda Síochána together with a number of civil servants. The role of Cabinet committee F is to keep the State's systems for the analysis of, preparation for, and response to, threats to national security under review as well as to provide for high-level co-ordination between relevant Departments and agencies on related matters. The Cabinet committee allows greater ministerial involvement in preparing for and managing major security threats.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	260	I thank the Taoiseach for his response. Will the Taoiseach indicate the position on the prioritisation of those threats? Probably one of the growing and most significant threats relates to cybersecurity. Will the Taoiseach indicate the degree to which the national security committee has taken action to prepare the State in respect of potential cyberattacks? We know what happened in Britain, where the health service was overwhelmed. We know other countries, especially eastern European countries, have had their systems paralysed as a result of a cyberattacks. Often, these attacks are perpetrated by other nations and criminal conglomerates. Does the State have a programme of investment to enhance its cybersecurity measures? Will the Taoiseach indicate where Ireland ranks now for a potential terrorist threat of the kind we have witnessed in London and the United States carried out by ISIS or others and the nature of our vulnerability? Will the Taoiseach give an indication of the dissident threat and how vigilant the Garda and the Army are in that regard? How concerned are they? The Taoiseach took a decision to get a staff member to photograph him chairing the national security cabinet committee so that it could be tweeted. I gather the Taoiseach took umbrage the last time this was raised, taking the view that we are all back in the analogue era – we are not.Officials and key personnel will change from time to time, depending on the nature of the crisis. Is the Taoiseach certain that security would not be compromised in some circumstances given the nature of the personnel who would be present? My concern relates to cybersecurity.

Apart from responding to the type of incidents the Taoiseach mentioned, does Cabinet committee A have any role in ensuring that An Garda Síochána and the Defence Forces are trained and equipped to deal with these types of incidents? Does it have the authority to review and update the current national security and intelligence structure? The Taoiseach will be aware that in August last, EirGrid revealed that State sponsored hackers gained access to a Vodafone network it used, leaving its network exposed to attack. Has this threat been discussed by the committee and what defence measures is the Government considering in the light of these threats?

On the specific role of the national security committee, has it given consideration to a matter I raised with the Taoiseach previously, namely, the need for a bespoke security agency which would separate security considerations from An Garda Síochána, leaving the Garda as a policing organisation and taking all the elements of security it currently does, together with military intelligence, the national cybersecurity agency and others, into a bespoke security agency? Has this matter been discussed by the committee? With regard to the facilities available in the event of a national emergency, a recent weather event caused a nationwide red alert. We have a national command centre, which I utilised on occasions in the past. Do we need to review the infrastructure we provide for a national emergency, whether it is caused by flooding, snowfall, an attack or a nuclear incident in the United Kingdom, to ensure we have a secure command centre that will direct our response to any security threat that might emerge?

It was elevated from low or very low to the next level up, either low or slightly elevated. I cannot remember the exact term but it is the second lowest level and it has not been lowered since.

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	265	I think there are five levels but I cannot swear to that. I am sure the level is currently set at the second lowest level, which I think is called elevated. As I stated previously, the membership of the Cabinet committee is not a secret and I have just placed it on the record of the Dáil. Aside from the picture that was tweeted, photographers have been invited into the meeting room in the past by the news media, as was a camera from RTÉ, and pictures have been published. The Cabinet committee's discussions are confidential and it is not the practice to answer questions relating to specific issues dealt with by the committee, for example, agenda items, work programmes and terms of reference. I can, however, speak generally about issues of national security and I am happy to do so. Cybersecurity is dealt with on two levels. The first, the national centre for cybersecurity, had its budget increased in recent times. The Defence Forces also have a role in cybersecurity. We are very aware of what has happened in other countries, whether it is the WannaCry attack which compromised the information systems of the national health service in the United Kingdom, or cyberattacks on parliaments, including the Oireachtas, in recent years. We are very conscious that Ireland has many data centres and a large amount of data is stored here. We need to ensure that, as a country, we are very wise to the risks of a cyberattack and there is greater co-operation at European level on this particular issue. One of the specific discussions we have had around the European Council table has been on what European countries can do in terms of greater co-operation to manage these new security threats such as cyberattacks. We intend to do exactly that and we have also had some initial conversations with the US authorities about how we could share their expertise in and around cybersecurity.  On Deputy Howlin's question on establishing a bespoke security agency, I may be correct in saying that it falls within the remit of the Commission on Future Policing to examine whether we should have a bespoke security agency.

Notwithstanding that Ireland is a small country with much lower security risks than other countries, creating a whole new agency and disentangling it from the Garda and Defence Forces would be complicated and our national security could be compromised during the transition phase, which could last for years and be very expensive. I have an open mind on the issue and I am interested in hearing views on it and seeing what the Commission on the Future of Policing recommends. The national emergency centre is used to co-ordinate these events. I believe I have covered most of the issues raised. 
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	268	I propose to take Questions Nos. 3 to 6, inclusive, together. I became aware on 20 November of the existence of an email in the Department of Justice and Equality, dated 15 May 2015, which recounted that an official in the Attorney General's office had telephoned an official in the Department of Justice and Equality. The phone call informed the Department that counsel for the Garda Commissioner at the O'Higgins commission of investigation had raised an issue of an allegation that had been made against Sergeant Maurice McCabe. The email noted that this allegation had always been denied by Sergeant McCabe and that when a file had been presented to the Director of Public Prosecutions in relation to it, the DPP had directed that there be no prosecution. The email went on to state that the issue had also been considered by the independent review mechanism. This had been done in the context of a complaint by a person who asserted that her allegation had not been properly investigated at the time by the Garda. This person has since become known as Ms D. At that time, May 2015, the O'Higgins commission of investigation was still in the early stages of its work. The author of the email surmised that the purpose in raising the matter may have been to test Sergeant McCabe's motivation. The email also stated that counsel for Sergeant McCabe had objected to the issue being raised. In relation to Deputy Kelly's question, it is not accurate to state that the Department of Justice and Equality and, by implication, the former Tánaiste were informed of the Garda Commissioner's legal strategy at the commission. In fact, the term "legal strategy" is not used in the email. What the former Tánaiste was informed in the email was that an issue which the author speculated might be argued to be "potentially relevant to motivation" had been raised on 15 May 2015 and challenged by Sergeant McCabe's legal counsel. Most Deputies will understand how the legal system generally operates - counsel raise matters and the issues are tested in argument. What would have been wrong would have been if the former Tánaiste had sought to interfere in the work of the commission while it was under way and in the approach taken by another party to a judicial commission. She should not and could not have done so in any circumstances. The current Attorney General, having reviewed the matter, has agreed that doing so would have been inappropriate and improper. I conveyed information to the House in good faith and used the phrase "cross-examination" as it was contained in the briefing note I had been given by the Department of Justice and Equality to assist me in giving my answers. However, this was an error and the note should have referred to "exchanges between counsel", which I understand happened during the opening statements of the commission. There is no question of my having deliberately misinformed the House. However, I apologise for inadvertently doing so. It is important to note that, while officials of the Department were witnesses in a later module of the commission, neither they nor their counsel were present for this part of its proceedings. Counsel for officials of the Department was not even nominated until many months later, in October 2015, and only attended during the module in which the commission investigated the action the Department had taken on foot of Sergeant McCabe's allegations. As Deputies will be aware, in response to my direction on 22 November 2017, the Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality provided me with an interim report on 24 November on progress made in the search and examination of departmental records, together with a full report on the implementation of the Toland report. I subsequently received a full report on the matter, dated 27 November. The former Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, as well as the Minister for Justice and Equality were also informed of these developments by officials of the Department. On 27 November the Department of Justice and Equality published the reports on its website, with two email threads which had been discovered in the course of the search and retrieval of records which have now been sent to the disclosures tribunal, a letter from the disclosures tribunal to the Department dated 22 November 2017 and a report setting out progress in the implementation of the Toland report. Officials in the Department have been advised to ensure that in the unlikely event further relevant records emerge, the acting Secretary General will be notified at the earliest opportunity and that they will be discovered to the disclosures tribunal without delay. As I stated in the House on 28 November, the events of the past few days have once again exposed major gaps in the Department of Justice and Equality, including in the way important emails were not found and not sent to the disclosures tribunal during discovery. I have directed that there be an external inquiry into that failure. A senior counsel is being appointed to carry out the review as a matter of urgency. I have also stated the Government will establish an independent change implementation group to accelerate the process of reform in response to the problems within the Department identified in the Toland report.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	269	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply and for correcting the record. It was an important point. There is an element of denial about what is going on. I spent a period of time at the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality this morning and genuinely ask the Taoiseach to ask his colleagues, Deputy Colm Brophy and Senator Martin Conway, who made good contributions about what happened. It was extraordinary. Given everything that has gone on and the information we have received through persistent questioning and with help from the media, we still have departmental officials coming to the committee to state the Department provided the information that it had been requested to provide during discovery. That is it - nothing has changed. The meeting was deeply worrying. I asked a specific question. I asked if private email addresses that potentially had been used by senior officials for departmental business and mobile phone records had been provided for the tribunal. The answer was that they had not been asked for them. I had to ask the officials to ask Mr. Justice Charleton if he wanted this information. Is that not crazy? Has anything changed? We were also told that the information provided had been provided based on the questions asked and that there might be other documentation available. In effect, they are acting as judge and jury and as a filtering system in providing information for the Charleton tribunal. The trawl has not changed anything. The culture has not changed. There are three specific issues. First, the way in which parliamentary questions are answered has not changed. The Taoiseach made a commitment in the Dáil that it would. I have evidence from yesterday. I am receiving far more text, but I am not getting answers in seeking facts, not speculation. Second, when it comes to the information being provided for the Charleton tribunal, we need a volte-face in attitude. The Department needs to provide everything. It needs to err on the side of providing too much. Information on the specific issues I have raised has not been sent. Third, I note that last week the Taoiseach was provided with a summary under section 41 by the acting Garda Commissioner. What is he going to do about this? It has to be acted on immediately. It is not a case of writing back and asking more questions. The tribunal will be live for the next couple of months and we need this unit to be dealt with. We need answers quickly because it is having a dramatic impact on the operations of the tribunal. The Taoiseach should remember that the Department has received lots of correspondence from certain witnesses who have issues and concerns about this issue, on top of the 29 parliamentary questions from me.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	270	A lot has happened. These questions were tabled before the events of last week. It is important that point be made because the Taoiseach has been clear that the former Tánaiste had to resign, in spite of making no errors. He has conflated two issues and formed a view that the former Tánaiste will be vindicated at the Charleton tribunal, but it is not inquiring into whether the Dáil was misled, whether information was placed before the Dáil or whether it was told the full story. That is the key point. The Taoiseach has acknowledged and I accept that he inadvertently misled the Dáil, but it was misled on this issue, not only once but twice and perhaps more. That is the core point in terms of accountability to the House and that was the challenge we faced. The Taoiseach also acknowledged that if Deputy Alan Kelly's questions had been answered differently three or four weeks ago, we might not have ended up where we are. It is a fact that the Taoiseach has had to apologise, as has the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, for failures in responding to the House. I have not received a satisfactory explanation as to why the Taoiseach, for example, was not told about the existence of the emails. Likewise, there is no explanation - I was not at the committee meeting this morning - as to why the documents were not sent to the Charleton inquiry, other than that it appears the Department was not asked for them, but that does not stack up, as was clear last weekend. There is nothing coming back by way of a rational explanation. What happened gave rise to huge mistrust between the House and the Executive and the Department. I refer to the drip-drip emergence of documents over a period. As was clear, Deputy Alan Kelly was asking specific questions, to which there were no answers. For example, despite it being laid out for four weeks that there might not have been a phone call as no one could trace one, it was traced eventually. There was a phone call and there is a record of it in the headquarters in the Phoenix Park. It took four to five weeks to have that question answered. On reflection, it should not have taken that length of time to answer it.

Are we in a position to appoint the change management group? When will the Taoiseach be in a position to do so?  On the examination to be undertaken by the external person to inquire into the reason the documents were not sent to the Charleton inquiry, is the Taoiseach in a position to name the person or indicate when the examination will commence?  On the Toland review, is the Taoiseach concerned about the lack of speed in reforming the Department? The review is nearly two and a half years old and a lot of it did not get anywhere, although some of it did.

I welcome the scéal that a senior counsel will carry out a review. Will the Taoiseach indicate when the senior counsel will be named? The Taoiseach has also stated he wants the inquiry to report before Christmas. Does he expect it to be completed before the Dáil rises for the Christmas recess? Will he publish the report immediately when he receives it? The Minister has also spoken about his concerns about the size of the Department of Justice and Equality and its area of responsibility. In 2014 the Toland report stated consideration should be given to dividing the Department and that an analysis had been conducted which supported this view. How will the process be progressed? Will the change implementation group have responsibility for advancing it or will it be a matter for the Minister? Is there a timeframe in mind for its completion, if it is decided to divide the Department? When does the Taoiseach expect the job specification for the new Garda Commissioner to be published?

#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	276	That is fair enough. I suggest that the Taoiseach asks his party colleagues about it.

I agree with Deputy Kelly that the Department of Justice and Equality should err on the side of sending too much when it comes to documentation. If officials have documentation in front of them and are wondering if it is covered by the terms of reference of the tribunal, they should assume that it is. That is the approach that all Departments should take when it comes to discovery orders from tribunals. I was concerned that when the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, heard about one of the famous emails that after he directed it to be sent to the tribunal, the Department still sought legal advice on whether it was covered by the terms of reference of the tribunal. It should have just been sent down straight away.

This is a tribunal established by the Oireachtas for a particular purpose and Departments should not think they have anything to hide or even have that mindset. In terms of the section 41 letter, that contains allegations about the liaison unit for the tribunal in Garda headquarters. This is a matter that has been raised in the House already. It was raised some months ago by Deputies Clare Daly and Mick Wallace. I have asked the Minister for Justice and Equality to seek a response from the acting Garda Commissioner to the allegations made. I want that response to be a line by line response to each allegation, each assertion and each fact.

I will have to double check as to whether those allegations were made in a normal letter or by way of a protected disclosure.

The role of my Department is to support my work as Taoiseach and to co-ordinate the work of the Government and Cabinet. My Department is structured around seven main work areas. The breakdown of staff currently assigned to each of these areas is as follows: 25 staff assigned to the international, EU and Northern Ireland division; 24 staff assigned to the economic division; 24 staff assigned to the Government secretariat, protocol division and the parliamentary liaison unit;12 staff assigned to the social policy and public service reform division; 11 staff assigned to the strategic communications unit; 28 staff assigned to the corporate affairs division; and eight staff assigned to the information and records management unit. The remainder of staff in my Department include services staff and those aligned to private offices, constituency offices, the Government press office and internal audit. With the exception of politically appointed staff such as special advisers, all staff assignments, appointments and recruitment in my Department are the responsibility of the Secretary General. While there are currently no plans to change the structure of my Department, the Department’s staffing needs are reviewed on an ongoing basis. There are currently 19 politically appointed staff employed by my Department. Politically appointed staff employed by my Department include special advisers; personal assistants; civilian drivers to Independent Ministers and Ministers of State; the deputy Government press secretary; the assistant Government press secretary; the chief strategist for the Independent Alliance and the political co-ordinator for the Independent Ministers in Government. 
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	290	Last week, the Taoiseach told me that there were a total of 22 staff working for him in his constituency and private offices. These include a deputy secretary, an assistant secretary, a principal officer and so forth. There are 18 staff in the Taoiseach's private office and four in his constituency office. I do not know if the total of 22 includes staff working out in the constituency. How many of the 22 staff are political? In terms of the structure and management of his Department, the Taoiseach has been in office for a reasonable amount of time now. A headline in the Independent newspaper this morning reads "Families 'devastated' as surgery target for children with scoliosis shelved". This is something that the Taoiseach and I discussed when we were both Ministers. When I was Tánaiste and he was a Minister, I secured, with his full support, the funding for the new operating theatre in Crumlin. There are 22 people in his office at the level of deputy secretary, assistant secretary, principal officer, assistant principal officer, higher executive officer and executive officer. How, in that context and in terms of the approach to this very important strategic issue, can we be told through the newspapers this morning of the distress of the parents and families of 210 children, whose target deadline for surgery was confirmed by the Taoiseach and by the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, to me and other Deputies not too long ago, appears to have been abandoned? This also includes children referred to by the Government in this House who would be facilitated to go abroad, mainly to the UK, to have their desperately needed operations done. I cannot understand what is going on in the Taoiseach's office. I know he is busy and this is a relatively small item in the overall scheme of things but it is desperately important to the people involved.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	291	The debacle on Monday around the negotiations between the EU and the British Government has brought into sharp focus the difficulties involved in managing the Brexit process. Does the Taoiseach have any plans to increase the number of staff in his Department or change how staff are deployed to deal with this issue? I am also concerned at the way the weekend's events were managed. Clearly, Brussels and the Irish Government believed that an agreement had been reached with the British. Experience of negotiations with successive British Governments, unionist leaders and Irish Governments has taught me, however, that until a deal is signed, sealed and delivered it is always best to be cautious. Over the weekend, and certainly from Sunday and into Monday, there was a lot of heavy briefing of the media. I do not know where the chain of command stands in that regard. Perhaps the strategic communications unit thought it was a good news story but there was lots of scéil about an emerging deal. A Government press conference was flagged up for most of Monday in the naive expectation that a deal would be announced. The end result was to give the DUP the excuse it needed.The DUP leader followed up with ludicrous claims which added to the sense of amateur hour, confusion and farce. The big question is where the process goes from here. Is the Taoiseach prepared to block progress to phase two unless Britain gives formal written guarantees there will be no economic border? From the briefing we received, it was not clear and, in fact, one could assume - if that is a safe thing to do - that citizens in the North will not have access to the European Court of Justice and the European institutions, like citizens of the European Union in Dublin, Cork or Paris. That was certainly absent from the communication that was relayed to us.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	292	Since the budget, on a number of occasions, the Taoiseach has indicated he is being very reasonable and that he thinks €6 million going on staff and marketing in the new communications unit is okay. I think it is actually quite extraordinary growth, given the Taoiseach mentioned 11 people have been employed in the unit in double quick time. I remember Deputy Stephen Donnelly asking questions about Brexit personnel being increased in various agencies and it took over a year to get two or three extra people into various Brexit agencies. Given the strategic communications unit has been ramped up very quickly, with 11 people working there, if we look at the departmental element of the Taoiseach's Vote, one thing stands out, namely, about one fifth of the total budget is now spent on marketing campaigns. It is quite unusual across the democratic world that the Prime Minister's office - in this case, the Taoiseach's office - would have such a personal budget weighted to marketing. I am unclear as to its direction or the necessity for it. Last week we were told the children's hospitals would be the focus of a marketing strategy from the strategic communications unit. However, the lack of scoliosis operations will not be focus of that unit. I know the Taoiseach has said we need more good news and that it is designed to counterbalance the independent media, which he believes is too negative. He spoke here some weeks ago and said there is too much negativity in the general independent media. I looked at last night's programme on disability services and I can bet my bottom dollar that will not feature in the work of the strategic communications unit. I am very uncomfortable with the blurring of the lines between what was traditionally known as Government information and political campaigning. I believe the strategic communications unit, notwithstanding people's best intentions, runs the very real risk of blurring those lines and that we will end up with political campaigns around issues that Government politicians will want to use to promote themselves, as opposed to giving basic information to the public.

I think that is bad politics, quite frankly. The Labour Party, as we all know, would have 20 members as State-funded staff and I am sure the leader's allowance paid to Deputy Howlin is also paid to higher staff in the headquarters of the Labour Party. Fianna Fáil, through its Senators, Deputies and the leader's allowance, probably has 100 State-funded, taxpayer-funded staff. If it is the Deputies' view there is some connection between that and scoliosis, I think they should perhaps offer to second some of the staff for Fianna Fáil and the Labour Party towards-----

#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	301	Given that Deputies were given wide latitude to discuss a very important issue like scoliosis under a question that is related to the structure and management of my Department, I would like to talk about scoliosis as well because I think it is very important. It is not the kind of issue I would use in that sort of way to score tacky points around the management of a Department. I am a doctor by profession. I understand scoliosis. I have treated patients who have had scoliosis. When I was a medical student, I remember seeing kids who were waiting on operations whose lung function was getting worse by the day and by the month because of the delays in getting treatment. I vowed to myself that if I ever had the privilege to hold political office, to be Minister for Health or Taoiseach, I would try to do something about this. I have been following this issue as a Deputy and as Minister for Health, and I am still following it and working on it as Taoiseach. I take it very seriously and it is something I am very committed to because I really feel for these kids and their families. We have made very significant strides forward. We have the new theatre in Crumlin, for which I provided funding when I was Minister for Health. I appreciate it is not open fully to capacity but it is open. As Minister for Health I also took the decision to offer the option of going abroad for treatment to patients. I totally accept that many families do not accept that but the offer is made. I am sure, if the Deputy genuinely cared about this issue, she would have mentioned and welcomed the progress that has been made. At the beginning of February of this year there were 315 patients awaiting spinal fusion. As of 1 December there are 156 patients on the scoliosis active waiting list, so, since February, the number of people on that scoliosis waiting list is down by more than half. The numbers now waiting more than four months was 80 last week, it will be down to 68 this week and by the end of the year, it will be down to 25. There will be only 25 children with scoliosis waiting more than four months and all those will be given an offer in the new year. Instead of taking cheap shots, I would have thought, at the very least, we would have got some recognition from the Labour Party about the amount of progress that has been made in this area. I know it is not achieving everything or what those kids deserve but to have gone from 315 patients waiting down to 156 now, and to as few as 25 waiting more than four months by the end of this year, is enormous progress. A lot of credit is due to the officials working on this in the various Departments, to the staff in the HSE and, in particular, to the consultants, nurses and other staff in Crumlin.

We all appreciate that as a new Taoiseach, like any Taoiseach, he is exceptionally busy and, therefore, he has to prioritise and have a strategy in regard to issues. I could read the Taoiseach a letter from one of the most eminent doctors in Crumlin that would probably make him cry. It is about what that doctor feels at the frustration of not having enough resources in terms of doctors and, in particular, nurses to have that theatre-----

I was involved in having this funded. The Taoiseach was Minister for Health at the time I was Tánaiste and we co-operated on it.

I will take my example from the former Tánaiste, who was on watch when many of these issues developed.My question to the Taoiseach was ignored by him. It was related to access for people in the North to the European Court of Justice and other European institutions and to clarifying that the Government would not move to the next phase of the negotiations until there was a satisfactory conclusion to the current phase.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	310	My fundamental question was about the blurring of the lines between propaganda emanating from the Taoiseach's Department via the strategic communications unit, SCU, and real news. I referenced scoliosis services. Let us be honest - "RTÉ Investigates" was the key programme that provoked a reaction from the Government on waiting lists, in particular for people with scoliosis. People were horrified and appalled, but it took programmes of that kind to force the Government to react. Likewise, with reference to last night's programme on the appalling circumstances of many elderly parents of adult citizens with intellectual disabilities, it will upset people across the country that this is where society is. Will it be "RTÉ Investigates" versus the SCU? Please God, the national children's hospital will be the next good news story and we are all rooting for it. It has had a long gestation period in planning and so on. The SCU cannot become a propaganda unit. Independent media are important. We might not like some of the stories and Governments may not like what emerges on television and radio programmes from time to time in revealing unacceptable situations, but that is the intercourse of political life and accountability by the Government to the people. That is what having an independent media is all about. The use of taxpayers' money and the ramping up of the SCU from nothing to 11 staff and €5 million outstrip the extra allocations of staff for Enterprise Ireland to deal with Brexit in the early months. That is the general point I am making.
#LeoVaradkar	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-party	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-dob	unknown-#LeoVaradkar-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	311	For the record, what the SCU deals with is the provision of public information and campaigns. It does not deal with political matters such as the Brexit talks or responding to what happens on television or radio programmes. That is not its role as I am sure I have said many times. As regards how I structure my Department, one of my special advisers, Ms Angela Flanagan, follows health matters. A specific part of her remit is keeping an eye on scoliosis services and keeping me informed on the issue. While it is absolutely the case that the RTÉ "Prime Time" programme had an impact and spurred further Government action, the provision of a theatre had been approved by me as Minister for Health long before that programme was aired. While I do acknowledge that the then Tánaiste, Deputy Joan Burton, took an interest in the issue and helped me to secure funding for the theatre from the person who is now her party leader and held the purse strings at the time, it is counterbalanced ten to 15 times over by the number of times that I had to fight, when Minister, with the Labour Party to defend the health and disability budget.

#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	315	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this very important topic which affects all 10,000 active CIÉ pensioners and all potential pensioners. In 1993 there were five pension schemes in operation in CIÉ, of which three were in deficit and two in surplus. After protracted negotiations, an agreement was reached in 1994 with all CIÉ employees and the company to amalgamate all five pension scheme, thereby allowing CIÉ to remove a potential €73 million pension deficit from its books. In return, the employees were given certain assurances, the first of which was that the board of CIÉ would guarantee the solvency of the pension schemes each year. This assurance was covered by SI 323 of 2002 and SI 205 of 2010. The second commitment given was that there would be regular post-retirement increases, but no specific rate was mentioned. The company adhered to these commitments until 2009 when it failed to provide sufficient funding to ensure the solvency of the schemes in that year and the following years. This was in direct contravention of the advice tendered by the company's actuary. The board of CIE has underfunded the pension schemes ever since and the underfunding now totals about €80 million. In 2013 flawed and legally questionable proposals to drastically reduce the benefits for the employees of both CIÉ pension schemes were submitted by CIÉ to the Pensions Board. There was no consultation with the workforce or the trade unions and the proposals were submitted as a first resort, without exploring other options. This has resulted in a pay freeze for pensioners for 11 years until 2023. CIÉ's pensions committee for the schemes has consistently refused to confirm that it adheres to all of its legal requirements. CIÉ is now in the process of submitting new proposals to further restrict and reduce pensioners' benefits, again without proper consultation and adhering to correct procedure, having refused for the first time in the history of the company to fund an independent legal opinion to enable the membership to test the legality of what was done and is now being proposed. I ask the Minister to intervene. The representatives of pensioners and the trade unions have tried fruitlessly to engage with the board of CIÉ. They have been misled, suffered obfuscation, been put off and their questions have been avoided, etc. It was traditional that if there was a dispute of this nature or there were legal questions at issue, the company would fund an independent legal opinion for the benefit of the employees and the company, something which has been flatly refused on this occasion. The only recourse they now have, having been fobbed off by the board, is to appeal to the House and people like me and the Minister. Is the Minister aware of the issue? Does he propose to intervene or do anything about it? Would he, at a minimum, as a prelude to such action, at least meet representatives of the pensioners who feel very aggrieved because their livelihoods are being shredded?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	316	I thank the Deputy for raising this important issue. Matters regarding the CIÉ pension schemes are, as the Deputy will know, primarily for the CIÉ group, its employees and the trustees of the pension schemes. The employees of CIÉ group companies, that is, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, Iarnród Éireann and CIÉ, are provided with pension benefits on retirement from one of two schemes, the regular wages scheme or the superannuation scheme.Both are defined benefit schemes. In common with the overwhelming majority of such schemes, both schemes are facing significant challenges in maintaining solvency to ensure prudent provision is made to fund the cost of future pensions in a low interest rate environment. In 2013, both schemes submitted proposals to the Pensions Authority, as required. The schemes demonstrated a plan that would restore the schemes to the solvency level required by the Pensions Authority by the end of 2023. This is referred to as the funding plan. The plan consists of three strands. First, there is a funding commitment from CIÉ as schemes sponsor. Second, there is a range of assumptions around future market performance and growth in pension liabilities. Third, there is an investment strategy that would hope, over time, match movements in the value of the schemes obligations with movements in the value of the scheme's liabilities. Each year the schemes' independent actuary reports to the Pensions Authority on performance against the schemes' funding plan. At the end of 2016, due mainly to the low interest rate environment, both schemes were certified as being "off-track", or they had not reached the solvency milestone that had been set in the funding plan for the end of 2016. Arising from the "off-track" certification, the trustees of each scheme are required to submit revised funding proposals to the Pensions Authority outlining the steps being taken to restore each scheme to an "on-track" status. The trustees of the schemes have the obligation to submit revised funding plans. There is no requirement on the trustees to consult with the trade union group or the active membership before making its submission to the Pensions Authority, and perhaps there should be. CIÉ, as scheme sponsor, considers it preferable to develop proposals on an agreed basis with the membership of the scheme. Accordingly, CIÉ has continued throughout 2017 to engage with the trade union group in order to bring about a set of proposals that could form the basis of the trustees' submission to the Pensions Authority. This process, which involves detailed discussion with employee representatives, facilitated by the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, is ongoing in an effort to develop proposals on an agreed basis to address the "off-track matter". Some progress has been made but an agreed basis for resolution has not yet been achieved. CIÉ is on record at the WRC that it will not impose any change that it proposes without the agreement of the active members of both schemes and that it will continue to contribute to both schemes in accordance with the rules of the schemes.
#WillieODea	unknown-#WillieODea-party	unknown-#WillieODea-dob	unknown-#WillieODea-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	317	The Minister has stated in his reply that negotiations are ongoing but the truth is that negotiations are going nowhere. I do not know how people in this House would react if we were faced with a proposal to freeze our pensions until 2023 and, in addition, that further restrictions would be introduced. I will put some specific questions to the Minister and I would like specific answers. He referred to the trustees as being part of the package but is he aware that an independent analysis of the CIÉ pension schemes last year concluded the role of the trustees in the schemes is marginalised and they can be amended without the input of trustees? There is no other scheme where a similar position applies in either the public or private sector. Is the Minister also aware that for the first time in history, there is no functioning pension committee, as all the members have resigned? Is he aware the same individual, whom I will not name, holds the dual role as head of group public relations with responsibility for pensions and the CIÉ board's lead negotiator; in other words, there is a clear conflict of responsibility? Will the Minister order an independent investigation into what is happening there? Will he direct the board to answer a number of legitimate questions put to him on behalf of the 10,000 active members of the CIÉ pension schemes? Will he request the board to for heaven's sake resort to the usual practice in CIÉ and fund an independent legal opinion for the benefit of the people who are trying to represent these pensioners?
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	318	I thank the Deputy for raising these matters. I am happy to refer them to the CIÉ board for their comment. I am not prepared at this stage to give a commitment to fund what he asks for just because the Deputy has raised it in the House today. If there is a conflict of interest, as maintained by the Deputy, I will refer it to the CIÉ board for comment along with the other matters. It would be foolish of me to answer that immediately either in the positive or negative as it is a serious allegation. I should look at it in a serious way but I will not make any judgment on it before I ask the CIÉ board about it.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	319	I welcome the opportunity to speak to this matter. The R630 is a regional road linking Whitegate with the N25, a national primary road at Midleton, and Lakeview roundabout in east Cork, which serves the Cork to Rosslare Europort via Waterford city. This regional road from Whitegate also carries traffic from adjoining areas such as Upper Aghada, Lower Aghada, Rostellan, Saleen, Ballycotton, Clyne and Ballinacurra, just to mention a few locations. Whitegate village can boast to be the home of the only oil refinery in Ireland but the most startling fact is that it accounts for over 40% of Cork's road tonnage, and it travels on the R630 all year around. There is also Aghada power station, which is Ireland's largest, and this means the regional route is extremely busy. The Minister can understand why. Unfortunately, all this traffic must enter the N25 at Lakeview roundabout at Midleton, which is constantly choked with long tailbacks every morning. Midleton town council had approached what was then the National Roads Authority, now Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, a number of years ago about having an extra slip lane at the junction between the R630 Whitegate route and the N25 to alleviate this very problem. Unfortunately, over the years nothing has happened. The commuters who use this route day in and day out have grown very frustrated with the lack of progress. More worrying is the question of safety in the area, particularly with regard to emergency services and the ambulance service in Midleton. I received information from the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, recently indicating that the new ambulance base is to be in Ballinacurra, which is on the R630 road. From seeing all these tailbacks, I know that if the problem remains, we should fear for people's safety. As well as all the people who use the route, I would like to know if TII will make use of the land adjacent to the Lakeview roundabout and put in an extra lane leading to Cork from the Whitegate road, thus alleviating this very serious congestion problem. I spoke to the Minister very briefly about this a while ago. It is basically a T-junction with the national route - the N25 - and the R630, which comes to a pinch point at the roundabout. There is enough land on the left to install a slip or feeder lane but there has never been support from TII. There is a large population in the area that travels the road and I mentioned some of the towns and villages. Very large trucks also use the road, and as I mentioned, fuel being taken from Whitegate accounts for some of the 40% of tonnage travelling in Cork. There is also counter-flow with the population working and living in the area. If the Minister could see the road on any morning, he would see tailbacks from Lakeview roundabout to Ballinacurra, which is the bones of a mile away. We cannot alleviate the problem unless a slip road is installed.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	320	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter, in which I know he has a great and persistent interest. It has registered on my radar because he has spoken to me about it both privately and publicly. I am grateful to him for doing so. As Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport I have responsibility for overall policy and funding for the national roads programme. The planning, design and implementation of individual national road projects is a matter for Transport Infrastructure Ireland, TII, in conjunction with local authorities concerned. Ireland has just under 100,000 km of road in its network and the maintenance and improvement of national, regional and local roads places a substantial financial burden on local authorities and on the Exchequer. As a result of the national financial position, there were very large reductions in the Exchequer funding available for roads expenditure after the financial crisis. For this reason the focus has had to be on maintenance and renewal rather than new improvement projects in recent years and I envisage that this emphasis on maintaining assets together with safety measures will continue into the next capital plan period. Within its capital budget, the assessment and prioritisation of individual national projects is a matter for TII, in accordance with section 19 of the Roads Act. I understand from Transport Infrastructure Ireland that Cork County Council recently completed a pavement improvement scheme at Ballyvergan, on the N25 close to Youghal, which involved the overlay of the existing pavement. In addition, the council is completing the N25 Killeagh pavement scheme which involves pavement improvements and associated works through Killeagh village. The N25 Castlemartyr pavement scheme which has been put out to tender will involve pavement improvements and associated works on the N25 through the east side of Castlemartyr village and beyond. It is anticipated that the project will go to construction in 2018. I understand, in addition, that the council is starting design works on a number of pavement improvement schemes on the N72, primarily between Mallow and Fermoy. Cork County Council, as the statutory roads authority, is responsible for regional and local road maintenance and improvement in the county. Funding is provided from the council's own resources, supplemented by grants. In 2017 the Department allocated €36 million to the council. We have been emphasising to all councils the importance of prioritising expenditure on roads when allocating their own resources, including local property tax receipts. Apart from a requirement that a minimum of 15% of maintenance and renewal grants be expended on regional roads, local authorities decide on allocations for regional and local roads in their areas. As such, allocations to individual municipal districts within a county are a matter for the council. Grant allocations for 2018 will be announced early next year and, in line with overall allocations in the capital plan, there will be a significant increase in funding.
#PatBuckley	unknown-#PatBuckley-party	unknown-#PatBuckley-dob	unknown-#PatBuckley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	321	I thank the Minister for his response which shows he is well acquainted with the background to this issue. I congratulate Cork County Council and East Cork Municipal District on the additional works completed in Killeagh and Castlemartyr and the planned improvements between Fermoy and Mallow. The Minister referred to national routes. That is the crux of the issue. As I said, Cork County Council has tried very hard to secure funding for its plans. I accept that moneys are limited and that the Minister has no direct remit when it comes to regional roads. However, some 40% of the traffic passing through County Cork travels this road and thereby encounters the largest chicane of a bottleneck one could ever expect to see. That tonnage is mostly coming from the Whitegate oil refinery, but there is also commuter traffic from the ESB power station, Trabolgan holiday centre and all of the towns and villages that feed into the route. Given these circumstances, will the Minister ensure this project which would alleviate a great deal of hardship for commuters in the area is prioritised? It is on the N25 national route, which is part of the difficulty. Being a regional route, it is the responsibility of Cork County Council and East Cork Municipal District which do not have the funding required to implement the proposal, but it is attached to the national route which is within the remit of TII. If the Minister cannot give me an answer today, I will be happy to follow up with him later. This might seem like a minor issue, but it affects thousands of commuters day in and day out.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	322	I understand the urgency of this matter and the Deputy's frustration at the lack of progress in addressing it. As he knows, nearly all of the moneys available to us for the immediate future are going on repair works and steady-state investment. It will be 2019 or beyond before moneys will be used for new projects which, although equally important, simply cannot be funded at this time. On the slip road issue, I understand TII received no formal submission from Cork County Council. TII's position on funding for the proposal was advised to the council during the course of discussions between officials of TII and the council. TII's view is that the proposal to construct a slip road feeder lane is a development-led matter and, accordingly, funding for any such project should be provided by way of an appropriate development contribution rather than from the limited Exchequer funding available to TII for the national road network. I accept the urgency of the matter, but the Deputy must accept that there is very little funding available and, given that constraint, the priority must be safety above the easing of congestion. Traffic congestion is a very serious problem, but I am pressing TII to focus on safety in view of the extraordinary and unacceptably high number of road deaths. I will be perfectly happy to discuss the matter with the Deputy in private and to raise it with TII.
#AlanFarrell	unknown-#AlanFarrell-party	unknown-#AlanFarrell-dob	unknown-#AlanFarrell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	323	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter. The Minister is very much aware of the particular requirements of commuters on the north side of Dublin. For several years there have been serious capacity problems along the northern commuter line which extends as far as the Border and they continue to get worse. Although additional capacity is urgently required, I understand Iarnród Éireann is not in a position to extend existing services beyond what it already has done. As part of the capital plan announced in 2015, I was pleased to see included an undertaking to extend the DART beyond its current finishing point at Malahide to Balbriggan, with a view to eventually electrifying the entire north-eastern commuter line. It is vital that the necessary funding and resources be put into delivering on that commitment. This afternoon, however, I have received a letter from Mr. Hugh Creegan, deputy chief executive officer of the National Transport Authority, which acknowledges that not much work has been done on electrification, particularly on the northern commuter line. This is very disappointing, particularly as I was informed heretofore that the project would proceed to planning before the end of the year. It is beyond me why my previous overtures on this matter, pointing out that the project was not being given much attention, as Mr. Creegan now acknowledges, were ignored. The other major transport infrastructure to be delivered in my constituency is the metro north project. It was due to proceed to planning, or at least public consultation, in the fourth quarter of 2017. We are now in December and there is no public consultation process. I read a newspaper article yesterday which made reference to a public space on St. Stephen's Green, but no additional information was provided on what the transport authorities were doing to ensure timely delivery of these essential projects. If the DART project is delayed by 12 months or, more likely, two years, we are looking at 2021 before the four-year plan, construct and build process, as outlined in the national capital plan, will commence. As a daily user of the DART, I often travel on trains after 9 a.m. that are absolutely jammed leaving Malahide and do not get into the city until 10 a.m. That is incredibly frustrating, particularly for commuters further down the line. I appeal to the Minister to allocate the necessary resources to deliver these projects. The capital plan is being reviewed and additional funding provided for it. I cannot think of a better use for that additional funding than for the purpose of accelerating the delivery of the DART extension project.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	324	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. He cannot think of a better project to put funding into, but the problem is that there are many competing projects and, in each case, its advocates think there is no better plan.They are all urgent and not every one of them can be fulfilled immediately. The Deputy's points were well made, however, and there is a crying need for a lot of the transport to which he referred. In the meantime, we will have to continue with the programme we have outlined and we have agreed to give increased capital to projects in the north and south of Dublin as part of the new capital plan. The Government's budgetary framework for capital investment, as set out in Building on Recovery: Infrastructure and Capital Investment 2016-2021, was reviewed earlier this year in the context of the mid-term review of capital priorities, delivery and funding. Following this work, budget 2018 increased the multi-annual capital investment funding envelopes for the coming four-year period, including providing an enhanced capital envelope of €2.7 billion for public transport investment between 2018 and 2021, including funding of about €230 million for mainline rail and DART capacity enhancement. This will enable acceleration of the initial stages of the overall DART expansion programme, focusing particularly at this stage on providing additional fleet to enhance capacity and on extending the electrified DART system. Specifically, it will allow substantial progress on electrification of the northern rail line as far as Balbriggan and the Maynooth line. The NTA’s transport strategy for the greater Dublin area, GDA, 2016-35 proposes implementation of the DART expansion programme. The original cost of the overall DART expansion programme, including the DART underground tunnel element, was estimated at €4 billion of which €3 billion was in respect of the tunnel as originally designed. The Government decided in September 2015 that the original proposal for the tunnel should be redesigned to provide a lower-cost solution. I understand the NTA's work on this is expected to be completed soon. Notwithstanding funding constraints over the past few years, a major upgrading of the city centre re-signalling programme was progressed and is well advanced to completion. Furthermore, limited design work has been carried out on electrification of the northern line to Balbriggan. Following the additional funding announced as a result of the capital plan review, it is intended to reactivate the design and planning work for this project during 2018. At this stage it is not possible to be prescriptive on the construction commencement date as this can only be finalised following the completion of initial design work. However, it is likely to be 2021 before building work starts, subject to receipt of necessary statutory planning approval. Planning consent is likely to be sought during 2020. The overall DART expansion programme has been assessed by the NTA as a positive project from an economic perspective and its advice is that the programme is essential for efficient transport in the GDA region and nationally. The programme is an important key to delivering an efficient transport system. When fully implemented, the enhancements to the heavy rail system provided for in the NTA's transport strategy will create a full metropolitan area DART network for Dublin, with all lines connected. This integrated rail network will provide the core high-capacity transit system for the region and deliver a substantial increase in peak-hour capacity on all lines from Drogheda, Maynooth, Hazelhatch and Greystones. I am advised that the NTA, in conjunction with Irish Rail, continues to examine short, medium and long-term options for increased demand and the associated requirement for rolling stock investment. The expanded rail network on the northern line will be supported by a core regional bus network incorporating routes from Balbriggan and Skerries. The BusConnects programme, recently announced by the NTA, is a transformative investment package that will finance new and expanded bus routes and greatly improve bus access through and around the capital and I secured funding of over €750 million in the budget to progress the programme. My top priority over the next few years is to increase investment in public transport rapidly while also increasing public transport services for the greater Dublin area and around the country.

It was announced in 2015 and there was a four-year delivery plan but the Minister's response suggests it will be at least two years late in being delivered and I am very disappointed by that. I commend the Minister and the Minister for Finance for the additional resources that have been allocated to the transport projects identified in the capital plan but I am disappointed about this one because it is crucial for the northern commuter line. It provides those living in the northern towns in County Dublin with additional options to get them out of their cars and keep them out. A recent transport assessment identified that Dublin city will require an additional 40 multi-storey car park facilities in a relatively short period in the absence of the delivery of key transport infrastructure, in particular on the north side of Dublin, in the form of DART services and the electrification of the northern and Maynooth lines. It is imperative that the NTA and TII deliver on what has been promised in the national capital plan for transport services across the State. I commend the additional funding but I sincerely hope we will have no further slippage on this particular project. There is chronic overcrowding on an awful lot of services on the northern commuter lines, such that mainline diesel trains arrive in Malahide already full and this is the first stop that overlaps the DART. It is well and good for people around the first couple of stations to get into the city at peak times but for everybody else it is a chronic problem and the knock-on effect is significant. 
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	326	I share the Deputy's impatience but I do not have the kind of cheque book I would need to sort out this problem immediately. I ask him to accept that we have made serious commitments, not just in respect of the DART underground but in respect of Metro north, of which the Deputy will be aware, and the Luas which was an expensive project that will be opened this Saturday. The additional resources are committed and I do not think there will be any further slippage. Next year may be a little bit slow but the BusConnects project and others will - not immediately but in time - relieve the problems to which the Deputy refers. He must not doubt that the Government is committed to this capital plan. The face of transport in Dublin in the next decade will be transformed in a way of which we can all be proud, particularly on the north side.
#JohnBrassil	unknown-#JohnBrassil-party	unknown-#JohnBrassil-dob	unknown-#JohnBrassil-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	327	I will cut straight to the chase. This is the second time I have raised this as a topical issue. The last time was in March and the battle has continued. In September the drug Respreeza was made available by its company for six months but the administration and distribution were not agreed. There were 21 patients but there are now only 19 as two have tragically passed away. I say this with a heavy heart but I feel the Oireachtas, the HSE and the Minister have failed this patient cohort. There has been intensive lobbying and I acknowledge that the Minister took calls and had meetings with me on this matter. On Saturday night the HSE agreed to fund the administration of the drug for the next six months but it stated that it had agreed to a six-month transition in the interests of patient safety to allow patients to transition to alternative care arrangements. If there were alternative care arrangements for these patients they would have been on them a long time ago. This drug has been life-changing for the 21 patients to whom I referred. It defies all logic for people to continue to make the argument that it does not work. Two patients have passed away in five weeks without this drug and another patient is seriously ill in hospital as we speak. I hope his recovery will be promoted by the reintroduction of the drug. A fourth patient in Kerry is showing serious signs of deterioration of health and a fifth, who had not received an antibiotic for three years, is now back on antibiotics. I cannot be convinced that this drug does not work - it does work.If the Minister does not want to fund it, he should state that he does not want to because he does not have the money. I ask him to stop making the argument that the drug does not work. It most certainly does.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	328	The Minister is aware of my views on this issue. I have spoken with him and raised it numerous different ways with the HSE and with his office. I spoke about orphan drugs at a committee. Last Friday was, for personal reasons, probably one of the angriest days of my life in politics. I was quite upset. A neighbour of mine, Marion Kelly, passed away. She was one of the two people who Deputy Brassil spoke about. Marion had been in my office numerous times. I knew her. She was an absolute lady. My point is that she was not given the best chance. We are not necessarily saying that if they were on this drug continuously, Marion or possibly the other lady up in Donegal would not have passed away, but that the body politic and the health system are letting these people down. These two people have been let down. Marion is a neighbour of mine, originally from Puckaun, who lived in Nenagh. She was an absolute lady, loved by her locality. The people of the locality feel that she did not get the best chance to continue, leaving her daughter, her grandchildren and her family behind. She died quite suddenly. No one can tell me that it is fair for somebody to be on Respreeza for 11 years and then, through the politics of health - it is political, whatever side one is on, whether the Department of Health, the HSE or the drug company - for the hope that these 21 people have been given, with 60 more people in total affected by alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency, to then be taken away. Suddenly, after Marion passed away, the HSE issued a statement at the weekend that it will administer the drug for a period of time. There is no alternative. Marion used to be in hospital seven or eight times a year. That went down to once or twice a year. The health benefits are obvious. We are talking about €84,000 a year. She put up a petition on Facebook, fighting for her life, asking people to support her. I supported her as much as I could. The ultimate issue here is that the health system and health politics let her down. Her legacy needs to mean something. I know that from her family. We need to intervene for all other alpha-1 antitrypsin deficiency patients and those others coming down the line. These costs are not exorbitant. I do not want a situation where this will continue. We cannot say that there is causation and that these two ladies passed away because of the five or six weeks they were off the drugs. The facts are that they were able to survive for 11 years using this drug and that both passed away in a very short window of time. Please bear that in mind.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	329	I thank Deputies Brassil and Kelly for raising this issue, not just on the floor of the Dáil but on many occasions over the last number of weeks and months and for keeping in close contact with me directly on the matter. Like both Deputies, I express my deepest sympathies to the families of the patients who have recently passed away and offer my condolences and, I am sure, all our condolences at this difficult time. I cannot begin to imagine what those families must be going through. As the House will be aware, a number of patients had been on a Respreeza access scheme operated by the manufacturer for a number of years until that company decided abruptly earlier this year to end the scheme for all patients on 30 September 2017. This access scheme was not one which had been established with the HSE's involvement. It had been directly established by the company. Nonetheless, I asked the HSE to satisfy itself that arrangements were put in place for the continued appropriate care of the patients concerned. I asked the HSE for the appropriate care because I am not a clinician and it is the responsibility of the health service to ensure there is appropriate care, and the HSE then engaged with the company over a number of weeks. I understand that the company agreed to continue to supply the medication free of charge for the patients who had been on the access scheme for a further period of six months, or until a further clinical trial commences next year. However, the company was not willing to continue to cover the cost of administering the medicine to these patients. The HSE, having considered all the circumstances, has decided to facilitate a transition arrangement under which it will fund the provision of the necessary nursing service to ensure that the treatment of patients can resume. I have often been critical of the HSE but I will say on the record of this House that I have seen the HSE work extraordinarily hard to try to come up with innovative solutions. It has sought meetings with the company to engage with it over a sustained period. The Health Service Executive did Trojan work to try to put in place an arrangement to get this drug flowing to patients again. I deeply regret the circumstances that happened in the intervening period. The new transition arrangements will facilitate the immediate resumption of the administration of the drug to the affected patients and will continue until a further clinical trial commences in 2018. The company anticipates that approximately half of the current compassionate access group of patients will be recruited into the next clinical trial in 2018. The terms under which the HSE has agreed to fund the administration of the drug include a requirement that the lead clinician concerned ensures that appropriate alternative treatment regimes are put in place in good time for those patients not proceeding to the next trial. The HSE has agreed to fund the nursing service to administer the drug during the next six months because the company firmly refused to fund further administration of the drug in the period to mid-2018 when the next trial is due to begin. However, factually and legally, that decision does not in any way alter the position regarding the HSE's formal decision not to reimburse Respreeza. I assure Deputy Brassil that the Health (Pricing and Supply of Medical Goods) Act 2013 gives the HSE the power to decide whether or not to fund a drug and its drugs group comprises ten clinicians. This is looked at from a wide range of areas. The HSE has previously considered the pricing and reimbursement of Respreeza through its decision-making process. I would say to the company and the HSE that they should not squander these six months and should continue to engage further. It is open to the company to produce more evidence, more information and to negotiate further. That is what should happen. We should not have a company that has total ownership of the access scheme with no HSE involvement ending the scheme in an abrupt manner, leaving Irish patients high and dry. I do not want to engage in the blame game against the company or the HSE, since the matter is too important, but the company has obligations as well as the HSE. I am pleased that arrangements have been made to resume treatment for patients which will allow a safe period of time but my appeal today is not to waste that time and to ensure there is further engagement with the company and HSE, and I will work with colleagues on this.
#JohnBrassil	unknown-#JohnBrassil-party	unknown-#JohnBrassil-dob	unknown-#JohnBrassil-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	330	I agree the six month period cannot be wasted but there is a potential for another trial and for half the patients to be facilitated. That means that half will not be facilitated. Can the Minister imagine the mindset of the ten or so patients who may not get on to a trial, having seen what happened to their two colleagues, Anna and Marion, in the last few weeks, and the sort of effect that has on their well-being? The company has not performed with glory here, nor has the HSE, nor have any of us but the fact is that it is our job to look after the citizens of this country. In whatever objective analysis one looks at, patients were on a drug, being maintained, having a quality of life and two people passed away within five weeks of the drug not being administered, with another hospitalised, another extremely unwell and another back on antibiotics. That sort of evidence speaks for itself. I want to get away from who is right and who is wrong. Whether we like it or not, the HSE has, in the interests of patient safety and well-being, agreed to administer this drug. It is in the system now and it is up to us to solve it so we do not come back here in six months with the same pleadings, the same Topical Issue matter and the same health issues that these patients could run into. We should have a solution in that six month period. I plead with the Minister to set himself a deadline for the HSE and company to have this resolved before the six month period has elapsed.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	331	I accept everything the Minister said but, to be honest with him, the families and those involved do not and cannot accept it. It is nothing personal, but they cannot. They do not care about this inter-wrangling or the politics involved. I agree with the Minister about the drug company's behaviour. I assume the HSE is doing its best. I accept all of that. However, these people do not care. These 21 people know one another. Two of them have passed away during this little window of time. It is quite obvious that others are affected. I knew this lady and I know her family. They want this to stop. They want her passing to be in some way a spark that will ensure the rest of the people are kept on the drug, that it is administered and that the process by which this drug can be approved happens. I know the process, which we have gone through in committee, the NCPE, the HSE's decision-making process, the toing and froing and all of that, but we all also know that other drugs have been approved. This is a modest amount of money for a small group of people who deserve better. They do not care about whether it is the drug company, the HSE, the Department or anyone in this Chamber who achieves it because all they want is a solution so that they can plan their lives in some form of quality way. Please help them do it.
#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	332	I agree with both Deputies that the patients deserve better. I do not think anyone could disagree. It is important to note, first, that everyone is back on the drug in the sense that the drug is being supplied. I reiterate my absolute sympathy to the families of the two people who have passed away. This trial was and is a clinical trial by the company and while it is this drug today it will be another drug next week. It is this group of patients today but it will be another group of patients next week. There are rule books and there are ethical ways for a company to engage. For a company to set up a clinical trial completely independent of the health service in any country and then abruptly end it, saying that is it for those patients, is not the way to treat patients who help develop its drug and product which ultimately makes it a profit. That is not just my view. There is also the Helsinki declaration. There has to be rules of engagement in terms of how a company behaves ethically in this country. I appreciate that both Deputies agree with that. I also appreciate that it does not help the patient sitting at home today, wondering if he or she will be on the drug in six months' time. As far as I can tell, it is unprecedented for the HSE to take this step and fund the nurse administration. They are doing so, recognising the seriousness of the situation. I reiterate that there is now a period of time available and that I would like the drug company and the HSE to engage to try to find a way forward that will provide certainty and clarity for that patient group. I will undertake to continue to liaise with Deputies Kelly and Brassil. I ask that as much focus, effort and responsibility is placed on the drug company as is on the HSE because it takes two parties to result in a successful negotiation.

I understand the Government is supporting the motion, which is very welcome, but we need to see the motion supported not just in words in this Chamber, as often happens, but in action in 2018. I also acknowledge and pay tribute to the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which has campaigned so tirelessly for investment in neurorehabilitation services. Some of those involved in the alliance are in the Gallery today. In particular, I want to highlight the contribution of the alliance's executive director, Mags Rogers. Well done to her. It is a good name. Many Members of this House have met those involved in the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and will agree that they make a very strong and compelling case. I am happy to have the opportunity to bring that case to Dáil Éireann. The World Health Organization in a 2004 report on neurological conditions described them as the greatest public health challenge facing public health systems in developed countries worldwide. The WHO has also stated that an estimated 6.8 million people die every year as a result of neurological disorders. In Europe, the economic cost of neurological diseases was estimated at approximately €139 billion in 2004. According to the WHO:Because most of the neurological disorders result in long-term disability and many have an early age of onset, measures of prevalence and mortality vastly understate the disability they cause. Pain is a significant symptom in several neurological disorders and adds significantly to emotional suffering and disability. Even burden estimates combining mortality and disability do not take into account the suffering and social and economic losses affecting patients, their families and the community. The socioeconomic demands of care, treatment and rehabilitation put a strain on entire families, seriously diminishing their productivity and quality of life.We see that in Ireland, with some 25,000 people each year struggling to access neurorehabilitation services. It is estimated that only one in six people who need specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland can access them. There has been a persistent lack of investment in neurorehabilitation services down through the years. As a country, we have fewer than half the number of specialist rehabilitation beds recommended for a population of our size. Furthermore, we have the lowest number of consultants in rehabilitation medicine in Europe. Where services do exist, they are undeveloped, under-resourced and sporadic across the country. This is preventing people from accessing the services they need to support their recovery. For example, there is still no dedicated specialist medical rehabilitation unit for people with neurological disabilities in the south of Ireland. Such a lack of neurorehabilitation services is having a debilitating impact on people’s lives. People with neurological conditions are spending significantly more time in hospital than is necessary. They often live in unsuitable settings and lead lives of exclusion and isolation. They are also often forced to travel abroad to get the services they need. The motion we are putting forward is calling for the investment necessary to make our neurorehabilitation services fit for purpose. It calls for dedicated, multi-annual investment in forthcoming budgets and the publication of an implementation plan for the neurorehabilitation strategy. It also calls for the establishment of dedicated community neurorehabilitation teams across Ireland and investment to target a reduction in waiting lists for such services. The national policy and strategy for neurorehabilitation services 2011 to 2015 was published by the Department of Health and the Health Service Executive almost six years ago on 16 December 2011, with an implementation plan promised within six months. Six years on, this four-year plan still has no implementation strategy. Last February, the Minister for Health requested an implementation plan to be published by the end of June 2017, yet a working group to develop the plan has not been put together. This is the second deadline announced and missed in 2017 as the HSE will not deliver the plan by the end of this year. There is great frustration about the situation, as can be imagined, and this frustration is compounded by the absence of any real progress in the provision of services. In 2015, the Neurological Alliance of Ireland in collaboration with the national clinical programme for neurology carried out a survey of neurology services and over two years later the findings are still relevant. The survey found key deficits in staffing across all 11 neurology centres, with little or no access to multidisciplinary teams in Sligo, Limerick and Waterford.There was a lack of dedicated beds, with only six of 11 centres having dedicated neurology beds. These beds were frequently required for other specialties within the hospital and not available for neurology. There were unacceptable waiting lists. Waiting lists for MRI scanning are a significant problem, with seven centres having waiting lists of a year or more. There was a critical lack of neurorehabilitation services. Eight of the centres reported limited or very limited access to hospital-based neurorehabilitation services, while ten of the 11 centres reported limited or very limited access to neurorehabilitation services in the community. Four of the 11 hospitals reported no dedicated occupational therapy services for neurology patients. Five neurology centres reported no dedicated speech and language therapist for neurology patients. Five neurology centres reported no dedicated medical social worker for neurology patients, including Cork University Hospital, which is one of the two national centres in Ireland. Only Beaumont and Tallaght Hospitals had dedicated neuropsychology services available to patients. Within these centres, waiting lists can be up to one year. Sligo hospital reported no dedicated posts for any of the core supporting therapies of occupational therapy, speech and language therapy, physiotherapy and neuropsychology. The regional centres of Limerick and Waterford also reported very limited access to dedicated health professional staffing. Every hospital group exceeded the ratio for consultant neurologists for our population. No centre has MRI access for routine referrals in under two months and seven of the 11 neurology centres cannot even gain access within one year of referral. These are serious deficits by any measurement. How do we address them? In 2011, when the National Policy and Strategy for Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland was being published, by coincidence the Association of British Neurologists detailed its recommended requirements for neurology services. The recommended ratio is for one consultant neurologist per 70,000 of population. This is exceeded within every hospital group. In one hospital group in the mid-west, the ratio is 1:200,000, which is almost three times what is recommended. At the bare minimum, there should be one dedicated specialist neurorehabilitation team in each of the nine community health organisation areas. Only three such teams are in place, however, and they are not even fully staffed. Not one new team has been put in place since the neurorehabilitation strategy was published six year ago. The demand for neurorehabilitation services is growing, with our ageing population and with increased survival rates of people with neurological disability, but services are completely insufficient to meet current needs. The lack of neurorehabilitation services is resulting in unnecessary disability and an inability to live life to the full in the community. To optimise the gains for individuals, neurorehabilitation services must be provided on a timely basis and in a seamless fashion by a range of providers using a multidisciplinary approach. The uneven nature of the current service is such that people lose gains they make at another stage of the pathway if they cannot move seamlessly from one service to the next. Many people with a neurological disability end up in nursing homes but residents in nursing homes cannot access community neurorehabilitation services. This is despite evidence that the provision of neurorehabilitation in nursing homes can improve outcomes, including the rate of discharge to home. The lack of neurorehabilitation services is a major factor in our emergency department crisis and delayed discharges, with the National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine noting that the lack of neurorehabilitation services is responsible for more than one in ten delayed discharges. The National Clinical Programme for Rehabilitation Medicine has stated the following benefits could be delivered as a result of investment in specialist rehabilitation services in both the hospital and community for patients with neurorehabilitation needs: a reduced length of stay in acute hospitals by five days; a 10% reduction in readmission rates; a 5% reduction in care requirements; and a reduction in the discharge rate to nursing homes. I will conclude to allow my colleagues to contribute.
#MaryButler	unknown-#MaryButler-party	unknown-#MaryButler-dob	unknown-#MaryButler-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	334	The demand for neurorehabilitation services is growing owing to our ageing population and increased survival rates for people with neurological disability. Services are completely insufficient to meet the current needs of people with neurological illnesses such as dementia, however. I compliment my colleague, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, on bringing forward this motion to highlight the need for investment in neurological health care services in the coming years. This motion is being introduced in co-operation with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. Every day in this country, 11 people are diagnosed with dementia. In 2016, 55,000 people were diagnosed with it. That figure is set to triple in the next 30 years. This is a significant public health challenge and one that will require the Government to plan and prepare immediately if it is to have the adequate services in place. In 20 years, there will be over 1 million people aged over 65. Of those, approximately 350,000 will be aged over 80. This will be a significant challenge for our health system. As co-chairman of the all-party group on dementia, I believe we need to recognise that an increasing number of people will be living with dementia for long periods of their lives. How society includes them and cares for them will demonstrate our country's determination to be both inclusive and compassionate in how we care for our elderly citizens. I am deeply concerned over the increase in the number of older people acting as carers for loved ones and relatives. According to the last census, from 2011 to 2016 there was an increase in this number in the order of 18.5%. There are now 29,000 people aged over 65 providing care for loved ones. It is absolutely unbelievable that people over 65 are providing care for their loved ones. It is clear to me from my work on the ground in Waterford and in my engagements with a variety of older persons' organisations that older people are just not receiving adequate supports. There are not enough home help hours or respite supports and there is limited access to the fair deal scheme, meaning that the responsibility for providing care to people with neurological diseases is being passed on to spouses and other relatives. We all saw the programme last night on carers. It really brought what is happening home to us all. Carers, without doubt, are some of the country's unsung heroes. They step in when the State is unable to provide care and support. This is happening all too often. We have a responsibility to ensure that the needs of those with complex neurological diseases are met. Where possible, we must also ensure the State provides the services their loved ones require. People with neurological conditions face a huge struggle. More often than not, the struggle is increased when the correct supports are not in place. The key to adequate care is funding. This is a field of medicine that has unfortunately suffered from a lack of investment over the years. This needs to change if neurology services are to be up to standard in meeting the future needs of the country.
#JamesBrowne	unknown-#JamesBrowne-party	unknown-#JamesBrowne-dob	unknown-#JamesBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	335	I commend my fellow Deputies, Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and Billy Kelleher, for their work in this area. I commend Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony for introducing the motion. Every year, 25,000 Irish people struggle to access neurorehabilitation services. Estimates suggest that only one in six people who need rehabilitation services actually receives such treatment. I refer to crucial treatments that prevent disability, support recovery and make it easier to overcome hurdles when facing treatment for stroke, multiple sclerosis, Parkinson's disease and many other disorders. Fianna Fáil's motion captures why neurorehabilitation services must be enshrined within forthcoming HSE budgets. There is a continued failure to understand the need for an holistic response to neurorehabilitation needs. Despite the publication of the neurorehabilitation strategy in 2011, neurorehabilitation services are lacking in six of the country's nine community health organisations. Inaction following the publication of the neurorehabilitation strategy has a negative impact on people with neurological disabilities who grapple with unnecessary barriers. In my constituency, Wexford, there is no dedicated community neurorehabilitation team. There are insufficient post-acute rehabilitation beds and there is a striking lack of dedicated respite, long-term care and home care for people with neurological conditions. With such sparse resources, it is crystal clear that there is a lack of supports at every juncture for a person with a neurological condition. Without local supports, there is a limit placed on the ability of patients to live to their full potential within their communities. Some people with neurological conditions may be forced to live in inappropriate settings, such as nursing homes or psychiatric facilities, when they should be cared for in more appropriate ones. Not only does this limit a person's ability to recover from a neurological disability but it can also lead to mental health difficulties and challenges. The lack of services is forcing people with neurological conditions to lead lives of exclusion and isolation, separated from their communities, families and friends.This motion demands the investment required to bring the nation's neurorehabilitation services up to speed with international standards, including those in my county of Wexford.
#BillyKelleher	unknown-#BillyKelleher-party	unknown-#BillyKelleher-dob	unknown-#BillyKelleher-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	336	The Irish Heart Foundation is a member of the Neurological Alliance and the foundation has been advocating on the need to develop stroke services across the country. Access to stroke unit care is estimated to reduce mortality and severe disability from strokes by approximately 25%. The Irish Heart Foundation, in conjunction with the HSE national stroke audit 2015, found that just 29% of stroke patients were admitted to a unit and only 52% spent any portion of their hospital stay in a dedicated stroke unit. In addition, almost one in four hospitals in Ireland treating stroke do not meet the minimum organisational standards required to operate a stroke unit. It also found that no hospital in Ireland meets minimum stroke unit staffing requirements set down by the European Stroke Organisation, with deficits of 30% in nursing, 50% for physiotherapists, 61% for occupational therapists, 69% for clinical nutritionists and 31% for speech and language therapists, while only 44% of hospitals have access to a medical social worker and only 19% have access to a neuropsychologist. By any stretch of the imagination what is required and what is provided are poles apart. There is now a need for us to bring forward the implementation plan of the strategy and to start resourcing and planning ahead in terms of the professional personnel that are needed. When one looks at the dearth of recruitment in those key areas it is clear that we are a long way off addressing what is outlined in the strategy. In planning ahead we must take into account the difficulties with recruitment and start the process of training, recruiting and retaining staff earlier than is currently the case. We have a habit of identifying the need, putting in place the services in terms of capital investment and then starting the recruitment process at the very end when they should be done in tandem with providing the services. The Irish Heart Foundation estimates that approximately one in six stroke deaths could be prevented through the development of a comprehensive national stroke unit network capable of meeting similar targets, with similar reductions in permanent severe disability requiring nursing home care. That point has been highlighted by previous speakers and no doubt others will also bring it up. Many people with an acquired brain injury or stroke are in inappropriate settings. They are in nursing homes or in poor accommodation at home without the proper supports. We need to look at how we care for people, not only in the context of the immediate needs but the longer term care as well. Putting stroke victims into nursing homes without the proper supports and services does nobody a service. The rehabilitative, recuperative process is very much diminished and the impact on the individuals concerned is very negative. That has been highlighted consistently in all the reports that have been published. There are copious amounts of empirical evidence not only in Ireland but elsewhere that early intervention in terms of rehabilitation has very positive outcomes for stroke patients. I commend the motion to the House.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	337	I thank and commend Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony for raising this very important topic and motion. I welcome the opportunity to state the Government's commitment to the publication of a plan for advancing neurorehabilitation services in the community, which is included in a Programme for a Partnership Government. Hence, the Government decided not to oppose the motion. I think we are all in agreement that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and his or her family. The care and support needs of patients are individualised and varied. The Health Service Executive, HSE, social care division and the HSE clinical programme and strategy division are working in tandem to progress the implementation of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services. The HSE has established a national steering group to develop an implementation framework for the strategy. Following a consultation process in 2016, the HSE has reconstituted the national steering group to ensure that the implementation framework takes a collaborative and holistic approach. The HSE national steering group is now comprises representatives across the whole health system, including heads of social care and the national clinical programme for rehabilitation medicine, acute hospital services, mental health, primary care, health and well-being, public health, health and social care professionals and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. I welcome the involvement of the Neurological Alliance of Ireland in the national steering group. I welcome Mags Rogers and the team to the Dáil today. Their work, and the work of their member organisations, has been vital in raising awareness of the need for neurorehabilitation services. It is important to note that the focus of the HSE national steering group is to develop a framework which is implementable across the entire country. The steering group considers that a managed clinical rehabilitation network model represents best practice as a means of providing neurorehabilitation services. To test the feasibility of this model, the steering group is developing a demonstration project pilot site to establish collaborative care pathways for people with complex neurorehabilitation care and support or accommodation needs. A working group has been established to support the demonstration project pilot site. The working group has drafted both terms of reference and an implementation framework. The National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, provides complex specialist rehabilitation services on an inpatient, outpatient and day patient basis to adults and children who have acquired a physical or cognitive disability as a result of an accident, illness or injury and require specialist medical rehabilitation services. I am happy to say that the contracts for development works at the NRH were signed in August last and construction commenced on the site immediately. The construction work is due for completion by the end of 2019 and the new development is expected to be operational in 2020. The development will see the existing ward accommodation at the NRH replaced by a new fit-for-purpose ward accommodation block of 120 single en suite rooms with integrated therapy services; a new sports hall; a hydrotherapy unit; a temporary concourse as well as clinical and ancillary spaces. In addition, links to the existing building will ensure full integration between the new development and the existing hospital on the site. The development will be a major enhancement to rehabilitation services in the country and will have a direct and significant impact on patient recovery, by providing an optimal ward and therapeutic environment for patient treatment in the NRH. Good progress has also been made to reopen beds at the NRH, which were closed to enable the hospital to provide a safe and appropriate level of care to patients from within existing resources. Four beds have reopened since the end of October. The Department of Health has sanctioned €0.65 million towards the cost of reopening a further four beds. The HSE's national service plan for 2017 contains a priority action to "establish an innovative pilot day service aimed at supporting people with severe acquired brain injuries". I am delighted to inform the House that work is well under way to complete the requirements of the service. Stroke represents one of the greatest areas of need for neurorehabilitation care in the Irish health services. The national clinical programme for stroke has been in place since early 2010. It aims to improve quality, access and cost effectiveness of stroke services. Early supported discharge services are recognised internationally as a basic, essential and cost-effective element of acute stroke care. Three pilot sites have demonstrated the effectiveness of early support discharge services in Ireland, including the reduction in delayed discharges, improvement in patient flow and the provision of greater access to stroke unit beds.It is estimated that Ireland has approximately 1,600 major trauma patients each year. These patients have suffered injuries with the potential to cause prolonged disability or death. It is essential for these patients to get the right care in the right place first-time around. The trauma steering group, chaired by Professor Eilis McGovern, was established in 2015 to make recommendations on the development of a trauma system for Ireland. The group completed its final report in July 2017. The report sets out a series of significant and important recommendations, all of which are aimed at significantly reducing death and disability from major trauma. I understand the Minister for Health intends to bring a memorandum to Government on the matter shortly. Although most families would prefer to be able to care for loved ones at home, hospital or nursing home care is at times necessary and form part of the continuum of care. The HSE is mindful of the fact that some people with a disability who are in nursing home care provision wish to, and should be supported to, move back to their home of choice. The HSE, through its network of community health care organisations, is working to facilitate this within available resources. However, nursing home support can also be an appropriate care option where persons concerned have clinically-assessed complex medical and social care needs that require this form of support. The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including personal assistant and home support hours, to support individuals to live as independently as possible. While the resources available for the provision of assisted living services are substantial, they are finite. The HSE is committed to protecting the level of personal assistant and home support hours for people with disabilities, including neurological conditions. In the 2017 national service plan, the HSE expects to deliver 1.4 million personal assistant hours to 2,357 adults with a physical or sensory disability. This is an increase of 100,000 hours on the 2016 target, although I have heard the opposite said in recent comments. The relevant figure is 1.4 million personal assistant hours, an increase of 100,000 hours on the 2016 target. The HSE service target is to provide 2.75 million home support hours to people with disabilities, which is an increase of 180,000 hours on the target for 2017. I am keen to ensure that the best possible services are available for all people with disabilities, including those with neurological illness or injuries. With budget 2018 we have been able to build upon significant existing resources and obtain additional funding for disability services. The allocation for disability services will rise to over €1.76 billion in 2018, which is an increase of €75 million. Of course, we could always do with more - many of my colleagues know that we always say as much. It is intended that the 2018 HSE national service plan, once finalised and approved, will commit to progress the implementation of the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services. Effective rehabilitation draws on a broad range of disciplines to meet the particular needs of individuals, with the object of assisting them to return to their life in the community. The Government, in speaking to the motion, clearly recognises the impact that rehabilitation can play in ensuring that people with neurological conditions can live a life of their choice to the greatest extent possible. I welcome the opportunity to assure Deputies of the Government commitment to bring about real and substantial improvement in the provision of neurorehabilitation services.

Sinn Féin will be supporting the motion. I commend Deputy Murphy O'Mahony on her initiative. I commend the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which I understand was instrumental in its drafting. I imagine there is agreement across the House that we must help those with neurorehabilitation needs to lead full and meaningful lives by giving them quality tailored rehabilitation and support. Unfortunately, as it stands, we could not be further away from such a scenario. Over 25,000 Irish people each year struggle to get the neurorehabilitation services they need to prevent disability and support recovery from conditions, including stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Neurological services are chronically underfunded. Over many years, Sinn Féin has been calling for additional investment in neurological services and has provided for this in each of the party's alternative budgets. We know early intervention ultimately reduces the care needed. Indeed, many studies clearly demonstrate significant cost savings post-rehabilitation. However, we are currently failing to intervene early enough. The National Rehabilitation Hospital is currently the only service provider. It is underfunded and does not have the capacity to deal with the increase in population size and the increase in the number of patients who need neurorehabilitation services at the facility. The NRH is set for a redevelopment, to be completed by late 2019, but that will still not address the lack of capacity as the old hospital will cease offering rehabilitative services. In truth, we are talking about replacement beds not additional beds. The National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015 was published by the Department of Health and the HSE in 2011 with an implementation plan promised within six months. It is now over six years since the strategy was published and an implementation plan has still not been published. Mór ár náire. I understand that representatives from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland have met the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, four times and that on each occasion he has promised that the policy would be implemented by the end of the year in question. It is a cause of great concern, however, to be told that, as of last week, a team to implement this strategy had still not been put in place. Have there been any developments on that front? Despite our support for the motion I wish to put on record our disappointment that there was no mention of all-Ireland co-operation. As my party's health spokesperson over many years, and through my involvement in the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Health and Children, I pushed hard for the provision of an all-island deep brain stimulation service and for collaboration between neurology services in the South and neurosurgery at the Royal Victoria Hospital, Belfast. Such a proposal was endorsed by the committee and was due for roll-out in 2016. I urge Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, to ensure that this vision becomes a reality in the immediate future. The current service is in need of additional resourcing and I acknowledge that this is a responsibility north and south of the Border. The Gavan Quigley and Neil Simms team at the Royal Victoria Hospital have performed a number of implant procedures for people presenting from south of the Border but far more could be done. Battery changing visits make up the greater number of patient throughput. This represents a failure on the part of both Administrations on the island and on the part of neurology services in the State, which continue to look to Britain for patient referrals. The Belfast-based all-Ireland provision of deep brain stimulation services has not and will not reach its true potential unless there is enthusiastic buy-in by all parties, political and otherwise. The Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, should seek and secure a full update report on the DBS service at the Royal Victoria Hospital. The report should include the informed input of Mr. Quigley and Mr. Simms as well as of Professor Tim Lynch at the Dublin Neurological Institute and others who have a direct involvement in or knowledge of this service, including the NAI and other representative voices. I continue to encourage the Neurological Alliance of Ireland and other organisations to consider strongly and push for more North-South co-operation in other neurological areas as there are so many untapped opportunities and potential in all-Ireland approaches. Again, I declare that Sinn Féin will support the motion as tabled. I hope that our collective voices and efforts will secure a much improved resourcing of this singularly valuable service in 2018.
#LouiseOReilly	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-party	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-dob	unknown-#LouiseOReilly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	339	I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and the Neurological Alliance of Ireland for helping to draft the motion and I thank Deputy Murphy O'Mahony for proposing it.This is an extremely important and timely motion. More than a year ago, I raised with the Minister of State the We Need our Heads Examined campaign. While we have heard some fine words in the meantime, unfortunately, precious little action has been taken. As a previous speaker noted, more than 25,000 people struggle each year to access the neurorehabilitation services they need to prevent disability and support recovery from conditions, including stroke, spinal cord injury, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. The gap between demand and capacity for specialist rehabilitation services is ever widening. Unfortunately, the services have not kept pace with developments in the acute sector and now lag behind acute services. As a result, large numbers of patients are discharged from hospital each year with a neurological diagnosis that would benefit from the input of a specialised community neurorehabilitation team but are unable to access rehabilitation services. When I spoke to the Minister of State well over a year ago, I raised the case of Vera Ronan whose daughter, Natalie, became a tireless campaigner with the Neurological Alliance of Ireland when she saw what happened to her mother after she was left in a hospital bed without the support and services she needed. It is unacceptable that Vera Ronan was taking up a hospital bed, while others waited in the emergency department. There are patients like her all over the country who could have their needs more appropriately served outside the hospital environment if there was sufficient capacity in the system to facilitate this. We must, as a matter of urgency, move to deliver more neurorehabilitation services in a community setting. We must stop the unfair practice of inappropriately discharging patients to nursing home care settings. Many of those in nursing homes should not be there and require services to help them to live the best possible lives in their own homes and communities, rather than in an inappropriate setting. The unfortunate reality is that people with neurological conditions spend significantly more time in hospital than is necessary. We all agree on the need for a person-centred, co-ordinated approach to patient care, with co-ordinated case management of patients, leading to improved patient outcomes and experiences. The development of appropriately resourced interdisciplinary inpatient, outpatient and home and community based specialist rehabilitation teams supported by education and training is required. Furthermore, waiting times for assessment and access to inpatient and community rehabilitation services and standardised pathways for people who require neurorehabilitation must be reduced. In the absence of a guarantee that these services will be provided, we will continue to pay lip service to the problem.  The Minister of State referred to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. The redevelopment of the hospital will not offer a panacea. The redevelopment project which is due for completion in 2019 will not address the lack of capacity because the old hospital will cease offering rehabilitative services. The Neurological Alliance of Ireland and a number of speakers made good suggestions which must be given careful consideration.

Dementia, Alzheimer's disease, stroke, Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis and epilepsy are just some of the neurological disorders with which most Deputies will be familiar. Most of us know someone, whether a family member, friend or colleague, who has been tragically affected by one or other of these neurological disorders. Behind the suffering of the individual lies the major challenge that husbands, wives, mothers, fathers, families and friends must face. Families are often faced with immediate, intensely emotional and practical demands. There is the sudden shocking realisation that everything has changed and families find themselves facing major readjustments in their previously normal lives. The individual with the neurological disorder and his or her family face great uncertainties. Both face the life-changing prospect of having to manage a chronic, lifelong condition. Carers face the prospect of a lower quality of life, sleep deprivation, constant pressure and strains on relationships. Carers and sufferers face the prospect of social isolation, stress and coping difficulties, especially when resources and supports to ease their burden are absent. It is unfortunate that community services are insufficient and fragmented. There is an excessive reliance on voluntary funding, particularly following cuts in funding for special needs assistance, home care packages and so forth. Residential and respite care facilities have also been reduced, leading to a dependence on home carers. However, with family structures becoming increasingly complex in modern Ireland, fewer families are in a position to take on the burden of caring for a family member at home. We have had a plethora of legislation, strategies and proposals. Quality and Fairness: A Health Strategy for All was published in 2001. The Disability Act was introduced in 2005. The Listen to Carers report was published in 2008. The National Carers' Strategy: Recognised, Supported, Empowered was published in 2012. The Assisted Decision-Making (Capacity) Act was introduced in 2015 and we also had the National Policy and Strategy for the Provision of Neuro-Rehabilitation Services in Ireland 2011-2015. Despite all of this work and the many aspirations set out in the various Acts and documents, implementation of many of the key strategies and proposals has been absent or incomplete.
#DavidCullinane	unknown-#DavidCullinane-party	unknown-#DavidCullinane-dob	unknown-#DavidCullinane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	341	It is estimated that between 10,000 and 13,000 people survive and live with a brain injury each year. People with acquired brain injuries are the largest users of neurorehabilitation services in Ireland, yet these services are severely underfunded. According to the organisation Acquired Brain Injury Ireland, neurorehabilitation enables people with a brain injury to recover and relearn skills to achieve their potential and start to lead their lives again. Neurorehabilitation combines specialised clinical and social care supports and is based on an agreed pathway of care. It is personalised, individualised and evidenced based. Following a brain injury, rehabilitation should be available as a basic right, not on the basis of a postcode lottery. When a person acquires a brain injury as a result of a fall, an assault, an accident, a stroke or a tumour, he or she needs to relearn the skills of life. Depending on what part of the brain has been injured and the extent of the injury, the person will have to live with different consequences, many of which will be hidden. They may range from physical, sensory and cognitive impairment to psychological and emotional issues. There is limited recognition in current health policy of people with acquired brain injury as a distinctive group with unique rehabilitation requirements. This must change. As a result of the lack of policy attention and focus, too many people with an acquired brain injury live in highly inappropriate settings such as nursing homes for older people, community hospitals and acute hospitals. In the absence of acquired brain injury services in the community, families struggle to cope. The problem is further compounded if the person with the acquired brain injury is less than 18 years of age because services for young people with an acquired brain injury are almost non-existent. Having a serious brain injury is totally life-altering for the person and his or her family. It has significant social and economic consequences for the individual, his or her family and society as a whole. However, life can be made much better following a brain injury if the person has timely access to the range of services he or she needs. I commend the authors of the motion which I obviously support. All of us want increased investment in the heath service, including in services to support people with acquired brain injuries. The appropriate time to allocate the necessary resources is at budget time. I hope, therefore, that the Government will allocate sufficient resources in next year's budget to provide appropriate settings and the care required by people with an acquired brain injury.
#GinoKenny	unknown-#GinoKenny-party	unknown-#GinoKenny-dob	unknown-#GinoKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	342	I support the motion. I commend Deputy Murphy O'Mahony on it. It reads well, but is shocking. It is an indictment, not only on neurological services in Ireland but the health service in general. Many Members in this Chamber have been vocal about how health apartheid is rampant in the health service. One sees people who must struggle every day for basic health services. Some of the pointers on the motion are incredible. For example, it refers to the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities, which I raised with the Minister of State on Topical Issues. Ireland signed that 11 years ago and it still has not been ratified. That is a bad start. It also states that 25,000 Irish people each year struggle to access neurorehabilitation services in Ireland. These services are critical for early intervention, which is key to somebody recovering as quickly as possible. I would like also draw attention to the provision of home-care services for neurorehabilitation. That is essential and should be provided in tandem as part of somebody's rehabilitation. I could go on for ever about the lack of services for those with a neurological condition. These conditions range from somebody with epilepsy to somebody recovering from a stroke. There are myriad conditions. We must address those issues, particularly around home care because those who have a condition essentially do not want to be in acute hospitals or nursing homes. Sometimes they want to be at home getting back to their lives they had previously. One can talk in flowery language about the health service in this country. I do not want to be a prophet of doom - sometimes that is easy here - but there is something fundamentally wrong in a society that does not take care of those who find themselves sick not of their making where the health service cannot look after them. It is a terrible indictment, not only of the Dáil but of society. What it comes down to - I do not know whether the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, will agree but there is probably a consensus in this place - is that once there is a two-tier health system, one will always have inequality in it. If one had a one-tier health service, regardless of whether one was a millionaire or somebody on social welfare through no fault of their own, one would at least have greater equality when it comes to the health service and the services that it provides. A two-tier health system leads to exactly what is stated in the motion. One has all these grave inequalities when it comes to people accessing services. Sometimes it is embarrassing to state that one is from Ireland when one sees some of the contents of the motion. It is an embarrassment and yet this is a wealthy country. If one has money in one's pocket or one is wealthy, one can get services but if one is poor or working class, one is at the bottom. That is fundamentally wrong in any society. This is a good motion. It throws up a good debate about the lack of neurological services for those who really need them who, as I stated previously, have conditions not of their making - the conditions have probably chosen them. When they need that help, society should provide them with their needs and if we do not provide it, it is a terrible indictment, not only of this place but of society as a whole.

I know about it from a very close friend of mine, a teaching colleague, who battled motor neurone disease very bravely and with great dignity - as much dignity as the illness allows - over the six years she had it. Also, through my work here and involvement in mental health issues, I met the late John McCarthy of Mad Pride who also battled motor neurone disease, for a shorter time. Then there were two former colleagues in the Oireachtas when I came in first - the late former Deputy Michael Fitzpatrick and the late Deputy Nicky McFadden, then a Senator. I acknowledge the great work that is done by the Irish Motor Neurone Disease Association, IMNDA, and the support that it gives to those with motor neurone disease and their loved ones. It is a horrible illness, attacking the motor neurone nerves in the brain and the spinal cord which means messages do not reach the muscles and that leads to weakness and wasting to the point where some have no power to do anything for themselves. The cause is not known. There are various suggestions and, therefore, the research is vital on what makes one person susceptible to the illness and another person not. It strikes people of all ages, even the young. I knew a case of a young boy of 13 years of age who, I think, was the youngest to contract motor neurone disease. Obviously, he did not get long because he was so young when he contracted it. It is progressive. Once diagnosed, the person knows exactly what is ahead of him or her. There are four main types. With amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, ALS, which is the more common with upper and lower motor neurone involvement, there is a life expectancy of two to five years. Progressive bulbar palsy, PBP, with the symptoms of slurring of speech and difficulty swallowing, has a lesser timeframe. Progressive muscular atrophy, PMA, only affects a small proportion with its weaknesses and clumsiness, and perhaps there is a better life expectancy. At one of the fundraising events I went to, I met a gentleman in his late 70s who had written a book about this. He had lived with motor neurone disease for many years, but his was a different type. Primary lateral sclerosis, PLS, which is rarer, may result in a longer lifespan or be life-limiting. I suppose this shows there is so much that is not known about this. At the end of their lives, in spite of that inability to do anything, the two individuals who I knew best were in unfailing good spirits. I acknowledge their courage and good humour in the face of that horrible and appalling illness. I am conscious of those battling motor neurone disease who are watching or listening, and their loved ones also. That is where the support is vital. Many want to stay in their own homes. I acknowledge the care and items - the type of wheelchair that she needed at different stages, the hoist, other adaptations in the house and hours of care - my own friend received. It was a difficult process for the family. Part of the difficulty was the lack of a centralised agency to deal with all aspects of this neurological condition. There were hours of care, but some hours of care came from one agency, other hours came from another agency etc. It was difficult trying to co-ordinate all of that. Then extra hours had to be found when the illness progressed to a fatal stage. I must acknowledge the work of the hospice and the care that it provided. Of course, all of that does not take into account the hours provided by family and friends. The motion specifically mentions other neurological conditions - stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease - on which the same points can be made. There is need for a centralised adequate service which meets the needs of those with a condition. There is a strategy which was published in 2011 but no implementation plan as promised. We are good on providing reports and strategies but we are weak on the implementation. I understand from the motion that a second deadline has also been missed and now it is expected some time in December. The motion states "it is estimated that only one in six people who need specialist rehabilitation services in Ireland can access them". We do not have the necessary beds. We do not have the requisite number of consultants. We do not have the dedicated specialist medical rehabilitation unit. The lack of all of those makes it even more difficult for those with these conditions. With the necessary services, these people can have a better quality of life in whatever time they have. They should not be living in inappropriate settings and with a disjointed service. I also have had personal experience in recent times with someone who had a stroke and I would not be satisfied with the care that he received in a mainstream hospital. There were nice physiotherapists who tried to encourage the therapy but there were gaps in the provision. There was no consistency and no urgency or drive with the patient. While the physiotherapists know what to do physically, I must ask do they have the psychological or counselling skills that are needed to motivate the patient. Physiotherapy can be painful and difficult and with elderly patients, physiotherapists need that additional skill because the work is challenging. The alternative, of course, is one leaves the patient in a semi-vegetative state unable to anything for himself or herself. The same can be said for those in nursing homes with a neurological condition. While the physical care can be excellent, the lack of neurorehabilitation is detrimental.We know that for stroke victims, treatment must be quick to optimise recovery. Treatment must be provided almost immediately because any delay is problematic. It is heartbreaking for patients to realise that treatment in those first few hours or days that could have made a difference did not happen, not to mention the additional financial costs incurred because they did not get the care they needed when it would have been most effective. Diet and food play a huge role but there are varying standards throughout the country, although I know there are challenges for the big hospitals. I have looked at various studies on this, including one on a nursing home in Denmark which was dealing with patients with physical and mental disabilities. The patients' diet was changed and made healthier, and dramatic improvements were noted. The briefing note that came from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland quoted research from 2011 on staff shortages. If similar research was conducted today would the results be similar? The survey drew attention to the importance of voluntary organisations which must be acknowledged. Members will have also received emails from PSPA Ireland, another voluntary organisation that supports a small number of people with particular conditions, namely progressive supranuclear palsy and corticobasal degeneration. As with motor neurone disease, there is no cure to date so rehabilitation and care are vital for quality of life. The group's campaign slogan is "We need our heads examined" and it is calling for implementation of the plans, with clear timeframes, good governance and accountability and the investment that is needed. When one talks about neurological conditions, the first people to come to mind are Dr. Orla Hardiman and her team, some of whom I met through my own personal experience. Dr. Hardiman has highlighted the shortage of permanent consultant neurologists. I read a report a few months ago which detailed the fact there were 16 such consultants in the country, with a locum in Cork but we should have 39 in the long term, with an interim number of 29. I am not sure about the current figures. The Neurological Alliance of Ireland is highlighting those gaps. It is also drawing attention to the fact that recommendations have been made in numerous reports but that we still lack provision for multidisciplinary, palliative, respite and community care. There is also a need to address the provision of information. When people develop neurological conditions they need to have adequate information. Who will provide that? I read about three young men with acquired brain syndrome, one of whom I met. Two suffered cardiac arrest while the third had been knocked off his bicycle. They spoke about the uphill battle they faced to get treatment. It was heartbreaking to listen to and read their stories. They were all healthy young men but they did not get the treatment they needed in Ireland. Two of them had treatment in Germany where they made progress. However, when they came back here that progress was not maintained. The treatment provided in Ireland is contrary to best international practice and it also contravenes the UN Convention on the Rights of People with Disabilities, which we will be ratifying soon. I hope that when we ratify the aforementioned convention we will then provide the resources that are necessary for people with neurological conditions because they deserve much better treatment than they are currently receiving.
#MichaelHarty	unknown-#MichaelHarty-party	unknown-#MichaelHarty-dob	unknown-#MichaelHarty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	344	This motion illustrates a deficiency in our health service which is replicated right across our specialties. It boils down to two basic facts, namely a lack of capacity in our structures and hospitals and a lack of staff to supply a service, which leads to long waiting lists. That is a simple analysis of the deficiencies in our health service. Critically, in neurological services in particular we have under-staffing in all of our level four hospitals. There are 11 such hospitals which are promoted as our centres of excellence but only four have dedicated occupational therapy services for neurological conditions. Five level four hospitals have no speech and language therapists and nine have no neuropsychological services which are vitally important for people with neurorehabilitation needs. Ten of the 11 reported limited, very limited or no access to community neurological rehabilitation services. Such services are extremely important because people will eventually go home. They will come out of hospital, return to their communities and will need community rehabilitation services. There is a lack of dedicated inpatient beds in our hospitals as well as in the National Rehabilitation Hospital. There is a lack of community supports when people come home and a lack of diagnostic services. Patients have great difficulty accessing MRI and CT scanning. Most important, however, is the lack of staff, particularly in community care. That is what is holding up peoples' recovery and limiting their potential to make the best recovery possible. I welcome the fact that the Minister of State has said that the National Rehabilitation Hospital will provide 120 beds by 2020. That will make a huge difference to our services. On the issue of manpower, we need one neurologist for every 70,000 patients but in many areas of the country the ratio is one to every 200,000 patients. The situation is particularly acute in the mid-west. If we were to have a ratio of 1:70,000, we would need 66 neurologists. Currently we have fewer than 30 and some of those posts are not filled. We are very poor in comparison to our European counterparts in this regard. In fact, we are probably at the lower end of the scale in Europe in the provision of neurological services. Every hospital group has an excess of patients per neurologist which is quite unbelievable in 2017. This problem is only going to get worse because of our changing demographics. Our population is aging and we are developing more degenerative and traumatic brain injuries. Brain injury can be devastating. Strokes and traumatic brain injuries can have devastating consequences for patients and their families. The incidence of degenerative neurological diseases like Parkinson's disease, multiple sclerosis, motor neurone disease and dementia also increases as the population ages. All of these place a huge burden on families and patients. In that context, early intervention is critical but this is problematic when there is a lack of capacity and a lack of staff. Patients do not get the early intervention they need and consequently do not have the best outcomes. We need speech and language therapists, occupational therapists, physiotherapists, neuropsychologists and social workers to deal with the devastating effects of acquired brain injury. These need to be supplied within the hospital setting and also in the community. This issue crosses all Departments and is not just confined to the Department of Health. The social determinants of neurorehabilitation will involve education, including retraining, to restore independence to patients. Patients will need housing, housing adaptation and extensions as well as access to transport and mobility allowances. Additional public transport will also have to be provided to allow people who have an acquired brain injury or who need neurorehabilitation to mix and have a social outlet. Social protection is so important in the context of neurorehabilitation. People will lose their employment and will need State support. As I said, this cuts across every Department and is not simply confined to the Department of Health. Multi-annual budgets are buzz words in health planning now. The recently launched Sláintecare report has a huge section on integration and another on implementation. Recommendations for neurological services were made in 2011 but a plan to implement those recommendations has not yet been devised, six years later. If the same happens to the Sláintecare report, the development of our health services will be set back enormously. Changing demographics are a huge problem in the context of planning our health services. We need to publish that implementation plan. We need to have dedicated neurorehabilitation teams in every community health area. We also need to target our resources at staff in the community and in hospitals.

I am delighted the Minister of State is in the House to listen to the debate. In the brief time available to me I want to acknowledge and salute the work of the Parkinson's Association of Ireland and in particular, the Tipperary branch, which was established over ten years ago to provide services and supports to people affected by Parkinson's disease in County Tipperary. I also want to compliment the work of Acquired Brain Injury Ireland which is Ireland's leading provider of flexible and tailor-made services for people with an acquired brain injury, ABI. I wish to focus on needs within the counties of Clare and Kerry and north Tipperary. I have been actively supporting the work of Dr. Caitriona Crowe and the Living Well with Dementia in South Tipperary project for some time. I also compliment Councillor Richie Molloy on his work for carers in County Tipperary. Of particular importance is the 5 Steps project which, as I am sure the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, knows, is a sustained and mainstream HSE service delivered in partnership with Family Carers Ireland in south Tipperary, of which Councillor Molloy is manager. All of these projects do vital work, the value of which cannot be over-estimated. We cannot ever credit the valuable work done by the volunteers in these organisations. An audit should be undertaken in order to embarrass the HSE about how little it does. As we know, Parkinson's disease is a progressive, neurological condition which impacts directly on 8,000 people in the country. What must be kept in mind, however, is that Parkinson's disease, acquired brain injuries and dementia are just some of the neurological conditions that affect individuals and families. I was appalled by a reply I received to a parliamentary question from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, in July. It stated:At present, it is difficult to determine how many people with ME are being seen in neurology ... services nationally.Information on waiting times per speciality and per hospital is all that is currently available to the neurology programme, and as such we do not have accurate information on the demand on neurology services or indeed other specialties, including:- Rheumatology;- Pain Specialists... - Cardiology etc.These are the hallmarks of a care system in crisis. The Minister of State and his officials should be ashamed to include this in a reply. He cannot even count the numbers waiting. Perhaps he is not bothered or he is too embarrassed to do so. It is shocking. I stood on this side of the House for five years or longer and listened to him as he jumped up and down all the time to say what he was doing. I expected more from him. I did not expect him to give that kind of careless, flippant, unhelpful reply; I, at least, expected him to know how many people needed help. He should at least talk to his officials and assert himself, as he did when he was in opposition. He should not be a mouse; he should have things delivered. He was huffing and puffing on the issue of the international human rights committee which he was going to bring before the Cabinet. The measure is long overdue and I support him in that regard. On the other hand, he wants to introduce abortion on demand for people with disabilities. I ask him to consider his position because of those double standards.
#RoisinShortall	unknown-#RoisinShortall-party	unknown-#RoisinShortall-dob	unknown-#RoisinShortall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	346	I commend Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and her colleagues in Fianna Fáil for bringing forward the motion. It is a timely debate for us to have. All of us who saw the shocking "Prime Time" programme last night will be only too conscious of the huge challenges that arise as a result of having family members with neurological difficulties and the problems caused for the patients themselves and also for their carers. It brought home to all of us the shocking lack of services for families facing these challenges. The motion provides us with an opportunity to shine a light on this aspect of the health service. It is yet another area in which there is huge under-investment and a huge level of unmet need and in which the services provided are wholly inadequate and being provided in the wrong place and probably at the most expensive level. This is instead of providing services at community level which obviously achieves greater health results and also much better value for money. The motion references the 2016 report from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland which was appropriately entitled, We Need Our Heads Examined. There were three central demands in that campaign, the first of which was that we should develop inpatient neurorehabilitation services at both national and regional level and end the unacceptable delays in accessing rehabilitation services. The second was that we should set up community neurorehabilitation teams in every community health organisation. Again, this is about bringing services back into the community, close to where the patients and clients are, where they want to access services and the best results can be achieved. I understand local community services are provided within three of the nine community health care organisations, CHOs, which, again, is an indication of the inadequate provision made. The third demand was that we should invest in long-term, rehabilitation-specific services in the community in order to provide care and support in appropriate settings. This arises because of the fact that, when a younger person has an acquired brain injury or a degenerative brain condition, too often, the only service available for him or her is in a nursing home which was intended to cater for older clients. As we heard again on the programme last night and as we know from the many families who are campaigning on the issue, the nursing home setting which was intended for older people is entirely inadequate for younger people with neurological difficulties. The motion calls for dedicated multiannual investment in coming budgets in order to develop neurorehabilitation services, particularly in the community, and, as I said, the publication of an implementation plan for the neurorehabilitation strategy by March next year, with a clear timeframe for implementation. Again, this is an example that is very common in respect of the implementation deficit disorder, one of the main conditions that dogs the health service. There is a strategy in place but no implementation. An implementation report was drawn up, but it was met with a scathing response from the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. What we need is a meaningful and real implementation strategy and for it to be delivered by the end of the first quarter next year. I support that proposal. The motion also calls for the establishment of dedicated community rehabilitation teams in each community health area and investment in 2018 to target current waiting lists in the community, following the outcome of HSE mapping exercises earlier this year. We know that a lot of attention is focused on hospital waiting lists. However, when we consider other hidden waiting lists, for example, for community services such as psychological services, speech and language services, physiotherapy and occupational therapy, as well as all of the critical services which are essential for those who have been involved in an incident or developed a condition, we must ensure they are enabled to be the best they possibly can be, in other words, to develop all of the senses and capabilities that have been affected by their condition or the incident they experienced, to return them to full health as soon as possible. We are not very good at doing this. Generally, when people develop a condition, they are left waiting an interminable length of time. This raises huge questions about the human rights of the individuals affected. They should be supported by the Government and public services to make as full a recovery and to live as full a life as possible. We know that if they are given the right access to quality rehabilitation services at an early stage, many people with neurological conditions such as brain injuries will be enabled to return to a fair degree of normality in their lives.Currently, a number of people with neurological conditions are, for example, unable to speak. They need speech and language therapy. Several of them are unable to return to work because they have not been able to access rehab. Many of the disabilities in question develop later on for people with neurological conditions, yet they are preventable if there is early intervention and access to rehab. That many young people are forced to live in nursing homes is unacceptable. It is important that we listen to what we are being told by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland, NAI, in that there are 800,000 people living with neurological conditions and that this figure increases by approximately 40,000 every year. The primary barrier to effective neurological care is the underinvestment and underdevelopment of community services in particular. We must bear in mind what the Government's priority should be. These are people who have been struck down by conditions or accidents and acquired brain injuries and whose lives, although negatively impacted upon, could be so much better and fuller. In many cases, they could live independent lives if they were supported by the Government with decent public services. That is what we should be doing and that is what these people deserve. It is in the best interests of everyone as a society that people be as independent as possible and live their lives as free from disability as possible. The plans are set out and it is clear what needs to be done. The strategy needs to be implemented and the Minister of State needs to get on with that as soon as possible.

In Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Louth, the latest figures for the number of people waiting to get treated at the National Rehabilitation Hospital, NRH, was four, with those four waiting for three months, which is the average waiting time to get a bed in the NRH. In a hospital like Our Lady of Lourdes, which has 235 beds, approximately four beds are occupied at any one time by patients waiting for rehabilitation treatment. This equates to in excess of 360 bed days lost in that three-month period or 1,440 in any one year. Nationwide, there are 126 people on the waiting list for the NRH. That is a great deal of bed occupancy and trolley waiting time that could be alleviated. I have been told that the NRH prioritises clients based on their rehabilitation potential. As such, many of those waiting never even get to the hospital. Many families have to source private treatment in the meantime and many patients end up in nursing homes. One in three people who require rehabilitation never get it. Earlier this year, 12 beds at a specialist brain and spinal injuries facility were lying empty due to chronic shortages of staff at the rehab centre in Dún Laoghaire. That was despite a waiting list at the time of 226 patients seeking treatment. I know of many cases where delays in assessments and proper rehabilitation treatment have been detrimental to patients' final prognoses. One such person would certainly be walking now rather than confined to a wheelchair if an assessment and proper physiotherapy had been available early to her. With Parkinson's disease, there is growing evidence that early intervention may help to preserve the functioning of neurons, reducing symptoms, in particular difficulty with or distortion in performing voluntary movements, slowing disease progression, improving patients' prognoses and, in turn, reducing the overall costs associated with this debilitating disease. Not only would early intervention in Parkinson's cases have a significant impact on health care costs, but it would ease the burden for families who are all too well aware of the detrimental effects of delayed diagnosis. There have been many cases of people waiting seven to nine months for beds in the NRH. This is frustrating for the patients and their families, as any delay in commencing rehabilitation is detrimental to the final prognosis. I could make many points about speedier access to MRI scans for diagnosis and the need for investment in that regard but, in sharing time, I am conscious of giving others the opportunity to contribute. We must consider how to get this service correct if we are to progress the available facilities for others.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	348	I speak on behalf of the approximately 750,000 people who have been diagnosed with a neurological disorder. We must bear in mind that more than 25,000 of those are struggling to get the services that they need to prevent disability and support their recoveries from conditions such as stroke, acquired brain injury, multiple sclerosis and Parkinson's disease. Demand for services is likely to accelerate dramatically in light of our ageing population and an increased number of people needing treatment for these conditions. I commend my colleagues, Deputies Murphy O'Mahony and Kelleher, for raising this important issue. While it is great to hear support from across the House, Ireland's global standing on this matter is very poor. Our services remain underdeveloped and require significant expansion if we are to meet the coming demand, never mind current pressures. We need dedicated, multi-annual investment in forthcoming budgets in order to develop neurorehabilitation services, particularly in the community, in response to the significant level of unmet need and the decades of neglect and underinvestment that need to be righted. An implementation plan for the neurorehabilitation strategy needs to be published by the end of March 2018 with, crucially, a clear timeframe for implementation. We need mechanisms to ensure governance and accountability at the highest levels of the HSE and in the Minister's office and the Department of Health. We also need the establishment of dedicated community teams in each of the nine community health organisations, CHOs, with investment in 2018 to target current waiting lists in the community following the outcome of a HSE mapping exercise earlier this year. There has been considerable collaboration with the NAI in tabling this motion. I compliment the alliance for highlighting consistently how clinical services are creaking at the seams, with staffing at critical levels. Occupational therapists are doing an incredible job. I know many of them. They need extra resources and staff to help them support those in need. Our country has the lowest number of consultant neurologists and multidisciplinary specialists in Europe. We have a continuing emergency department crisis, which results in patients often not being admitted to neurology units because beds are unavailable. Before handing over to my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, I will say that our country lags far behind the rest of the developed world in terms of neurorehabilitation services. We need to remedy that now.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	349	I welcome the opportunity to contribute on this important issue and acknowledge the good work done by my colleague, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, in this regard. We want to stay positive, but it is worth pointing out the facts. For example, the implementation plan for the national policy, which was due to be published in June, has still not been published. As my colleague, Deputy O'Loughlin, said, Ireland has the lowest number of consultant neurologists in Europe. This is disappointing. We need investment and delivery because the services that are required by people who are suffering in this way are not present on the ground.Despite what we speak about and what statistics we churn out in the House each day, this is not helping people who cannot access the supports they need on a daily and weekly basis. The Neurological Alliance of Ireland reported that 800,000 people in Ireland currently live with a neurological condition. As we know, services in various counties are not good. In my constituency, Kildare North, they are extremely poor. In 2015 a person who reported to a GP with a brain injury was sent to the accident and emergency in Blanchardstown because there were no facilities in Beaumont. The person spent 13 hours waiting to be seen and two days on a trolley. From there, the person was referred to Beaumont Hospital. Another person who came to me was a constituent who suffered a serious brain injury in 2003 and was discharged without any follow-up care. As a result, he became very ill about three months ago. The family approached the State for support but unless they received some today, they have heard nothing from the State in that regard which is extremely disappointing. The only support he has received is from a voluntary organisation, the Abbey Community Project which has operated in Celbridge for ten years and helps people who have a dual diagnosis or those with mental health difficulties. It receives no State funding, an issue which I have pursued for over a year with the Minister of State's colleagues in terms of trying to give it some support. Without the support of that community group, this individual would have nothing, and has had nothing up to today unless he received help today.  When I contacted the Minister's office in an attempt to secure some support for this man, I was told to refer him to a weekly clinic in Kildare town which was 40 miles away. That was the best that came back from the Minister's office, which is extremely disappointing. Nothing was received from the State. The suggestion from the Minister's office is of no use to someone who is walking the roads, sleeping rough and missing from home because of a condition, resulting from a brain injury, over which he has no control. Why is this the case? It is because the required supports are not in place. We need to turn a negative into a positive, through the work of the Minister of State and the Government, and try to put supports and investment in place to help people who are suffering in this regard and are in urgent need of help. Without services, such people will find themselves in a very lonely place and things could become more serious or tragic for them.
#JimDaly	unknown-#JimDaly-party	unknown-#JimDaly-dob	unknown-#JimDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	350	I thank Deputies for their contributions to the debate on the very important matter of neurorehabilitation services which has been raised in the Private Members' motion today. It is clear from the contributions in the House that we are agreed that the work of progressing the implementation plan for neurorehabilitation services is critical if we are to achieve the best possible outcomes for people who require these services. We are all acutely aware that neurological illness or injury has significant implications for the individual and his or her family, and impacts on their social, educational, vocational and recreational participation. I want to take this opportunity to re-emphasise the Government’s commitment to the area of neurorehabilitation. The commitment in A Programme for a Partnership Government, along with the priority actions in the area of neurorehabilitation identified by the Health Service Executive in its national service plan for 2017, will have a positive impact on the development and integration of these services and on the lives of those people with neurological illness or injury. The HSE national steering group is tasked with developing a national implementation framework for the national policy and strategy for the provision of neurorehabilitation services in Ireland. The representation on the reconstituted steering group will ensure that the framework has a collaborative and holistic approach. It is of great benefit that representatives are now included on the group from across the whole health service, including the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. The focus of the national steering group is to develop a framework which can be implemented across the country and the group has agreed an approach to the development of the framework. The proposed managed clinical rehabilitation network demonstration site will test the feasibility of this model to provide neurorehabilitation services nationally. Managed clinical rehabilitation networks ensure that only those patients with the highest levels of need are admitted to the specialised medical facilities at the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Appropriate care for all other neurorehabilitation needs would be met within the network through alternative inpatient facilities and enhanced community rehabilitation teams. It is, of course, possible for the group to draft a theoretical implementation framework document within a much shorter timeframe. It is very important to note, however, that this approach may not provide a feasible, fit-for-purpose framework which can be implemented nationally. It is for this reason that the HSE has adopted the approach of developing and testing a demonstration model and this work is progressing. In addition, the mapping exercise undertaken by the HSE to identify the levels and gaps of existing neurorehabilitation services is important in order to establish a clear picture of where specialist rehabilitation services are currently being delivered and where the demands are for these services. This will also ensure that the best possible use is made of available resources. The National Rehabilitation Hospital plays a central role in the provision of neurorehabilitation services to adults and children who, as a result of an accident, illness or injury, have acquired a physical or cognitive disability and require specialist medical rehabilitation. The hospital has a reputation for excellence and provides patients with every opportunity to meet their rehabilitation goals through personalised treatment plans which are delivered by consultant-led interdisciplinary teams which are expert in their fields. Rehabilitation programmes at the National Rehabilitation Hospital are tailored to meet the individual needs of adult and paediatric patients. Existing bed capacity at the hospital was reduced last year by hospital management to enable it to provide a safe and appropriate level of care to patients from within its existing resources. Following engagement between the hospital and the HSE, funding has been provided by the HSE and a total of four beds have been reopened in the brain injury and spinal cord system of care programmes at the hospital. It is also important to note that additional funding of €0.65 million has been made available towards the cost of opening a further four beds at the hospital as part of the Government’s 2017 winter measures and measures to improve access to hospital care in 2018. It is planned that two of these beds will reopen next week in the hospital’s brain injury programme. It is also significant that the contracts for new development works at the hospital have been signed and that construction works are now well under way. These new facilities will provide a major enhancement to rehabilitation services in the country. They will have a direct and significant impact on patient recovery by providing an optimal ward and therapeutic environment for patient treatment at the hospital. The design is patient-centred and based on the principles of empowerment, dignity, privacy, confidentiality and choice. The HSE has a priority action to establish an innovative pilot day service aimed at supporting people with severe acquired brain injuries. This day service is at a very advanced stage of implementation and will provide core specialised services for a particular group of patients. The HSE provides a range of assisted living services, including personal assistant and home support hours to support individuals to live as independently as possible. The HSE is committed to protecting the level of personal assistant and home support hours for people with disabilities, including neurological conditions. Nursing home support can also be an appropriate care option in cases where persons concerned have clinically assessed complex medical and social care needs requiring this form of support. Stroke represents one of the greatest areas of needs for neurorehabilitation care in the Irish health services and the national clinical programme for stroke has been in place since early 2010 and aims to improve the quality, access and cost effectiveness of stroke services in Ireland. More recently, in 2015, the Minister for Health established a trauma policy for Ireland steering group, chaired by Professor Eilis McGovern, to make recommendations in regard to the development of a trauma system for Ireland. The group completed its final report in July 2017. It is important to acknowledge the range of excellent neurorehabilitation services which are already provided. It is also important to acknowledge the work that is under way by the HSE national steering group to develop an implementation plan for national neurorehabilitation services. Neurorehabilitation is an area of our health service that requires a collaborative and strategic approach from all of the service providers. Again, I thank the House for the opportunity to address these issues and Deputies for their valuable contributions to this very important debate.

I thank my colleagues for using Private Members' time to debate this motion. The Minister of State gave a good account of everything that might happen and could happen, what is well under way, what is being investigated and referred to trial models and so on. In the meantime, there are ridiculous waiting lists. I am from the same part of the country as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and many others in the House, a region comprising 280,000 or more people, which includes Sligo Regional Hospital and Letterkenny University Hospital.There are two neurologists based in Sligo who cover both hospitals. They are Dr. Daniel Kevin Murphy and another recently appointed neurologist. The Saolta hospital group has made the case that based on the population being seen five consultant neurologists are required in the area. That equates to one per 70,000 patients. I have focused specifically on Sligo Regional Hospital, but the position in Letterkenny University Hospital and other hospitals throughout the country is the same. We can consider the figures for outpatients alone from 28 January 2016. At that stage 338 people were waiting. In a reasonably positive development at the time, only seven had been waiting for over 15 months. The Minister of State and his colleagues have spoken about the progress being made, but there were different figures on 31 October this year, or one month ago. I will wait to receive the Minister of State's attention. I am glad that the staff of the Debates Office have managed to get a copy of his speech. They might show the courtesy of waiting and asking for scripts after the fact. On 31 October the figure of 338 people waiting to see a neurologist had become 710, an increase of 110% increase. There is a cost for other health services, support services and charities on which we depend to care for the people concerned as a result of not having an adequate diagnosis early enough and treatments prescribed by neurologists. This cost could be saved by providing the number of neurologists required. The two mentioned are working like slaves and can absolutely not do any more. There was an increase of 110% in the number waiting for an outpatients' neurologist appointment. The Department has provided figures for those waiting more than 15 months. Of the 710 people waiting, 316 have been waiting for more than 15 months, which represents an increase of 4,514% in one year in the number waiting for more than 15 months for an appointment. These figures are from the National Treatment Purchase Fund. There is no metric, analysis, speech that can be written or trial model that could be under way to justify such incompetence and mediocrity. In Sligo I was involved in a small way in the establishment of the North West Neurological Institute, a charity that does some of the work for the Health Service Executive. Remarkably, the clinical indemnity scheme will not admit it because Mr. Ciarán Breen has stated it is a political matter. The Government should work as hard and as quickly as it can to recruit the five neurologists we require in the region, but will it, please, help the charities which are doing some of the work and admit them into the clinical indemnity scheme?

I hope the debate will serve to put neurorehabilitation services and the need for them front and centre. I hope Deputies will forgive me - I know that the Minister of State will do so - if I finish on a more local note. It has been estimated that Ireland should have 270 neurorehabilitation inpatient beds for the size of its population. However, we have less than half of that number and none of them is outside Dublin. With reference to the particular case in the south of the country, numerous reports have highlighted the critical need to provide a dedicated specialist rehabilitation unit to serve the needs of the population of the area. Patients from the south account for one in four referrals to the National Rehabilitation Hospital. Individual reports in 2000, 2003, 2007, 2008 and 2011 all pointed to the need for a specialist medical rehabilitation service to meet the needs of people with neurological conditions in counties Cork and Kerry. The report on the reconfiguration of acute hospital services in counties Cork and Kerry in 2011 published by the HSE clearly states:Cork and Kerry need an acute rehabilitation medicine service that would provide a post-acute specialist rehabilitation service for acquired brain injury and neurological diagnoses for those between 18 and 65 years of age. The service should be led by a consultant in rehabilitation medicine linked to the NRH in Dublin and supported by a regional rehabilitation co-ordinator and a multidisciplinary professional team, including a clinical neuro-psychologist.It specifically highlighted that "the presence of specialists in rehabilitation medicine would be of considerable benefit to the health service of Cork and Kerry". It is now six years since the publication of that report and there is still no dedicated specialist medical rehabilitation unit in the south for people with a neurological disability. One part-time consultant is in place, but there are no dedicated beds in any of the local hospitals. I am sure the Minister of State agrees that we need to do much better than this. I have brought the motion before the House because I believe the case for the provision of these services is overwhelming. It is made with powerful advocacy by the Neurological Alliance of Ireland. I will finish with the words of its executive director in a letter to The Irish Times:Neurorehabilitation services promote recovery and prevent and delay disability. They enable people to go to work, contribute meaningfully to family and community life and, most significantly, avoid becoming dependent on already severely restricted health services. Without such services, people remain unnecessarily in hospital, exist in nursing homes that are not suited to their needs or continue to live with families who are not able to cope.The case is clear. It is now time to act.
#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	354	I move:That Dáil Éireann approves the following Regulations in draft:Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund Regulations 2017,copies of which were laid in draft form before Dáil Éireann on 13th November 2017.I apologise to the House for being late. The horse and greyhound racing industries occupy a key position in the sporting and social landscape. As a nation, we have a strong affinity not just with racing but also with the social scene at its core. Government funding of these key industries provides an excellent opportunity to yield a high return on its investment. Support for certain strategic industries is important to future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for society, as well as for the economy. The industries receive financial support from the State through the horse and greyhound racing fund under section 12 of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001. My Department makes payments from the fund to Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon. In the period 2001 to date, a total of €1.12 billion has been paid from the fund to the horse and greyhound racing industries in accordance with the provisions of the Act. The cumulative upper limit on payments from the fund provided for under the relevant regulations has, therefore, been reached. Exchequer funding provided from the fund is pivotal to the survival and continued development of the horse and greyhound racing industries. In order to give effect to the provisions of budget 2018, the cumulative upper limit must be increased by regulations.This is because it is necessary to comply with the technical requirement under section 12(13) of the Horse and Greyhound Racing Act 2001. Doing so by way of these regulations allows us to increase the cumulative limit on the amount payable from the horse and greyhound racing fund by €80 million to some €1.2 billion. The recent Deloitte report commissioned by Horse Racing Ireland indicates that the total estimated direct and stimulated expenditure of the Irish breeding and racing industry was €1.84 billion in 2016, with the core industry contributing €914 million of this and secondary expenditure the remaining €927 million. There are an estimated 15,200 jobs at the core of the racing and breeding industry and in directly related industries. The achievements of Irish bred and Irish trained horses abroad and the enduring influence of Irish born jockeys and stable staff underscore Ireland's global prominence. We hold the distinguished position of being the third highest producer of foals, coupled with having the third highest number of active brood mares in the world. Government funding is crucial to maintaining and building on our position as one of the world's leading breeding and racing nations. Moreover, this funding affords the State an excellent opportunity to secure a high return on its investment, leading to a flow of income throughout the economy. Support for certain strategic industries is important for future economic growth and can provide widespread benefits for our society, as well as the economy. The greyhound industry is significant for Ireland and has been embedded in Irish society for decades. It is an important activity from an economic, social and cultural perspective and provides and supports considerable employment, both directly and indirectly, across the country. The greyhound sector went through challenging times during the economic recession, but it continues to make a significant economic and financial contribution to the economy, particularly at a local level. Bord na gCon's annual reports indicate that despite the severe recession, the industry is recovering, showing an increase in the operating surplus in 2015 and again in 2016. Funds generated from greyhound racing are reinvested in the industry through contributions to prize money and grants to various bodies involved in the greyhound racing and breeding sector, as well as the promotion of greyhound welfare and the regulation of the industry. Revenues generated have also contributed significantly to the improved facilities now available at greyhound tracks throughout the country. Greyhound racing is an activity that is inextricably linked with the farming community and while it is undoubtedly part of the fabric of rural Ireland, it also enjoys a strong urban support base. The Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016 introduced a range of improvements in governance and accountability arrangements, many of which derive from recommendations made by Indecon International Economic Consultants following its review of the sector. Indecon was further commissioned to conduct a review of matters related to Bord na gCon in order to assess the suitability of the legal, governance and regulatory framework supporting the greyhound industry and identify opportunities to maximise its commercial income. In response to the recommendations made in the Indecon and Morris reports and the report prepared by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine, I have introduced a draft general scheme of a greyhound industry Bill. The Bill will address the governance of Bord na gCon, strengthen regulatory controls in the industry, modernise sanctions and improve integrity with a view to building a reputation for exceptional regulation in the sector. The draft general scheme has progressed through the pre-legislative scrutiny phase and it is hoped a memorandum will be brought before the Government in the coming weeks requesting approval to publish the updated scheme and submit it to the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel for drafting. The legislation will bolster the greyhound industry, enable it to deal with existing challenges and maximise its future potential. Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon face significant challenges as they work to grow and develop the horse and greyhound racing industries in a competitive and mobile market. I am confident, however, that both industries have tremendous growth potential, with sporting, leisure, tourism and cultural appeal across a wide demographic, both national and international. The thoroughbred horse industry is a major driver of the economy and both industries breathe life and jobs into their respective communities from the grassroots up. The hugely important contribution made by the horse and greyhound racing fund since its inception in 2001 has been vital in ensuring the industries can continue to invest in their infrastructure. The €80 million allocation for which I am seeking the approval of the House is vital in securing rural jobs and sustaining communities. The regulations are necessary to ensure Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon will receive the funding provided for in budget 2018 and that the very important role played by the industries and the economic activity generated by them will be sustained into the future.  I commend the motion to the House and look forward to discussing any matter arising.

#JackieCahill	unknown-#JackieCahill-party	unknown-#JackieCahill-dob	unknown-#JackieCahill-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	356	Fianna Fáil supports this proposal. The horse and greyhound racing sectors are two industries of which we in this country can justifiably be proud. The funding allocated to them is some of the best money spent by the Exchequer. In 2016 the two industries contributed €50 million in betting taxation, which represented an increase of some €20 million in the wake of the provisions set out in the Betting (Amendment) Act 2015. I am confident the revenue will have increased again this year. Nevertheless, there is scope for us to review how the industries are taxed, particularly in view of the growth in betting exchanges and the increase in activity by the very large multinational bookmaking operations.  A tax rate of 1% is extremely low. However, in making any change to the taxation regime we must be very conscious of the position of track bookmakers. Some of them have started to use betting exchanges in an attempt to boost their turnover, but they are essentially a vanishing species. In reviewing how the taxation system operates we should consider whether we can do anything to help their survival. Track bookmakers are an integral part of the social aspect of horse and greyhound racing and bring a unique perspective to events. If we were to lose them and move towards a tote monopoly, we would lose a huge part of the industry and our heritage. We must find ways to help them to survive, as well as the small independent bookmakers who are also getting scarce in numbers. We need to find imaginative ways to secure tax revenue in a way that is fair to all operators. Following a substantial drop in revenue during the recession, there is great scope for revenue generation from both industries. I imagine that in the near future what we gain from them in taxation will be on par with what the State invests in the industries. The Minister referred to the forthcoming greyhound industry Bill which is urgently required. There have been various controversies in recent years where a dog was found to have been given this or that substance. These revelations are doing unknown damage to the industry's reputation. We need legislation that will allow us to offer a robust defence of the integrity of the industry. If people are using prohibited substances, there should be stringent ways of dealing with the issue. The long delays between when a report is made on an animal being treated with a substance and the imposition of a fine or sanctions for such behaviour must be addressed.

I welcome the proposal to provide additional funding for the horse and greyhound racing industries. There will be critics who see this as money badly spent, but the Minister must remind them of the number of jobs created by the industries and the tremendous revenue they generate for the Exchequer. It has been a traumatic year for the greyhound industry, with the sad closure of the Harold's Cross track. I hope the industry can move on from it and secure the future of the remaining major tracks. I agree with Deputy Jackie Cahill that while betting tax will have to increase down the road, a proviso should be implemented to minimise the effect on on-course bookmakers who provide an invaluable service and are part of what attracts people to track racing. They keep the crowds up and engage people in great banter, as we see on television.It is important to look after on-course bookies, many of whom are sole traders. I thank the Minister as we seem to be moving forward with funding for horses, but he should not forget trotting, an activity which is growing.
#MartinKenny	unknown-#MartinKenny-party	unknown-#MartinKenny-dob	unknown-#MartinKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	358	The horse racing industry has been before us as a topic on many occasions, both here and in committees. The €80 million spent on these two industries is a huge revenue investment by society. We all understand we have to invest to reap a reward at a future date and plenty has been made of the return we get on it, but many feel the amount the industry receives is worth discussing. It is seen as a club for very rich people and people feel not enough is being done to help those at the other end of the scale. I come from a rural community and we all know people who are involved in the industry, who have a couple of old nags and try their best but fail all the time and some support has to be given to them as it is not being given currently. Last year we looked at the money given to the horse racing industry and saw that a lot of it ended up in prize money. At big race events we can see who collects this prize money and I do not think it is a good use of public money. We should not be putting such sums of money into the industry until there is reform and the only way we can protest at what is going on is by saying in this House that we do not support the amount being put into the greyhound and horse racing industry in this context. We have talked about bad management but it goes further than just mistakes being made. A lot of the things happening are intentional and designed to enrich a small group in the industry. That is wrong and we need to stand up to it. All that is going on in respect of testing and doping in the greyhound industry is obscene. I remember people protesting with their greyhounds about the closure of Harold's Cross greyhound stadium and that is another example of a sector within the industry which is simply not working right. We have reports and other things are coming up, but, at the end of the day, nobody is getting the people responsible for this into line. Until we can ensure these things are done properly, I suggest we do not support the motion.

There is a tremendous community and social side to the greyhound track in Tralee on a Friday or Saturday night; therefore, it is with sadness that I have to raise some issues about the sector. I have been lobbied by small greyhound breeders who are absolutely disgusted and feel let down by the lack of regulation and proper policing and testing in the greyhound sector. One particular greyhound has tested three times in four weeks for cocaine, but the owner took the case to the courts and won his case. As a result, the dog was allowed to run without any sanction on the trainer or owner. That is wrong because it means the small man cannot compete with the big man. The big man can find experienced personnel to buck the system and that has happened on several occasions. The reputation of the greyhound sector has suffered over a considerable time and we have not just learned about this today or yesterday, yet nothing has been done by successive Governments to bring about proper policing and testing within the sector. There is no sanction when, over a four-week period, a trainer can win three high value stakes with a dog that tested positive for cocaine each time. How can anybody have any confidence in such a sector or allocate money to it when this happens? This is the complaint of the small breeders who have five or six dogs and try to win a stake every now and then. If they could win it would make a big difference to them but they cannot do so and my party and I have serious problems with this motion as a result. It is with reluctance that I have to say we cannot support it.

We are nonetheless eager to get to the point where there is a long-term funding structure in place, for the horse racing industry, in particular. This can be achieved by pursuing correct policies and it will mean savings for the Exchequer. The horse racing industry's aim is to become self-financing and be able to stand on its own feet without the necessity of Exchequer funding, which would then be available for other important areas where it is much needed. We have engaged in detailed submissions on the greyhound industry in the past year on proposed legislation and we have focused on significant welfare issues which must be addressed in any legislative intervention. Of equal importance is the question of probity and integrity at all levels of the greyhound industry. Shortcomings, failures, excuses and failures to follow up on investigations and inspections are no longer acceptable. Following the prelegislative scrutiny debates, all stakeholders in the industry are on notice that co-operation and significant improvement in these areas must be forthcoming. If there are no improvements, funding should be reviewed and discontinued. I note the disposal of Harold's Cross stadium and hope Bord na gCon will not be found wanting in helping out some small, rural greyhound tracks which kept going in adverse economic circumstances. Mullingar greyhound stadium needs some assistance for vital infrastructural investment in order that it can continue to provide vital facilities for the public and entertainment. It is an important track and I trust funding will be forthcoming from Bord na gCon and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I have raised the publication of the Indecon report and we support its recommendations, in particular that pertaining to the Irish Harness Racing Association, which is made up of a very constructive and responsible group of people who have already set about implementing recommendations in a very focused way, notwithstanding the failure of the Department and other stakeholders in allocating them resources. The Irish Harness Racing Association has made multiple requests for funding assistance as it needs seed funding of some €720,000, with a further €2 million in capital funding. Brexit will have serious implications for the thoroughbred racing industry and the breeding industry. The Irish racing and breeding industry is in many ways dependent on Britain as our main market and the sector is considerably exposed in the event of a hard Brexit. The horse racing and breeding industries of the United Kingdom and Ireland operate as one with horses, trainers and riders regularly moving between both jurisdictions. Horse Racing Ireland has informed us that thoroughbred racing has always operated on an all-island basis and foals born in Northern Ireland carry the IRE suffix, rather than the GB suffix. Two of Ireland's 26 racecourses are based in Northern Ireland, with 22 fixtures annually. All trainers in Northern Ireland are licensed by the Irish Turf Club and races there are staged under the Turf Club's rules of racing. Approximately 90% of runners in these fixtures are trained in the Republic and horses move on a daily basis; therefore, a return to a hard Border would seriously disrupt this movement. The two countries also operate as a single entity for stud book purposes.Some 65% of our foals are exported and 80% of these exports are to Britain; therefore, it is the single biggest market for bloodstock and is a huge revenue generator. Some €225 million or €230 million was generated by exported thoroughbreds. Some 80% of this would be at risk due to trade issues following the vote in favour of Brexit. Exchange rate volatility is important. I have been very cantankerous with regard to media rights, as people know, and from 2019 to 2023, media rights will be paid in sterling. That will be a significant risk to income, that is, the exchange rates and so on. I do not want to see Kilbeggan, Ballinrobe, Roscommon and all those small racecourses losing out. I agree with Deputy Martin Kenny. It is no use putting a lot of this prize money into where the snobby crowd is always cleaning up. I am worried about people like Peter Downes who breed horses and work hard. They are top class breeders, especially in the jumps industry. I am an advocate for the jumps industry. The wealthy crowd is in the flat industry. I would look after people who are involved in the real race course. In Britain-----

Some 80,000 tourists come here annually because of our racing industry. That will be under threat owing to unfavourable rates of exchange. In 2016, Irish-trained horses ran about 1,500 times in Britain, winning prize money of €15.3 million and, in reverse, there were only 309 British runners here and they only won €3.9 million. Britain relies heavily on Ireland and France to source racehorses and 75% of runners in British fixtures are either Irish-bred or French-bred. The importance of Brexit cannot be overemphasised with regard to this industry.
#PaulMurphy	unknown-#PaulMurphy-party	unknown-#PaulMurphy-dob	unknown-#PaulMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	365	Here we are again. Another year has passed and another €80 million is being provided for the horse and greyhound racing industries. The Minister, in his speech, as far as I can tell, makes no reference whatsoever to the issues of animal welfare and animal rights. How long can he continue to ignore the horrific conditions faced by greyhounds in this industry? I know people who own greyhounds who love their dogs, treat them well, etc., but I also know that it is an industry that is intimately connected to gambling and where the profit motive is extremely strong, which, unfortunately, has an extremely distorting impact and results in cruel practices towards dogs. In the last week there were two very important stories in the media which illustrate the point. The first which is in the newspapers today addresses doping. Another two greyhounds have tested positive for traces of cocaine. Every time this happens, the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB, states it has a doping testing regime in place and that it only thinks 1% of dogs is affected, but all of the evidence suggests it is the tip of the iceberg. Pharmacology experts, veterinarians and others in the industry treat the official figures with serious scepticism. The Morris report pointed to severe problems with the anti-doping measures in the greyhound industry and found that the National Greyhound Laboratory did not have facilities to test many of the drugs used to dope greyhounds. When will the IGB be obliged to fund adequate levels of testing for substances in greyhounds? The issue of export of dogs to countries which have very low or no animal welfare regulations or legislation is serious. I note that the Minister, in an answer to Deputy Daly on 28 March, said Bord na gCon "advises all owners involved in the export of greyhounds to only export to destinations that provide the expected levels of greyhound care and management as defined in the IGB's Code of Practice for the welfare of greyhounds. I strongly endorse this view." That is all very well, but the reality is that greyhounds are being exported to China, Pakistan and countries where really cruel treatment of dogs is absolutely rife. There was a story in the British press a week ago about a woman called Kerry Elliman who has been involved in a Birmingham organisation and rescued dogs which were exported from Ireland to China. The conditions that are reported are horrific. The Daily Mirror states: Video footage from contacts across China gives a horrific insight into how racing greyhounds are treated in the absence of animal protection laws. One harrowing clip shows a greyhound being boiled alive in a cauldron. In other clips greyhounds yelp as they are strung up with cables and hung from a line to be weighed. Other greyhounds, reduced to skin and bone, are confined in a tiny cage. Last week, Kerry spent five days in Beijing to retrieve the dogs her contacts intercepted.Kerry has been in touch with me and provided me with an extensive list of dogs that have been exported from Ireland. The dogs are on a website in China with their original owners listed and they came directly from Ireland. There is a list of 22 dogs, owned by the Cliffords, Jason Walsh, Stephen McNamara, Gerard Dowling, Stephen Dunphy and the list goes on. I can provide it for the Minister. These are greyhounds which were directly exported from Ireland to China and it seems likely that many of those involved in the exports are also involved in exports to Pakistan and elsewhere.

This issue was dealt with in Private Members' business some time ago and I also tried to bring foreard a Bill to ban live hare coursing. We have far too many examples of appalling ways in which animals are treated in this country and I want to acknowledge the individuals, families and organisations which do so much for animal welfare and try to redress that balance and address the cruelty, neglect and indifference to animals. It was positive that the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, signed the regulation banning the use of wild animals in circuses which will come into effect on 1 January. He has said the use of wild animals for entertainment purposes in circuses can no longer be permitted and I agree with him. There is hypocrisy because we still allow animals like greyhounds to be used for entertainment in a way where they suffer injuries and where other animals are also injured. I would like to see more of the funding allocated today to be designated for welfare. I met representatives of Bord na gCon when they were here and discussed these matters with them. I acknowledge those greyhound owners who look after their dogs but those who do not are not being addressed. We see that with those whose dogs have been found to have been doped. Funding should have a role in that regard. There should be a way in which funding will only go to those who have the welfare of the animals at heart. I know Bord na gCon has a retired greyhound trust to rehome greyhounds, but that is through a 2% deduction from all winning prize money and matching contributions from Bord na gCon, which I do not think goes far enough. It had a nice booklet about greyhounds making great pets with which I totally agree since I have met many of them, but it does not comprehensively address the welfare of greyhounds. We have evidence of owners who have no guilt or compunction and are ready to sell off unwanted greyhounds, as Deputy Paul Murphy said, to places such as Macau. The treatment is appalling and well documented. As well as Macau, they are going to other places in China and Pakistan. The owners are exporting greyhounds first to Spain and France in order that they are not seen to be going directly to Macau and elsewhere, but the trail is there. Animal welfare groups that trace the trail follow it back to greyhound owners in Ireland and have named them, but the owners get away with impunity. Bord na gCon could have a role in that regard and in dealing with those owners who abandon their greyhounds, openly or otherwise, to rescue centres. We know that greyhounds are very affectionate creatures. We also know about the injuries and dogs that are put down because of them or because they have not made the cut. There is a big demand to try to re-home these greyhounds. My views on live hare coursing are well known. I do not believe we should do it any more.We have a lot of evidence from the National Parks and Wildlife Service and the Irish Council Against Blood Sports of what goes on at some hare coursing meetings. The hares are terrorised, struck multiple times by dogs and mauled to the ground. We are also aware of hares being brought back to other coursing meetings. There is plenty of footage available, but, again, there is no follow-up action for those found guilty. There is an alternative available: drag coursing. I ask Bord na gCon to consider using some of its funding to examine this alternative which has proved viable in other countries. It also had another nice booklet on loving and respecting its athletes which was about the greyhounds. My point is that all greyhound owners pay their fee to the coursing club but many greyhound owners do not agree with coursing. Bord na gCon should hold the book to register greyhounds. We would then know exactly how many greyhound owners were in favour of coursing. This is public funding and the public have indicated in many surveys that they do not agree with live hare coursing, yet owners of greyhounds who do not agree with coursing have to pay their fee to the coursing club. Let us consider the horse racing industry and the extent of its funding. What percentage goes towards the treatment of injuries, re-homing and animal welfare initiatives? Prize money accounts for more than half of the total expenditure of Horse Racing Ireland, the bulk of which goes to a specific group of racehorse owners, yet many stable staff, some of whom are on minimum wage, are enduring poor working conditions. The provision of funding could be contingent on meeting certain conditions, although I do not know why the horse racing industry cannot fund itself. The horses that make the grade are treated very well, but what about the ones that do not? We have been told about bleeding lungs and gastric ulcers. How much of the fund goes towards treating injuries? We also know about the money that is filtered down from Horse Racing Ireland to hunt clubs via point to point meeting grants. When we consider the funding going to the industry and that going to the animal welfare organisations, there is absolutely no match, yet the animal welfare organisations are picking up the pieces. There is hypocrisy in that regard. We have to be consistent; there has to be an adequate and a proper follow-up to the abuse of animals.

I express my support for the small trainers. They are greyhound men and women and genuine people. Never in their lives would they engage in activity such as mistreating their animals, drugging dogs or engaging in any of that nonsense. They are respectable people whom I admire. I go to the greyhound track in Tralee. A person could not go to a better place on a Friday or a Saturday night. It is a great fund-raiser. Local community groups, schools and GAA clubs use the facilities where people come together. It is a great place for young people and children to go to because it is safe and they enjoy it. It is a great community activity. However, I cannot get my head around how it is acceptable for a person who drugs a dog and has that unfair advantage to run that dog again. We all know that the dog is innocent and does not take the drugs. However, if it tests positive a week or two or three weeks later, how can the person in question run it again? It is the person who is wrong.  I fully support the greyhound industry. I am behind every person involved in it. For the small greyhound breeders and those who love a little win now and then, it balances their books a little if they receive some prize money. For God's sake, tackle the unfair advantage which I describe as the criminal element. Anyone who drugs a dog is engaging in a criminal act.

It is a wonderful industry in which many people are employed. Like previous speakers, I am very concerned about doping or drugs being used. That practice must be rooted out and we must come down heavily on it because those involved are tarnishing the name of this good and wonderful industry. Clonmel track is located in my constituency. Think about all of the pleasure and enjoyment it and coursing give. Think also about the spin-offs, the money and industry that go into it. I ask Deputies Paul Murphy, Maureen O'Sullivan and others who oppose it to come to see the industries that surround it. Everyone who has a dog has to have a kennel, avail of veterinary services, have tackle, foodstuffs and everything else that goes with it. I am all for the industry and want to support it. Like others, I support the amendment to the 2015 Act on betting tax. The rate is too low at 1%. It is not too low, however, for the small men who are part of the culture and heritage - the bookies we meet on the dog and horse racing courses. They are part and parcel of that heritage and culture, as well as the fun, enjoyment and banter, something we must protect. I support the small bookies who must be supported. They employ people, pay rates and everything else.  I also challenge the Minister to do something for small racehorse owners. I am not talking about the Coolmore Stud or the big syndicates and trainers. Think about the rates charged and the small trainers who must be supported. We talk about rural proofing legislation, but we are not rural proofing anything, rather we are trying to destroy everything that is good in rural areas.  We must also look at the carry-on of the big conglomerates which I now call vulture funds. We have our own in County Tipperary which is home-grown. We have great prowess with horses and in winning races, but we must look at the wages they pay and the way they are buying and gobbling up all of the land available. They are no better than vulture funds, which is a shame. While I acknowledge their prowess with horses and in providing enjoyment, it has now gone too far. Let me address the issue of animal cruelty which is now wholesale. I challenge Deputy Paul Murphy and all of the others who are against coursing to come and see the marauding gangs of criminals who are out today and and will be out tonight lamping. There are five, six or ten of them with five or six dogs chasing after one hare or any other animal they meet, but neither the ISPCA nor anyone else is controlling them. I invite the Deputies and others to come to the coursing meeting in Clonmel at the end of January. It is a wonderful festival which is almost upon us. It is worth approximately €6 million to Clonmel and we want to support and keep it. We want the naysayers to turn their attention to the marauding gangs. They are the ones about whom they are always talking. We know who they are. When a man meets 60 of them on a bridge in Ballycarron in Golden and takes numbers, three of them wearing balaclavas will approach him. It is time the mob was cleaned up.  It sickens me to my very being to hear Deputy Paul Murphy and others worry about greyhounds and hares when they do not mind the slaughter of innocent unborn babies. Every day of the week they are looking for abortion. I have just left the committee from where it is all coming. I am disgusted. They cannot wait to have it - save the hares and kill unborn babies. It is fairly warped thinking.

“Renaming of Family Income Supplement
9. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall review the operation of the Working Family Payment, including the requirement that you must be working 19 hours per week, 38 hours per fortnight, to qualify for the payment, and shall bring forward a report to the Committee on Social Protection on same within 6 months of this Bill being enacted.”.I tabled this amendment because something could usefully be gained from what I am proposing. The working family dividend was the Government's big idea. It was suggested it was working on a wonderful system called the working family dividend or working family payment that would, at a stroke, eliminate poverty traps and ensure everybody was paid a reasonable wage and that nobody would have an incentive not to work. There is a system in place that makes it attractive for people on low wages to stay in employment, namely, family income supplement. We asked the Minister on several occasions whether, if the working family payment was introduced, family income supplement would survive in some form. For a long time we were informed that there was no decision on that matter. Eventually, the Minister told me that it would survive but as a subsection of the working family payment. Now we find that in the budget family income supplement has simply been renamed the working family payment. In the Fine Gael election manifesto there was a paragraph on family income supplement and all of its drawbacks. While it has proved to be a useful scheme, costing the taxpayer several hundred million euro, nevertheless it has a certain number of drawbacks. In certain circumstances it creates poverty traps. My understanding, from my communication with the Minister and various committee exchanges we had, is that it is her objective to improve the newly entitled family working payment, remove some of the anomalies that make it less attractive to work and make it more attractive not just to go out to work but also to work longer hours, if in work. If the Minister produced a detailed report, over six months, and introduced it to the committee responsible for dealing with social protection issues, other committee members and I would have a number of suggestions to make on how the incentive could be improved in order that more people would benefit from it and it would really achieve what it was designed to achieve. That conversation would be useful and could ultimately result in a saving to the Exchequer. If more people are encouraged to go out to work who are not encouraged to do so now, or if people are encouraged to work longer hours, they will be paying tax, which will obviously be of benefit to the Exchequer. If we do this properly, it will probably be cost neutral. I would appreciate it if the Government accepted my amendment in order that the report could be prepared and we could all have an input and make suggestions, from our working knowledge of family income supplement, on how the benefit could be improved to achieve its intended objective.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	375	I will be supporting the amendment. Deputy Willie O'Dea is correct. In the run-up to the last general election the working family payment was the big new idea from Fine Gael. It was nearly the only big issue on which its members were running, but there was no substance other than the name, and there was much questioning. There were no ideas, only statements to the effect that there would be analysis and that more detail would be brought forward on the payment. There was an expectation that it would be forthcoming in the run-up to the taking of the Social Welfare Bill, but all we have got is a name change from "family income supplement" to the "working family payment". There was a lot of hype and absolutely no substance whatsoever. There is much concern about family income supplement, as it stands. In particular, there is a lot of precarious employment. There are zero-hour contracts. Essentially, family income supplement supplements employers to continue with precarious employment and zero-hour contracts, etc. Therefore, considerable issues arise. It is only when we introduce an acceptable living wage that this issue will be tackled. I will certainly be supporting the Fianna Fáil amendment which proposes that a report be produced within six months on the serious anomalies identified and what needs to be done to ensure those who need the payments most receive them. There are serious concerns. There are some good employers, but there are also some who are exploiting workers and using family income supplement, or the working family payment, as it is now to be called, to supplement low pay levels.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	376	I thank Deputies Willie O'Dea and John Brady for their contributions. I do not propose to accept the amendment. Let me state why. In the context of budget 2018, it was decided to redesignate the family income supplement scheme as the working family payment scheme, which will give it more visibility as a payment aimed specifically at working families. The new name better reflects the nature of the payment and the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection encourages families to determine whether they are eligible to receive it. The Department has, as part of the process to develop a working family payment, already carried out a comprehensive analysis of the range of supports available to working families with children, including, of course, family income supplement. It established an internal working group and an interdepartmental group, comprising representatives of relevant Departments, and issued an open call for submissions to inform its work. Therefore, a lot of work has been done on this issue. The results of the analysis are confirmed by the ESRI's research into the Department's existing in-work measures. The analysis demonstrates that existing in-work supports are effective and work well in assisting individuals in making the transition from unemployment to employment. The paper that resulted from the analysis of the current system concluded that the ideal approach was the introduction of a package of targeted changes to existing schemes rather than the introduction of a new scheme. The Minister has stated it is her intention to continually review the package of supports offered to working parents to ensure they are meeting their objectives. In 2018 there will be an increase in the working family payment-family income supplement income thresholds of €10 for families with up to three children. Over 80% of families in receipt of family income supplement have one, two or three children. The name change will come into effect on 1 January 2018. It will be accompanied by a national promotion and information campaign designed to encourage as many eligible families as possible to apply for the working family payment.  While it would be useful to give time to allow for the effects of the promotional campaign to become clear – this is important – I appreciate that Deputy Willie O'Dea has specific concerns about the scheme such as the impact of the hours worked threshold. It is worth mentioning in that regard that the number of hours associated with the working family payment-family income supplement hours worked criterion has been reduced significantly since the introduction of the scheme, from 30 hours per week to the current 19. It is important to state the working family payment must not become a vehicle for subsidising unsustainably low earnings or encouraging and incentivising employers to offer minimal hours of employment. The House will be aware that for low-income workers with less than the minimum hours of employment for family income supplement who work on a casual basis for up to three days a week, the jobseeker's allowance or benefit scheme provides in-work income support through daily disregards and tapered withdrawal of payments. I always like to end on a good note. The Minister is happy to confirm that she is prepared to bring a paper before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection within six months that will review the operation of the working family payment and include a detailed consideration of the hours worked criterion of the scheme. She has informed me that she will write to the Chairman in the next day or so to confirm this in writing. Against that background, I hope Deputy Willie O'Dea will not press the amendment because the Minister will carry out a review and notify the committee to that effect in writing.

He has told me that the amounts will be raised. We know this from the Budget Statement. He has also told me that there will be an information campaign. We can have an information campaign at any time. We are saying each and every member of the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection has ideas because of his or her experience of dealing with constituents and their problems on a regular basis. He or she is aware of the anomalies and knows how the system could be improved to rectify the anomalies. That is very important. The Minister of State has given me an assurance that the Minister will continue to review the position and that at some stage in the next six months she will bring a report to the relevant committee, but that is not what I am asking for in the amendment. What I am seeking is that the Minister commission a specific report on the issue and have it discussed by the committee. I have given her six months in which to do so, which is not unreasonable. I will not withdraw the amendment. I will press it because this is something we want to be sure will happen. The committee should be given that opportunity and it should be written into the legislation. I do not see what the problem is.

We all know that. We are concerned about the people who are working a small number of hours every day who do not qualify for jobseeker's allowance or do not have the other options to which the Minister of State referred. We are not prescriptive about the outcome. We are looking for the research and analysis because we are meeting individuals who are working part time, who are working three or four hours a day, four or five days a week. They work less than 19 hours a week and seem to be caught in a trap, which is why we are looking for a report on the specific issue to advise us. We have the anecdotal evidence and met the people concerned in our constituency offices. We are looking for the issue to be placed on a proper footing in order that we can make informed and advised decisions.

What is important is that we specifically encourage the taking up of employment among low-income families with children. The objective of the working family payment is to minimise the labour market disincentives for parents to take up work, to prevent in-work poverty among households with children and to tackle child poverty through the provision of income support for low-income workers with children. A lot of research has gone into the issue and the analysis shows that the existing in-work supports have been effective in assisting individuals in the transition back to work. The Minister has gone a long way on the issue. She is happy to confirm that she is prepared to bring a paper before the Joint Committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection where a lot of work is done. The Minister undertakes to complete the review within six months. She will examine all of the criteria, including the issue covered in Deputy Willie O'Dea's amendment of the number of hours worked. She will write to the Chairman of the committee in that regard. I urge the Deputies opposite to wait and see what will happen. This is a new era. Family income supplement has been in place since 1984 and things have changed since. What is most important is that we look after low-income families and encourage them to work. The Deputies should give the Minister a chance to look at the issue in the next six months and produce a report. We can work on the issue through the committee system.

“Exceptional Needs Payment
15. Section 201 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005 is amended by the insertion of "which is not necessarily unforeseen" after "to meet an exceptional need".".As the Minister of State will be aware, the exceptional needs payment fulfils a very important role in society. The amount of money involved amount to only a tiny fraction of the total budget for social protection. On 7 November, the Minister indicated that the total budget for single exceptional needs amounts to €31.5 million. I note that 9,400 payments were made in November 2016 and 9,100 payments were made in December 2016. The number of applicants who secured an exceptional needs payment averaged roughly 8,000 or 9,000 per month in 2016. However, statistics are not kept on the number of people and families whose applications for a payment were refused. As a result, we cannot take a global view of the payment and identify what percentage of applications are approved and rejected. This is a lacuna because the payment gives us an insight into the stresses suffered by citizens and families, particularly in the pre-Christmas period when they face additional stresses such as cold weather, additional payments for heating and clothing and so forth. The exceptional needs payment scheme is demand led, as the Minister indicated to me in reply to a question. In my information clinics I have been finding that people with an exceptional need for their family or for themselves are increasingly being refused a payment on the basis that the guidelines issued by the Department to its officials and deciding officers stress that the need must be not only exceptional but also unforeseen. I contend that there is no basis in the legislation for such an approach. I read over section 201 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, which states: "The Executive or deciding officer may, in any case where the Executive or deciding officer considers it reasonable, having regard to all the circumstances of the case, so to do, determine or decide that supplementary welfare allowance shall be paid to a person by way of a single payment to meet an exceptional need." My amendment proposes to add the words "which is not necessarily unforeseen" after the words "to meet an exceptional need". I do so on the basis of the recent experiences I have outlined, which I believe are shared by other public representatives and agencies working to try to protect the most vulnerable families. One example I encountered involved a person whose grandmother had a fatal illness. When the issue of funeral expenses arose following the grandmother's death, it was stated that while this may have been an exceptional expense for the family, it was not an unforeseen expense. The test in the 2005 legislation is that the payment may be made if exceptional conditions arise. It appears the Department is erecting a further hurdle to make it more difficult to secure an exceptional needs payment. The Department's interpretation in this matter is incorrect because the statutory test is one of exceptional need. To add a further hurdle that the need must also be unforeseen is, I believe, unlawful. In a judicial decision in 2016 in the case of McE v. Residential Institutions Redress Board, Mr. Justice Hogan gave an explanation of the meaning of the word "exceptional". It is clear from this decision that exceptional means "exceptional circumstances simpliciter", with the standard of exceptionality measured by reference to contemporary standards prevailing within the public. As such, if someone has a serious illness and needs a once-off payment for a winter jacket, his or her case is exceptional as per the ordinary meaning of the word. If the Department tries to argue that the circumstances involved are not unforeseen, it is effectively changing the rules. The starting point for many people would be that "exceptional" and "unforeseen" are completely separate concepts. It is clear from the Oxford English Dictionary that these concepts do not overlap in their meaning. The question one must ask, therefore, is whether something can be exceptional and also foreseen and the answer, of course, is yes. This means the Department's rationale is incorrect because the statutory test is one of exceptional simpliciter, rather than exceptional and unforeseen. Another example I have been given is that if somebody had a cancer of the knee and following surgery had to have special footwear, that is an exceptional need the person would qualify for the payment. However, the Department seems to be taking the view that if the person applied the following year for a follow-up for this exceptional need, because it was foreseen in light of the operation, it would not be provided. It is a serious matter. I note there has been a legal challenge to this in the High Court in recent days where an effort is being made to bring the Department back to the legislation that we have and not to be erecting another hurdle. The scheme involves a small amount of funding from the Department. In my experience, it has played an important role down through the years in alleviating real suffering for citizens. I have been disappointed, particularly in the last 18 months, to find increasingly that this exceptional and unforeseen rule is being used. I ask the Minister of State to accept the amendment to the consolidated Act to return the situation to the status quo ante and to proceed on that basis to deliver the exceptional need, which may well have been foreseen, to assist constituents.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	393	I cannot accept this amendment. The legislation providing for exceptional needs payments is set out in section 201 of the Social Welfare (Consolidation) Act 2005, as amended, and provides that an exceptional needs payment can be paid to meet an exceptional need where the officer considers it reasonable having regard to all the circumstances of the case. The legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement to a payment. The principal consideration in making an exceptional needs payment is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need which is not of an expected or recurring nature and is, therefore, unforeseen. The Department has issued guidelines to staff administering exceptional needs payments to assist them in the decision-making process. However, these do not affect the discretion available to officers in issuing an exceptional needs payment to assist an individual or household in any particular hardship situation which may arise. That word "discretion" is important. The officers on the ground know exactly each individual case. They understand the cases that come before them. That discretion is available and it is important that it is used. Exceptional needs payments provide support to those most vulnerable. To date in 2017, 94,000 payments have issued at a cost of €34 million covering varying needs from rent deposits to housing kit-outs to clothing and travel. I am satisfied that the discretion available to officers in the administration of this scheme ensures that these payments target those most in need of assistance and the proposed amendment is not required. I will talk to Deputy Broughan afterwards. If the Deputy has individual cases of persons who are in such need, I would ask him to bring them to the attention of the Minister who will look into them for him.

That is the reason I tabled the amendment. The Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, told me, when I raised it with her on 7 November, as the Minister of State has repeated here, that the legislation does not confer a statutory right or entitlement and that, "The principal consideration in making a payment under the ENP scheme is to address a particular once-off and exceptional need which is not of an expected or recurring nature and is therefore unforeseen." I would contend that the unforeseen aspect of it is illegal. We did not put that in primary legislation. I cannot recall who was Minister in 2005. That was not the intention. A primary consideration down through the years with the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection's budget has always been keeping it inside €19 billion or €20 billion, even though we provide half of that budget through our social insurance payments. Especially in any kind of assistance payments, the funding is a significant consideration. The exceptional needs scheme is being further restricted at a time when it is needed more than ever when there are such crises affecting families. The Minister of State mentioned, as the Minister stressed on 7 November last, that there is this discretionary power available. Many believe the quasi-judicial powers that the Department has relating to appeals etc. should be placed on a statutory basis. When I was a spokesman on social protection, that was something I tried to bring forward. The significant discretion and quasi-judicial power that officers have, that is set out in legislation but also expanded on in guidelines, can be very unfair. It is regrettable that the Department does not keep statistics on the applications overall. It would be a useful database for the CSO and for society generally. The key point is that the Minister is misusing the 2005 Act by adding a key legislative provision, namely, this idea of being unforeseen which was not in the legislation, which was not intended, which is new, and which this House should legislate for. I would like to legislate that it not be in the Act and that the unforeseen idea be excluded.

The review was used as a basis for guidelines in 2012-2013. We will keep this scheme under review and look at it again to see whether it supports those it needs to support. As I stated, it is important that the social welfare officers on the ground use their discretion in exceptional cases, such as those the Deputy mentioned. There are exceptional cases because 94,000 payments have issued to date in 2017 at a cost of €34 million. There is a major cost but no doubt it is important for those who are in dire straits. As I stated, if the Deputy has particular cases, he can bring them to the attention of the Minister.

The Minister will publish the report on the effects of the 2012 pension bands and rates changes immediately after it has been considered by the Cabinet.”.This amendment reflects the problem that was created by the changes introduced by the former Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Burton, back in 2012, which basically created a two-tier system of contributory pensions, depending on when a person was born. It has given rise to several anomalies which have been well thrashed out, both in the committee and in this House. The Minister first commissioned a report within her Department and that report is to be referred to a Cabinet sub-committee, which will examine it and send recommendations to Cabinet. What I am simply proposing here, to keep this thing moving along and in order that we will not have to wait until the next budget for changes in this vital area, is that the report and recommendations be published immediately they have been considered by the Cabinet. This is a reasonable amendment and is along the lines of a commitment already given by the Minister. I urge the Government to accept it.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	398	I have put forward amendment No. 15, which is very similar to amendment No. 12 in the name of Deputy John Brady. On Committee Stage we agreed we would table a similar amendment to ensure the Minister comes back to us with that report - or a paper, as she put it - on the 2012 changes and what they mean for these women, in the main, and men. We have gone through a long process and do not wish to repeat ourselves. However, I reiterate that what was done to this cohort of pensioners was one of the most brutal attacks on older women and men in this country. The then Minister, Deputy Burton, was standing where the Minister of State is now, defending the indefensible while slashing lone parents' payments, in particular the access of children of eight, nine and ten years to such payments, as well as slashing disability payments and pensions. The list goes on. There is no protection, given this was done in the pure knowledge of the Department. In March 2013, the journalist Conor Ryan wrote that the Department of Social Protection was aware that thousands would lose out but implemented the policy regardless. The Department, with Deputy Burton as Minister, offered some measure of restitution by introducing a homemaker's credit scheme but responsibility for this was passed to the Department of Finance, which thus far has insisted the money is not there for a scheme. The Minister for Finance has called what has happened "bonkers", a word which has been used quite regularly. I cannot understand how the Minister was so surprised given that he came into the Dáil and voted for this change to the pensions in 2012 and voted for all the other cuts in the 2012 budget. If this is not resolved, and if this paper does not come back with a clear trajectory as to how it is going to be resolved within a clear timeframe, both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil will suffer. Fianna Fáil had a chance to make a difference to this budget. It could have insisted this was changed but it simply came back later on with a Private Members' Bill and is only now making an issue of it. It will be held accountable by the elderly people of this country and its members are familiar with the wrath of those elderly people who do not take it lying down when they are literally walked over.I urge the Minister of State to accept this amendment and that in the name of Deputy Brady - the Deputy will speak on it himself - and to revert to us as quickly as possible with a transparent strategy.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	400	I support the amendment tabled by my colleague, Deputy O'Dea. Some of us have been raising this anomaly since 2012. It is not this year alone that we have raised it or the difficulties that have been caused, in particular to women who left insurable employment to take up full-time work at home caring for children, elderly parents or siblings. We all know of many individuals and families who have been caused hardship by the method of calculating pension entitlements. Many of us know of people who worked alongside a colleague who, despite having made ten full years of 52 contributions per year prior to reaching pension age or a yearly average of more than 48, is now on a reduced pension. I recently encountered a case. Back when a person was young and about to emigrate to England to take up a particular trade, his family got him two weeks work in a similar business in Dublin through a contact. It was done to give him some experience before emigrating to London to start an apprenticeship. When he retired, he returned to Ireland some years subsequently, having paid his insurance contributions over many years. However, his entitlement is now calculated starting from the two insurance contributions that were credited to him when he was young. He did not even know that his employer, who did everything above board, had paid those contributions. Following the Department assessing his entitlement, he has a much reduced pension because the employer paid two stamps for him, followed by a long time lag before he returned to Ireland. My colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and Curran, have made strong cases on Second Stage and Committee Stage. I strongly support Deputy O'Dea's recommendation and ask the Minister to revert quickly with a report with a view towards enacting measures to eliminate anomalies and ensure that people are not denied their entitlements.

As has been rightly pointed out, this problem has affected people - mostly women, but some men as well - across the country. The Dáil has debated this matter previously. It has been called bonkers and several other things. At the end of the day, however, many people have been treated as second-class citizens in terms of their pensions. What was done in 2012 was wrong, so the Government should address the matter, particularly when it and everyone else in the House recognises that there is a problem. There is no good in claiming to be giving things to different parts of society if people are still getting the wrong pensions. It is intolerable. We have discussed the slogan "Keep the Recovery Going" and how it is good to see more people working, but this matter should be given priority. I will back the amendment 100%.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	403	I have a great sense of déjà vu. Last year, we tried to pass a similar amendment. That amendment called on the Minister to produce a report within three months. That was amended by the then Minister for Social Protection, the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, to the effect that he would produce a report within six months. One year later and there is no sign of that report, but I remind everyone that that is probably because Deputy Varadkar was busy trying to become the Taoiseach and running a social welfare campaign declaring that welfare cheats were cheating us all. In fact, pension cheats cheat us all. That is what the Taoiseach has been guilty of. In the ten months since promising to do so, he has failed to produce a report on the matter. I am all for supporting this and the other amendments on producing a report, but I will not hold my breath for the current Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, or the Minister of State sitting opposite to deliver. However, I am encouraged by the Minister's utterances about wanting to see this changed, that she is going to deliver on it and that, although she does not have the money now, she will find it within 12 months, if not sooner. She has acknowledged that the pensioners are protesting and kicking back, albeit in much smaller numbers than they did when Fianna Fáil withdrew their medical cards. They are beginning to mobilise, and I thank all of the Deputies who came out to the gates to speak to them, encourage them and show solidarity with them more than a week ago. It is not good enough to say "I will, I will, I will" any more. I am sorry, but I do not believe it. The proof is in the pudding. The pudding in this case is the Taoiseach and his behaviour, for example, that he is doing all of this for those who get up early in the morning. I am encountering many pensioners who got up early every morning for many years only to be told that they were not worth the full whack when they came to pension age. The new bands, which were introduced as an austerity measure at the behest of the troika and encouraged by those who were prepared to co-operate with the troika and bail out the banks at whatever cost, are now impacting on people - mainly women, but also men - who have worked for all of their lives and are now being told that they are not worth a full pension and will have to accept less. It is extraordinary that we can pay millions of euro to lawyers in Europe so that we do not have to accept Apple's tax but we cannot look after our pensioners, those who worked hard for all of their lives. Many of the people we met outside the gates last week were testament to that. Not only did they work, but they also reared their families and looked after the elderly. Later, I will speak on amendment No. 7, which deals with the question of the homemaker in particular. That is a slightly separate issue, although it has been grouped with these amendments. It impacts more profoundly on women than just the making of the bands.

I just lost a minute to that explanation, so I will take it back. The question of inequality for pensioners has been well rehearsed in the House. Each of these amendments asks for a report. Can we have that report? Can we not for once walk away from the Chamber having been told that we will get it and then actually get it? I do not know how many times this issue has been raised by various Deputies during Questions on Promised Legislation throughout the year only for there to have been no response. The then Minister could conduct a campaign against what he called welfare cheats, most of whom were found not to have been cheating at all, just to ensure that he got the leadership. They were probably over-claiming by errors that were often made on the part of departmental staff. I wish to discuss the women who suffered because they made their homes prior to 1994. It is a bit like saying that they were worth something after 1994 but were worthless before it, even though they were doing the same job, namely, rearing and washing children, cleaning, cooking, looking after children's health and ensuring that there they were ready to go out into society as the next generation of workers. They made their homes and looked after the elderly, the sick and the disabled. If they did that after 1994, the State will look after them. If they did it prior to 1994, they can go to hell. We all know why. It was carefully mapped out by civil servants and the troika so that the impact of people retiring would hit immediately by 2013 or 2014 under this measure whereas, for those who retired in 1994, it would be many years before it would hit.It is all about saving pennies at the expense of ordinary people for no other reason than to bail out the banks. There is a longer-term ambition on the part of the Government to reduce pensions and the awards received by people who have worked all of their lives, to lengthen people's working lives and force people away from a transitionary year so that they have to sign on for jobseeker's allowance. There was a little bit of good news today, whereby public servants can, if they choose, work until they are 70 years of age, but that must remain a choice rather than a compulsion. We would argue that the transitionary pension has to be restored.  I do not know if it will be possible to address all of those issues, because they are all a result of what happened in 2012. The question of the transitionary pension, people being forced to work longer and having to sign on for jobseeker's allowance and being worthless prior to 1994 as a homemaker but valued afterwards all need to be addressed. The Bill is a mechanism to penalise a sector of society in order to save coppers. This has to be utterly condemned. It is a clear case of discrimination on the grounds of gender and age.  As I said to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, should we be in a position to take a case to a European Court, I have no doubt that we would emphatically win it. I hope we do not have to do that, but I would encourage all pensioners to help the Minister to find the money. She said she would find the money within 12 months, if possible. They should get outside the gate on a date in the new year and protest again. That will help the Minister to find the money. She will listen, her eyes will open and she and the rest of the Cabinet will find the money somewhere to address this grave injustice.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	415	I am speaking in support of amendment No. 12 in my name. I will also support the other amendments. We are discussing one of the biggest crimes the Fine Gael and Labour Government perpetrated on our older citizens. We know over 42,000 older people are directly impacted by the heinous cuts made in 2012 in the full knowledge of their consequences and impact on older citizens. The cuts were made without any consultation or debate whatsoever, and we are now living with the consequences. It is predominately women who are affected, but a sizeable number of men are also directly impacted by the changes. We know the impact that cuts of €35 or €40 per week can have on our older citizens. Sinn Féin and others have raised this issue continuously since 2012. One of my first actions as a newly elected Deputy was to move a motion on this issue last year. It was a major issue in my constituency clinic and I brought forward a motion which, unfortunately, did not get full support across the House. However, it raised serious awareness of the issue. Fianna Fáil moved a similar motion recently. It is bizarre that in its budget negotiations it did not see fit to address this serious problem facing our older citizens. This matter was dealt with extensively in the Joint Committee on Social Protection and there were amendments on Committee Stage. The Minister, Deputy Doherty, under questioning on Committee Stage said a report had be commissioned and carried out. She said a number of weeks ago that she hoped to bring the report to a Cabinet sub-committee in the near future, but did not give a date - she may have said it would happen this week - and would then bring it to Cabinet.  I tabled an amendment calling for the report to be published within a three-month timeframe. The Minister said she is serious about the issue and wants to make the necessary changes to reverse the cuts made in 2012. She is using similar language to that of her predecessor, the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar. She has referred to winners and losers in the process. The easiest way to deal with the issue is a total reversal of the 2012 changes. The Government has referred to a lack of money. Reversing the cuts would cost €70 million. Sinn Féin included the measure in its prebudget submission and showed exactly where the money would come from. It comes down to political choices. In their budgetary negotiations neither Fine Gael nor Fianna Fáil saw this as a priority. However, it is a priority for the 42,000 older citizens who are being discriminated against by the Government. I referred earlier to the fact that Labour Party Deputies are not present. In votes on previous amendments only one or two Labour Party Deputies were present. We are dealing with proposals to try to rectify the faults of the previous Government. One of the main architects of that was the former Minister, Deputy Joan Burton, who is absent. That is despicable, given that she was the Minister who brought in these changes in the full knowledge of their impact on older women, in particular, and other citizens. She is not present for the debate and is not acknowledging the failures over which she presided. She is not working on a way forward to reverse the cuts. We are getting mixed messages from the Government on this, even though there is a spin unit which costs the taxpayer €5 million. While the current Minister, Deputy Doherty, talks about hoping to put in place measures in the near future to deal with this in the run-up to next year's budget, the Taoiseach is talking about 2021 when we move to the total contribution system. We need a clear message from the Government. It is either serious about this or it is window-dressing.  The key to all of this is the report which examines the changes made in 2012 and, more importantly, what will be done to reverse them. I will conclude with a word of caution. There can be no losers in terms of rectifying the faults. The solution is a total reversal of the changes made in 2012. There can be no more losers; there has been enough losers up to this point. Some 42,000 of our older citizens have lost out as a direct consequence of the decisions of this Government and previous Governments.  I may be naive or foolish, but I am taking the Minister, Deputy Doherty, at her word when she says she will bring the report to a Cabinet sub-committee and then to Cabinet. She said that would take place before Christmas. My amendment calls for the immediate publication of the report following its presentation to the Cabinet so that we can see the impact of the 2012 changes and, more importantly, what is being done to rectify the situation and put money back in people's pockets. We cannot afford to wait until next year's budget. The numbers are increasing year-on-year. In the last year alone, 8,000 or 9,000 older people have been directly impacted by the cuts. The matter needs to be addressed as quickly as possible. Kicking the issue down the road for another year simply will not wash with our older citizens.

It is an issue I have raised constantly in the Dáil and Cork County Council, of which I was a member when the change was made in 2012. It was a very harsh cut which was slipped in under the radar. It appeared that it only impacted on a small number of people initially, but as people reached pension age more and more were hit by the change. As we know, many lost out by up to €30 a week.It is cutting people who stepped outside the PRSI net when they were perhaps doing caring or family homemaker roles. The cut was as much as €30 per week. It is not just this week but every week for the rest of their lives. This needs to be addressed. The fact that this is discriminatory by age has been mentioned and I should reinforce it. People with the very same record of contributions have different pensions just because one person reached pension age after 2012. That discrimination by age is not right and it should be dealt with. I have raised the matter before with a previous Minister responsible for social welfare, the now Taoiseach, who said at the time that there would be winners and losers. We know that right now everybody is a loser and the matter must be dealt with. We understand a report has been commissioned and it is due before Cabinet soon enough. There is no reason to hold back and once the information is available, it should be let out in order that we can get working on the solution. There is no need to allow this to continue any longer if there is a way of dealing with the problem. I encourage the Government and all Deputies to support the amendment to make this information available. We know there is something wrong and there is no reason to hold back. We should get on and deal with solutions.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	417	I will move amendment No. 14 when I get a chance. It calls for urgent action and a report on this incredible injustice that was done to a major cohort of our citizens in the 2012 budget when there was a change from four to six bands. This was based primarily on financial grounds, with the supporting documentation projecting so-called savings of approximately €45 million over a number of years. This followed the unfortunate cuts that were made by the Fianna Fáil Government from 2008, with changes made to the qualifying number of social insurance contributions. There was an effective doubling of these, from 250 to 520. This matter was part of that grotesque attack on some of our most vulnerable citizens. I raised this with the former Taoiseach, Deputy Enda Kenny, in February this year, arguing that it penalised the women of his own generation of people born in the late 1940s up through the 1960s who had to take a period out of the workforce to rear their children when we had very little crèche infrastructure or support for working mothers. After 2012, they found themselves in this devastating position. Like the previous speaker, week in and week out I have spoken to women approaching 66 who have said they were astonished to find, having worked for a considerable portion of their life, that their pension was going to be so much lower than they had expected. A very fine report was done on this by Age Action Ireland at the turn of the year. The researcher, Ms Maureen Bassett, set out very clearly the major impact that the cuts had on people and particularly those on the lower levels of contribution. She specifically outlined the effect on those with a rate of ten to 20 average contributions. Those with an average of 29 contributions ended up with just 85% of the maximum, and those with an average of 15 to 19 contributions ended up receiving a 10% lower sum than they had before 2012, down to 66% of the maximum. The bottom band with an average of ten to 15 contributions also received a 10% lower sum, leaving them with 40% of the maximum amount. The clear injustice of this was best expressed here by Professor Alan Barrett of the Economic and Social Research Institute who said the Government changed the rules of the game in the middle of the game. There was a system where women thought they were working towards a particular pension, but arbitrarily in 2012 the Government did this. The public relations spin at the time was that there were no cuts in the social welfare rates. The reality was that the then Minister, Deputy Noonan, had a very savage impact on an entire generation of women workers in particular, as 66% of the affected workers are women. It is a cohort of 40,000 plus and it is growing, and they feel very angry. I heard many of these senior and retiring citizens saying this deserves a serious legal challenge based on the exact point made by Professor Barrett and it cannot be allowed to endure. In debating the Social Welfare Bill and in putting questions to the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, and her predecessor, the current Taoiseach, I heard mention of working towards a position in 2021 and having some sort of restoration. From the figures supplied by the Minister, there does not seem to be any serious approach to doing that. We seem to be left with a position where, effectively, the suffering of these women workers, and some men, will go on as a gross injustice. The time has come for the Minister to come forward with a plan for restoration. My simple approach would be for the status quo ante for these workers, along with restoration of losses. We heard a fairly positive report today from the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council, whose representatives appeared before the Select Committee on Budgetary Oversight. They outlined the budget surpluses we hope to have in the next few years, barring a Brexit disaster, and one of the uses of those surpluses should be to do justice to this cohort of women workers who have reared their families and worked so hard. We are all sympathetic in this regard but the Minister has the power to implement change. It was a reprehensible decision in 2012 and the Bassett report demonstrates quite clearly that people knew this would have a very disproportionate impact on women workers. Unfortunately, a woman Minister for Social Protection let that go through in budget 2012, inflicting that suffering on those women. The Bassett report quotes the Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, which was adopted in 1979 by the United Nations. We ratified and signed it in 1995. We gave a commitment through the homemaker's scheme and the then regime for women's pensions that we would try to uphold that convention. I know the Bassett report also refers to the European Convention on Human Rights, Article 14 of which explicitly prohibits discrimination in how all the other convention rights should be enjoyed. This includes the equal enjoyment of all the rights of the European Convention on Human Rights. This includes pension rights for women workers. I urge the Minister to accept these amendments. I hope she will come forward and provide justice in this area.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	418	I support the amendment put forward by my colleague, Deputy O'Dea. Many of these amendments are very similar and it is worth pointing out they arise from the Committee Stage debate that we had. We withdrew the amendments on that Stage with a view to having amendments that reflected what the Minister said. This is important, as I am not bothered about the amendments but rather the action the Minister has said she will take. That is the key. Most of these amendments were written around what the Minister said on Committee Stage. This matter has been around the committee dealing with social protection for well over a year.There was an extensive debate on Committee Stage of the Bill, at which point talk emerged of a report. The proposal put forward was that the anomalies which have arisen as a result of the 2012 changes would be dealt with as part of the move from a total averaging system to a total contribution system. The then Minister spoke about bringing forward a report, but the report he envisaged was on a new pensions total contribution system. Significant progress has been made on this issue in the past year in so far as the Minister, Deputy Doherty, has identified the 42,000 people who were affected by the 2012 changes, two thirds of them women, and undertaken to deal with them as a specific individual cohort, separate from the roll-out of a new pension scheme. That is a significant advance on what we were looking at 12 months ago. There is now clarification that this is a stand-alone issue which uniquely impacts those people who were affected by the 2012 changes. We often talk about winners and losers when discussing a particular provision or measure, but there are no winners among these people. It is clearly unfair that they should be entitled to less than those who qualified for their pensions earlier. We cannot contemplate a system where there is an unfairness that leads to a large cohort of people losing out. The Minister appeared before the joint committee on Employment Affairs and Social Protection several weeks before the budget. In the course of our discussion, she asked members to identify a number of priority issues that she might be able to effect in the budget. As Chairman, my concluding remarks to her, after a long debate, were that the two issues of most importance were those on which we had issued reports to her, namely, the position of lone parents and the anomaly in entitlement to the contributory State pension. These were clearly identified as the two most significant issues that had emerged during the course of the committee's work. I was consequently disappointed when budget day came and the issue of the anomaly, which we had specifically raised, both in the Dáil and in committee, was not addressed in any way. I am glad that progress has since been made such that this group has been identified and the Minister has given clear indications that she will progress a solution for the group separate to the rolling out of a new total contribution pension system. That the matter is to be dealt with separately, as a stand-alone issue, is a vital consideration. To clarify, the Minister said specifically at the committee meeting that she would present a report on the matter to the next relevant Cabinet sub-committee, following which she would take it to the very next Cabinet meeting and thereafter publish it. It was in this context that members of the committee who were in attendance did not press amendments and undertook to draft new proposals that would reflect the undertaking given by the Minister. We do not want to wait three months or six months for that undertaking to be delivered. The Minister was very specific in giving us that commitment and, as such, her reputation is on the line. She gave a clear public undertaking to the committee and to individuals members and we wish to hold her to account for it. The issue has gone on too long. Part of the reason for her proposing to present the report to the sub-committee, the Minister told us, was that additional moneys would be required to implement its recommendations. That was clearly set out as a consideration in the timeframe she proposed for dealing with the matter. These amendments are reflective of that timeline. The Minister was to take the report to the relevant sub-committee and immediately thereafter to Cabinet. We hope the report she presents includes specific recommendations and will facilitate immediate change. On the question of more money being required, the reality is that, most years, savings are made in the Department. We cannot wait until the end of this year or until next year's budget before addressing the unfairness that was imposed on these people. A timeline must be set out for how they can recover the money they have lost. Parity must be re-established such that they are receiving the same level of funding as are those who retired before 2012. While publishing the report in the timely fashion the Minister has indicated she will do is important, the content and detail of that report are of equal importance. It must clearly show how we are to bring people up to the level of payment they would have received had the 2012 changes not been made. The committee was very specific in its report that the first step should be to suspend the 2012 changes, after which a discussion can take place on how to restore parity. I urge the Minister of State to accept amendment No. 4, because it is exactly reflective of what the Minister has said she intends to do. There is no conflict between what she has proposed and what is in the amendment. The Bill that is passed by these Houses should reflect what is not just the will of the Oireachtas but also what the Minister has committed to doing.

Those changes were made at a particular time, when a series of harsh decisions was implemented because of the problems facing the country. Many of those decisions were wrong, however, and some of them are being reversed. The anomaly we are discussing here is a case in point. It is discriminatory and wrong and requires immediate reversal. Colleagues have given examples of how people were caught out by it. Those people, predominantly women, who took time out for caring duties should not be penalised for having done so. They did it before the homemaker's scheme was in place and their contribution in caring for children or dependent older adults must be recognised. Equally, people should not be penalised because they started working very early, in many cases when they were still in school or college, and those early stamps are now distorting their entire record of contributions. It is wrong that one person should have an entitlement to a full State pension simply because their years of working were continuous while another person who might have more contributions but also has a gap in the middle is penalised. This is a glaring anomaly that must be addressed quickly on the grounds of fair play. When the Minister finally realised there was a problem, which took some time, she gave a strong commitment to close the anomaly. She was expressing her determination in this regard right up to budget time but, since then, it has changed to a determination to produce and publish a report. My concern is that there seems to have been an intervention by the Taoiseach, who, consistently and in spite of what the Minister said, has indicated his preference to address this issue by way of the move towards a total contribution model in 2020. That is not an adequate response to the women who find themselves facing discrimination in retirement. Introducing a total contribution scheme may have merits in its own right, but it will not address the problems faced by the 42,000 people who were caught by this particular austerity measure. I fully support the points made by colleagues and I urge the Minister of State to accept the amendment on behalf of the Minister. The latter must be held to account for the commitment she gave to address this issue.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	420	I do not intend to accept these amendments. I wish to point out that the current rate bands applying to the contributory State pension were introduced from September 2012, replacing previous rates introduced in 2000. The rate bands prior to 2000 were less generous and the improved rate bands introduced in 2000 were a feature of the economic and political environment at that time. The economic crash changed the focus and while other payments were reduced as a result, the core rates of the pension, on which many pensioners were solely dependent, were maintained. Instead, the rates for new pensioners who had additional means and lesser PRSI contribution records were reduced. The 2012 rate bands more closely reflect the social insurance contribution history of a person than those in place between 2000 and 2012. However, the current rate bands still provide pensions to people that are more generous than strictly proportionate with their level of contribution. A person with only 20 years of contributions over nearly 50 years will still get an 85% pension. This is an extremely good outcome for those people. It is estimated that to revert to the previous bands from January 2018 would result in an annual cost of well over €70 million in 2018 and this annual cost would increase by an estimated €10 million to €12 million each following year. The precise cost is difficult to arrive at as there would be new contributory pension claims made by people currently in receipt of either a non-contributory pension or an increase for qualified adult, IQA, payment. Most countries have a contributory pension and there is nothing anomalous about those persons who have fewer contributions having lesser entitlements to contributory benefits such as a pension. Outcomes under our State pension system are more equal than in most EU countries with average payments of State pension payments to men and women at about parity, unlike the significant disparities which exist in many other countries where lifetime earnings are part of the pension rate calculation. The Department is examining in depth various options that would provide some relief to those who would have a higher contributory pension had the rate bands not been amended in 2012. If there are equitable changes that target such relief to those who were particularly affected by anomalies under the yearly average system, particularly if they had homemaking periods prior to the introduction of the homemakers' scheme, the Minister will ask the Government to consider if and how these might be financed. As soon as the report is finished, the Minister intends to bring it to the next Cabinet committee on pensions, in which Members appear to be interested, which takes place just after Christmas on 18 January. Following that she will bring proposals to Government for consideration. This is a priority for the Minister and the Department and I do not consider it necessary to insert a statutory obligation and a timeline on a piece of work that is already in progress. The Minister made a commitment on Committee Stage of this Bill to take these steps and to publish the final report. There is no need for these amendments. Including a reference to "Cabinet" is not good legislative practice because there is an obligation on the Cabinet to be confidential and the word is normally not used in legislation as it could create a risk of ambiguity across the Statute Book. The Minister has given a commitment and this will go before the Cabinet sub-committee on pensions on 18 January. As soon as the Cabinet meeting is finished she will publish its considerations and the option papers. I ask Members to reconsider their amendments given that the Minister will do this when the Dáil returns after Christmas.

We are looking for a report which went to Government to be published after the Government has considered it. We are looking to bring about something the Minister promised and I tried to draft the amendment to reflect exactly what the Minister said in committee. I do not distrust the Minister and I take her at face value. She once said she did not trust us but I do not reciprocate that distrust as I believe what she says. If she is sincere about it, what is the problem with the amendment? Deputy Bríd Smith referred to an unfortunate experience when we were promised certain things that did not materialise.

We were told the paper was ready and would be presented at sub-committee level, and hopefully at full Cabinet level, before Christmas but now we are being told it is being pushed back to a sub-committee on 18 January. As she had indicated previously that it would be presented in November, this already means it will be three months later and it has not been published. I changed my amendment to reflect a commitment given by the Minister. The previous amendment was to hold Government to a three-month timeframe for the report, which has been finalised. We were told a comprehensive analysis of the data, paper and computerised, had been done but now we hear Cabinet confidentiality put forward as an excuse. It was the Minister who gave the rock-solid assurances that, if Members withdrew their amendments, she would bring it forward before Christmas. I will push my own amendment and support the other amendments. As Deputy Curran said, the Minister's reputation is now on the line. My patience is starting to grow thin. Maybe I am naive but I have given her the benefit of the doubt as a new Minister who seemed sincere. However, the timeframe is starting to drag on and the amendments have to be pushed.

I do not have the honour of being on the social protection committee but I used to ask the current Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, about this issue a lot when he was the relevant Minister and he understands the injustice that is being done. The current Minister, Deputy Doherty, answered a parliamentary question recently to the effect that restoration would cost €70 million and it would be a further cost of between €10 million and €12 million annually. She told me what she told the committee but it does not seem to be leading to a resolution. I asked Deputy Varadkar, as Minister, if he could make changes to the homemakers' scheme so as to give the same resources to the women who were most affected.The Minister, Deputy Doherty, mentioned this in her recent reply to me but she did not give any indication of the way in which she is going to address it. She went on to speak at length about the total contributions approach. My gut feeling is to support all the amendments and to move my own amendment. Will the Minister of State give us any encouragement tonight with regard to the thinking of the Minister as to how this matter could be resolved to bring about a fair restoration and remove this injustice which we all see every week?
#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	433	I support my colleague, Deputy O'Dea, and indeed all the speakers on this matter. We all know a terrible wrong was done which affects up to 40,000 people. I believe the Minister is sincere about tackling it but, a few short weeks ago, in late October I think, she said that there would not be a new system in place until 2020 and that a new contribution system would be in place by then. I would be afraid that this would be pushed out along the line and there could be a longer time for consultation. In reality, I do not think we can allow this matter to go on. We need to have it brought to a conclusion within months, if that can be done. I urge the Minister to deal with it as quickly as possible and the amendment must be supported. It was a dreadful mistake by the Labour Party at the time, as a part of the Government, to allow this to happen. That is history now, but we have to try to rectify it. I fully support the amendment from Deputy O'Dea because we all get people coming into us about this in our clinics all over the country. It is a big issue.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	434	I add my voice to those who are concerned that there has been a retreat by the Minister from the commitment she gave. I do not regard it as just a personal commitment from the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, but all of these things are parliamentary parlance. People say things to get others to move on, and make commitments that they do not believe they can actually stand over. The Minister might disagree with me but, if that is the case, we need an explanation as to why she is not able to stand over that commitment. Was there an intervention by the Minister for Finance at a Cabinet meeting or did the Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, say not to mind it since he got away with it for a whole year without issuing a report so the current Minister did not need to stick to her commitment? We need the figures, a report and we need to be able to verify what is being said about the cost of this and how and where it will be provided. Even if the figures of €70 million and €250 million or whatever it is are accurate, it is a drop in the ocean compared to what the State, and this and previous Governments have done and are prepared to do to bail out banks, pamper the rich, and look after developers and vulture funds. I could go on, but I will not. The Minister of State knows what I mean. I meant what I said earlier. We cannot let up the pressure on this issue. People need to get outside the Dáil to protest about this issue. It is not good enough just to leave it to pensioners. I am hurtling towards pension age as are many other workers. Unless we address this now, we will all find that we are impoverished by the time we reach 66. I believe the trade union movement and all NGOs that are concerned about the elderly should take this up as a mantra and ensure that the Minister, Deputy Regina Doherty, finds the money.

The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall review the impact of removing income generated from rent-a-room relief from the means test for those in receipt of the One Parent Family Payment and shall bring forward a report on the same within 6 months of this Bill being enacted.".This amendment requires yet another report, on the impact of removing income generated from rent-a-room relief from the means test for those in receipt of one-parent family payment. The Minister will be aware that we have a scheme called the rent-a-room scheme for tax purposes. It means that if somebody rents out a room in his or her house, that person can earn up to €14,000 per annum tax free. Unfortunately, a reciprocal arrangement does not operate for people in receipt of social protection payments. People in receipt of means-tested social welfare payments are means-tested on every cent from that rental income. I am focusing on lone parents in particular and of all the different groups, the poverty statistics among lone parents are very dramatic indeed. According to a small calculation I did, if a single parent looking after three children is earning €350 per week and renting a room for €80 per week, that person will only gain €35 because of the means test. This is a disincentive for people among the poorest group in society to earn a little extra income which they badly need. It is a classic poverty trap. I want a report to be done so that it can be referred to committee and we can point out, as I am sure we will be able to, that the financial consequences of this will be minuscule because, due the means tests that exist already, one will find that very few single parents rent out a room in their house. In many cases, they do not have any room to rent out. In other cases, the disincentive is so strong that it is just not worth their while to do it. Such a report would be worthwhile and we can work out the financial implications and discuss that at committee with a view to removing that anomaly and difference in tax treatment between renting out a room and the social welfare treatment when people are in receipt of means-tested social welfare payments in next year's budget.

“Review of Bereavement Grant
17. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall, within 6 months after the passing of this Act, prepare and lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas reviewing the abolition of the Bereavement Grant and setting out the options for restoring those grants.”.This is a worthwhile amendment but I apologise because I do not want the Minister to come back from Brussels or wherever she is and find that she suddenly has to write about 172 reports. We discussed this on Committee Stage and there were two things missing from my proposal then. One was a timeline so I have rectified that and put in six months. I think the Minister suggested on Committee Stage that I should have been more specific in what I was seeking but, for whatever reason, that does not appear to have happened. The loss of the bereavement grant resulted in €25 million being taken away from assisting people in the event of a death. I was talking to somebody at the weekend after a sad funeral in Limerick, and I assure Deputies that it was a no frills funeral. I imagine it was the cheapest possible funeral but when a member of the family volunteered to me how much it cost, I was absolutely shocked. It is getting more and more expensive to die. My own family had a sad bereavement recently and it brought home to me that when a family member dies, one has grief, anguish and pain. In that situation, one does not want to be going around to credit unions seeking to borrow money or, worse again, going to some vulture of a money lender who will clean out a person looking for money. I have come across problems at constituency level and I am sure others have also. There is a gap between the amount the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection is prepared to pay towards the cost of funeral expenses and the cost of the funeral.We will have to focus on that next year. Due to the lack of specificity, if that is the correct word, in my amendment, I will not press it.

This relates closely to the earlier discussion about exceptional needs payments. The explanation at the time was that undertakers' fees, etc., were being inflated because families were getting this support. It was helpful to families who had very little savings down through the years. As Deputy O'Dea said, people have to scramble around and go to the credit union and so on to try to come up with what seems to be an increasingly costly sad occasion. It is timely for us to begin to think about bereavement grants.

"Report on Jobseekers Allowance
17. The Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection shall, within six months of the passing of this Act, lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the impacts on young people under 24 and 26 years of age of the reduced levels of jobseekers allowance applicable to them and report further on reversing these reduced allowances.".This amendment speaks for itself. It seeks a report on why this Dáil continues to discriminate against young people. This Dáil probably does not believe it discriminates against young people but, under the legislation that is about to be passed, there will be different rates of social welfare payment for young people than for others, depending on whether those young people are under 24 or under 26. Although the amendment is only seeking a report on the impact of discrimination against young people, because of the reduced level of jobseeker's allowance applied to them I am sure it will meet the same opposition as the amendment seeking a report into the effects of the implementation of the homemaker's scheme and the denial of the associated benefit to people, mainly women, who made their homes prior to 1994. In a similar vein, we are discriminating against young people, young people under 24 in one bracket and young people under the age of 26 in another. Neither category is entitled to equality. The Taoiseach talks about a republic of opportunities. The affected young people are the very people to whom we should be giving opportunities but we start by being totally miserable with the payments they receive while they are dependent on social protection. That might seem like nothing to us in this House, as we earn very good money, and it may seem nothing to some who do not even know how much they earn because they are so wealthy. For young people who are entirely dependent on the jobseeker's allowance, it means an awful lot. An extra €10, €15 or €20 per week could make a huge difference in their lives. I want to ask an obvious question: does anybody really believe young people get a cheaper bus fare, cheaper rent or cheaper food than those over 26 or that it is easier for them to buy a pair of runners or raincoat than it is for those over 26?The entire measure is a nonsense. If one is unemployed and if one is available for work and is seeking work and cannot find it, then one should be treated the same as everybody else. That is an absolute necessity. The report is required because it would explain the thinking of the Cabinet and, in particular, the Ministers for Employment Affairs and Social Protection and Finance who say that the measures are necessary in order to balance the budget. I would like to hear what they believe in terms of discrimination against elderly people, older people or pensioners - whatever is the politically correct term - on the one hand, and young people who are the future of this country, on the other.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	443	I support the amendment. I spoke already this evening about the discrimination that is ingrained in the social protection system. This is a further discriminatory practice. I do not know any young people who are unemployed and who want to be on social welfare. They want to get work. The former Minister for Social Protection spoke at a committee meeting about young people getting off planes from foreign countries. To paraphrase what he said, "How can they get off planes here and get work?" He was questioning what our young unemployed people in this State are doing. Unfortunately, that is the mentality we are dealing with here. Young people should be treated with equality. What is happening is totally wrong. When the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection was questioned on this issue on Committee Stage, she said a report is being compiled and it is hoped that it will be forthcoming. Perhaps she is not aware that the report, which was compiled by NUI Maynooth, has been published. I think it was published in April. It is not acceptable for the Minister to say on Committee Stage that she is waiting for a report when it is ready for her to view. The Minister also said a review of the cuts is being carried out by the Government and that it will be published in the next year. I tabled a question to the then Minister for Social Protection in May regarding the review and he said it was ongoing and he was hopeful that a report would be produced before the end of the year. We should have all of the information but, unfortunately, we do not. This is a continuation of a previous debate we had on discrimination against older people in which we were promised report after report but they were put on the long finger. It seems the work has been done on the report into the discrimination imposed on young jobseekers, which is compounding problems for them right across the board. Short of seeing the reports that have been compiled, it is critical to accept the amendment in order to put a timeframe on getting a report and seeing the impact of the discriminatory cuts that were imposed on young jobseekers.

I strongly support the amendment. We have been talking about discrimination against a cohort of citizens most of the evening in terms of women and pensioners. Even after the budget, the 18 to 24 years cohort just receive €107.70 and that is most discriminatory. The policy should be reconsidered. For example, more than 700 young people who are signing on at the two employment exchanges in my constituency are affected by this policy.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	446	I can inform Deputy Brady that the report has not been published in full. Initial results were published in April. We hope the report will be published in the coming weeks or months. We do not have an exact timetable for it yet. NUI Maynooth is undertaking research, the purpose of which is to examine the effectiveness of the reduced rates in encouraging young jobseekers to avail of education, training, employment programmes and other opportunities. My Department has not commissioned this research. Rather, as part of an effort to encourage and promote research, it has facilitated the university with access to the data in order that it might undertake the research. Initial results were published in the form of a working paper in April and that is available on the university's website. The Department is currently considering the contents of that research. Among the initial findings is an indication that the reduction in jobseeker's payments for 18 and 19 year olds in 2009 led to reductions in the duration of unemployment, although only the effect on 18 year olds is statistically significant. Under Pathways to Work 2016-2020, my Department is committed to review and report on the impact of the reduced payment rates for jobseekers aged between 18 and 25. The review will be finalised shortly and will take account of the results of the NUI Maynooth research. Jobseekers under 26 years of age who have qualified children and those who were in the care of the HSE immediately before they turned 18 are not subject to the reduced rates of jobseeker's allowance. Similarly, those transferring from disability allowance or jobseeker’s benefit are not paid at the lower rates. Furthermore, should a young jobseeker on a reduced jobseeker's allowance payment participate on an education or training programme, he or she will then receive the maximum personal rate for jobseeker's allowance. In budget 2018, we are providing for an increase of €5 per week in the maximum personal rate of jobseeker's allowance for recipients of all ages. Those aged under 26 will also receive the €5 increase. This means that a jobseeker's allowance recipient aged 18 to 24 will, from March 2018, receive €107.70. For those on the maximum rate, their payment will increase from €193 to €198 per week. Also as part of budget 2018, I announced the introduction of the youth employment support scheme, which is targeted at young jobseekers. I will conclude on this point because we are all anxious to finish the Bill tonight. The Central Statistics Office figures on unemployment are encouraging. They show that unemployment fell to 14% in October. That is a significant decrease of almost six percentage points, from 19.7%, in the past 24 months. The overall unemployment rate fell to 6%, which is very encouraging. I ask Deputy Bríd Smith to withdraw her amendment.

I do not see the point in doing so because I know it will be defeated. However, I wish to comment on what the Minister of State said. His opening remarks are shocking. The implication is that if one pays young people practically nothing and cuts their dole to the minimum, it will force them out the door to work. That is not true. I would love to get my hands on the completed report. We should insist on a full debate on it when it becomes available because it will be discovered that at the same time as the cut to the social protection measures, there was a move to push young people into other labour activation measures. We will discuss this matter at the committee tomorrow. There are many problems with JobPath and the other initiatives that were taken. Deputy Catherine Murphy did a very good exposé on some of the private companies that are being engaged to work with young people and often push them into bogus self-employment contracts. There are significant problems with the way we are treating young people in terms of future jobs and their prospects in this country. It stems from the idea that one pushes them out the door, cuts their pay and forces them into any old job they will take. That does not take cognisance of what is emerging and neither does it take cognisance of the number of young people who have been forced to emigrate because it is unbearable to try to live on that level of income support. The Minister of State should try to live on that amount.

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	449	I move amendment No. 10:In page 13, after line 38, to insert the following:“Report on Employers’ PRSI Contributions17. Within three months of the passing of this Act, the Minister will lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on increasing employers’ PRSI contributions with special regard to the models and levels of employers’ contributions in other European states.”.We often have big discussions. Many on this side of the House are advocating for more equality in social protection. I can hear the question ringing in the heads of those looking at me. They are asking where the money will come from. This amendment tries to deal with one aspect of that question. There are many ways to skin a cat and there are many ways to get money in this capitalist society in which we live. The amendment tries to deal with one of these ways comprehensively. I am going to press the amendment. It calls on the Minister to lay before the House a report on the increase in employers' PRSI contribution and the levels of contributions that are paid in other European states. The proposal formed part of our alternative budget submission. We were able to show that if employers here paid the same level employers pay in France, then we could raise a further €16 billion per year. That is merely an example in financial terms of how comparatively low employers' PRSI contributions are here as against the average throughout Europe. The employers' contribution to social protection is 42% of the EU average. Is it any wonder that we have less decent public services? If a patient goes into a clinic in Germany, she gets seen right away and only pays €15 for medication and the visit to the doctor. When a patient goes to an emergency department in this country, she could be left waiting and the hospital seeks €100 for the visit. The patient probably does not get treated properly or receive the right X-rays either. That is simply an example of a public service that is underfunded and inefficient because we do not collect the resources available. We need to look carefully at why three times the level of employers' PRSI is charged in other countries compared to Ireland. The amendment calls on the Minister and the Department to produce a report on the matter with cognisance of the European average.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	450	I do not propose to accept the amendment. In addition to the PRSI paid by employees, PRSI is payable by employers on the basis of the salary paid to their employees. Most employments fall under PRSI class A. The rate of employer PRSI under class A is 8.5% where weekly earnings are €376 or less and 10.75% where weekly earnings exceed €376. It is generally recognised that the rate of employer PRSI payable is lower in Ireland than any other EU countries. Ireland is the 11th lowest in the list of OECD countries for employer social security contributions, while employee contributions are the sixth lowest. However, it is important to note that in many countries there is either a cap on employer social security costs or a reduced rate above a certain income threshold. In Ireland, a flat rate is charged on the full salary. In these cases, direct comparisons of rates would not provide a realistic basis for assessing the effective rate of employer contribution. Consideration of increasing the rate of PRSI charged to employers is part of the larger debate on policy development of social insurance in the years ahead. The findings in the recently-published Actuarial Review of the Social Insurance Fund at the end of 2015 will serve as an important input to the debate. As the Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Deputy Doherty, indicated at the time of its publication, the review provides Government with an evidence-based and timely opportunity to consider reform of how our social insurance system is financed. The Minister also stated that she intended to consult widely on these reform options. In light of the Minister's intention to undertake a review of our entire system of social insurance, it would not be appropriate to consider changes in only one aspect of social insurance, that is, the rate of contribution paid by employers, in isolation. That would not amount to good practice. A commitment to increase the rate of employer PRSI would be premature given the requirement to take a broader perspective on changes to social insurance.

The Minister shall prepare and lay a report before the Houses of the Oireachtas on the impact of cuts to the fuel allowance given the increase in fuel costs and examine the impact that partial restoration of the fuel allowance would have on fuel poverty and that the report shall be presented to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Social Protection within six months of enactment of this Bill.”.I will be brief because I spoke extensively on Committee Stage. It is a serious issue that needs to be examined. We know a cut was made to the fuel allowance from 32 to 26 weeks. There has been an increase up to 27 weeks, which is welcome. Fuel poverty is extensive. It is rampant throughout our State. It is estimated that more than 400,000 households throughout the State experience fuel poverty of one level or another. It is estimated that there are more than 3,000 excess winter deaths among those over 65 years in the State. Between 2005 and 2009, it is estimated that 400 of those deaths were directly linked to temperature inside the home. That is a stark figure. Unfortunately, we know the cuts to the fuel allowance have increased fuel poverty throughout the State. We have all heard the evidence. Elderly people have come to my constituency office saying that they have to make choices between turning on the heating, putting food on the table or buying clothing. That is a terrible situation for anyone to be subjected to. I welcome the fact that the Minister made changes on foot of amendments that I brought forward in last year's Bill to give out bulk payments. There are two bulk payments under the fuel allowance. Certainly, that has helped our elderly people in particular. They can buy in advance and avail of any special deals or offers. The entire issue needs to be looked at. I have laid out the statistics. They are stark and real. We need to examine the impact these cuts have had. We need to examine the benefit of increasing the fuel allowance from €22.50 per week over the 27-week period in which it is paid and the benefits in terms of lifting people out of fuel poverty. All of this needs to be looked at. That is why I am asking for a report to be compiled and brought back to us to see what changes can be made.

For a good part of the day he wears his coat at home and tries to conserve energy as much as possible. We had some recent reports on energy cost in Ireland - I realise it is not directly the area of responsibility of the Minister of State. We seem to be coming out as the second highest in the OECD. The level of energy costs is incredible. I have never found the Commission for Energy Regulation to be very effective. I know one of two colleagues would have invigilated the commission down through the years. I gather it is now called the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. It never seemed to give us any serious competition in the delivery of energy. As Deputy Brady has said, a considerable cohort of our population has been deeply affected by the cuts in this area. Obviously, it is something the Government should address urgently. Earlier today, at the Committee on Budgetary Oversight I heard the leader of the Green Party refer to the necessity for more carbon taxes. Of course he was in government previously. He propped up two Fianna Fáil taoisigh for a lengthy period – I am referring to Mr. Ahern and Mr. Cowen. During that time we had a major energy poverty problem but we did not see it being addressed then. Yet he is calling for new impositions in terms of the carbon taxation. Such taxes would, as always, impact most heavily on the poorest cohort of our population.It is especially untimely. I support the amendment because it is a matter that we should be conscious of and address in social protection legislation. 
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	460	I thank Deputies Brady and Broughan for their contributions. I do not propose to accept this amendment. Fuel allowance is just one element of the Government's strategy to tackle energy poverty, which is a complex matter. In 2016, the Government launched a comprehensive strategy to combat energy poverty. This followed extensive public consultation and the strategy builds on the progress and experience developed over the four years since the publication of the first Government strategy on affordable energy. It expands the reach of existing energy efficiency schemes and commits the Government to developing and piloting new measures to find more effective ways to focus energy efficiency efforts on those most at risk of energy poverty. It puts in place the structures and the accountability to ensure the challenge is effectively addressed at every level of Government and across the public service. The fuel allowance scheme assists pensioners and other welfare dependent householders with meeting the cost of their heating needs during the winter season. The payment is made to more than 376,000 of the most disadvantaged households, including pensioners, who are most at risk of energy poverty. In recent years, there have been increases in both the amount and the duration of the fuel allowance. In budget 2016, the fuel allowance rate was increased from €20 to €22.50 per week, which represented a 12.5% increase in the rate of this payment. This increase was estimated to cost €24.5 million in 2016. In budget 2018, it was announced that the number of weeks the fuel allowance will be paid is to be increased from 26 to 27. In 2017, the estimate for expenditure for the fuel allowance is €229 million, a substantial amount. The Department also pays the household benefits package at an estimated cost of €232 million in 2017, of which €177 million relates to the electricity or gas allowance element of the household benefits package. As of the end of October this year, 432,711 households were in receipt of the electricity or gas allowance element of the household benefits package. We are constantly reviewing the rate of payment of fuel allowance and we have an important strategy on energy poverty in place. I do not propose to accept the amendment. 
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	461	It is unfortunate that the Government does not acknowledge the need for a report on this matter. The Minister indicated she was prepared to examine the issue and that it would be useful to do so. It is not right that the payment of €22.50 should remain static for the 376,000 people who depend on it and are, as the Minister of State acknowledged, among the most needy in the State. In real terms, the value of the allowance is being reduced every year by inflation. This issue must be examined to determine if €22.50 is an adequate weekly payment. In my view, it is not adequate because fuel costs are increasing every year. A comprehensive report on the issue is needed. While I acknowledge that the issue is cross-departmental and does not only relate to the Department of Employment and Social Protection, nevertheless, the Department deals specifically with the fuel allowance. For this reason, I ask that a report be commissioned on the impact of the decision to cut the duration of the payment from 32 weeks to 26 weeks. While I acknowledge that it has since been increased to 27 weeks, it should also be noted that the rate of payment has remained static for much too long.

This is an annual event which involves the House giving its approval to continue with technical arrangements for the private health insurance system. The legislation is introduced annually to make adjustments to the risk equalisation scheme in respect of stamp duty levies, risk equalisation credits and hospital utilisation credit rates. Private health insurance is regulated by the Health Insurance Authority and it is on its recommendation that these annual proposals are made. They are generally nodded through on the basis that there is general support for the principle of risk equalisation. Risk equalisation is an important element of private health insurance which prevents cherry-picking in the health insurance system. This is especially the case given the history of the health insurance system in this country where the VHI had the field to itself, more or less, for many decades. For this reason, the company has a disproportionate number of older members and it would be unfair to allow new entrants into the market which could cherry-pick younger and healthier clients or customers. That is the purpose of risk equalisation and it difficult to argue against the scheme. The new arrangements and rates will apply from 1 April 2018. The legislation also makes amendments to the lifetime community rating scheme to extend the powers of the Minister in that regard. It proposes that the 2% loading for people aged over 35 years, which was introduced a couple of years ago, be modified to some extent and that the 2% annual loading be limited to a maximum of ten years. This is clearly highly technical legislation. I am concerned, however, that some of the proposals regarding the lifetime community scheme are not entirely clear. Reference is made to a negative impact for older policyholders, which would affect the VHI in particular. I hope, although it is not entirely clear from the text, that it will not result in an appreciable increase in the cost of policies for older people because the cost of private health insurance has increased substantially in recent years and reached a point where it is unaffordable for many people.Obviously, over recent years, many gave it up. During the austerity years, the level of cover went down to its lowest and it is gradually creeping up again, with 46% of people currently having it. As I said to the Minister last week, I would see this 46% who feel that they must have private health insurance out of fear and out of a lack of confidence in the public health system as a serious indictment of the health system. This is unheard of in most other European countries. Generally, in European countries, people have access to an affordable public health system that is generally free or almost free at the point of use and that is the kind of system we should have in this country. It is the kind of system that Irish people should be entitled to. Unfortunately, we are in a situation where nearly half the population feel they must fork out for very expensive insurance. I spoke last week about the average premium. I do not accept the average premium figures provided. The average premium for a person over 50 on the basic plan B is €2,000 this year. It had been €1,500 last year. That has to be seen for what it is. It is essentially another tax for people. It is an additional tax of €38 a week or €167 per month to buy private health insurance. If the recent budget had announced the introduction of new taxes of €167 a month, the Government would be laughed out of it, but somehow people seem to think it is all right to put this kind of charge or tax on people just to access basic health cover. Of course, what people get from the basic plan B is basic health cover. It really only enables people to skip the queue and jump ahead of others who do not have private health insurance when it comes to elective surgery. By and large, the health insurance policies that are available in this country give poor value for money. In addition to paying that €2,000 a year for private health insurance, people are also caught with paying usually the full cost of a GP. A consultant can cost €220 and a person enjoys little cover from his or her health insurance for that. Private health insurance does not cover medicines. In the main, it does not cover any diagnostics. It also does not cover emergency department access. No doubt people are being ripped off. They are faced with this considerable additional bill just so that they can have some peace of mind that if they have an emergency, or not so much have an emergency but need elective surgery, they will be able to access that in a timely way. As I said, we are having the wrong debate here. The debate we need to be having is how we move from the current dysfunctional, unfair, inequitable and inefficient two-tier health system to a single-tier public health system comparable to most other countries. That is what all of the emphasis should be on at this point. If the Minister ever needed proof that the present system is so wrong, all he need do is look at the "RTÉ Investigates" programme to see the kind of carry-on there and the blatant abuse of the two-tier system. I suppose events have overtaken that shocking programme but we still need answers to what Deputy Harris, as Minister, will do about the revelations shown in that programme. At the recent Joint Committee on Health, the Minister spoke about pursing the cases that were highlighted in that programme, but of course the fact is that this is a systemic problem in many parts of the country, in particular in hospitals. I will undertake to send on to the Minister tomorrow details of that information that was drawn up by the "RTÉ Investigates" programme.

#SimonHarris	unknown-#SimonHarris-party	unknown-#SimonHarris-dob	unknown-#SimonHarris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-12-06 00:00:00	Ceisteanna - Questions	472	I thank Deputies for their support for this Bill and their contributions to the debate. I agree with Deputy Shortall, in terms of the debate that we need to be having and, indeed, the debate we are having. This is obviously annual legislation we deal with but the Deputy is quite correct. We have all subscribed in this House to the idea of creating a universal health care system that can provide timely access for patients based on need, not ability to pay. That is where I want to get to as well. In that regard, Deputy Shortall has shown leadership with the Sláintecare report on which I look forward to working with Deputies in this House. To recap briefly, the main purpose of this Bill is to specify the revised risk equalisation credits and the corresponding stamp duty levies to apply on health insurance from April of next year. I am pleased that this year it has been possible to maintain the main stamp duty at the existing level. In addition, the stamp duty for non-advanced contracts is being reduced by 20%. The credits and levy rates for next year strike a fair balance between the need to sustain community rating by keeping health insurance affordable for older less healthy consumers and maintaining the sustainability of the market by keeping younger healthier customers in the market. The Bill also makes a number of changes to the operation of the lifetime community rating to ensure the continued smooth operation of that scheme in a fair and balanced manner. Following enactment of this Bill, I will make a regulation next year which will set out specific details of the changes and will further enhance the operation of the lifetime community rating scheme. These changes, coupled with ongoing increases in employment, which is factually a key driver in the demand for health insurance, will support the market and everyone who wishes to purchase private health insurance. Before concluding, I will briefly respond to a few questions that were raised in this debate. Deputy Kelleher mentioned that the public health system subsidises consultants to do additional work over and above what they are entitled to do. A key objective of the consultant contract of 2008 is to improve access for public patients to public hospital care. The responsibility for reporting individual consultants' compliance with their contract was formally delegated to hospital groups in 2014. However, it appears clear that these arrangements are not robust enough to ensure individual consultant compliance. My Department is working with the HSE to find a solution to ensure compliance is monitored more effectively. I look forward to receiving that detail from Deputy Shortall tomorrow and passing it on to the HSE, and seeking action upon it. Deputy Boyd Barrett queried whether the report prepared by the Health Insurance Authority, HIA, will be published. I can confirm that the report will be published before Committee Stage takes place. Deputy Mattie McGrath asked had I met the Health Insurance Authority. I most recently met it on Thursday, 26 October.
