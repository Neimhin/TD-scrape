#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	0	It now is patently clear that this is the most incompetent Government in the history of the State.  On Sunday, the Minister for Health and Children announced she had approved and authorised a statutory service plan from the HSE involving cuts of €500 million.  That plan was placed in the Oireachtas Library yesterday and is obsolete today.  My understanding is the Health Service Executive prepared its service plan and submitted it to the Minister for Health and Children for authorisation.However, in light of changing circumstances, the chief executive of the HSE will be obliged to seek a further €400 million in cuts.  This will strike at the heart of the most vulnerable in our society as it pertains to a critical major public service plan.  The Minister for Health and Children, who sat at the Cabinet table and heard of the changing economic circumstances from the Minister for Finance, should have been in a position to tell the HSE it was basing its service plan on the wrong figures, in the same way the budget was drafted using incorrect figures.  Arising from the service plan submitted by the HSE that now must be amended, can the Taoiseach explain to the House the numbers of beds that will be cut and the number of people who will be made redundant?  Can he spell out the impact on waiting lists and trolleys, 400 of which were occupied yesterday, as well as on capital projects for hospitals nationwide next year?

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	5	It has obtained efficiencies totalling €280 million during this year, which will be repeated next year.  The figures being spoken about in the public debate this morning are not those of the HSE.As Deputy Kenny observed, the HSE has set out a public service plan to support its goals, which are to maintain services to patients and clients in both hospitals and community settings in a manner that is fully consistent with patient safety and best practice.  It is to expand certain services, particularly in respect of cancer and therapies for children with disabilities, to which additional funds of €15 million and €10 million, respectively, have been allocated, as well as an additional €120 million in other areas.  Moreover, it is to support the reorganisation of services and the management of costs in such a way that services will be maintained and expanded.  Furthermore, it is to work with the social partners in the health sector to achieve the objective of maintaining services to the public with a much tighter budget and to manage closely the significant risks of cost increases arising from the need to provide medical cards and other services as a result of the economic downturn.The HSE service plan has been prepared and approved by the Minister on that basis.  It refers to the budget of €14.7 billion that will be paid for health services next year, which constitutes an increase of 3.2% over this year's budget.  Her approval and the finalised plan take account of all recent developments, including the budgetary position, the deterioration in the economy and the need to manage risks.  In her letter approving the plan, the Minister also has set some specific and challenging requirements for the HSE.This is a challenging and much-improved service plan, which sets out clearly the links between the services planned, the budget for those services and the staff needed.  It is a plan that will require more than ever the active involvement of staff at all levels to make the changes necessary to deliver it.  The goals desired by the Government across all areas only can be achieved with real co-operative engagement of management and staff from the outset of the year, drawing on the commitment of all to patients first and foremost.  The HSE's management is engaged with staff representatives on these issues.  I believe this is the best way to proceed and is the basis on which the plan was set up.

While there were ten HSE employees at grade 8 in 2000, there were 713 in 2007.  I asked the Taoiseach what are the implications, in respect of the cutting of front-line services, on foot of an amended plan involving cuts of €900 million from this service?  What are the implications for front-line services, the employment of nurses and doctors and patient care?  The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, appears to be the only person in Ireland who states that too many people are working in accident and emergency units nationwide.  Last night, 400 people were obliged to lie on trolleys.

What are the implications for waiting lists and patient care?  What are the implications for any future development to take place in the health business in 2009?  The Taoiseach should answer these questions clearly and unequivocally, based on the up-to-date information in his possession.  As this is the Taoiseach's last morning in the House, this matter should be sorted out in order that Members know where they stand.

Yesterday there were 390 people on trolleys in accident and emergency units.  That is just ten less than the number who were on trolleys on the day that the Minister, Deputy Harney, announced an emergency in accident and emergency in 2006.On Wednesday last, the HSE published a service plan which stated that there would be €500 million cut from the health services and yesterday it emerged that the figure is now closer to €1 billion.  There are 500 beds already gone out of the health service and it is proposed to remove another 600, that is, 1,100 beds.  It costs €200,000 to provide a bed, in other words, €220 million that has already been spent in providing hospital beds will not be used under this plan.We are faced with a situation this morning where the Taoiseach or his deputy will come in here tomorrow morning to propose that Dáil Éireann be suspended for six weeks — that we go out of business for six weeks — at a time when the country is facing its worst economic crisis, when our banks are in crisis and at a time when Ministers, including the Minister for Health and Children, are seeking additional cuts in services.  This country needs a Government and leadership.  It needs people who have got a handle on the problems that are facing the country and the people.  It does not have that.What we have——

He has not got the banks right.  He told us on Sunday that there was going to be a €10 billion rescue plan and when I asked him direct questions on it yesterday, he could not answer a single one of them.  We are no wiser today about what he is going to do about the banks than we were last week.On the economy, the Taoiseach stated two weeks ago we did not need an economic recovery plan.  At the beginning of this week he stated he had such a plan.  We still have not seen it.  We are now told it is some kind of a framework.  When will we see this economic recovery plan that the Taoiseach has been talking about and dining over in Farmleigh?  The problem is that the Taoiseach is not governing.  The country has serious economic, social and service problems that are not being addressed by his Government and people are becoming increasingly depressed by that.Everybody knows that the country is facing enormous challenges and economic difficulties and people are prepared to step up to the plate and to address them collectively.  However, the problem we have in this country is that we do not have a Government which is giving leadership and direction and providing any sense that there is a solution and that we can get through these difficult times.Is the Taoiseach serious about closing down the House for six weeks in these times?  When will he tell us what the Government will do about the banks?  When will we get the detail of these health cuts about which the Minister for Health and Children is talking?  When will we see the economic recovery plan about which the Taoiseach has been talking?

A new economic situation has emerged over the past six months and we will set out a framework which will shape the debate around the social partnership talks that will take place in the coming weeks.  What we must do is rely on some of the strengths of this economy which we have built up over the past ten years.  The totally negative way in which this economy is being portrayed in every respect by the Opposition is not a fair appraisal of an economy that is under stress and——

It is our intention to engage with the social partners and to provide ourselves with the means by which we can deal with these challenges.  These challenges will not be dealt with in the partisan way in which Deputy Gilmore wishes to deal with them.  They will be dealt with through social partnership where we will set a credible timeframe within which health can be restored to the public finances on an agreed basis, which is the best and only way forward to deal with the magnitude of the challenge that faces us.

#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	143	I asked the Taoiseach four questions but with all his bluster he forgot to answer them.  Is he serious about closing the Dáil for six weeks during this very difficult period?  When will we be told exactly what he intends to do about the banks?  What cuts will be made to the health service, when will they be outlined to us and will we have an opportunity to debate them or is it his intention to reveal them when the House is closed down for six weeks?  Finally, when will we see the economic recovery plan?  There is no point in telling us about discussions with the social partners in regard to the plan.  It is the Taoiseach's responsibility to produce it.  Neither is there any point in telling us that negotiations have been entered into with the very same bankers who got us into the banking problem in the first place.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I have already answered Deputy Kenny regarding the health situation and have indicated that the need for more efficiencies and effective delivery of services is a critical part of maintaining services in the health service next year.  That is on the basis that €14.7 billion is being made available to the health service, an increase which takes account of the €580 million cost of the nursing home subvention scheme over this year.  Negotiations are ongoing between management and unions and there is every indication that we will achieve the work practice changes necessary to ensure that we have flexibilities, deliver services to the front line to the greatest extent possible and minimise adverse impacts on patients.  That is the purpose of the exercise.In regard to the banks, I have outlined the situation to the Deputy.  The recapitalisation policy was enunciated in detail last Sunday.  Proposals must now come from the banks with which we are in negotiations.  It must be understood that the only interests I have are the stability of the financial system so that we have a banking system that serves the modern economy we have built and protecting the interests of the taxpayer in that effort.  These are our primary considerations in dealing with the matter.  We have indicated that proposals should be brought before the Government in early January.The committees will return on 7 January and we will be involved in trade delegations to support Irish industry abroad.  We will ensure the Government returns on 7 January.  The Government is working hard, despite what Deputy Gilmore wants to say.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	150	However, I assure the Deputy that the Government will work hard on maintaining this country's reputation as a good economy, a place to do business and a location where enterprise can prosper.  We also know that an Irish recovery can only happen when a global recovery takes place because this is an open economy and we are affected by what happens abroad.  We are not total masters of our own economic destiny in every respect——

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	158	We certainly did these things.  We are now facing higher unemployment levels and we need to put in place policies that will help us to deal with the situation.  This phase will pass.  We have to indicate to the public where this economy can be in a number of years if we take the correct decisions now.  I believe the correct decisions — the elephant in the room if Deputies would prefer — involve the discrepancy between expenditure and tax revenues which has emerged during the course of this year in particular as a result of the international downturn.We have to be prepared to work with the social partners on finding a way to deal with the problem so that everyone gets behind the wheel to ensure we come through the difficult time that lies ahead.  That is the approach of the Government and it is the right strategy.  It is not a matter of instant gimmicks, soundbites for the media every morning or saying that we should have change but we will oppose change every time it is proposed.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	171	I propose to take Questions Nos. 1 to 19, inclusive, together.I travelled to Paris on 1 October to meet with President Sarkozy.  During the meeting we undertook to work closely together between that date and the December European Council.  President Sarkozy expressed interest in coming to Ireland again during his Presidency but this was overtaken by my visit to Paris on 5 December.I travelled to Brussels on 7 November for an informal meeting of Heads of State and Government.  The meeting was called by President Sarkozy to discuss the current financial crisis.  While there are no formal conclusions from the meeting, it gave the Union the opportunity to frame its general approach to the G20 discussions in Washington on 15 November on examining ways of reforming the international financial system.I met with President Vaclav Klaus on 10 November as part of the three day State visit to Ireland by the President of the Czech Republic.  We held a bilateral discussion, following which I hosted a Government lunch in honour of the President and Mrs. Klausová.  President Klaus's visit, which was arranged earlier this year, was a return visit following President McAleese's State visit to the Czech Republic in 1999.  As Deputies will be aware, the Czech Republic will assume the Presidency of the European Council on 1 January 2009.  We  discussed the priorities for the Czech Republic's forthcoming Presidency, the global financial crisis, the Lisbon treaty and bilateral relations between Ireland and the Czech Republic.I travelled to Helsinki on Thursday, 27 November for an evening meeting with Prime Minister Vanhanen.  While in Helsinki I also had a meeting with President Tarja Halonen.  I then travelled from Helsinki to Stockholm for a meeting with Prime Minister Reinfelt.  On 3 December I met with Prime Minister Jean-Claude Juncker in Luxembourg.  Following my meeting with Prime Minister Juncker I travelled to Berlin for a meeting with Chancellor Angela Merkel.   The following morning I had a meeting with Prime Minister Gordon Brown in Downing Street.  I met with the current President of the European Council, President Nicolas Sarkozy, in Paris on Friday, 5 December.Our discussions were dominated by the Lisbon treaty and on his part, President Sarkozy confirmed that his contacts with the other member states made clear that the process of ratification could not be reopened.  The meeting was part of an ongoing and intense co-operation with the French Presidency in our effort to secure a way forward that responds to the concerns of the Irish people while securing the support of all member states.  After my meeting in Paris I travelled to Brussels for a meeting with European Commission President Barroso.  Once again, discussions at our meeting focused primarily on the Lisbon treaty.  We also touched on the climate change and energy package.During each of these meetings the main topic of discussion was the Lisbon treaty and in particular the concerns of the Irish electorate and how they needed to be addressed.  We also discussed other key EU issues, including the climate change and energy package and the international financial crisis.I also made a series of phone calls to my colleagues in the European Council in the run-up to the summit in Brussels on 11 and 12 December, during which I explained to them what we were hoping to achieve at the European Council, and sought their support.  I attended the European Council on 11 and 12 December in Brussels and as I will be making a statement to the House later today I will merely give a summary account of the proceedings.For Ireland, discussions of the Lisbon treaty was a major focus, and I explained to the Council the concerns of the Irish people.  First I indicated that retaining a Commissioner was a real concern for the Irish people and it agreed to that.  Second, I stated that I needed an undertaking that the other concerns of the Irish people, such as tax, family and ethical matters and the Common Security and Defence Policy would be addressed in a legally robust manner.  This was also agreed upon.On the basis of the agreements made at the European Council, and on the condition of our being able to satisfactorily put guarantees in place, I have said that I would be prepared to return to the public with the new package and to seek approval of it.  It is important to stress that there is much detailed work to be carried out in the months ahead regarding the content of the guarantees to be provided.  In addition to the Lisbon treaty, the Council also reached agreement in a number of other areas, most notably the energy climate change package and economic and financial measures.

This is clearly a costly but important exercise.  We are all aware of the European position and if Europe does not lead on all this alternative recyclable green agenda, it will be difficult to get other countries to follow suit.  Has the Government decided to participate in the Barroso plan and teased out the cost and strategy implications for Ireland?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	186	I have not been turning my mind to the early appointment of the next Commissioner.  On the second point, from our perspective the stimulus brought to the economy in view of our financial position has been the maintenance of our capital investment programme, which is twice the European Union average.  Were it the European average, the capital programme would be approximately €4 billion next year, when we will have a programme of €8 billion.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	187	Has the Taoiseach given consideration to a matter I referred to him before, the opting in to the justice and security issue which was part of the Lisbon treaty?  I make the point because the Taoiseach is aware that over €700 million of drugs was seized off the Irish coast a number of months ago and earlier this year over €100 million of drugs was washed up at Mizen Head.  Given the scale of international crime now, be it from human trafficking or the fact that this country is both a conduit and destination for serious amounts of drugs, does the Taoiseach consider it would be an important element of our central participation in Europe to opt into the justice and security element of the treaty?The Taoiseach is well aware of the academic arguments put up by legal minds on the difference between common and civil law.  The people of the country would like to know that the Government wants to participate fully — and demonstrate this — in all elements of justice and security, so our citizens are safe and our young people are not continuously exposed to the pressures of drugs, drug abuse and drug addiction.  That scale of crime is happening on a continuous basis.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	188	Our position on the justice and home affairs area is to participate as fully as possible.  There is a reserve in terms of ensuring the difference between common and civil law is respected and understood.  We are legally advised there may be occasions where that full participation might not be possible as would otherwise be the case.  Our demeanour in the area is to work co-operatively with colleagues in the European Union and further afield, such as in Interpol and other organisations, to deal with the worldwide criminal networks which run the drugs trade and bring much agony, sorrow and tragedy to so many lives.  They blight many societies in the modern world in which we live.These are legal questions which have been assessed by our Attorney General and the Government has followed that advice.  All our colleagues are aware that it is our full intention to participate in all of these matters and our reserve is simply in the event of there being a legal problem by doing so.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I wish to ask a few questions about the conclusions reached at the summit.  It was agreed that if the Lisbon treaty is ratified and comes into effect, each member state will have the right to appoint a Commissioner.  Has any consideration been given to what will happen with regard to the appointment of the new Commission if the Lisbon treaty is not ratified?There were agreements on legal guarantees in a number of areas in respect of taxation and security and defence policy.  I do not see any great difficulty with these because, as I read it, they were not affected by the Lisbon treaty in any event.  There is also a provision for a guarantee that the provisions of the Irish Constitution regarding the right to life, education and family are not in any way affected by the Treaty of Lisbon, the Charter of Fundamental Rights and the justice and home affairs provisions of the treaty.We all understand that the abortion issue was raised during the course of the referendum on the Lisbon treaty.  I cannot recall anybody raising issues relating to education during the course of the referendum campaign.  In so far as family issues were raised, they certainly were not central.  I have been through the research which was done following the referendum, but I cannot see anywhere in it that family or education issues surfaced as matters of concern.  Perhaps the Taoiseach could explain where those issues emerged from, the nature of the legal guarantees being sought, and how that will be squared with the charter of fundamental rights.I also wish to ask the Taoiseach about workers' rights issues, which he raised during the European summit.  The text of the conclusions states that high importance will be given to those issues but not legal guarantees, as is the case in the other areas.  Can the Taoiseach explain why that is so and what he proposes to do to address it?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	190	As regards the issue of a Commissioner per member state, in the event of the Lisbon treaty not being ratified the Nice treaty arrangements will be operable.  Those arrangements state that when the membership reaches 27 the Council will have to agree to a reduction of that number and provide a solution along the lines of the Nice treaty.  Therefore one cannot guarantee a Commissioner per member state if the Lisbon treaty is not ratified.  If it is ratified, these conclusions confirm that the Heads of State and Government are prepared to undertake a procedure which will ensure that every member state has a Commissioner.  That situation cannot continue under the Nice treaty.  The Lisbon treaty currently states that a Commissioner per member state will be available to every member of the Union until 2014, whereupon on a principle of rotation a reduced number, to 18, will be agreed.  That is an important point which arose during the course of the referendum.  I am glad to note that the commitment given by the European Council last week is quite clear in that respect.As regards other matters, we are involved in work in progress and further detailed texts will have to be worked out.  We can keep the Deputy and his party apprised of that.  The Deputy raised questions concerning the right to life, the family, the right to denominational education and other issues, some of which concern minority groups in this country.The issue of workers' rights is about ensuring that, by ratifying the treaty, we incorporate the charter — which is part of the treaty — into the treaties of the European Union.  On any objective reading of the situation, it is accepted that that would greatly enhance and protect workers' rights in future.  The difference in some respects is that the workers' rights issue is not simply an Irish-specific question, it is one for all 27 member states.  The other issues are Irish-specific ones, but that is not to say for one moment that we do not accord importance to this matter, which was raised during the last campaign.  There are dossiers going through various sectoral councils at the moment dealing with delineating the exact implications of certain cases that were brought before the European Court of Justice, which were specific to those particular states.  However, they obviously caused concern as to whether they would have a wider application or — in respect of the issues that were dealt with in those cases — what policy response will emerge between member states that would be agreed at Council level.  Those dossiers will continue to be addressed in the forthcoming Czech Presidency and probably during the Swedish Presidency as well.  That is the context in which these matters arose.

Perhaps the Taoiseach might return to that.I acknowledge that if the Charter of Fundamental Rights was adopted, it would strengthen the rights of workers both here and elsewhere in the EU.  It would also strengthen the right to collective bargaining.  As matters stand, however, that charter has not been adopted.  That aside, would the Taoiseach acknowledge that the judgments in the Laval case and other somewhat similar cases before the European Court of Justice, have given rise to concern about the possibility of undermining pay and working conditions which are accepted as the norm here?  Does he agree that it would be necessary to have those issues satisfactorily addressed in advance of another referendum on Europe?Does the Taoiseach intend to involve the Opposition parties, particularly those which have supported the Lisbon treaty, in constructing the texts of the legal guarantees, assurances and other matters which are to be concluded as part of this process?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	192	Providing support for vulnerable workers is of central concern to the Government.  The development of European policy and practice reflected in the Union's legislation has been hugely positive for workers in Europe, including Irish workers.  To take but one example, this is reinforced by the adoption of the directive on temporary agency work.  This measure continues the long established pattern of significant and effective protection for workers being reinforced by and, in many instances, originating with European initiatives.  It is that tradition and its continued potential which was reflected in the decisions of the executive of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions and the European Trade Union Confederation to support the Lisbon treaty.  As I said earlier, through the Charter of Fundamental Rights, the draft treaty represents a significant advance in the articulation of workers' rights, not least in respect of the operation of collective bargaining.Regarding the ECJ judgments to which Deputy Gilmore referred, the particular issues raised in, for example, the Laval and Viking cases relate to the specific social partnership and collective bargaining context which exists in Scandinavian countries.  Therefore, the judgments are case-specific.  Our legal advice is that there are no particular implications arising from the ECJ judgments in these cases for Ireland, with the particular arrangements in place as part of the Irish industrial relations system.  We have a strong body of employment rights legislation which protects workers, including posted workers — that is posted from another EU member state — who have the same rights as Irish workers under Irish law.  It is important to note that the transitional agreement, which was recently ratified by IBEC and ICTU, will serve to bolster and enhance our body of employment rights legislation.  That said, the Government has made the case to our European counterparts that these ECJ judgments should be discussed among the social partners at EU level.  In this context, we welcome the fact that the European Commission, backed by the Troika of French, Swedish and Czech Presidencies, has asked the EU social partners, as part of their work programme in 2009, to undertake an analysis of the balance between workers' rights and competitiveness issues, having particular regard to the ECJ rulings.  In the time available to us, we will continue to use that process to the greatest extent we possibly can, as a means of bringing the necessary clarity and orientation to that debate, which will provide reassurance to those who may continue to have concerns in this area.  We would also be glad to apprise party leaders in the House, particularly those who support the treaty, of our efforts to go ahead with the envisaged detailed work arising out of the conclusions and to listen to and see in what way we can accommodate the ideas or proposals of others as part of a collective effort as comprehensively as possible.

Given that no changes have been secured and no commitments to make any changes to the actual text have been made, why has the Taoiseach agreed to put the same treaty to the electorate, which has already rejected it?  In a previous manifestation, it was rejected by other European electorates.The Government has told us that key issues that arose in the referendum will be dealt with by what have been described as legally binding guarantees.  What is the nature of those guarantees?  Will the Taoiseach spell out for this Deputy and the House exactly what it is that the Government is proposing?  How would he respond to this Deputy's opinion and that of many others that the guarantees will be of questionable enforceability and will not measure up to amendments or protocols to the treaty, the necessary critical elements?  Will they amount to nothing other than political declarations with no legally binding powers?  Is it the case, as indicated by President Sarkozy, that some declarations or all of what has been suggested by the Taoiseach and other national commentators on these recent developments will accompany the accession treaty for Croatia in 2010 or 2011?
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	194	Regarding the questions raised, this is an exercise in democracy.  Concerns were raised by our people about the Lisbon treaty, which meant the treaty was rejected last May in a referendum.  The Government undertook a process, as did the Oireachtas, to see in what way we could first of all identify the main concerns.  As the Deputy knows, different points of view were expressed on different issues by people who voted on any particular side, not all of them mutually supportive or mutually coherent.We sought to identify those issues and a very structured process was undertaken, both in terms of a modern means of assessing public opinion and also, of course, ensuring the Oireachtas was fully involved in bringing forward a number of groups and discussing the matter publicly in our committee system in a transparent and open manner.  Having done that, the Oireachtas sub-committee came forward with, while not a unanimous report, what was very much the view of the vast majority of those who sat on the committee, namely, that the concerns that influenced people to vote in any particular way could be identified.  Those are reflected in the main in the conclusions suggested.The Oireachtas sub-committee has other recommendations in respect of national procedures and national issues that could be dealt with at country level and that do not require the agreement or consent of our member state colleagues.  These relate to how we deal with European legislation, scrutinise it and provide a further reassurance to people that, not only has the appraisal undertaken been rigorous on the part of governments or the Commission in terms of initiating legislation and the subsequent work at Council of Ministers level, but that the issue of subsidiarity should be given expression in this House to a greater degree than has been the case before.  This point is well taken.I have always believed that, as a proponent of European issues, we should contextualise many of the issues that we discuss here to a far greater extent, whether they are economic, social or cultural, in the context of the European Union itself.  There is an interdependence and interlinking, not just in terms of financial resources in many respects, because we are moving on from that phase of membership, but also in terms of policy formulation and where competence lies in these areas, where there is a very strong European influence.We need to articulate that to a far greater extent in our national debate on a whole range of questions in order for people to see the relevance and importance of European Union affairs in the daily lives of our own people.  It is not simply a constitutional matter.  While European issues have been dominated by an effort to accommodate enlargement and to define structures and systems within the European Union and its institutions to make it responsive to the wider needs of the new united Europe in the post-communist era in which we live, the constitutionalisation questions have, perhaps, dominated to an extent that has bemused many.  We wish to move on from that.The Lisbon treaty, perhaps, provides us with the best way of doing it.  It represents the seven-eight year compromise that was reached after much deliberation.  It is specific in terms of protecting member states' interests and accommodating their concerns, perhaps by its complexity of structure, but this is an inevitable outcome of the accommodating and inclusive nature of the Union itself in reaching agreement on matters of importance to member states in a coherent fashion.For that reason, it is important that we seek to address the concerns of the Irish people.  It is totally open to them to come back to any issue at any time where our national interests are at stake.  I strongly believe that our national interests are at stake.  Deputy Ó Caoláin may disagree, which is his entitlement, but I strongly believe it.  From the position I hold, I am all the more convinced of it as every week and month passes.Be that as it may and to answer the specific questions raised, I am glad to note from Deputy Ó Caoláin's remarks that, if it were to occur that we would be able to obtain legal guarantees of protocol status, it would give him the reassurance that he requires in these matters, since he seems to be emphasising the importance of legal effect of the concerns raised being provided.  I do not wish to move beyond the conclusions as they are currently stated at the December Council meeting or to anticipate the outcome of further discussions that must take place, but I have a clear political understanding that the legal effect that we will require can and will be forthcoming subject to a satisfactory conclusion of the work that is yet to be done.This is an indication of the willingness of colleague member states to seek to accommodate the concerns that we have democratically assessed in this Parliament and that we are now communicating to colleagues in the European Union.  If it is the case that this is ultimately what is to emerge, I would be delighted if it were an influential part of Deputy Ó Caoláin's thinking on this issue for the future.  I would welcome that.The Deputy asked a question about ratification of the treaty.  We are involved in a discussion with 26 member states.  It has been portrayed by some who oppose the treaty that our work on this matter began two or three weeks ago.  One would be quite naive to suggest that the objective results achieved at the Council meeting last week could have been achieved on the basis of two or three weeks work.  In the aftermath of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty, I went to a European Council meeting where I informed the Council of the rejection of the treaty and the need for that rejection to be respected.  In other words, if they were ever to return to this matter, they would need to try to address the concerns which caused the people to reject the treaty.  It was made clear to me that a re-ratification of the treaty was not an option the other 26 member states wished to consider.  We can take one of two approaches from that.  We could decide there is no more we can do or we can decide to work in solidarity with those member states to try to resolve the problems that were specific to Ireland's rejection of the treaty.  I took the second approach because that is in the interests of the country and that we have an obligation to do that.The response that is emerging from member states indicates a respect for the concerns to which I refer and a preparedness to give legal effect in the future for those concerns and to deal with the fundamental question relating to the representativeness of the Commission — that is, one Commissioner per member state — at all times.  That is an advance on both the Lisbon and Nice treaties.  Had I done nothing, we would have lost our Commissioner on the basis of the Nice arrangements.  By engaging and negotiating with member states and asking them to respect the issues raised by the Irish people, we have come with a conclusion that is specific in respect of the institutions.  This has not happened previously in respect of other countries that found themselves in a position similar to that of Ireland.  Other member states are prepared to make this institutional change and to commit to it now in an effort to convey to the Irish people their willingness to address that important matter so people can reconsider the treaty.  Had I taken the approach suggested by some, what we have achieved might not have been possible.I understand the Deputy's party, in the context of the criticism it has offered, has set down a range of issues in respect of which changes should be made.  The problem is that the other 26 member states are not minded to do so.  We must, therefore, make a decision: should we address and try to deal adequately with the main concerns identified Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union or should we continue to set the bar so high, as the Deputy's party has done, to ensure that matters will never be renegotiated?

Does the Taoiseach accept that he has not so explored the mandate the electorate gave him in the referendum on the Lisbon treaty to the effect that he should engage directly in respect of this matter?  Let us ignore the fact that other member states are not minded to introduce changes.  We have heard that mantra on many occasions from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs.  The reality is that the Taoiseach had a task to undertake.  Does he accept he has not taken action in respect of that task?The Taoiseach stated this matter relates to democracy.  That is certainly the case.  However, whether he has been engaged in an exercise of democracy is another matter.  Many of us who voted "No" can detect neither respect nor regard for the position we articulated when we made our choice in the referendum held earlier this year.The Taoiseach did not reply to a number of the questions I posed.  In respect of President Sarkozy's contribution vis-à-vis the expected treaty relating to Croatia’s accession in 2010 or 2011, will the Taoiseach state whether, unlike the position heretofore, this treaty and all future accession treaties will not be put to the Irish electorate?  If President Sarkozy is indicating that the legally binding declarations relating to Ireland are to be part of such a proposition and if it is the case that these will not be put to the Irish electorate, does it not follow that the Taoiseach is asking the people to buy a pig in a poke?  On foot of his earlier comments, will the Taoiseach acknowledge that he does not have a clear vision, in written form or otherwise, of what was allegedly agreed in the run-up to and during the European Council meeting which took place last week?

Does he also accept that, critically and clearly, no changes to the Lisbon treaty as presented to the Irish electorate, either by amendments to the text or by protocols, have been secured, and that is the critical fault line?

That is if one is not interested in spreading confusion.  The conclusions state they are legally binding guarantees.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	202	I just explained that I have a clear political understanding with regard to obtaining legally binding guarantees as per the conclusions.  We are in a work-in-progress phase.  We will carry out the detailed work and when that is done, we will bring them before the House and explain them further.  We will then hear from the European Council as to how it wishes to give legal effect to those guarantees.  As President of the European Council, President Sarkozy indicated at the Council meeting, at the press conference which followed it and at the European Parliament yesterday what he believes will be the means by which these legally binding guarantees will be given.  I am prepared to await a formal decision from the Council on those matters.  However, I have a clear political understanding which allowed me to provide the conditional commitment I gave.  If I did not have such an understanding, I would not have given that commitment.It is on the basis of that clear understanding that we are proceeding to the next phase involving detailed work on the text.  The Deputy will have to accept that is the position at present.  When the detail is completed, we will bring it before the House and have a further discussion on it and see what is the position at that point.Deputy Ó Caoláin made a point about people being minded and not having put the case sufficiently.  I put the case.  He referred to his party's involvement in compromise.  He had to make some fundamental compromises in order to achieve political progress.  However, that does not disbar him from continuing to pursue his political vision for the country, as I pursue mine.  I do so with quite transparent and unsophisticated democratic principles.  The Deputy's experience could perhaps inform him better than anything I could say.  One advances the position nationally in so far as is possible, based on the ability of others to agree with one.Sinn Féin or the Deputy might prefer other changes to be made to the Lisbon treaty.  However, the treaty can only be agreed, not on the basis of a diktat of his party or mine, but on the basis of a consensus agreed among 27 member states.  The other 26 member states have come forward with a consensus position and they must take account of our concerns.  They are seeking, willing and anxious to do so out of respect for the Irish people, for the fact they want Ireland to be fully part of the Union and in terms of the additional changes to the Lisbon treaty construct.  The Deputy suggests there has been no change.  Where in the Lisbon treaty does it say there will be one Commissioner per member state?  It does not say that.

We are engaged in a democratic process.  We must address the concerns that the people raised, as they are entitled to do, in terms of the democratic decision they made last May.  That is what we are doing.Sinn Féin has decided to use a different tactic, namely, to go about suggesting to the Irish people — I cannot recall how many amendments Sinn Féin was seeking, it may have been 25, in its famous document produced within a week of the rejection of the Lisbon treaty — that if the Government does not achieve what it suggests it cannot put the treaty to the people.  Deputy Ó Caoláin has a problem in that the other 26 member states do not agree with him.

People sometimes think one can dictate but one cannot.  One must work with practicalities and realities and deal with the concerns of the Irish people.  The people must be given the reassurances they need not only in respect of sensitive issue in regard to our Constitution but in regard to workers' rights and the Commission.  We must give a clear indication to the people that if they vote "Yes" Ireland will keep its Commissioner.  That, perhaps, is the reason the poster erected by Sinn Féin will be redundant if we ever get to the next referendum.

The Taoiseach stated that his function was to ensure that the concerns expressed by the Irish people, in so far as we understood them, in terms of their rejection of the Lisbon treaty referendum, were addressed.  There are two ways the Government can do this.  It must first show good faith by addressing the issue of workers' rights and protecting the hard won rights of workers in this country.

We have only until the end of next year to do so.  We must address this issue quickly.Also, we should pass the agency workers' directive which is currently awaiting transposition in Irish law.  Why not do that?  Why has the migrant workers' directive not been passed?  It is causing mayhem in terms of employment of migrant workers in the service industry and, especially in restaurants, an issue raised yesterday by the migrant workers' centre?  What is the position in respect of the compliance Bill?  We must deal with that legislation.  The Government must, first and foremost, show good faith at home.

They could concern us if a business from another country were to take a similar case.  The European Court of Justice would then have to determine in respect of national law and practises and the freedoms of the European Union.  We must put in place a legal mechanism that will protect us in the future.  Otherwise, there is not much sense in putting a new referendum to the people.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	239	On the first matter, the parliamentary committee outlined various recommendations, some of which must be addressed with member state colleagues at European Council level and others which must be dealt with at national level.  In the context of employment rights legislation and so on, it should be pointed out that we have a good record on employment rights.  Employment rights legislation which protects migrants workers has been bolstered.  For example, on the posted workers issue, these people now have the same rights as Irish workers under Irish law.  Other issues are being discussed in the social partnership process.  We have a voluntary industrial relations system.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	241	There is urgency in respect of this issue.  However, there are also issues to be dealt with such as how we balance workers' rights——-

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	243	——with competitiveness issues in the interests of maintaining workers in employment, which is also a critical workers' right.  We must consider these matters in a sensible way.There is no major ideological chasm between us in respecting the rights of workers, which is something to which I adhere.  What we need to do is ensure this is addressed in a context that does not affect competitiveness or makes less likely that we will have more rather than fewer workers in employment.  We must also maintain standards.  I have no problem with any of this.  It is something to which I subscribe.  I was formerly a Minister for Labour.Dialogue is taking place within social partnership.  We will do anything we can to progress this issue and to provide reassurance on these matters.  They are issues, at a national level, that must be considered with others in the Parliament during the coming months.  Of course, we should do this.  We must be helpful, open and co-operative in these matters.  The contention was made that if one voted "Yes" to the Lisbon treaty one would be adopting a construct; that there is no such thing as a social market or social Europe and the European Union is hostile to workers' rights.  We all know that the genesis of much of the most progressive social legislation in our employment legislation originated from the European Union and the Commission.It was the late Paddy Hillery who, through the first Commission on Social Affairs, introduced equal treatment and equal rights directives which have been transposed not alone into Irish law but European law.  This is an area where the European Union has differentiated itself from the neo-liberal market economics of other major trading blocs in the world.  We are seeking all the time to strike this balance, not because we are trying to dilute its importance but because we want to ensure that the context within which workers' rights are exercised is an economy that will provide employment and a more fulfilled life for workers.  It is a difficult balance and is a matter of judgment and of changing circumstance.I take the point that this is not an exact science.  In making these I am not suggesting that one is not committed to inclusion and to dealing with reassurances in this area.  We need to do so with that context in mind.  For this reason, and if, as Deputy Costello stated, I am to proceed in good faith on these matters, which is my intention, I do not believe this should be an issue between us.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	252	I agree with the point Deputy Gilmore made in his leader's question about the Dáil rising until the end of January.  I wish to comment on Dáil sittings.  The Taoiseach rightly pointed out that the committees are back on 7 January.  I respect the fact that Ministers will be abroad at some stage in January on delegations and carrying out national business.  That is part of Government responsibility and it is necessary that, on occasion, Ministers lead delegations abroad to make further connections with other countries on behalf of this country.  I respect that.However, at a time when 10,000 people a month are losing their jobs, and when the most time off for those who have jobs is a week at Christmas time, it is perverse that the Parliament — the Dáil — should be off until the end of January.  It has always been a matter of perception that because the committees are back, the Dáil is in session.  That is true to an extent.I object to the Order of Business because I would like the Dáil to come back on 7 January, the same day as the committees, to conduct its business on behalf of the people.  I know the Chief Whip does not like that but 10,000 people a month are losing their jobs and those who have jobs have a week off at Christmas and that is it.  There is a real job of work to be done for the country.  There is a real challenge facing Government and a need for drive, enthusiasm and leadership.  I will accept the Order of Business if the Taoiseach tells me that the Dáil will be recalled on 7 January but, if not, I will vote against it.
#EamonGilmore	unknown-#EamonGilmore-party	unknown-#EamonGilmore-dob	unknown-#EamonGilmore-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	253	I agree with what Deputy Kenny has said.  This House should be back on 7 January.  When he was replying to me earlier the Taoiseach indicated the Government would be back on 7 January.  He outlined that some Ministers have overseas commitments, which I understand, and that can be facilitated in the normal course of how we do our business.It is important there is public confidence in politics.  A Dáil recess up to the end of January will scandalise the public.  Here we are in the middle of an economic problem and the Dáil is going into recess until the end of January.  The history of Dáil recesses to the end of January goes back to a time when the budget was at the end of January.  The rationale for it was that the Dáil did not come back after the Christmas recess until the end of January because the Government was dealing with the budget and needed time to prepare the budget.  That no longer applies.  There is no justification whatever for a recess up to the end of January.I support what Deputy Kenny has said.  The House should be back in business on 7 January.  I support also his opposition to the Order of Business unless the Taoiseach can give us an assurance on the matter.

As the Taoiseach is present today can he bring the Order Paper forward and advise the House as to what it will reflect tomorrow?Yesterday, in my case, but other voices again this morning have reflected on the serious situation that now stands in the offing in regard to the health service.  Yesterday we thought cuts of €500 million were planned but that has risen to some €1 billion in real terms in cuts within the health service.  That needs to be addressed.  The issue is critically important and it affects every one of us, irrespective of politics, as every citizen will be in need of health care in this State at some point in their lives.  There is great concern already in regard to the haemorrhage of services and the continued move towards centralisation and privatisation.  We need to have a full-blown debate on the floor of this House regarding the Government's intention for the health service in 2009.  I ask that the Taoiseach accommodate that as early as possible, if not before Christmas at the earliest resumption date in the new year.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	256	I reiterate that the Government will be back at work, indeed before 7 January.  There will be a Government meeting on 7 January but the Government will be back before then due to the pressing issues we are dealing with.  In the course of the coming weeks I have indicated that as a result of meeting with the social partners there will be intensive discussions on bringing forward a plan for economic renewal, which will include a fiscal stability programme based on those discussions.  We can come into this House and debate them.  Similarly, that will also be the case with the service plan for 2009 for the health service.It is important to point out that there will not be inactivity either on a Government or parliamentary level until the end of January.  From the beginning of January there will be parliamentary activity in the committee system and the Government needs the time and ability to get on with that work we are talking about in terms of preparing such a plan for economic renewal with the social partners and also engaging in necessary trade delegations out of this country as we try to maintain and shore up the orders that Irish business is finding hard to win in the present circumstances.

I would like confirmation that this is in the context of the recent crisis in the pork and bacon industry.Will the Taoiseach clarify, in the absence of the Minister, the Government's disposition towards the applications for compensation from farmers north of the Border who used the feedstuffs supplied by the producer on this side of the Border?  Will the Taoiseach also comment on the Minister's remarks on Monday that it was the Government's intention only to compensate what he described as "Irish producers"?  It is my understanding that the applicant farmers north of the Border are exactly that, Irish producers.  They have used feed supplied and produced on this side of the Border.

Can we please have clarification on this?

We are now being asked to guillotine the Finance (No. 2) Bill for 7 p.m. this evening.  Many of the amendments on Committee Stage of the Bill did not have an opportunity to be discussed.  The country is facing severe economic difficulties and we propose to guillotine the Bill and barely allow any decent discussion on what is happening in the economy or on the implications of a Bill that disastrously decided to raise VAT by 0.5% and send people in flight to shop in the North of Ireland.

I made the point to the Chief Whip at the start of this session that Fine Gael would oppose, as a matter of principle, the guillotining of Bills.  Therefore, I oppose the guillotining of this Bill.  There are occasions where a Bill might run out of steam in any event, but I have made the point to the Chief Whip that we will oppose every proposal to guillotine a Bill.  I object to this proposal on that basis.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	269	I ask the Taoiseach to be more specific about the Government's framework for the economic recovery plan and that he offer clarification.  In that regard I understand there is to be a series of statements and questions tomorrow in the House in respect of banking, recapitalisation and the issues arising.With regard to the report this morning, will the Government make an announcement tomorrow about a framework for economic recovery, or about a framework for a plan for economic recovery?  Is that announcement to be made in the House, or has a different forum been chosen for it?  It would appear somewhat unusual for the House to discuss the banking business, at my party's request, and the Government to be found in a different forum outlining an economic framework.  When will the Dáil have an opportunity to see the framework and discuss it?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	270	A total of 65 minutes has been set aside to discuss the recapitalisation of the banks.  That is inadequate and there is no provision for questions and answers from a Minister.In the context of what we learned in the past 48 hours about the budgetary issues and cuts in the health services, and also about what the Taoiseach has said about an economic framework, it is very difficult to discuss the provision of up to €10 billion for Irish banks when other serious budgetary issues face the country over the Christmas period.Can the discussion be expanded to cover not only to the banks but to include the budgetary emergency that yet again faces the Health Service Executive?  Can it also include the general framework that the Taoiseach spoke about, an economic plan for getting the country through 2009?  We need more time for that.  If the time to be allocated was to be doubled and if there were to be provision for a question and answer session, there would then be some notion of parliamentary accountability about the exercise.

We need additional time to address the critical issue of the proposed recapitalisation of the banks.  We need the opportunity to quiz the Minister.  Some 20 minutes is not sufficient, as we have had examples of this and will have them again today in regard to other matters.  We need a full-blown opportunity.  That is the critical focus this House should have tomorrow, which would include the service plan for the HSE.
#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	272	The Order of Business tomorrow will be dealt with.  It is important to point out that yesterday I met the social partners and asked them to engage in a process, which they agreed to do.  I will set out the shape of that debate by issuing a framework for those discussions which will be ongoing over Christmas and into January.  That is the right way to proceed.  As a result of those discussions bringing forward a comprehensive approach containing an input from all the social partners on the issues, there will be an opportunity available to the House to discuss this when we come back.  That is the time when we should do so.With regard to the question of statements, as a result of a query made yesterday, I said I would agree that we could have them if Members wanted to have statements on this matter and put their views on the record of the House.  The Chief Whip has accommodated this and has provided for time tomorrow in what is a very busy schedule as we head into the last week of our deliberations for this session.  Sixty-five minutes should be sufficient for people to set out their position based on the statement issued on Sunday.

#SeymourCrawford	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-party	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-dob	unknown-#SeymourCrawford-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	318	I want to raise three specific issues.  First, thankfully, the industrial development Bill was given to us today.  When will it be debated in the House?  Retail and manufacturing business in the whole Border region in particular is disappearing and it is vital we get the Bill into the House as quickly as possible.

When will the eligibility for health and personal social services Bill be brought to the House?Lastly, in light of the fact farmers in REPS 4 were promised their money last September and are now told they will not get it until the end of January, when will there be a debate on that whole issue——

It is critical that this is brought before the House as a matter of urgency in the context of the recession and, further, in the context of Dell in Limerick.  I have written to the Taoiseach and the Tánaiste on the issue.

I suggest the heading of a Bill: the restoration of visibility Bill.  Perhaps the Taoiseach would consider introducing such a Bill to encourage him back into the House.  It would increase his visibility.

One is in regard to the transfer of undertakings (pensions) Bill, which could be an appropriate Bill to discuss at present given that the Government proposes to raid the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  The other issue is in regard to the concerns of the coastal and inland fisheries interests and anglers.  Both the fisheries (amendment) Bill and the fisheries (consolidation) Bill would have an impact and are pertinent in the context of the current discussions at EU level.

I asked the Minster for Transport the action he will take following the recent "Prime Time Investigates" programme on the haulage industry.  The question was disallowed on the basis that the Minister has no responsibility for this area and that it is a matter for the Road Safety Authority.  Does the Minister have responsibility for anything?

We will move on to the motion on the Spent Convictions Bill 2007, but first I call Deputy Burton.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	383	I attended the meeting of the European Council in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, 11 and 12 December.  I was accompanied at the meeting by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs, Deputy Dick Roche, and the Attorney General.The Council had an unusually heavy agenda.  While the bulk of discussion centred on the Lisbon treaty, energy and climate change negotiations and the economic and financial crisis, other issues were also dealt with.  That such a heavy agenda could be completed with unanimously agreed conclusions is testament to the excellent French EU Presidency of the past six months.  France deployed its own highly successful mix of pragmatism, determination and dynamism.  In acknowledging France's success, I single out the particularly effective role played by President Nicolas Sarkozy.  I met him on several occasions in recent months.  We are indebted to him for the leadership and assistance he has provided for Europe.  President Sarkozy has shown himself to be a friend of Ireland.When I reported to the House following the October European Council, I said our task in the period ahead would be to work out how to address our concerns on the Lisbon treaty in a way which could be endorsed by all 27 member states.  With the co-operation of our partners in the European Union, the outcome of last week's Council represents a significant step towards delivering the way forward.  Before outlining the detail of last week's meeting, I will briefly recap on the context against which it took place, and the steps the Government has taken since the referendum.The Government accepted the outcome of the referendum last June, and undertook to manage the impasse arising as a result of it.  We sought to gain an understanding of the reasons underlying the rejection of the treaty.  That included the commissioning of very comprehensive research, the findings of which have been published and with which the House is familiar.  The Government co-operated with the other parties in the Oireachtas in the establishment of the Sub-Committee on Ireland’s Future in the European Union, which undertook intensive and broad work, hearing from some 110 witnesses from more than 40 organisations.We then brought the key concerns, as identified in the Government's research and examined by the sub committee, to our partners in Europe and requested that these concerns would be addressed.  We did this through direct and extensive contact at many levels.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs, the Minister of State with responsibility for European Union affairs and our diplomatic network were very active in engaging with all other member states.I stayed in close contact with President Sarkozy, meeting on several occasions.  As the Council meeting approached, I undertook a number of visits to European capitals to meet leaders and to discuss our approach with them and to hear their views.  Early last week I spoke by telephone with as many of my European Council colleagues as proved possible to outline again our concerns and explain the nature of the response we felt was required.  Last week, we took those concerns to the European Council.  The following is a summary of what I said last week to my EU counterparts at the European Council.I began by reminding my colleagues that Ireland had agreed in October to seek to identify the elements of a solution which could command the support of all at the December Council meeting.  I stressed the Government's belief that the Lisbon treaty is important for the Union's future development.  I also recalled that it could only enter into force if it is ratified by all 27 member states.  I made clear that the concerns of the Irish people as expressed during the referendum must be reflected in any solution.  I elaborated on my comments in October about those concerns.  Many people felt that they lacked sufficient information or understanding to vote "Yes".  Many were concerned at a perceived loss of influence to Ireland, especially when the Commission ceased to include a national of every member state.  Others were concerned that decisions on important social and ethical issues, especially, but not only, abortion, would be taken out of Irish hands.  Some were concerned that workers' rights would somehow be constrained.  Some felt that the position on tax, notably corporation tax, was somehow undermined by the Lisbon treaty.  Others were concerned that our traditional policy of military neutrality, to which very many Irish people, whether they voted "Yes" or "No", hold a very strong sense of attachment, would be compromised by the Lisbon treaty. Some were even misled to fear that it could lead to conscription to a European army.  I said that while some of these fears and concerns were misplaced or based on misapprehension or misinformation, it did not take away from the fact that they were sincerely held and require a respectful response.I briefed my colleagues on the European Council on the work of the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union, noting that it had representation from across the political spectrum.  Again, I record my appreciation for the work of that committee and the way in which it carried out its business.  I informed the European Council that the Committee's report stated clearly that to help secure Ireland firmly at the heart of Europe, the concerns that arose during the referendum campaign must be addressed.  I made clear that the response to the concerns of the Irish people had to be satisfactory.  I then set out the nature of the response to the concerns that I believed was required.I stated that retaining a Commissioner was a real concern for the Irish people.  There was no doubt that this was a very significant part of the debate during the referendum campaign, and that a change was necessary to respond to the belief among the public that the loss of a Commissioner represented a considerable loss of influence.Second, I stated the Government needed an undertaking that the other concerns of the Irish people, which I had set out and that are recorded in the annex to the conclusions, would be addressed satisfactorily and in a legally robust manner, where appropriate.  Moreover, such an undertaking required the inclusion of a reaffirmation by the Union of the value it attaches to issues such as workers' rights and national competence in respect of key public services.Negotiations on the conclusions lasted for many hours last Thursday evening and resumed on Friday morning.  I am pleased to report to this House that the Council was able to reach unanimous agreement on the response to Ireland's concerns.  This unanimous agreement represents an extremely encouraging response to the concerns of the Irish people.  Our partners are prepared to adjust the institutional balance agreed within the Lisbon treaty to provide that member states keep a Commissioner each in response to Irish concerns.  This is a very significant move.  While several member states were strongly opposed, ultimately they accepted that this change is required.Second, with regard to the other areas of concern I have outlined previously, the Union agreed that our concerns should be responded to satisfactorily, including through the use of legally binding guarantees.  While the detail is yet to follow, our partners are clear about the nature of those guarantees.  The Union also agreed on the need to confirm the importance of issues such as workers' rights.  On the basis of the agreement on these elements and on condition of our being able to put in place appropriate guarantees, I stated that I would be prepared to return to the public to put a new package and to seek their approval of it.  I believe this to be a significant outcome.I emphasise that considerable work lies ahead on the responses to such concerns.  I also emphasise the nature of the agreement on the Commission because there was considerable confusion at the time of the referendum.  The maintenance of one Commissioner per member state is not possible under the existing treaty arrangements, as the Nice treaty requires the size of the Commission to be reduced.  Only if the Lisbon treaty enters into force will Ireland and every other member state now keep a Commissioner.  The conclusions agreed last week are very clear on this point.While my focus and that of my delegation was necessarily on the Lisbon treaty issue, other important issues also were discussed.  On the economic front, there has been extensive coverage of the European economic recovery plan.  This represents a framework for member states' efforts and is designed to ensure consistency and maximum impact.  In Ireland's case, while we will continue to sustain our capital spending at a level far above the historical norm, the immediate focus of our efforts must remain on redressing the budgetary imbalance.  The Council also agreed to take forward work on better global regulation of financial markets, better global governance and ensuring there is not growth in protectionism at a time of economic stress.  As a small exporting nation dependent on favourable international trading conditions, avoiding growth in protectionism is important for us.The agreement by the European Council on the climate change and energy package is of huge importance.  It is a good outcome for the environment and for Ireland and a number of our key concerns were taken on board at a late stage of the negotiations.  I pay particular tribute to the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy Gormley, and his officials for their excellent work in negotiations on this agreement.  It represents a significant step in the effort to forge a wider international agreement to tackle one of the greatest challenges of our age.  Nearly two years ago, under the leadership of Chancellor Merkel, Europe agreed to unilaterally reduce our emissions by 20% compared to 1990.  Friday's agreement under President Sarkozy's watchful eye was, in effect, the setting down in detail of how that is to be done and Ireland played its full part in delivering on that.The agreement represents the culmination of intensive and highly complex negotiations.  Many people hoped for a more robust deal and Ireland supported the Presidency and the Commission in pushing for a package that was stronger than that which finally was agreed.  However, one must recognise that compromise was necessary.  The compromises, with which some are unhappy, were necessary to ensure that agreement was reached.  Failure to reach agreement last week would have represented a serious set-back to the momentum we must bring to the climate change negotiations.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, led the Irish delegation at the UN negotiations in Poznan while the European Council was under way and we remained in close contact.  Ireland sought an acceleration of the international negotiations to agree a deal next year and the EU's leadership in this process was reinforced by last week's deal in Brussels.  The reality for all countries is that if progress is to be made in tackling climate change, meaningful adjustments must be made and inevitably this will involve some change for all.  The agreement is testament to Europe's ability to keep working, however challenging that may be, until agreement is reached.  While this may be slow, and at times, tortuous, it is the best and the only way.  On climate change, Europe now has shown the way forward by setting down its approach in detail on how it will reach reductions of 20%.  If the rest of the world rises to the challenge, the Union is committed to stepping up its target to minus 30%.The Council also adopted conclusions in several other areas, including agriculture, external relations and security and defence policy.  The full text of the conclusions has been laid in the Oireachtas Library.  As for the developments in Ireland in the pigmeat sector, at our request the Council agreed to invite the Commission to contribute to our efforts to support farmers and slaughterhouses.  The Government is following up with the Commission on this welcome development.  I record my appreciation to the Council and to Commission President Barroso in particular, for their support of, and solidarity towards, Ireland on this issue,The extent of the challenge Ireland faces in respect of its future relationship with Europe can hardly be over-stated.  There will be much written, accurately and regrettably otherwise, about the agreement reached last Friday and about what the Lisbon treaty itself does and does not do.  We must be careful not to lose sight of the wood for the trees.  My view, which I believe is shared by the vast majority of Members, is that our future must be within Europe.  Within Europe, we must be close to the centre and not at the margins or with some semi-detached status.  This has been the approach of Irish Governments of various hues for more than 35 years and it has served the country well.This shared approach over a sustained period reflects the reality that Ireland's relationship with Europe and its European partners is a truly national issue that transcends party politics.  I appreciate the approach adopted by Opposition leaders, with whom I have had discussions in recent days.  Whatever about our differences, we share a view that our future in Europe is so important that it requires as strongly united a position as possible within this House.  Those who suggest Ireland can remain at the heart of Europe while refusing to work with its fellow member states, which are convinced of the necessity for more efficient and effective institutions and a stronger EU voice internationally, are attempting to render a great disservice to the public.  Moreover, lest anyone consider that another referendum would create a pressure point around which concessions might be leveraged from the Government in return for support, I wish it to be understood that no good can come of such an approach.  Advancing sectoral or narrow interests in such a way could be highly damaging for this country, especially at this time.These are difficult times on a variety of fronts.  Just as many of the challenges Ireland faces are international, so must be the response to them.  Ireland must face outwards, not inwards, in seeking to advance its interests and protect its people and the hard-won improvements in living standards over the last decades.  Serving our national interest requires us to play our full role within Europe.Friday's conclusions on the Lisbon treaty move us further along the path of identifying a way forward that could gain the support of the Irish people, while at the same time being acceptable to all our partners.  The outcome of last week's meeting augurs well.  I am confident the Irish people's concerns can be addressed and will be addressed satisfactorily.  If a satisfactory outcome to the work I have described is achieved in the coming months, the Government will put the issue to another referendum.  Whether our future relationship with Europe will be based on Ireland playing a full and constructive role in the European Union or otherwise, ultimately will be for the Irish people to decide.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	386	Some time ago I criticised the Taoiseach and the Government for not being up front with those Opposition parties that have supported the Lisbon treaty.  I acknowledge and thank him for his response, in that the Government now is open to keeping Opposition leaders briefed on the issues that are emerging as we proceed with this business.  This is important, because whatever differences may exist between the Government and the Opposition, and there are many on matters such as the economy and the manner in which the country is run or otherwise, the Taoiseach may take it that Fine Gael always has supported Ireland's position in Europe and will continue to so do.  Some weeks ago, I stated that the only way the Lisbon treaty can come into effect is when the people give their decision on a different question, whenever that is to be asked.  I also made the point that this must take place towards the latter part of next year.  I acknowledge the response from the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs on being open to discussing these questions and how they should be dealt with.It will be necessary to put in place a structure pertaining to ways of demolishing the extant myths, falsifications and lies about what was not contained in the Lisbon treaty and the fears generated for those who had concerns.Let me repeat for the record that I think it is appropriate that either the sub-committee of the Joint Committee on European Affairs, which was chaired excellently by young Senator Paschal Donohoe, or some other independent group would carry out an audit of how we have transposed European directives into Irish law.  This is important because there is a range of measures that were causing people concern such as red tape in business, for sheep farmers on the hills etc.  Those concerns will not go away due to the fact the Taoiseach will hold a second referendum.  It is important that we would be able to demonstrate that people have listened to those concerns and that at least the Government has tried to address them in the sense of having examples of how the directives have been transposed into law in France, Italy or Germany as against in Ireland, and so that one can say to people that these directives were agreed and this is the way they have been implemented in Ireland as distinct from other areas.  I do not want to lessen the impact of a directive in any way but, in terms of common sense and flexibility, Government should respond here with an independent assessment of how that has happened.In my capacity as a Vice President of the European People's Party, I attended that party's meeting before the Heads of Government meeting.  I was struck by the generosity of the 14 prime ministers in that group towards this country and in wanting to help Ireland to deal with its difficulty.  They recognise that Europe needs Ireland and Ireland needs Europe.In the next 20 years, there will be the emergence of new global powers like China, India, Russia because of its natural resources, South Africa and Brazil, in addition to the United States.  In there, at the tail end of that, is the European Union.  Nobody wants to see a situation where catastrophe stares us in the face, as has happened with Iceland being outside of the eurozone and not having access to the European Central Bank.  These all are elements of having a prosperous society where one can use the fruits to build a country where people can live their dreams and fulfil their aspirations.It might be appropriate if the Taoiseach could respond and give us an indication of when he intends to hold the referendum.  I seek clarification from the Minister for Foreign Affairs about how the declarations can become legally binding.  I hope they evolve to a point where there is a specific protocol given on these matters.I campaigned on the basis of what was contained in the Lisbon treaty in respect of the commissionerships, and I was happy with that.  However, it is a concern of people and I take the point that if people feel that a Commissioner for every country is an important element of this, then I will not object to it.  The declarations given from the European Council meeting for Ireland are important and valid, and will go a long way towards ameliorating people's concerns about this.  If one gets to a point where the French Presidency under Presidency Sarkozy or, in June, the Czech Presidency, can evolve to a point of a legally binding protocol, then so much the better.I would like to say a great deal about climate change and other areas of fiscal responsibility in this regard but time does not permit me to do that today.

He has given a full life to public service and I wish him well.  I hope he can find time in the days ahead to spend floating around regions of the upper Shannon.  I wish his successor, Mr. Cooney, well.Coming to the end of the French Presidency of the EU, the Taoiseach mentioned the role played by President Sarkozy.  The French President got much flak in certain quarters in this country at the end of June last, but one must acknowledge the tremendous role he played in taking on board the concerns of the Irish people and the Irish Government.  He ensured, through his vigour and enthusiasm, that the EU responded in a positive manner to the needs of Ireland.  The way he dealt with the crisis in Georgia, and the tremendous role that Europe played in it, his dealing with the international financial crisis and his efforts to get a global approach to financial difficulties epitomised for me the need for a full-time president of the European Union based on the two and a half year concept.  That, to me, is one of the most essential ingredients required, as is outlined in the Lisbon treaty.I also welcome the steps taken by Government to get undertakings on measures.  One must acknowledge that from our point of view in the main, with the exception of the Commissioner, all of these were dealt with in the treaty.  However, there was a lack of certainty among people.  There were concerns and it is important those concerns have been addressed.The EU is probably the most democratic political concept on the planet.  I must admit it is much more democratic than we are here in this country where the Opposition gets generally only crumbs from Government, irrespective of who is in Government, and we are not blaming the Minister, Deputy Martin, exclusively for that.  In the EU, everyone has a say, views are taken on board and compromises are made, notwithstanding the fact that many countries do not agree with the provision of a Commissioner for every member state because they feel that it will impinge upon efficiency.I note from the "No" side of the campaign that the argument has moved on a little.  The treaty contains so many matters that there are many new claims, and many new battles will be fought over the months ahead on new territory.  It is important we do not lose sight of the treaty's tremendous advantages.The Lisbon treaty is not meant to replace what is there.  It is not something new coming in for something old or unworkable.  It enhances what is already there.  It is an improvement on what is already there.  The practitioners who operate on a day-to-day, month-to-month and year-to-year basis feel the need for it.  I cannot come around to the concept that there is a conspiracy by 26 or 27 governments to make life difficult for their people or for their administrators.  We must bear in mind that the concept of this is for the common good.I look at the many positive things it can do.  It can deal with cross-border crime, and I hope that we can see it in our wisdom to opt in on judicial and home affairs.  It can deal with the energy crisis.  We are here at the periphery of Europe, at the end of the pipe.  Where would we stand trying to create an energy security policy on our own?  It would not be possible.Ireland is the gateway to Europe.  We projected ourselves as the young Europeans for decades.  Europe has been very positive for us.  Jobs are an issue with respect to Europe.  I heard some of the "No" campaigners talk about scare tactics and I thought it was a little rich of them.  Certainly, Ireland being at the heart of Europe is essential for our foreign direct investment needs and the "No" to the Lisbon treaty sent out a negative message.  The message is not that tangible at present but, as some of the contributors to the sub-committee mentioned, by the time it becomes tangible it will be too late.The Taoiseach mentioned earlier the issue of workers' rights.  It is important the legislation that is necessary here on home territory to deal with workers' rights issues should be put in place in the first half of next year.On the treaty, this morning I read bits of an extract from a speech by Mr. Gay Byrne.  In the last campaign there was the great slogan, "If you don't know, vote No".  In my view, if you do not know, you try to learn and find out about it.  If you do not find out about it, do not go and impinge upon other people who have taken the time to go and find out about something and make an informed decision.  I am not picking on Mr. Byrne specifically, but I will use him as the figurehead for many of the people in that campaign.  He stated, "I agree with Ulick McEvaddy that the entire thing is unintelligible bilge".  If I adopted the same approach to the transport legislation on road safety as Mr. Byrne has done on this occasion, I would be saying to the public that if they had a vote on this legislation, do not pass it because they will not understand it.  That approach is too simplistic.  It is too serious a matter for opinion makers to adopt that approach.  One goes out and informs oneself of the rights or wrongs.  One does not need to know every comma and full-stop in the treaty but the information is freely available even if knowledge and interest is more limited.I challenge opinion makers to study the material before they make an informed decision and, if they then discover an ideological difficulty with the text, people will respect them for it.  They should not take the simplistic view that it is in vogue to vote "No" if one does not know.  In regard to the idea of signing a contract on a house, I do not know how many people have read their mortgage contracts.  I have not read them even though I have bought more than one house in my time.  I signed my name and accepted my solicitor's advice that matters were in order.Mr. Byrne wrote: "One other thing I'll guarantee: within six months of Ireland voting "Yes", our special corporate tax rate will be gone".  The untruth of that statement will be copperfastened by a protocol following the commitment received by the Government on taxation.  If Mr. Byrne and other commentators intend to participate in a national debate, they should at least afford the public the courtesy of learning the issues before they pass pronouncement.  Their views will be respected even by those who disagree with their judgment if they are based on informed knowledge.Senator Donohoe has produced a report on the findings of the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union which is available on the Internet for free or the Government publications sales office for €4.10.  Efforts are also being made to circulate copies of the report to libraries.  It will not be the most exciting read this Christmas but it will probably be one of the most important.  A recent "The Gerry Ryan Show" included a segment in which information was sought on the report.  The programme was contacted shortly after this segment aired but a decision was made not to inform viewers on the report's availability.  Anyone who wants a copy of the report could obtain one from the Government, Fine Gael or the Labour Party.As this is probably the most serious issue we will decide in a referendum for a generation, people should inform themselves.  If they make their decision on an informed basis, nobody can argue with them, but they should not vote "No" because they claim not to know.  That is a simplistic and irresponsible approach.  This is not the opinion of a Europhile or a member of an unelected elite lecturing to "No" people; it is basic common sense.

These should have been the priorities for the European summit and today's discussion.  Instead, as a consequence of last June's referendum, the first priority at the summit and for this House is the Lisbon treaty and the future constitutional arrangements for Europe.  That may be good news for those who wish to slow down Europe for the sake of their commercial or political interests or whose politics thrive on institutional paralysis but it is not good news for those who need the European Union to respond more effectively to the economic crisis or wish the European Union to lead on the future of the planet.The big story coming out of the summit was that a deal was struck on the Lisbon treaty and a second referendum will be held.  Already people are lined up in their trenches.  Those who were for it are for it again and those were against it are against it again regardless of what is written in the document.  I do not take that approach.  This is by no means a done deal.  Important progress has been made but this matter remains a work in progress.  What has been agreed is a carefully constructed formula which under certain conditions should lead to a second referendum.  However, as the Taoiseach confirmed in the comments he made this morning, the holding of a second referendum is conditional on a satisfactory outcome for the work currently in progress.If we have learned anything from the last referendum, it is the importance of reading the small print.  I welcome the recognition in Europe that the same question cannot be put to the people again.  Significant changes are required to address the concerns raised during the campaign and major progress has been in that regard.  The decision to revert to one Commissioner per member state is a significant change to the proposition that was put to us last June.  The proposal to reduce the size of the Commission arose from a concern for making that body more efficient.  It was an agreed and important part of the new architecture but as my colleague, Proinsias De Rossa, MEP, has pointed out and to paraphrase the Secretary General of the Commission, if one has to choose between efficiency and legitimacy, one chooses legitimacy.  The decision that each member state will retain a Commissioner should be acknowledged as representing a real response to concerns raised during the Irish referendum.The European Council has also undertaken to address a number of the other concerns that arose during the campaign.  The proposals on abortion, neutrality and taxation are not controversial and were never going to be affected by the treaty anyway.  Nonetheless, it is welcome the a belt and braces approach is being pursued in order to reassure voters on these points.  However, I have concerns about two other issues.The first issue pertains to the summit conclusions, which commit to "a guarantee that the provisions of the Irish Constitution in relation to the right to life, education and the family are not in any way affected by the fact that the Treaty of Lisbon attributes legal status to the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights or by the justice and home affairs provisions of the said Treaty".  What does that mean?  I am aware that abortion was an issue in the referendum and I have no objection to a restatement of the status quo, in other words, that abortion is entirely an Irish matter.  That was done in the Maastricht treaty.  However, I have serious concerns about this paragraph in terms of where it came from and what it might mean.  Exactly what are these issues of education and the family in respect of which it would appear that Irish recourse to the charter is to be restricted?  I heard some ingenious falsehoods being peddled during the campaign but these issues are new.One of the principal reasons the Labour Party supported the Lisbon treaty in June was the Charter of Fundamental Rights, which we believe would greatly strengthen the rights of the individual citizen in the European Union.  We would be very concerned if the charter was watered down or if Irish citizens had more limited access than other European citizens to the rights enshrined therein.  Clearly, the devil is in the detail and a process of negotiation must now begin.  A mechanism should be found to allow the involvement of pro-Lisbon treaty parties in that process.The other issue about which I have concerns is workers' rights.  I was satisfied that the Lisbon treaty would significantly enhance worker's rights but a perception was successfully created during the campaign that the opposite was the case.  This was not helped by the Government's poor record in protecting and enforcing workers' rights at home or in progressing European initiatives to enhance rights.  The issue was further complicated by decisions of the European Court of Justice, including the Laval case.  There is a real concern among working people that the way has been opened for undermining the levels of pay and working conditions accepted as the norm in this country and most other member states.  These issues must be satisfactorily addressed before another referendum is held.Working through the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union, Deputy Costello has advanced a number of proposals that would protect workers' rights.  However, these proposals, which are discussed in the report of the sub-committee, were not adequately taken up by the Government.  I welcome the political commitment made in the conclusions to attach high importance to this issue but this needs to be fleshed out.  We also need to see a commitment from the Government to address this issue domestically.  Again, I am aware this is intended to start a process of drafting and I am prepared to engage with the Government in this regard but the importance of this issue does not seem to have been grasped.The Government has committed to holding another referendum before the end of next October.  The proposition to be put to the people in that referendum is to be changed.  We can see the shape of some of that change, but we do not know the detail.  It is the detail of the change which concerns me and which will determine the Labour Party's response.This is not a done deal and two issues arise which are of real concern.  These are the Charter of Fundamental Rights and workers' rights.  If a second referendum is to be held or passed, those concerns must be addressed and the Opposition parties need to be involved in the process that addresses them.I want to say a few words about the economy and climate change.  I welcome the decision made by the European Council to launch a co-ordinated economic recovery package across the European Union.  The plan wisely avoids a one-size-fits-all approach but emphasises instead the need for a co-ordinated approach.  It also endorses some key principles.  The initial thinking from the Commission pointed to the need for short-term action that would build long-term competitiveness.  It pointed, for example, to the potential of the green collar sector to create employment, and the importance of investment in research and development and in infrastructure.These are points which the Labour Party has been making for some time.  I also believe that Ireland should play its part in this European initiative but again, there is no clarity as to what the Government is thinking or doing.  After months of doing nothing, last Monday there was a big public relations exercise at Farmleigh, although there is still no plan.  It is by no means clear whether the Government's economic plan, when it eventually appears, will fit with the overall EU strategy.  It should do so.The EU has, in recent years, been one of the strongest advocates of international action to prevent runaway global warming.  It was in this context that the Commission's energy and climate change package was published at the beginning of the year.  The intervening 11 months have changed global economics and politics almost beyond recognition.  The reality of global warming has not changed, nor has our obligation to stop it.Whereas much of the detail of the energy and climate change package is welcome, the major concessions to big polluters and the conditions now attached to a 30% reduction if goodwill is shown in Copenhagen by the United States, China and others are a cause for concern.  This watering down of the original package is delaying the inevitable — that we must take radical, collective action to prevent catastrophic climate change, and that we must take it sooner rather than later.The EU has been the most important vehicle for progress in recent European history.  It has been vital for progress in Ireland of its citizens, economy and environment.  We must not allow our current difficulties, or the political difficulties of this Government, to reverse this progress for the sake of a short-term fix.
#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	391	I thank Deputy Gilmore for sharing his time.  He has articulated very well the issues of major concern to the Labour Party and those matters which still need to be addressed.  This European Council meeting was one of the most significant in many years.  Some of the issues being addressed were major global matters, including the financial crisis, as now the full 15 eurozone countries have slipped into recession.  The €200 billion recovery package has been extremely important in that respect.As I understand it, none of the Irish banks has taken up the €30 billion package put forward in October, some two months ago, for small and medium enterprises.  That would have been fantastic for providing liquidity in this credit crunch, with 54% of the small and medium enterprises in need of cash flow.  Likewise, I was amazed to hear last night on "Oireachtas Report" the spokesperson from Allied Irish Bank, who appeared before a committee, saying that the bank did not need any liquidity and was quite happy not to get the €10 billion from the Government.  Where are we on the banking issue and the money being made available from Europe?On the climate change issue, it is good to see we have at last made the first rung on the ladder to the 20% reduction, efficiency and sustainability with regard to greenhouse gases.  The challenge we face is that from 2012, it will cost the Irish economy an estimated €1 billion.  We must address the challenge and ensure this becomes a benefit to the Irish economy, and the area of industry dealing with cutting greenhouse gases becomes an advantage.  We have enormous resources in wind, geothermal and others that should enable us to add to the economy.The central issue addressed with regard to this country was the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty rejection in June.  We had a circle to square in that the people rejected the Lisbon treaty while at the same time indicating strongly that they were in support of participation and engagement in the European Union going forward.  We had preliminary work arising from the Millward Brown survey and the work of the sub-committee, which lasted for two months.The Government went to the European Council with five central identified issues to address.  The first was the matter of the Commissioner, which we must recognise was very successfully addressed.  The second was the matter of taxation and legal guarantees have been given on this.  The third was the matter of the European security and defence policy and how this relates to neutrality, and legal guarantees have also been provided on this.  The fourth matter was right to life, education and the family, and again legal guarantees were provided in this area.The fifth issue raised by the Government was the protection of workers' rights and public services.  No legal guarantee was sought or given in this respect, although assurances were sought and given.  Even at this, it appears the United Kingdom was not happy with that level of assurance.  This can be seen in almost the same terms as 40% of Irish voters voting in respect of the Lisbon treaty having considered the protection of workers' rights as very important.  The Council confirmed it considers the issue very important but it did not assert it would act on it, which was the case in terms of the other four issues.The question remains of what will be done.  How will we make the assurances sufficiently robust for the issues to be addressed?  The nub of the problem is that we must find a legal mechanism to ensure that when a conflict arises with regard to the four freedoms of the marketplace and the movement of goods, services and people, it must be addressed in the context of not allowing them take precedence over the protection of the rights of workers.  These are fundamental rights which have been based on long-term national law that has been discussed and put in place.  Agreements and practices have also been engaged in, and these must be protected rather than undermined.I am not so sure I wish to engage again in an all-party sub-committee where one party uses the forum to grandstand rather than engage.  The party attempted to delete everything proposed within that sub-committee's findings.  Another party to that sub-committee did not make any submission of its own but went out to the plinth just as the sub-committee's findings were being drafted and made statements of its own which, to a large degree, undermined the good work done in the previous seven or eight weeks.

We argued that the Irish people's concerns on workers' rights, public services, neutrality, democracy, tax sovereignty and international trade were valid and had to be addressed.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, and his fellow "Yes" campaign supporters told the people that there was no better deal to be had.  Last week's meeting of the EU Council has proven this proposition wrong.  However, the EU Council agreement raises more questions than answers.  Earlier this morning, we had some opportunity to commence teasing that out.As it stands today, the Government has committed itself to re-running a referendum on the same treaty the people rejected on 12 June.  They have not secured any changes to the Lisbon treaty or its protocols.  The deal struck will not address the substantive issues raised by the electorate time and time again before and after the Lisbon referendum.  Sinn Féin wants to see these issues addressed.  Ireland is a full and active member of the European Union and will remain so.  We want to see Ireland's influence maintained and enhanced.  We want to see neutrality protected.  We want to see a social progress clause that will protect workers' pay and conditions.  We want to see a new approach on public services.  We want to see the promotion of a trade policy that is good for Irish farmers and the developing world.  We want to see the Government deliver on the mandate it was given.What did the Government agree to?  Over the last number of days we have listened to Ministers in the media telling us that the changes they secured on the issue of a Commissioner and a number of declarations will allow them to return to the people and re-run the referendum.  The question is whether these assertions stand up to scrutiny.  In our opinion, on the evidence before us, they do not.We are told that the agreement which was reached allows all member states to keep their Commissioner if the Lisbon treaty is passed by October 2009, but that is not true.  Under the Nice treaty unanimity is required to decide the number of Commissioners.  An interim solution could have been found to allow for every state to keep its Commissioner until the broader issue of the reform of the EU was resolved.  This could have been done while the broader issues of the EU's democratic deficit, workers' rights and public services, militarisation and the influence of small countries in the EU institutions were being addressed.  The Government had the opportunity to put these issues on the table but, with respect, it failed to do so.The second assertion is about legally binding guarantees.  The Government has told the people that a number of the key issues of debate during the referendum will be dealt with through legally binding guarantees.  We are also being told that this may happen in the context of the Croatian accession treaty in 2010 or 2011.  How this is to be achieved, and what impact it will have on the Lisbon treaty, is not clear.  What is clear, however, is that any future accession treaty will not be put to the people in a referendum.  What we are likely to get is some form of declaration, promising protocols to an accession treaty that we may or may not see prior to a second Lisbon treaty referendum.  That is a very important point.Contrary to claims made by the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Micheál Martin, in newspapers this week, Sinn Féin has not rejected any deal before considering its detail.

The answer is that the Government does not have it, and it is telling us that it will not have it until later in 2009.  How therefore does the Government know it will in any way resolve the substantive concerns that led people to vote "No" in June?Declarations are not worth the paper they are written on as they are not legally binding.  They are exactly what they are called — political declarations made by politicians with no legal status or force.  They are like promises made by a Government at election time, sadly, more likely to be broken than implemented.  Unless protocols are secured and ratified by all member states, guarantees as described by the Government are worthless.On the issue of neutrality, even if this declaration were legally binding there would be huge questions about its value.  The declaration refers to Ireland's "traditional policy of neutrality" which, given the role this State plays in assisting the transit of US troops to Iraq, would hardly instill confidence.  It will do nothing to halt the drift towards militarisation of the EU, the enlargement of the EU's military tasks, and the establishment of the European Defence Agency.  It will not prevent closer, so-called EU co-ordination with NATO.The declaration on taxation changes nothing in the treaties.  Unanimity in the Council is still required for tax harmonisation measures, but the Council will have the ability to bypass popular referenda in order to take such a step.  This point was confirmed in a legal opinion secured by the Oireachtas Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union.  For the record, I will quote the legal opinion:Article 48 expressly gives power to change the mechanism of voting and a ratification of this Article or the Treaty containing this Article by the Irish people in referendum gives authority in referendum for any subsequent change which complies with Article 48 without the necessity of further recourse to the people.There is obviously a belief among EU leaders that a future Irish Government will be convinced to go along with such a move.  A declaration, even if legally binding, would not change that.  That is a crucial point.  The authority of the Irish people to decide on this matter by referenda will be removed.The Council conclusions on the issues of workers' rights and public services are deeply worrying.  These issues have been totally ignored by the Government since the "No" vote, despite Sinn Féin and others insisting they were critical issues that had to be addressed.  The Government and the Council seem to have recognised, belatedly, that they are important issues but the way in which they are dealt with is completely inadequate.  The undermining of workers' pay and conditions has caused serious disquiet across the country.  It is totally unacceptable that the Government has failed to secure a social progress clause to prevent the exploitation of workers in Ireland and across the EU.  This is a missed opportunity.The conclusions refer to ". . . public services, as an indispensable instrument of social and regional cohesion".  Not only is this limiting in terms of what public services are, for the conclusions of the Council make it clear that EU leaders have absolutely no intention of halting or reversing the liberalisation of public services as provided for in the treaties.

The conclusions also refer to:. . . the essential role and wide discretion of national, regional and local governments in providing, commissioning and organising non-economic services of general interest, which is not affected by any provision of the Treaty of Lisbon, including those relating to the common commercial policy.That is a reiteration of protocol 9 of the Lisbon treaty.  The "non-economic services of general interest" definition is, as we know, constructed in such a way as to limit governments' role in the broader field of public services, namely health, education, social services, transport, utilities etc.

They attempt to confuse a number of issues in order to give full reign to fear and misinformation in a rerun of the referendum.Having seen them in action over this past short spell, the approach of some members of the Government, including those present, has been arrogant.

Notwithstanding that, he is entitled to make his contribution.Will the Minister for Foreign Affairs confirm whether, under the Constitution, the Government can introduce a proposal for a constitutional referendum as often as it wishes?  I will not go down the road of discussing the number of times America's suffragettes needed to make proposals.  They were told "No" 30 or 40 times before they got the vote.Will the Minister confirm the co-finance measures to deal with the pork crisis?  What funding, if any, will be available from the EU?  At the bishops' conference this week, Bishop Fields called on the Government to urge the EU to send peacekeeping troops to the Congo.  Did this possibility arise during the Council meeting?  While the African Union-UN force in the Congo is working to the best of its ability, additional forces are required in the region to restore peace and stability to the Congo.  Currently, this could only be done by EU troops.Reference was made to the Middle East peace process.  Will the Minister inform the House of the EU's role in the Quartet discussions?Regarding the €200 billion economic stimulus package, what input will Ireland have and over what period will it last?
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	414	There are precedents of organising multiple referendums on various issues, such as electoral representation, divorce and abortion.  There is no constraint on reverting to the people to allow them to decide on any particular question.Regarding pigmeat, the issue was handled in the context of the EU through the European Food Safety Authority.  This showed the importance of belonging to an international organisation where people on the veterinary, food safety and public health sides work collectively in accordance with best principles, such as the precautionary principle, as it gives the markets confidence.  There is a direct link between an EU public health surveillance and food safety network and ultimate market confidence in food products.  This was clearly displayed in the pork issue.Last week, a private storage scheme for pigmeat was exclusively introduced for Ireland.  This will allow the storage of some 30,000 tonnes of pigmeat products with an underlying value of €15 million for a period of six months.  We managed to achieve a Council conclusion in text format, which will enable the Council to express its support for Ireland's effort to deal with the situation and for its prompt precautionary action and ask the Commission to support farmers and slaughterhouses in Ireland by way of co-financed measures to remove the relevant animals and products from the market.  The conclusion has been given politically and the Commission is working with the Government on the details in terms of how the former can add supports over and above what has been offered in terms of the private storage area.  This demonstrates the good faith shown by our European partners during the exceptional situation in which we found ourselves.Last week, the EU's Foreign Ministers held two significant discussions on the situation in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, DRC.  The first occurred at the General Affairs and External Relations Council meeting on Monday and the second occurred over dinner at the European Council meeting on Thursday, 11 December.  The key issue was our response to the request of the UN Secretary-General, Ban Ki-moon, for assistance and support.  The original request was for a deployment by the EU or some of its member states of a multinational force for up to four months, pending the arrival of reinforcements requested by the UN Security Council.  The matter has been under discussion, including a detailed discussion at the meeting and a briefing by Javier Solana.There have been some welcome developments on the regional political side of the issue, as leaders are engaging.  There is no unanimity on the deployment of a battle group, but we agreed on further engagement with Ban Ki-moon concerning the details of what would be required on the ground and what could be deployed effectively.  From a humanitarian perspective, we believe that there should be a positive and meaningful response to the Secretary-General's request, which I articulated at the Foreign Affairs Council.One can argue that the whole idea of battle groups was to have them in readiness to be able to respond to such situations.  Obviously, circumstances are moving quickly.  At Thursday's meeting, there was a sense that matters had improved somewhat and that we should keep them under consideration.  Discussions are continuing at senior level under Javier Solana's office.At the Foreign Affairs Council meeting on Thursday, our text contributed significantly to an extended discussion on the Middle East and found its way into the ultimate conclusions of the overall text in terms of developing broader support for the Arab peace initiative and a broader regional dimension and encouraging the prioritisation of the Middle East question by the incoming American presidential Administration.With regard to the economy, we are spending approximately twice the EU average on capital investment.  We are ahead of the game in that regard in the context of the stimulus policy.  We welcome the initiative on the part of President Barroso in respect of this matter.

What is the position regarding the conditional response to a second referendum?  How does the Minister propose to deal with the Opposition in the House in respect of this matter?  Does he intend to establish a new committee or will the existing sub-committee remain in place?  What steps does he propose to take in the context of introducing domestic legislation relating to the EU directives — such as the services directive, the agency workers directive and the migrant workers directive — that are awaiting transposition into Irish law?  There is also the question of the employment law compliance legislation.  A report published yesterday indicates that fewer than half of those employed in the hotel and services industries are paid the minimum wage and that 75% of them are not paid overtime at weekends.Between now and the summer of next year — when the Czech Republic will hold the Presidency of the EU — what steps does the Minister propose to take to deal with the issues raised at the summit?  How does he propose to progress matters relating to them to a satisfactory conclusion?On the €200 billion stimulus package, why does Ireland seem to have difficulty in drawing down the money available from the European Investment Bank?  Why has none of the €30 billion available from this source in respect of small and medium enterprises not been drawn down by Irish banks to date?  Such enterprises here are crying out for cash but the banks are not making it available.  The banks are stonewalling these businesses and stating that they have no problem as regards liquidity.  However, there is no sign of credit being provided.  Why do we appear to have a problem with regard to drawing down EU money?Matters relating to Zimbabwe were discussed at the Council meeting and I understand the case of Jestina Mukoko, a campaigner for human rights in that country, was raised.  Was any progress made in the context of pressurising South Africa, the key player in the region, to take action?  Did the possibility of imposing sanctions arise at the Council meeting?  I understand certain Irish pension funds are invested in the region.  Perhaps taking action in respect of these might be an appropriate avenue of action.

Normally it works with the member state which holds the Presidency, which then negotiates with the other member states.On the domestic front, the Deputy made the point that there should be constant communication between the parties on a bipartisan level.  Such communication will continue to be the norm.  I am of the view that it may be useful to retain the Sub-Committee on Ireland's Future in the European Union, which produced a report prior to the Council meeting.  Notwithstanding some of the reservations articulated earlier by the Deputy, the sub-committee operated as an extremely effective vehicle within the Oireachtas for facilitating a debate on issues relating to Ireland and the European Union, particularly in the aftermath of the Lisbon treaty referendum result.The sub-committee may have an opportunity to continue its work.  I have been working on this matter since July and when we established the sub-committee, Deputy Costello suggested that it should issue an interim report and that there should, perhaps, be a second phase to its work.  That may be one possibility as to what might happen.  I will consult with the Deputy and others in order to decide on what might be the best way to proceed.  We must go about our work in an effective and efficient manner.On workers' rights, it is important to again point out that we work with the other member states on the amendment of the EU's body of law on labour and that we draw up domestic legislation in respect of this matter.  We ensured that the conclusions agreed last week contain an acceptance and confirmation in respect of the importance attached by European Union member states to the issue of workers' rights.  That is a better outcome than we anticipated prior to the Council meeting.  Our original presentation to the Presidency took the form of the attachment to the conclusions of an Irish text relating to this matter.  Through a process of negotiation, however, we moved beyond that to a position where the undertakings to give legal guarantees to issues specific to Ireland — neutrality, tax and ethics — are contained in the conclusions, which are strong as a result.  In addition, there is an attachment of high importance to the issue of workers' rights.

The critical issue is that Ireland has in place a minimum wage.  Sweden did not have a minimum wage and, as a result, the Laval judgment is extremely specific to that country.  The absence of legal frameworks in Sweden made it fundamentally vulnerable.  In this country there are recognised employment agreements, REAs, in the area of construction, joint labour committees, JLCs, operate in certain sectors and there is also the minimum wage.

The Taoiseach indicated that a number of member states were opposed to the retention of a Commissioner by each member state but stated that they ultimately accepted that this change is required.  Will the Minister indicate the states that were strongly opposed and outline the specific arguments they put forward in this regard?  Will he provide detail in respect of this matter in order that we might be assured that the undertaking relating to Commissioners is not merely being included to create the appearance of serious engagement?President Sarkozy referred to the treaty relating to Croatia's anticipated accession in 2010 or 2011.  It has been stated that some of the declarations to which the Minister, the Taoiseach and their colleagues have referred since the European Council meeting would form part of that treaty.  Will the Minister indicate if that is the case?  Will we have a second Lisbon treaty referendum prior to our even seeing some of the ostensibly "legally binding declarations", to use the wording employed by Government, that they will not present until 2010 or 2011?  Perhaps the Minister would clarify the position in this regard.

However, he quickly moved away from that.  On his point in regard to the Commission, under Lisbon there will be fewer members of the Commission; that is a legal fact.  There is no getting around this; an interim agreement cannot be provided.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	451	They believed that there was an institutional balance to be arrived at and had no difficulty articulating the view that they believe a reduced Commission would lead to more efficiency and so forth.  They have articulated this view publicly and within the Council.  Others had reservations earlier in the negotiating phase.  I respect the positions they presented to us.  This was a difficult and substantial issue.  It was a major concession by our colleagues to Ireland to agree to change the situation in regard to implementation of the Lisbon treaty.Deputy Ó Caoláin continually uses the word "declaration".  We never used that word.  That word is not contained in the conclusions or used in any public articulation of the issues.  I have nothing against the word "declaration".  One of the most far-reaching declarations we ever had was the "Downing Street Declaration" with which Sinn Féin had no problem.  What we have referred to here are "decisions" of the European Council which in themselves have legal validity.What we are talking about in this regard is a decision from the European Council which has undertaken to give robust legal guarantees that would have treaty status and will be attached to the treaties.  Obviously, these will be attached to the treaties at the time of the next accession treaty, which potentially is the Croatian accession.  There is a precedent in this regard in terms of the Danish experience.  This is far better than Deputy Ó Caoláin ever thought we would get.

#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	453	Deputy Ó Caoláin jumped the gun prior to Council and during the debate.  Sinn Féin's spokespeople continually stated we were getting meaningless declarations.  They are more surprised than anybody by what has been achieved.  President Sarkozy was open and honest and told the 27 members at the Council meeting that this will mean a legal guarantee, a protocol, will be attached to the treaties.I would like to make a final and important point in respect of workers' rights, an issue raised by all Deputies.  The Charter of Fundamental Rights is key to Lisbon.  It is part of Lisbon and refers to the right of workers to negotiate and conclude collective agreements at appropriate levels; to take collective action to defend their interests, including strike action; workers' and their representatives guarantee of information and consultation in good time; workers' rights to protection against unjustified dismissal in accordance with union laws, national laws and practices; workers' rights of access to a free placement service; workers' rights to working conditions which respect their health, safety and dignity; workers' rights to limitation of maximum working hours, to daily and weekly rest periods and to periods of paid annual leave; and the prohibition in respect of the employment of children.  It states that the minimum age of admission to employment may not be lower than the minimum school-leaving age, without prejudice to such rules as may be more favourable to young people and except for limited derogations.  Also, young people admitted to work must have working conditions appropriate to their age and be protected against economic exploitation and any work likely to harm their safety, health or physical, mental, moral or social development or to interfere with their education.  These provisions are contained in the Charter of Fundamental Rights.  Why, in the name of God, does Sinn Féin insist on voting against these fundamental rights for workers?

Doing so would provide it with an opportunity to demonstrate its good faith on this issue.  Then we might believe the Government is sincere.  The Government continually refuses——-
#KathleenLynch	unknown-#KathleenLynch-party	unknown-#KathleenLynch-dob	unknown-#KathleenLynch-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	455	I ask the Minister to reply in writing to the questions put by Deputy Barrett.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	456	I will do so.  I wish to confirm that a substantial provision of up to €300 million was agreed for carbon capture and storage.  There was a robust debate on that issue, in respect of which we obtained a satisfactory outcome.  I will reply formally to the Deputy in regard to the committee's work.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	457	I propose to take Questions Nos. 59 and 60 together.I wish to bring to the attention of the Deputies the fact that under the applicable takeover rules there are constraints on any comments I can make about the matter at this stage.  The reply is given in that context.Ireland's aviation policy, as set out in my Department's current statement of strategy, is to promote regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country and key business and tourism markets.  The priority, from an Irish economy perspective, is to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world.  That remains the strategic context against which any proposal for the purchase of the State's shareholding in Aer Lingus will be considered.Following its initial announcement on 1 December, Ryanair posted a detailed offer to Aer Lingus shareholders on 15 December.  In accordance with the takeover rules, the board of the company must set out a detailed response within 14 days following the release of the detailed offer so that shareholders can make a decision on the acceptance of the offer or otherwise.  The Deputy will be aware that the board of Aer Lingus has publicly announced its rejection of the proposed offer.I have said that the Government would consider the Ryanair offer when received.  It is now being examined by my Department.  The State's nominees on the board were issued with a mandate to seek to reconcile commercial and public policy objectives on 31 January 2008.  I have not given any specific directions to the State's nominees on the board in regard to this matter.  All members of the board of directors are subject to the requirements of the Companies Acts to uphold their fiduciary responsibilities and to act in the interests of the company and its shareholders.Even if a sufficient number of Aer Lingus shareholders were willing to accept Ryanair's offer, the completion of a merger between Ryanair and Aer Lingus would only be possible with the approval of the European Commission.  The Deputy will be aware that Ryanair's previous takeover bid, initiated in 2006, failed to obtain the necessary approval and that decision is now under appeal by Ryanair to the Court of First Instance.On 11 December, I agreed to meet with the CEO and chairman of Aer Lingus who wished to convey to me their opposition to the Ryanair offer.  The Deputy will be aware that the company made a public statement following the meeting.

If the Government were to decide to accept this offer, would the Minister be in a position to instruct his nominees on the board to do so or are they separate to and independent of his policy decision?On 1 December, the Minister said there were two key issues.  He did not include competition today.  What is his view on competition?  Would it be bad for consumers if there was only one airline option in Ireland, in other words, if Aer Lingus and Ryanair were part of the one fleet and under the same ownership?Does the Minister consider that the recent Ryanair offer, which is much less than a previous offer, is bad for the taxpayer in the context of the Government investment in Aer Lingus?  The key point is that on 1 December the Minister said the Government's shareholding was being held, in particular, to prevent hostile bids or takeovers.  Can he define what he means by a "hostile bid"?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	459	As I indicated at the outset, I must be careful in what I say until such time as the Government makes a final decision on the issue.  To try to be helpful to the Deputy, I repeat that it is Irish aviation policy to have maximum connectivity and competition.  We have pursued a two-airline policy for many years, in the sense that we believe two airlines is the minimum number that should fly in and out of Ireland.  We have more than that and we would want to see more than that, but in the context of that particular aviation policy I will present to Government when I know the full facts of the offer, and when I have the full response from Aer Lingus, which is due to be made on 29 December.  At that stage I will make my recommendation to Government on the shareholding we have.  I will take into account the matters the Deputy legitimately and correctly raised, namely, whether the offer is good value for taxpayers and whether it will enhance or hinder competition.I have explained the specific details regarding the directors to the Deputy.  The directors of the Aer Lingus board have already made their views on the offer known, but they have to make a formal response to it.  The directors must have regard to the general aviation policies of the Government, but they must also ensure their fiduciary responsibilities are fully met.  I cannot dictate to them how they should act but I can point out what is Government policy at the time.  I will not make a decision on the matter until, first, I have seen the offer, which I have now seen and that is being examined, and second, Aer Lingus has made a full response to the offer.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	460	On behalf of the Labour Party, I have heard from both sides and I have read the Coinside Limited offer document.  I have also heard from Aer Lingus.  I agree with Mr. Conor McCarthy.  I think this is an ego trip and a complete distraction by the chief executive of Ryanair.  On competition and connectivity grounds, but above all on behalf of the Irish travelling public, I believe the offer should be rejected out of hand and Aer Lingus should stay as a totally independent airline.  That is where my party stands.  Tomorrow we will have an opportunity to question again representatives of the two airlines in public.The Minister outlined the Government's aviation policy.  Does it encompass a two major airline policy?  In other words, are we in favour of two major airlines connecting this island nation to the United Kingdom and to Europe?I understand the three Government-appointed directors to the board of Aer Lingus are Mr. Hackett, Mr. Wall and Dr. Hunt.  Has the Minister been in contact with them in any way?  Has he spoken to them and will they fulfil the objectives of the national aviation policy?  Has the Cabinet discussed the matter?  Has the Minister spoken to any of the other large shareholders, such as, for example, Bank of Ireland, which I understand owns 4% of Aer Lingus, Mr. Denis O'Brien and, above all, the ESOT itself and Aer Lingus?Will the Minister comment briefly on the competition issue?  Is it not a fact that if the takeover were to be achieved, the number of routes out of Ireland would increase by approximately 20% or 25% immediately, that it would increase in terms of being a single airline route and there would be much less competition?  Is it not the case that this would be a major blow, that we would have a dominant, monolith airline with 75% or 80% of traffic?In terms of connectivity, regarding the slots in Heathrow, for example, and Shannon, is it possible for the kind of guarantees Mr. O'Leary has said he would give to be incorporated into any takeover agreement, given the comments of the Stock Exchange on a number of offers?Most Members would agree that Ryanair has a dismal record — sometimes an appalling record — in regard to the conditions and salaries of workers who work for the company on this island and in other parts of Europe.  Does the Minister have concerns about the future treatment of the workforce of any merged airline?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	461	I thank the Deputy for his contribution and his statement of Labour Party policy.  I trust he will appreciate that Fianna Fáil has a party policy on the matter also but I cannot act on the basis of party policy.  I have a particular role as adviser to the Government and to the shareholder, who is the Minister for Finance.  I am somewhat constrained in what I can say.  On aviation policy, which I outlined to the Deputy earlier, it is not that we just have two major airlines coming in here.  If we could have ten major airlines, that would be Government policy, but at a minimum we should have competition — the point the Deputy made.As I explained in the House the last day, very specific rules have been put in place by takeover panels, competition authorities, the Stock Exchange and everything else as regards shareholders acting in concert during a bid period.  Therefore, when Mr. O'Leary requested a meeting with me, I felt it necessary, as did he, to have a legal adviser present to ensure these rules were obeyed.  From that viewpoint, I can confirm that I have not had conversations with other shareholders, nor would it be right or proper to have had, as this could give rise to competition difficulties — and Stock Exchange difficulties.As regards the slots at Heathrow, the "initial offer" suggested the Government would have to give its approval for changes to those.  In the offer document it is now suggested that the Houses of the Oireachtas is the body that should have the say in that regard.  I do not know, legally, whether that is a possibility and we shall take legal advice on that as we will on the other aspects.

In terms of the hostile bid — the point the Minister referred to on 1 December — a hostile bid means that something would not be in the best interests of the company or of the Government's shareholding, which is what I presume the Minister is talking about.  It seems that implicit in what the Minister is saying is that he will reject this, even though, perhaps, he cannot say that.What Ryanair is guaranteeing is the connectivity from Heathrow to Ireland.  If Aer Lingus is taken over by any other company, that guarantee will not necessarily be there.  Will the Minister please comment?
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	463	At the time of the first attack on Aer Lingus by Ryanair, which the Minister's predecessor should have expected, Commissioner Kroes demolished the bid on economic grounds, in terms of the severe lack of competition and connectivity and pointed out that this was different from other takeover bids in Europe.  Has the Minister had any contact with the Commissioner?Looking at the two airlines over the past year or so, is it not a fact that Ryanair has performed quite badly from its shareholders' viewpoint, with massive losses and a serious failure in the hedging of fuel costs as well as other problems on the closure of bases and so on?  At the same time, the smaller airline has had a relatively good six months and looks as if it will break even in this very difficult period.  Is this not really a smash and grab exercise by Michael O'Leary, in his typical buccaneer fashion, on an enormous asset which is worth three or four times the valuation he has put on it?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	464	I do not know whether I can add much.  However, Aer Lingus has done well in very difficult circumstances this year and the agreement reached with the trade unions and workers will help it to do even better, into the future.I do not agree with knocking Ryanair, however.  Ryanair employs a good many Irish people as well.  It is a very successful Irish company, and we should bear that in mind, whatever our views might be as regards the current offer, or anything else.  There are sufficient people across Europe knocking the airline, who are competitors of Ryanair, and would like to see it going out of business, without us starting to do so in this House.  It employs a good many Irish people and while I would not share Mr. O'Leary's attitude to trade unions, people who work in the airline are, by and large, well paid.  That should be kept in perspective.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	465	Since my appointment as Minister for Transport, my practice has been to keep open lines of communication with the agencies operating under the aegis of my Department, primarily by maintaining regular and appropriate levels of contact with the chairpersons of the boards of the agencies, or their equivalents in the case of certain regulatory bodies.  Communication takes place in several ways including by telephone and by way of both formal and informal meetings and encounters.  Occasionally I meet the full board of an agency in a structured setting.  I have also on occasion met senior management as required from time to time to address matters of particular pertinence for a given agency.These discussions, encounters and occasional formal meetings have addressed, inter alia, issues such as review of overall strategies, business plans, financial outlook, performance by agencies, safety, reform and modernisation of the various sectors, structures or possible rationalisation, updates on investment programmes or on specific projects, or proposals for legislative change.Clearly, my engagement with the agencies focuses mainly on issues of strategic note but I am aware that my discussions are complemented by talks which take place on an ongoing basis between my officials and the management of the agencies operating under the aegis of the Department.While this form of engagement and oversight has worked well in the past, I recognise that there is always scope for improvement.  For this reason, earlier in 2008 the Department carried out a comprehensive review of its corporate governance relationship with the State agencies.  As a result of this review, I wrote to the chairpersons of the State agencies under my remit last month announcing the introduction of a new approach to corporate governance.  This initiative is aimed at: providing a clearer mandate to each of our State agencies and enhancing the Department's monitoring of their performance; ensuring continuing compliance by agencies with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies; and ensuring that more regular and structured engagement takes place at ministerial and senior management level with all agencies, as a means of reviewing performance and ensuring that the Department's objectives are being met.Additional information not given on the floor of the House.Specifically, I have proposed to each agency the particular schedule of regular structured meetings, which should become the norm for that agency from now on, as meetings with me or alternatively with senior officials in the Department may be more appropriate in different cases.  I propose to meet the boards of the larger agencies.  The agenda at such meetings will cover my mandate and expectations, as well as the agency's performance and will address any other pertinent corporate governance issue arising in the context of the particular agency.The responses I have received to date from the State agencies have been very positive and I am confident that this new approach will significantly improve the oversight of the agencies under my remit and ensure that the performance dialogue will become more structured, focused and productive with all the agencies concerned from now on.

How many has he met?  As he knows there was a review of his Department by the Department of the Taoiseach.  Transport is a very critical Department, where €1.27 billion of taxpayers' money is being spent on public transport, €2.1 million on national, regional and local roads, €40 million on road safety, €48 million on coastguard activity and so on.  It is a very important Department.  He mentioned the word, "governance".  The governance of his Department is inadequate.  There is little consensus within the Department as to whether users of the services of these agencies are customers of the Department and what its oversight role is.The criticism is that the Minister is not doing his job, that he is sitting back and not meeting these agencies.  They are spending billions of taxpayers' money and the Department does not know whether it has oversight.  Those semi-State bodies do not know whether they are overseen by the Minister, either.  In fact, they complain of the lack of direction and leadership from the Minister.

That has always been my style.  It was for that reason we initiated the review of the relationship between the State bodies and the Department earlier this year.  I did the same in the last Department I was in, the Department of Communications, Marine and Natural Resources.  The Deputy is talking about an internal organisational review report of the Department, but the criticisms levelled in it are not levelled at the Minister, as he will see if he cares to read the report carefully.

How many of the 37 has he met?  The criticism I made is of the Department and the Minister is the leader of the Department in terms of policy.  The report clearly states the Department needs to take a more proactive leadership role in setting and clarifying strategies.  The issue is that taxpayers' money is being wasted in some of these bodies, but the Minister has no oversight of them.

He asked about the various bodies I had met.  I have met with all the major ones since joining the Department.  I met with Aer Lingus, Bus Átha Cliath, Bus Éireann, the Cork Airport Authority, CIE, the Commission for Aviation Regulation, the Commission for Taxi Regulation, the Dublin Airport Authority, the Drogheda Port Company, the Dublin Transportation Office, Dublin Port Company, Galway Harbour Company, Iarnród Éireann, the Irish Aviation Authority, the National Roads Authority, the Port of Cork Company, the Railway Safety Commission, the Road Safety Authority, the Railway Procurement Agency, representatives of the three airports and the Shannon Foynes Port Company, and the Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, has responsibility for the ports.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	474	The 2009 Exchequer subvention to CIE will be €313.279  million, an increase of 1.5% on the 2008 figure.  During the course of the Estimates discussion, my Department had discussions with the Department of Finance and with CIE on the overall financial position of the CIE operating companies, Dublin Bus, Bus Éireann and Iarnród Éireann.  The chairman and chief executive of each of the companies also briefed me on the financial outlook on 1 December.CIE is projecting an operating deficit of €39.5 million for 2008 after Exchequer subvention, compared to an operating deficit of €1.47 million in 2007.  This significant deterioration in the financial position of CIE is due in the main to losses in revenue due to a drop in demand for services and increases in costs, particularly fuel costs in the earlier part of this year.  The outlook for 2009 is for a further deterioration in the group's financial situation in the absence of corrective measures.  In order to preserve the financial stability of the group, each of the companies must, in addition to increasing fares, pursue some rationalisation of services, ranging from frequency reductions, to service withdrawals.  The CIE subsidiaries are considering service reductions that maintain the integrity and attractiveness of their networks and achieve significant cost reductions over time.Following my discussions with CIE and its subsidiary companies and taking account of the emerging findings of a cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann by Deloitte, to be completed shortly, I have agreed the following package of measures to protect the financial position of the CIE group and to maintain public transport services to the maximum extent possible: an increase of €5 million in 2009 over 2008 in the compensation paid to CIE in respect of its public service obligation, provided for in the Estimates; a fares increase of 10% for January 2009; CIE to identify a package of service rationalisation and reductions, focused on heavy loss-making services, sufficient when taken together with the other measures set out to ensure the financial stability of the CIE group; and measures to improve bus priority and bus journey times.It is a matter for the CIE group of companies to secure operational efficiencies and to reduce costs so as to maintain services at the highest level possible.  I have requested that, in deciding on service reductions, the group should aim to maintain rail services, peak-time bus services, and bus services to developing areas.  Service reductions should be a last resort in the group's efforts to maintain financial stability.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	475	I thank the Minister for his comprehensive reply.  Does what the Minister now proposes to do with regard to bus transport and public transport generally not completely pull the rug from under his sustainable transport policy?  The Minister will launch the sustainable policy in a few weeks' time, but with these cutbacks he is completely wrecking the sustainable policy in terms of bus transport.  Is it the case that the subvention to the CIE group of companies is among the lowest of the 27 European Union member states?  It is certainly the lowest of the old EU 15.  Is it the case that the cutbacks now proposed will involve the loss of 40 Dublin Bus routes, of 150 Bus Éireann routes, the withdrawal of 170 Bus Éireann buses and of 100 Dublin Bus buses and the loss of 400 jobs?  Is the Minister not effectively eviscerating the whole bus-public transport strategy?A few months ago the Minister agreed with me that buses must perform the core role until we get the major investment required into heavier public transport over the next five or six years.  Is he not wrecking that policy now by these short-sighted financial constraints he and the Department of Finance are imposing?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	476	The country is in the financial situation it is in and no amount of burying one's head in the sand with regard to reality will help anybody.  CIE is suffering as a result of the economic recession, just as is everybody else.  Fewer people are using buses and trains and coming into towns to shop and fewer people are working.  In that kind of environment, it is inevitable that services will end up in a loss-making situation.The company has a responsibility to ensure that it trades responsibly.  We provided an increase in the subvention and a fares increase.  It is up to the company to try and ensure it works within those provisions to maintain services and try and grow them if possible.  Taxpayers are providing €313 million to public transport, but there is no more money available from them.  It is and will be taxpayers from whom these moneys must come.  CIE, as it has done in the past and must do in the future, must live within its means and within its budget.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	477	When I spoke to CIE about nine months ago the key issue was escalating fuel costs, with oil at $150 a barrel.  That cost has been cut by two thirds, down to $50 or so and I understand CIE and the various bus companies are well hedged for next year.  Therefore, how can fuel be used as an excuse to cut back on transport?  The Minister failed to get the European Union to do anything about the fuel rebate, which has hurt all public and private transport operators since 1 November.Is it not the experience of our European sister countries that the lower fares are, the greater the number of people who will travel?  Study after study has shown this to be true.  Instead of increasing Luas, Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann fares by between 5% and 10%, the Minister should be cutting them by 20% if he really wants people to use public transport.  The Minister is taking a short-sighted and undynamic approach to policy, is he not?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	478	I am somewhat confused by the Deputy.  I am not sure what he wants me to do on this matter.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	479	I want him to get more people on buses and trains.  He is the regulator.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	480	He is telling me I should cut fares.  I would be delighted not to approve a request for higher fares.  The original request was for a 20% fare increase.  I would be delighted to be able to say to CIE that I was going to get it to cut its fares.  If the Deputy thinks that is a wise policy to pursue, that is okay.  I will do that.  The Deputy cannot complain, on the one hand, that CIE will not be able to operate as it wishes and, on the other, that somebody must pay for this.  Taxpayers must pay the €313 million.  CIE must promote itself as much as it can, as companies are obliged to do.  It is clear there must be rationalisation within Dublin Bus.  Many services can be saved if that rationalisation takes place.I do not use fuel as an excuse.  CIE has a very good record of hedging.  The most it was caught for in fuel costs was approximately $100 per barrel.  It did well and saved.  I am responding on the basis of what I have been told.  I am not imposing anything.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	481	Under the Roads Act 1993, the maintenance of roads, including winter maintenance, is a statutory function of each individual road authority.  This work is funded out of each authority's own resources, supplemented in the case of regional and local roads by discretionary and block grants allocated annually by my Department.  In the case of national roads, funding for maintenance, which includes the gritting of roads and other safety-related work in winter, is provided by my Department to the National Roads Authority which allocates it among the local authorities.Local authorities are advised that they should set aside contingency sums from these resources to finance works necessitated by severe weather conditions.  In 2008, the total discretionary maintenance grant allocated to county councils by my Department was €29.56 million and the total block grant allocated to urban authorities was €16.133 million.  The maintenance grant by my Department to the NRA for allocation to local authorities in 2008 was €58.21 million.  This includes provision for winter maintenance, forecasting and monitoring of weather conditions.Local authorities are regularly reminded by my Department of their responsibilities in relation to winter maintenance of roads.  During 2008, the matter was brought to the attention of local authorities on 5 February and again on 10 December.
#ShaneMcEntee	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-party	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-dob	unknown-#ShaneMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	482	I listened to the Minister on the radio last week.  He said, rightly, that we have not had road conditions such as we have had in the past few weeks for a number of years.  Many new drivers are not experienced in these conditions.  I doubt there is a Deputy in this House who has not had many complaints in respect of our smaller roads, particularly those roads that were not maintained over the past number of years.  We know our major roads are safer.Is the Minister happy that the allocation he gave in 2008 is being used?  There is a difference.  If I contact local authorities in different areas some will claim, behind the scenes, that they are not funded properly.  The Minister states that his Department funds them properly.  Can the Minister clarify that all the county councils got the same money this year as they received last year?We are coming near to the end of the year, and, please God, the Department can be proud of one thing, namely, that deaths are down.  The Minister knows he has the backing of everybody in the House for every measure he takes in that regard.  However, I am deeply concerned about the condition of our roads at present.  I am concerned that funding is not being used specifically to grit roads if they continue to be in the same condition.There is a serious problem throughout the country with regard roads that are newly tarmacadamed.  They then have six-inch deep curves on their edges.  I am aware of one road where there were four accidents last week due to non-maintenance of road edges.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	483	To my recollection, and I may be corrected, the amount of money provided under this heading at the beginning of 2008 was an increase on the figure given in 2007.  There was no reduction in funding.  The grants we give for roads are meant to supplement local authorities' own resources.  If the authorities feel they have not got an adequate amount in the grant they receive from us, they should put money from their own resources towards it.  That is the situation as it is supposed to be.I agree with the Deputy there appears not to be the same amount of gritting on minor roads.  That is my experience and I hear the same from colleagues on all sides of the House.  Perhaps the reason is that it is a long time since we had such a prolonged cold spell.  Judging from the level of complaints we have heard, there has not been the same level of gritting as previously.  The responsibility lies with local authorities and it is one they should take very seriously.  I know the Deputy made that point publicly and I agree with it.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	484	Ireland's aviation policy, as set out in my Department's current statement of strategy, is to promote regular, safe, cost-effective and competitive air services linking the country with key business and tourism markets.To this end, within the European Union, Ireland has consistently supported market liberalisation measures, which have, to date, served as the platform for the rapid expansion of aviation generally.  We have also sought to influence the emerging EU and wider international framework for aviation to ensure that it continues to promote competition and innovation in the marketplace.The introduction of the EU-US open skies agreement and the conclusion of a more liberal agreement on a bilateral basis with Canada illustrates our commitment to supporting liberalisation measures.Our approach to the encouragement of air services is complemented by our policy on the development of airport infrastructure within the country.  The main objective is to ensure that the three State airports have sufficient capacity to respond to the growth opportunities of a competitive airline sector and to provide vital international access.  The opening of terminal 2 at Dublin Airport in early 2010 will allow Dublin Airport to comfortably handle up to 35 million passengers per year and will create a vibrant modern airport that will be an efficient gateway to the Ireland of the 21st century.In addition, the six regional airports have a role to play in facilitating access to the regions.  My Department provides financial support for airport development and operations as well as for PSO services connecting Kerry, Galway, Knock, Sligo, Donegal and Derry to Dublin.

The figure is down 17%.  Is it not the case that the Minister's airport departure tax of €2 per passenger travelling to the United Kingdom will have an adverse impact on this decreasing number?  Does the Minister not think he should do away with that tax?  It is affecting profitability on routes for the main airlines and it affects people's pockets, particularly when their income is reducing.

I expect that passenger numbers will reduce as they are currently reducing.  That has more to do with the international economic situation and the recession we now face.  I do not accept for a minute that the airport tax will be the deciding factor as to whether people travel in and out of this country.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	492	In the Minister's replies to questions put to him by the transport spokespersons, he mentioned aviation policy and Government policy in respect of maximum connectivity.  Over the past few days we have had good news and bad news.  In my own mid-west region we have seen 200 jobs announced for an American company in Ennis.  The company is there because there is a daily direct transatlantic service which is very important.  On the other hand, we have seen job losses because Heathrow was a very important hub of connectivity for the region.  I know the Minister has had discussions with the airlines, particularly with Aer Lingus and Ryanair in recent days.  Michael O'Leary mentioned that he would restore the Shannon-Heathrow slots in the event of his takeover bid proving successful.The last time I questioned the Minister, I asked about the border customs protection facility and he told me he would make an announcement shortly, which he did two days later.  Is the restoration of the Shannon-Heathrow service by Aer Lingus imminent and has the Minister had discussions with Aer Lingus in this regard?  The news on the ground is that there may be an announcement before the end of the week.  If there is, I hope the Minister will return to Shannon, make that announcement and act as Santa Claus for Christmas.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	493	I do not think I would make a good Santa Claus.  With regard to the Shannon-Heathrow route and the different meetings I have had with different representatives of Aer Lingus in the past 12 months, I have never failed to highlight that issue.  I have also discussed it on a number of occasions with our own directors on the board of Aer Lingus to try to ensure that the link, which is important, is restored.  Again, we are back to the same situation as before.  At the end of the day, it is a commercial decision that Aer Lingus will have to make.
#PatBreen	unknown-#PatBreen-party	unknown-#PatBreen-dob	unknown-#PatBreen-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	494	Does the Minister expect Aer Lingus to make a decision shortly?

I can only hope.

One of the core issues of that policy is the State Airports Act 2004.  Will that now be repealed having regard to the separation of Dublin, Cork and Shannon airports?  There seems to be some row-back on this and a feeling that on economic grounds it should not proceed.  What is the Minister's view?On a related point regarding the investment we have made in the three national airports, is it not the case that the Ryanair company has been bitterly opposed to Terminal 2 at Dublin, the new facility at Cork and the additional facilities at Shannon?  Do these issues concerning the past history of Ryanair concern the Minister given that the general plan in Dublin is for Aer Lingus to use Terminal 2?
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	498	That is a very broad question with many extra wings to it.  I will allow Deputy O'Donnell to raise a brief supplementary question.

Will he seek a meeting with his directors on the board of Aer Lingus to ensure there is certainty on this and that we get a date as to when this vital connectivity for Shannon and the mid-west region, including Limerick, is restored?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	500	There are no plans to repeal the State Airports Act.  The state of play is that the business plans have been submitted, the DAA commentary on the business plans has been submitted and the two airports, Shannon and Cork, have also submitted letters to me stating their views of the proposal to have separation at this point in time.  Both airports remain committed to the concept of separation.  The three chairpersons and the chief executive of the Dublin Airport Authority are currently in discussions and I expect them to make contact with me over the next few days to try to finalise this particular matter.With regard to the investment in airports, it is a fair portrayal of the situation to say that on most occasions every proposed investment in the airports, particularly Dublin Airport, has been opposed by Ryanair, which believes that the Dublin Airport Authority is gold-plating everything in regard to Terminal 2, Pier D and so on.  I had the discussion with representatives of Ryanair not that long ago that Government would see the airports, particularly Dublin Airport because of its size——

They are the gateway to Ireland and are the first impression people get of Ireland.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	504	The reference in the organisation review programme report is to a finding in our business customer survey for 2005-06, which surveyed 328 business customers and found that of 47 who had made a complaint, over half had not had their complaint resolved at the time of the survey.  As the survey was carried out on an anonymous basis it is not possible at this stage to identify either the business customers concerned or the nature of their complaints.I can assure the Deputy that my Department makes every effort to ensure that all complaints are dealt with and I would like to take this opportunity to highlight some areas where we have made improvements for our business customers.  In May 2008, the Department introduced a new on-line facility that enables approved motor dealers notify vehicle ownership changes to the national vehicle and driver file, NVDF, over the Internet.  The new on-line service at www.motortrans.ie presents an alternative to paper-based arrangements.  In addition, the processing time for road transport operator licences has decreased from approximately 20 working days in 2006 to under five, and changes or additions to licences from ten working days in 2006 to two.  Furthermore, following decentralisation to Loughrea in May 2007, the public office opening hours were extended by 1.5 hours per day.

While I accept the survey may have been anonymous, is there a complaints system or process within the Department so it can track its business customers' complaints?  If there was, I am sure they would not have waited two years for these issues to be resolved.  Does the Department record all communications with regard to complaints?
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	506	The systems that operate in the Department are similar to the ones that operate in the Minister's office in that all communications are recorded when they come in and where they go in the system is also recorded.  We endeavour to ensure that replies are given.  It is possible that when people do not get the answer they want, they regard the issue as not being resolved.  The 23 people of 328 who say it was not resolved are not necessarily saying they did not get a reply; they may not have got the reply they wanted.

We were also to move some of our operations in maritime safety to Drogheda but because of the stage it was at, it will not go ahead until 2011 under the review.  We complied with all of the deadlines and we are probably one of the better Departments in regard to decentralisation.

There is only one case in which an assistant secretary and all his staff are located in one building.  Therefore, there is a significant lack of communication and efficiency.  I am sure the Minister, Deputy Dempsey, will explain in answer to a later question how he intends to reduce the number of premises from six to three.

The transport portfolio has been shifted from place to place and from Department to Department and we have ended up with six buildings.  It is totally unsatisfactory.  We hope that during the course of next year we will resolve the matter and reduce the number to three.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	513	Driving under the influence of intoxicants, which includes prescription, non-prescription drugs and alcohol, is one of the primary causes of road fatalities and a serious road safety issue.The Road Traffic Acts provide for the testing of drivers under the influence of drugs.  If a garda is of the opinion that a driver is under the influence of a drug or drugs to such an extent as to be incapable of having proper control of a vehicle, he or she may require that person to attend a Garda station, and further require that person to submit to a blood test or provide a urine sample.The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is keeping abreast of developments in the area of preliminary roadside testing for drugs, but there is as yet no reliable system available.  In the meantime, the road traffic and transport Bill, currently being drafted, includes provisions for field impairment testing, that is, non-technological methods by which the Garda could look for the presence of drugs.  The Bill is expected to be published early next year.The Minister for Health and Children, in collaboration with the Road Safety Authority, recently launched a new road safety leaflet entitled Medicines and the Driver.  The new leaflet highlights the effects that prescription and non-prescription medicines can have on a person's ability to drive safely.  The leaflet also gives advice on how to avoid driving under the influence of medicines.  I understand the Road Safety Authority hopes to collaborate in an initiative with the pharmacy sector shortly, whereby such information will feature on the bags used by pharmacy outlets.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	514	I thank the Minister of State for his reply.  I have been very concerned, as have my constituents and people throughout the country, with the very significant increase in the number of people taking drugs in every town, village and county in the country.  I spoke with some doctors this morning and we discussed the admission into psychiatric hospitals of people who have taken drugs.  If this is happening, there must be more people driving under the influence of drugs.  I welcome the compulsory testing measures for drink driving.  The time has come in Ireland and every other country to put a test in place.  There must be compulsory testing on a regular basis of people driving under the influence of drugs.  There is no doubt there are hundreds of people killed in the country every year by people who have taken drugs and who subsequently walk away.  We do not have the relevant figures.  How close are we to having some compulsory drug testing in the country both for drivers and in the workplace?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	515	I used to have responsibility for the drugs strategy and I am aware of the issues referred to by the Deputy.  At present, there is no recognised system by which the Garda can test people on the road.  In some countries throughout the world trials are ongoing and we will wait and see how they develop.  Such trials are not at the stage where they could be in place on a legal basis, because various people in the courts and elsewhere would drive a coach and four through arguments based on such trials.  Part of the function of the Medical Bureau of Road Safety is to keep abreast of developments in that regard.  As soon as there is a reliable roadside test for drugs, we will change the legislation to allow its implementation.  I agree with Deputy Ring.  There is mandatory testing for alcohol but not for drugs, which is illogical.  However, we cannot proceed until such time as the system is in place.  The new legislation will help the Garda to request that people walk in a straight line and so on.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	516	A Medical Bureau of Road Safety study found that one in three drivers who test negative for alcohol test positive for drugs.  Hibernian Insurance carried out a survey the results of which indicated one fifth of drivers under 35 years of age were under the influence.  The Minister of State indicated there are no operational drug tests anywhere in the world.  However, they are in place in several Australian states, such as Queensland, where a major roadside drug testing policy is under way.  Tasmania is introducing its policy involving a particle detection test.  Can we not emulate such places and have this fundamental issue dealt with once and for all?
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	517	I accept trials are ongoing in different parts of the world.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	521	The Medical Bureau of Road Safety is especially keen to keep abreast of such developments.  As soon as such trials can stand up to such rigour, I hope they will be introduce as quickly as possible.  Under the current system, if tests prove negative for alcohol, they are automatically tested for drugs.  That is already in place.  We wish to reach a stage where there is the equivalent of mandatory testing for drugs.

One year ago, the Minister promised he would introduce legislation on mandatory testing at the scenes of accidents.  If this were introduced and included a provision whereby a blood sample is tested for other substances, it would give an accurate figure of those who are in accidents.  Those are the people who would have taken more than most other people.
#MichaelRing	unknown-#MichaelRing-party	unknown-#MichaelRing-dob	unknown-#MichaelRing-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	524	I intended to ask the question raised by Deputy O'Dowd.  Is data available on people who were tested following accidents who did not fail an alcohol test but who were found to have taken drugs?  Such data would show the amount of people tested. I agree with the remarks of Deputy O'Dowd.  We must do something as this is a very serious problem.  The country is rife with drugs and the problem is increasing in every section of society.  Some people are driving like lunatics killing others on the roads and we must do something about it.

#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	529	We will include measures related to that in the new Bill.  Deputy Ring referred to people driving like lunatics.  I accept there are some people using drugs and that we must deal with them.  However, the number of road fatalities this year is reduced considerably from the numbers of previous years.  While there are people transgressing the law who we wish to catch, we must accept that generally there is a good deal of buy in from many motorists who obey the law.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	530	Dublin Bus passenger numbers have increased from 134.2 million in 2000 to 147 million in 2007.  This increase was achieved despite the introduction of the Luas and improved suburban rail services in the greater Dublin area.  Dublin Bus is the largest operator of bus services in that area.  In the course of the past year, passenger numbers on its services have declined by approximately 4%.  Passenger numbers on suburban rail and the Luas are also experiencing a drop in demand.  Various reasons are suggested to explain this situation.  These include the general economic downturn, reduced shopping in the city centre area and fewer migrant workers living in the city centre area.  This drop in demand is despite the marketing efforts of the company, which has implemented a campaign through the media and directly to households advocating the benefits of travelling by bus and the value for money which is available.The cost and efficiency review of Dublin Bus and Bus Éireann, carried out by Deloitte, is expected shortly and I understand that it will advise that, while many aspects of the operations of Dublin Bus are efficient, there is further potential for efficiency gain to attract more people on to the bus.  On the basis of the ultimate findings and recommendations of the review, Dublin Bus will be mandated to target overall operational efficiencies including changes to its network to simplify routes and eliminate duplication, to improve timetables and to improve co-ordination of services on common route corridors and to introduce other customer orientated initiatives.
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	531	One point is the gridlock in Dublin city causes a problem for buses as well as for everyone else and consequently, bus travel speeds are reducing all the time.  In many cases, it would be quicker to walk, if possible, and it certainly would be much more efficient were one to cycle.  I accept there are reasons for the decline in usage and fewer migrants using public transport appears to be an issue.  Nevertheless, the modal shift that Government policy has been promising has not happened.  The key point is the Minister's policies have failed and, as I have pointed out previously, the Circle Line buses have been taken off the route.  More than 30 buses are sitting idle and are parked forever because Dublin Bus has put them out of business.  This simply is not good enough.  New thinking is needed in the Department as the Minister's policies have failed in this regard.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	532	I am unsure whether the Deputy asked a question, as that sounded more like a statement.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	534	I imagine the Deputy is asking whether the Minister agrees with him.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	535	No, I do not.  The Deputy is aware the Department has introduced the Dublin Transportation Authority Act, which now is in place and will be rolled out.  The question of competition in the market is dealt with in that Act and will be dealt with in the next national public transport plan.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	536	Deputy O'Dowd may have inadvertently misled the House when he referred to a private company.  I understand that a large part of the fleet in question is engaged in coach work and other tasks in hand and that the services it no longer fulfils were in addition to its core business.Obviously, the 4% decline is disappointing.  Does the Minister, who mentioned the network, envisage that the frequency and reliability of services could be increased?  When operating a major public transport system, a major problem arises in respect of what to do with the fleet during off-peak hours.  People have asked questions on this subject, which affects both private and public fleets.  How does one cope during off-peak hours?  Has the Department made proposals in this regard?  I refer to ways to increase the usage of the fleets, particularly in urban areas.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	537	Undoubtedly, the frequency and more particularly the reliability of a service are extremely important.  I refer to frequency in the sense that one can predict when a bus will come.  Once this is available to customers, people are encouraged to use the service.  For example, on some of the quality bus corridors, QBCs, the service is reliable, there is the same headroom between each bus and so on.  When such certainty exists, people use the service and in some cases this can result in an increase in usage of up to 40%.  Consequently, there is a need for major change in the manner in which Dublin Bus operates.  There is no question about that.  Matters such as the frequency of the service, the operation of the networks, co-ordination of the services along the core corridors, direct routing and additional cross-city services all will be extremely important, as will real-time information in order that people will know when and where a particular bus will come.  All such measures will be important in efforts to increase usage.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	538	I wish to facilitate brief supplementary questions from Deputy Broughan, followed by Deputy O'Dowd.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	539	The Minister rightly referred to the Dublin Transportation Authority, which is of great importance to public transport.  When will it become operational?  Members spent a considerable amount of time discussing the legislation in committee rooms and so on.  Are the provisions pertaining to planning, that is, all new development will have the integrated public transport function at its centre, effectively operational since the Act became law?  The Minister referred to how the fleet could be better utilised and it also must be expanded.  Would the Minister consider a differential fare structure, with much lower fares applying during the off-peak period to encourage people to use buses?
#FergusODowdFG	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-party	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-dob	unknown-#FergusODowdFG-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	540	The Minister stated that Dublin Bus must change, which is true.  Does the Minister agree there must be a much more proactive policy from Dublin Bus to use the private sector at peak times to use spare capacity?  It does not make sense to have the buses to which I referred parked on a lot somewhere in County Kildare while at the same time, Dublin Bus buses, in their original livery colour and with 1997 registrations, are providing public transport on the streets of some British cities.  I have photographs of this.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	541	The question of what to do during off-peak hours certainly is an issue.  The Deputy's suggestion certainly could be considered by Dublin Bus.  Bus Éireann uses quite a number of private subcontractors throughout the company.  The off-peak issue also raises the question of work practices in Dublin Bus that must be addressed in respect of how one uses one's resources.  As for Deputy Broughan's point, rather than more buses, capacity has increased by well over 30% and passenger numbers are falling.  Consequently, it is not a question of not having the buses.  Perhaps it is a question of not deploying——
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	542	For five or six years, between 2000 and 2005, not a single bus was bought.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	545	The Minister of State, Deputy Noel Ahern, remembers this.  For a major portion of the lifetime of the Government, it refused to buy a bus.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	546	Allow the Minister to respond.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	547	Capacity has increased by 30% while passenger numbers are falling.The simple question that must be asked is whether the buses available are being deployed to the best effect.  The answer is "No" and this must be addressed to increase the numbers.  Deputy O'Dowd's earlier point on congestion certainly is one of the causes of the problem of the service's unreliability.  I refer to the scenario in which no buses come for a long time and then two or three come at once.  Congestion is a factor that is outside the control of CIE, Bus Éireann or Bus Átha Cliath.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	548	I am conscious that the matter raised by Question No. 68 also has been dealt with as Priority Question No. 61.  However, in accordance with the rules of the House, it also has been tabled as a number of ordinary questions.  For clarity, the Minister will reply to Questions Nos. 68, 73 and 117 together.  Members could go through the Minister's reply again.

Many of the transport services the taxpayer pays for through the Minister are dealt with by State and semi-State agencies.  The criticism is there is inadequate oversight of them.  To be specific the commentary is there is no consensus among agencies of the Department as to whether the latter should have a role in monitoring these services.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	551	Does the Deputy have a question?

I refer to the lack of oversight and the consequential lack of accountability and transparency regarding the billions of euro that are being spent on Transport.  There is no oversight of them.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	553	The report stated that the Department of Transport makes every effort to ensure compliance with the code of governance by the agencies.  The Department's responsibility is to ensure they comply with those codes.  The report suggests the Department must adopt a strategic approach to the governance of the agencies, particularly in the context of the large number and variety of agencies under its aegis.  It suggests structured meetings with the boards and that the Department should give them a clearer mandate as to what it expects from the agencies.  It also suggests the Department should focus more on performance management and monitoring of the outcomes of those agencies and that it should try to improve the data flows from the agencies.  The Department has addressed all four points in the initiative I instigated earlier this year to which I referred previously.  I intend to implement the recommendations in this regard.

It states it is important that it considers this issue at a strategic level and develops a coherent viewpoint that is understood by all of its staff and all of its agencies.  Clearly, there is a continuing serious problem in this regard.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	558	It would be remiss of us during this debate not to state that many of the agencies we are talking about are doing a superb job.  In particular, I would cite the Road Safety Authority.  It is outstanding, as are some of the outcomes it is achieving with great difficulty.  I commend the Minister of State with responsibility for the agency, Deputy Noel Ahern, who is here with us today.One of the big problems with all of those agencies is that they are not answerable directly to this House.  This is an issue which goes to the Leas-Cheann Comhairle and to the Ceann Comhairle, and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges.  Unlike the House of Commons, we cannot raise issues, for example, such as the port tunnel in the case of the NRA and some of the safety issues in the case of the RSA.  The Ceann Comhairle turned down eight or ten questions in this current batch from me and Labour Party colleagues such as the Leas-Cheann Comhairle on the basis that the Minister cannot talk about the agencies.  In the House of Commons, the former Secretary of State for Transport, Rt Hon. Ruth Kelly, spoke about any issue to do with transport.  The present Secretary of State, Rt Hon. Geoff Hoone, who I watched a few days ago, speaks on any issue to do with transport on policy grounds irrespective of whether it relates to an agency.The 30th Dáil was supposed to be a reforming Dáil.  Deputy O'Dowd feels the same as I do.  We were supposed to have a reformed Dáil whereby answers on all transport issues in broad policy could be obtained through the Minister.  Has this Minister any objection in principle to answering the policy questions on the NRA or any of his Department's other agencies?  If those agencies are not answerable to this House, then we have a major problem.  That, I think, is the thrust of the Fine Gael question.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	576	I move:Vote 31 — Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Second Supplementary Estimate).That a supplementary sum not exceeding €50,000,000 be granted to defray the charge which will come in course of payment during the year ending on the 31st day of December 2008, for the salaries and expenses of the Office of the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, including certain services administered by that Office, and of the Irish Land Commission and for the payment of certain grants, subsidies and sundry grants-in-aid and for the payment of certain grants under cash-limited schemes.The Irish pig industry has faced many challenges in recent years but none more so than last week when its very survival was threatened.  On Saturday, 6 December last, test results confirmed the presence of dioxins in Irish pork fat samples and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, initiated an immediate recall of Irish pork and bacon products produced since 1 September 2008.Not alone was the recall decision the right decision; it was the only responsible decision that could have been taken.  It has been widely commended, particularly overseas and by a number of the country's most important international customers.  The decision was taken to reassure consumers that Irish pork and bacon products available on the market following the recall would be perfectly safe to consume.  I am entirely satisfied that it has provided the necessary reassurance to consumers, as evidenced by the response of consumers to the reappearance of Irish pork products on the shop shelves last week.That decision received the full backing of the European Food Safety Authority, EFSA, having been asked by the European Commission for urgent scientific and technical assistance and to provide scientific assistance on the risks for human health.  The EFSA findings give considerable support for the decisions we took both in recalling products and in the actions taken to resume production.The Financial Times, in an editorial on Tuesday of last week, stated of the Irish authorities’ actions that “the main lesson so far is a positive one: as soon as you can discover unacceptable contamination in food, act without delay to withdraw everything that might be affected — and tell the public exactly what you are doing”.The importance of the Irish pig production and processing industry is clear when one considers that it is worth €1.1 billion per annum and employs approximately 6,500 people, with approximately 500 farm families involved in pig production.  Since the positive tests results were confirmed and the product recall initiated, the FSAI and the Department have worked through the various phases — protection of public health, restoration of consumer confidence, securing the future of the industry, and maintenance of markets and national reputation.The recall was in respect of Irish pork products from pigs slaughtered since 1 September last.  That date was chosen on the basis of the evidence available to the Food Safety Authority of Ireland on a precautionary basis.Contrary to suggestions, both in the media and elsewhere, the Dutch authorities only contacted my Department and the FSAI after my Department issued a press release on Thursday, 4 December last, confirming an investigation into the source of a contaminant in animal feed and the restriction of a number of farms.Having recalled the product and taken the necessary steps to both protect public health and restore consumer confidence, the Government's focus moved quickly to get processing resumed and get product back on the shelves.The Government was particularly anxious that processing would recommence as soon as possible after the recall decision was made.  We were conscious of the threat to the jobs and livelihoods of thousands of factory workers as well as hundreds of producers throughout the country.  It was also important that our domestic and international customers saw Ireland as being back in business in pork production in the shortest possible time span and with the least possible disruption to trade, and I was acutely aware that many producers were ready to move animals for slaughter.On Monday of last week, the Taoiseach and I, together with my officials, commenced detailed consultations with representatives of the Association of Pigmeat Processors with the recommencement of processing being the principal objective of the discussions.  We all agreed at the outset that it was in everybody's interest that slaughtering recommenced quickly and that we get back into the market, restore consumer confidence and protect what is a vital element in the wider Irish agrifood sector.These discussions, while lengthy and complex, were extremely constructive and led early on Thursday morning last to an agreement on the terms of a funding facility that provided sufficient reassurance to processors to enable them to commence processing later that day.The agreement provided that processors would commence slaughtering immediately following the Department's agreement to emergency funding for a product recall scheme in respect of eligible pigmeat products.  The scheme will apply to all primary and secondary processed pigmeat produced from animals slaughtered in Ireland from 1 September to 6 December 2008.  Detailed terms and conditions of the scheme are being prepared and I expect to be in a position to make interim payments to those directly affected who can demonstrate verifiably the extent of their need during this early period in the process.  The total facility I am making available for this scheme amounts to €180 million and my request to the House is for an advance of €50 million for this purpose, which represents the amount that I can reasonably expect to discharge before the year's end.Having secured agreement with the processors to recommence processing, I met representatives of the producers last Thursday morning and my officials have been engaged with them since Friday on agreeing an appropriate solution which would allow restrictions to be lifted so that normal production can resume as quickly as possible.  These discussions are ongoing because, while some progress has been made, a number of issues are still outstanding.  However, I remain optimistic that a satisfactory outcome can be achieved quickly.  My aim is to get these suppliers up and running again in terms of supplying pigs for slaughter and processing.I am acutely conscious of the particular difficulties that have arisen for pig producers, many of whom have thousands of pigs ready for slaughter.  My Department is also exploring the potential for finding suitable slaughtering facilities so that the animals may be directly removed from the food chain in a manner that is separate and distinct from the normal processing of animals.Over the past ten days, Ireland's EU partners and the Commission have been unstinting in their support for our efforts and actions.  Last week's meeting of the European Council unanimously expressed its support for Ireland's efforts to deal with the situation relating to pigmeat and our prompt precautionary actions.  The Council asked the Commission to support farmers and slaughter houses in Ireland by way of co-financed measures to remove animals and products from the market.  We are in the process of following up on these initiatives and an application for funding is being finalised.  Last Thursday the Commission presented a proposal to member states on a private storage scheme for pigmeat exclusive to Ireland.  This proposal received the unanimous support of member states and will allow the storage of some 30,000 tonnes of pigmeat products, with a potential value of €15 million, for a period of six months.  This important support measure will give the industry an appropriate breathing space in view of the difficulties that may arise in the coming months.  These measures demonstrate the solidarity and support that the European Union offers when one of its members, which on this occasion was Ireland, finds itself in difficulty.In the course of my statement to the House last week, I outlined the inspection regime operated by my Department.  The national residue monitoring programme together with the national feed inspection programme comprise the national food and feed control plan for Ireland.  The national residue programme implements a risk-based sampling regime in which upwards of 30,000 samples are taken from across the food chain and tested for over 200 possible contaminants.  The feed inspection programme involves approximately 2,400 inspections per annum throughout the feed chain.  The annual inspection programme covers a range of areas, including feed importers, feed manufacturing mills, mineral mixture plants, recycling plants that manufacture feed using unused food of non-animal origin, feed retailers, wholesalers, hauliers and farms.  The level of inspections carried out complies with and in many cases exceeds the requirements of EU legislation.The premises from which the contaminated feed originated is registered with my Department as a feed business operator under the feed hygiene regulations which came into effect on 1 January 2006.  The premises were inspected in September 2006 and November 2007 but on neither occasion was any problem detected.  It was also scheduled for an unannounced inspection in December 2008.  The EU regulation laying down the requirements for feed hygiene clearly states that the primary responsibility for feed safety rests with the feed business operator.  That responsibility includes an obligation on the operator to identify as required under the legislation any hazard and critical control points and to ensure that all appropriate actions are taken to eliminate potential risks to the feed chain.In regard to the specific investigation into the source of the contamination, my Department is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Garda.  I also understand that Carlow County Council has visited the premises in the context of its responsibilities under the Waste Management Act 1996.  The investigations focus on the type of fuel used in a burner which dried surplus food material for animal feed and the appropriateness of this type of oil.  While the use of oil in the generation of feed drying facilities has not heretofore caused problems for the feed industry, this aspect is now being pursued with the industry and the relevant regulatory State agencies.  In view of the apparent link to the type of fuel used in the drying process, I am asking the European Commission to consider whether the type of oil to be used by feed business operators can be more strictly regulated under EU Regulation 183.2005, which lays down the requirements for feed hygiene.  I will also take the opportunity of tomorrow's meeting of the EU Agriculture and Fisheries Council to brief my colleagues on the events that led to the recall and the decisive response by the Irish authorities.  I will also brief the Commissioners for Agriculture and Rural Development and Health.When we have completed our investigations, we will review all activities associated with this incident.  That review will inevitably include my Department's annual feed control programme.  As the Taoiseach noted last week, lessons are sure to be learned from this review.  My Department has always been prepared to consider and constantly review the adequacy of control measures in the area of animal health, whether in the context of foot and mouth disease, BSE, avian flu or blue tongue.  The same is true on this occasion.  It is imperative that we continually assess our control measures.  We are proud of our country's reputation for food production and animal health and we work hard to maintain it.  The House can be assured of my determination to ensure that the requisite measures will be introduced to maintain that reputation.  While we are justifiably proud of Ireland's reputation as the food island, we have a responsibility to protect that reputation.  I am conscious that events such as this have the potential to tarnish our reputation and damage important markets.  Bord Bia and our embassies abroad are assessing the impact of recent events on those markets.  Last Thursday I travelled to Paris, where I had the opportunity to reassure a number of Ireland's most valuable customers of the safety and quality of Irish meat.  I am ready to assist Bord Bia in any way I can to bolster our important international markets.The actions we took after the discovery of dioxins in pork and beef samples were well judged and measured.  We acted swiftly to protect public health, provide consumer confidence and safeguard a vital industry.  It is the experience worldwide of food producing and exporting counties that the crucial factor is not the actual occurrence of an event but how it is addressed.  Our response was balanced, proportionate and fully supported by our EU colleagues.  Having made these vital decisions we have since acted in a decisive manner to get processing back on track and to keep Irish pork and bacon products on retail shelves throughout the world.  Our actions will reassure consumers and, with the assistance of a new Bord Bia labelling system, Irish pork and bacon products will again be as popular as they were before this problem emerged.The provision of a facility of up to €180 million secures an important element of Ireland's agrifood sector, which is worth €1.1 billion per annum and which employs 6,500 people if related sectors are included.  Approximately 500 farm families are involved in pig production.  The industry comprises 11 major processors and up to 800 related enterprises.  Approximately 50,000 pigs are slaughtered per week, or 2.6 million pigs annually, and 65% of the 200,000 tonnes produced per annum is exported.  Pigmeat exports were worth €367 million in 2007 or over €1 million per day.  It is estimated that the cost to the Exchequer from the loss of these 6,500 jobs in the industry in terms of social welfare payments and tax foregone would be €140 million in one year.  That is to say nothing of the potential costs of statutory redundancy and the profound impact on both urban and rural communities throughout the country.This assessment relates only to the impact of the loss of the processing jobs which would essentially mean the end of the pig production sector and the enormous impact on the 500 producers, many of whose enterprises would be lost, and the very severe impact that would have in rural communities up and down the country.  The funding I am seeking today — €50 million — is part and parcel of this recovery.  It is essential for my Department in meeting the commitments we have entered into with the industry and I commend it to the House.I thank the Members with us, including party spokespersons Deputies Creed and Doyle from Fine Gael, Deputy Sherlock from Labour and Deputy Johnny Brady as chairman of the Oireachtas committee.  I thank other colleagues from all sides of the House for their constructive contributions since difficulties arose last Saturday week.

#MichaelCreed	unknown-#MichaelCreed-party	unknown-#MichaelCreed-dob	unknown-#MichaelCreed-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	579	The Acting Chairman might tell me when five minutes remain in the slot.  Being here today is like waking up from a bad dream.  It has also been a very expensive lesson for the State.  We have previously had agricultural debates in this Chamber and in committee where we haggled over sums far less than the €180 million relevant here.  Some €9.3 million would restore the installation aid and early retirement scheme on a national level when money is not as plentiful as it was.  We cannot find €10 million for a cervical cancer vaccination programme.That puts into context the extent of the crisis we faced, and €180 million may well be an under estimation of the damage done to the food island reputation.  That can only be quantified as we move forward and look at the implications in the marketplace.  There is plenty of evidence emerging at the moment of markets being closed and difficulties, even within the EU market, of markets being cancelled.  It is incumbent on us to learn from these mistakes.I am pleased to report to the House that the agriculture committee, under the chairmanship of Deputy Johnny Brady, met today and approved a very early detailed analysis of this incident.  We will call as witnesses all the main players, including political figures and the administrative senior civil servants in the Departments involved.  It is incumbent on us to learn from this.  We must find €180 million in these financially stricter times, which I agree with, but it is important we do not repeat the mistakes.In essence, the three factors standing out for me are the failure in traceability; the inspection regime in plants and the tests carried out; and the proportionality of the response.  I listened to the Minister's defence of the response and I must take that in the context of all the scientific evidence subsequently available.  I accept there are issues between people on the marketing and medical or scientific side.  Sooner rather than later we must critically analyse all these issues and decisions and report back to the House.  I am pleased to say this work is under way in the Oireachtas agriculture committee under the chairmanship of Deputy Johnny Brady.I am appalled that we are coming here today looking for a Supplementary Estimate of €50 million on a single sheet of paper.  There is no detail available to the House or outlined in the Minister's speech on the draw-down.  As a guardian of the taxpayers' money, that is the only document I received, with a brief statement from the Whip's office, which stated, "The proposed expenditure relates to payments to processors, producers and renderers for the destruction of certain product and slaughter and destruction of animals, the rendering of product and animal carcasses and associated costs."I have been around long enough to know that people have undoubtedly had losses.  There is potential in this compensation fund for persons not to be adequately dealt with while others benefit disproportionately.  I will approve the Supplementary Estimate but it is extraordinarily lax of the Minister and his Department to come in with a request that the House approve €50 million for 2008 with no detail of who the beneficiaries will be or the criteria under which this fund can be drawn down.  It is slipshod work in the extreme.  I am sorry to have burst the harmonious approach we have had on the issue but the material is extraordinarily bereft of any detail at a time when taxpayers deserve us to place the utmost scrutiny on how we spend their money.  There is no detail in this single page, which requests €50 million.I accept the time frame has been remarkably short and that officials in the Department and the Minister have been under considerable duress.  I appreciate the urgency of getting funding to people affected.  Notwithstanding any of that, it is extraordinary to ask this House to approve part of the overall sum required.  I would like to hear the Minister in his response tell us more about the remaining balance.  Is the total sum €180 million or €178 million?  When will we see details on that?We have done the budget for 2009 and there is no provision in the Department's Estimate for the balance of the fund.  Where will it come from and who will fund it?  Is there some other mechanism that the Department is not telling us about on funding?  Were it not for the urgency and critical time scale involved for all, I would be inclined not to approve this Supplementary Estimate.It is important to voice our concern that all who have innocently been injured by this debacle receive proportionate compensation.  I am anxious, in particular, that the deal concluded in the Minister's Department between the main processors does not exclude secondary processors in the industry.  The main players were in that room for many days but those locked outside are now most anxious that they receive their fair share of the compensation.  I appreciate the reference in the Minister's speech to the issue that all primary and secondary processors would be compensated.Will the Minister tell us more on the rendering process as we have not seen any lists of what is being charged to the State and where the product is to be rendered?  What arrangements are being put in place?  All that detail is necessary and if it becomes available before Thursday the Minister should lay the detail before the House before it rises for the Christmas recess.  I appreciate that officials in the Department are working in a very difficult timeframe.From my perspective, the most innocent victims are the individual pig producers who took feed in good faith.  I will not stand in judgment on this issue until the Garda inquiries are concluded.  The individual pig producers must be compensated and as I understand negotiations are ongoing I will not be prescriptive with regard to the outcome.  If these people are to be out of business, it is reasonable to expect that those who put them out of business pay towards getting them back into business.  It is reasonable that the losses should be compensated until the businesses are up and running, as they were put out of business by the State.One of the biggest issues that must be addressed is the failure in traceability.  This has been sold to farmers in all sectors on the basis that one could reach out and forensically recall contaminated product.  We did not test it in beef and I am not sure we have the real answers as to why we did not.  If we have the forensic capacity to recall contaminated animals or herds, why did we not do so and take the contaminated product off the market?It does not work in the pig sector at all once pigs go inside the factory gate.  We should either abandon all the investment we have made in traceability, or we should bring to heel the processors who up to now have not operated a clearly defined traceability system.  If there is resistance to that it must be dealt with and it is incumbent on us to deal with it.  My preferred solution is to continue with traceability while ensuring we have a system that works.  We cannot tolerate a system whereby the industry dictates that it will not have traceability beyond the factory gate.I appreciate the Minister is involved in a new marketing initiative with Bord Bia but that cannot be done on fresh air.  It will require funding, so will that entail a further Supplementary Estimate in 2009?  From press reports, I see that markets worth €30 million in China and Russia are closed to pork.  In addition, the weanling cattle trade to Italy is in jeopardy, so I hope every effort is being made to secure it.  We are also having difficulty in Poland, South Africa and other markets.  This has been a nightmare scenario for the Irish food industry and particularly for the pork and bacon sector.  We must learn from it and it is imperative that we remedy the defects that have so expensively exposed the taxpayer.  I look forward to hearing more details from the Minister on this matter.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	580	There is no doubt but that this Supplementary Estimate is needed.  It will cost the State €180 million because of flaws within the food chain.  We must rectify the matter to avoid being exposed to such a situation again.  To that end, I compliment Deputy Johnny Brady and the other members of the Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food for agreeing to hold an intensive series of sessions in January to prepare a report with recommendations that I hope will be put to the Dáil before the end of January.The primary cause of this problem was that the regime of scrutiny, including testing, at the feed supplier end of the cycle was not up to scratch.  Even if the premises were being tested only once a year, it should be mandatory to send samples of the product for analysis.  It happens with feed compounders and also when milk is collected at the farmyard gate.  It should be standard procedure to send samples from batch numbers for analysis, including the testing of dioxin levels.In addition the sooner our dioxin testing capacity is up and running the better.  There has been a cost factor in sending samples to York for tests.  I acknowledge that the results came back very quickly in this instance, but such testing facilities should be available here.  Samples from companies such as the one that caused this problem should be sent for testing as a matter of course every week.We heard earlier from Deputy Ned O'Keeffe that in Denmark pork and bacon products are 100% traceable.  In reply to parliamentary questions, I have been told by the Minister for Health and Children that such provisions can only be justified here on the grounds of protecting public health, prevention of fraud or unfair competition.  All three grounds are applicable in the pig and poultry sectors.  We must get serious about this.  There has been resistance within the food processing industry to clear traceability, including country of origin and production.  It has been convenient for certain elements to ignore traceability and present foreign products as being Irish.  We saw that by virtue of the products that remained on shelves recently.  In recent weeks, it became a virtue to do so because the products were not Irish.  However, the same products were being marketed beforehand as if they were Irish.We have 51 abattoirs that operate under a scheme whose closing date was 29 February 2008.  Various Fine Gael Members tabled questions about this scheme in July, October and this month, but they received the same answer.  In the last reply, dated 1 December, we were told that results were expected from the 51 abattoirs shortly.  If we had a network of abattoirs that were subject to full scrutiny we would have been able to contain the problem.If this problem is properly rectified it should not recur.  If it were to recur, however, we should be able to isolate and contain it and thus minimise the financial damage to our industry.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13160	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	581	I wish to share time with Deputy Penrose.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	582	Is that agreed?  Agreed.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13160	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	583	I appreciate that we all had to act in unison last week and take the Minister's statements in good faith as the crisis unfolded.  Across the political divide we acted in the public interest.  A total product recall was the only way to go to restore consumer confidence and export markets in the long run.  This week, however, we are at a different juncture.  The Minister is now asking us to stand over a payment of €50 million by way of a Supplementary Estimate.  I have serious reservations about it because the Minister has not provided sufficient detail on how that sum will be spent down to the last euro.  I agree that the compensation package must be negotiated but the lack of detail shows a certain disregard for Opposition Members who represent all sides, including consumers, farm workers and processors.  We should be provided with far more detail of this Supplementary Estimate, given that it is taxpayers' money.My understanding is that this €50 million payout will cover interim payments to processors, although that is not stated in the Minister's speech.  Perhaps we can get some clarification on that.  I did not hear anything in the speech to indicate that workers who were left out of pocket through last week's closure of plants will be compensated.  If plants such as Rossderragh are not in a position to compensate workers for loss of pay, which occurred through no fault of their own, there is a strong case for the Government to compensate them.  That is not an unreasonable request in this instance.  I am disappointed, however, that there is no detail of such a scheme in the speech.I did not write a speech in advance of this debate because I wanted to listen to the Minister before responding.  I wanted my remarks to be based on his speech.  Over the past 72 hours, I have read a great deal about Millstream Recycling company in Bunclody.  The Minister stated: "In regard to the specific investigation into the source of the contamination, my Department is being assisted by the Environmental Protection Agency and the Garda".  Why is the Garda involved?  Is it the Department's opinion that an illegal or nefarious process was involved?  If people are being asked to stand over a payout to the industry of between €50 million and €180 million, it is fair that they ask pertinent questions as to why the Garda has become involved.The Minister also stated: "The investigations focus on the type of fuel used in a burner which dried surplus food material for animal feed and the appropriateness of this type of oil".  He went on to state: "In view of the apparent link to the type of fuel used in the drying process, I am asking the European Commission to consider whether the type of oil to be used by feed business operators can be more strictly regulated".  It appears that the use of this type of fuel is not governed by the Department's rules, the hazard analysis and critical control point, HACCP, legislation or EU regulations.  Will the Minister clarify this issue and inform the House as to why the Garda is involved?  If the Garda is involved, a nefarious scheme is the presumption.  If there was an illegal process, will there be a source of redress?  Was the Millstream process illegal?  It is the reason for this debate.  The process will cost the State up to €180 million.Ironically, anything that I have read about the factory in question suggested that the process was a forward looking venture well ahead of the posse in terms of new industry initiatives.  This does not sit well and I hope that we are not hanging a particular individual out to dry.  The issue must be addressed transparently.  While we agree that compensatory measures must be put in place, we need to know who negotiated the package on behalf of the pig industry.  We also need to know when the funding will be divvied up and, in light of the public interest, whether the details of who gets what will become available.  If the taxpayers are to cover the cost, it is only fair that they know what is at stake and in play.There has been a failure of regulation, but I do not attribute it to the Government necessarily.  By way of constructive criticism, I suggest that we have a single figurehead — a supremo, if the House wills — to be in charge of food regulation.  I am not discussing the creation of a new agency or quango.  However, the statements issued by the Department, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, FSAI, and the European Food Safety Authority could give rise to a certain degree of confusion as to where competencies lie in food safety.  It took some 24 hours to realise that competence lay with the FSAI.  Rather than a merger of competencies, I propose there be one voice within the regulatory framework so that when the members of the Fourth Estate and the Legislature need questions answered, we will know to whom we should go.More details are necessary.  I will stand over the Department's decision to effect a withdrawal.  We stand over the necessary compensatory package, but there should be more detail.
#WilliamPenrose	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-party	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-dob	unknown-#WilliamPenrose-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	584	I thank my colleague for sharing time.  While it is his brief, I wish to say a few words because I have some knowledge of this area.I endorse the Minister's decision on behalf of the people last week, as it was a matter of national interest.  We are well on our way back to market recovery.  It will take some time because some organs of the media carried adverse publicity and used inflammatory and unwarranted terms.It is important that we have a properly integrated system of identification and traceability in terms of all foodstuffs sold.  As Deputy Brady is aware, it is easy to have traceability from the farm to the factory.  The cattle movement monitoring system, CMMS, brings the process to a certain point, but what occurs after an animal goes into layerage?  I once visited France as a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food to try to identify sheep so that we could measure the impact of how the French advocate their own products to consumers.  I remember well how a little French flag was placed in lamb on display.  As Europeans, we are too good.  We are reticent to show people the green, white and gold on our fine product and to tell them that it is traceable the entire way.  It is the best product in the world.There also appears to be a European reticence to country of origin labelling.  The Minister should take Europe on and tell it to get lost, as the labelling must be done.  There are idiotic ideas about substantial transformation, where something is supposedly manufactured or processed in Ireland if one throws a package of breadcrumbs on a basic product that comes from an external country.  It is a nonsense.  Deputy Edward O'Keeffe asked a necessary question forcefully.  How is it that, within three or four hours of the announced withdrawal, some of our shelves were packed with hams and processed goods?  They were already in stock and ready to hit the market.We are not doing enough.  We must call on everyone to put their shoulders to the wheel.  We have a fine product and one little hiccup should not be used by people who want to say that there is an issue.  Deputy Brady's committee and mine, the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food and the Joint Committee on Enterprise, Trade and Employment, respectively, will tell the Commissioner in plain Meath and Westmeath language what we want.  It is time to stop kowtowing to eurocrats.  Instead, we should tell them that we want country of origin labelling.  The same situation obtained in terms of Brazil.  We have strict regulations due to foot and mouth disease and BSE.  Everything is in its place.  It is about time.I am generally not critical.  However, I am critical of the waste management scheme.  The Government met at Farmleigh House, but the Labour Party has been advocating the building of schools.  Some 400 need to be built, a labour intensive project that would give construction workers a chance.  The farm waste management scheme could be another project.  Only half of the total number of people in question have submitted applications to the Department.  There will either be a flood of applications between now and 31 December or many eligible applicants will be prevented from carrying out necessary work aimed at protecting the environment.  What will be the position in respect of these people?  The Minister had the ideal opportunity to extend the scheme.  I accept that he probably fought hard in respect of it but I am sure, due to the fact that there was money involved, it was the Department of Finance which put the kibosh on it.The closing date for the scheme is 31 December 2008 and there is a stipulation that there can be no additional entrants.  The scheme provided people with the opportunity to carry out vital work.  However, it also provided much needed employment in rural areas where construction workers are being laid off.  In recent months, farmers obtained good value because people began to submit competitive tenders to carry out the building work they required.  All these farmers would have required was an extension of three to four months in order that the work might be carried out after the winter.  There were three or four months during the summer when the weather was so bad one would not have put a snipe out on one's land because it would not have survived.  It is for these reasons I cannot understand why the scheme has not been extended.I have heard that a new invigilation or inspection regime is going to be put in place and that local authorities will be given responsibility for it.  I hope this will not lead to duplication or even triplication.  The officials from the Department carry out examinations in respect of the matters under discussion and these are extremely satisfactory in nature.  Like me, I am sure the Minister does not wish to see duplication arise in respect of such examinations.
#MartinFerrisSF	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-party	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-dob	unknown-#MartinFerrisSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	585	In respect of the compensation package for the pigmeat sector, I am sure everyone is pleased that production was resumed relatively soon after the all-clear had been given.  The compensation package agreed also seems to have addressed the concerns of the processors.  However, another issue that must be addressed is the entitlement of workers in processing factories to receive compensation for wages lost while they were temporarily laid off.  Several thousand workers in different factories, all of whom suffered loss of earnings, were affected.The fact that €180 million has been made available for compensation means that there are adequate funds available to ensure that the losses of earnings to which I refer will be made up.  I calculate that the actual sum involved would constitute a small proportion, perhaps only 1%, of the €180 million.  One of the companies involved seems to be implying that the terms of the compensation deal agreed with the Government prevent it passing any of it on to its workforce.  This appears to be a weak excuse for the company to fail to look after its employees, who were, after all, affected more than the owners of the factories.  Not too many working families can afford any major loss of income for even a week and particularly at this time of the year.  Even if the terms indicate that it is incumbent on the Government to ensure that workers obtain their fair share, as I have already stated the amount involved represents only a small proportion of the overall fund.Now that the immediate issues relating to the crisis in the pigmeat industry have been or are in the process of being dealt with, a number of important questions remain to be answered in the context of how the dioxins in question came to be passed to the infected animals and with regard to the regulatory procedures that apply.  One aspect that has struck many people, particularly farmers, is the apparent lack of rigour applied in monitoring certain sectors of the agricultural industry in comparison to the huge resources dedicated to farm inspections and subsequent investigations, often, it seems, in respect of trivial matters or on quite dubious grounds.My office is dealing with one farmer who has been threatened with deductions to his single farm payment on the basis of an inspection supported by, of all things, evidence in the form of satellite photographs.  He claims, and would appear to have proof, that the parcel of land in respect of which he was found negligent does not even belong to him and that the inspector involved changed the reasons for his negative report.The contrast between the level of inspections for individual farms in respect of animal feed hygiene and companies such as that at the heart of the crisis is stark.  On average, approximately 850 farms are identified, on a risk-assessment basis, for inspection each year.  This illustrates that the level of attention paid to individual farmers is in contrast, it seems, to the monitoring of the plant, Millstream Recycling, which is at the centre of the pigmeat crisis.  Said plant was not inspected at all in 2008 and only once in 2006.  The only other plant involved was also inspected on one occasion in both 2006 and 2008.  However, it was not inspected last year.  As already stated, this contrasts with the level of on-farm inspection, particularly in light of the relative place in the scheme of things of an individual farm and a plant such as that to which I refer.Even if an inspection had been carried out this year, it would not have examined the oil responsible for the contamination.  This raises a number of serious issues in respect of regulatory procedures.  Even though the contamination in this case was not sufficient to present a serious threat to public health, it is crucial that in the future this aspect of processing should be monitored in order to prevent any recurrence of problems such as those to which I refer or a more serious contamination of the food chain.As already stated, a number of questions remain to be answered.  A number of these questions have been tabled by Deputies Ó Caoláin, Creed and I with regard to the use of the oils concerned.  We inquired, in particular, as to the origin of these oils, how they were supplied to processors and the position with regard to their destruction.  In reply to a parliamentary question tabled yesterday, the Minister stated that up to now the oils used have not presented any problem and that, therefore, a specific regulatory procedure is not yet in place in respect of them.  The latter is something which must be addressed immediately.We need to know where the oils to which I refer originate, where they were manufactured and bought, the procedures governing their use and how they are disposed of after use.  We must also ensure that mineral oils, including those that have been used in electricity transformers or which have been contaminated with such oils, are not used in the drying processes for animal or human foodstuffs in any processing plant.  We must be presented with a full report on any circumstances where the use of those oils has been detected.I asked the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources if he has engaged in discussions with the ESB regarding the traceability, sale, use and disposal of oils that have been used in its electricity transformers, particularly in light of concerns that such oils may have been responsible for the contamination of the Millstream Recycling plant.  We also need to know the extent to which the ESB ensures that when oils are removed from its installations, they are kept under proper control and properly disposed of as per its agreement with the companies charged with responsibility in this regard.  There are only three such companies licensed to carry out this work and only two are actually involved.In reply to questions tabled yesterday, the Minister stated that he is satisfied with the annual inspection programme relating to other aspects of the sector.  What he must do now is ensure that procedures which will lead to a similar level of confidence in respect of the use of these oils are implemented.  That can only be accomplished if this is made part of the overall monitoring and inspection regime.The Minister also said that the tests carried out by the Department enabled the source of the foodstuff that was responsible for the contamination to be identified.  As a result the Department was able to identify and take appropriate measures in respect of the farms that received that feed.  The animal foodstuff was confiscated and restrictions were placed on the movement of animals from the farms that were affected.  Any other farms which received the same foodstuff were similarly identified and feed was removed from them.In light of this information and in the context of the entire issue of traceability, which was an issue of central concern when this matter was debated last week, a number of questions must be asked.  If the Department was able to identify the source of the contamination and the farms affected — and was able to do so quickly — was it appropriate to impose an overall ban?  Does confidence in the existing traceability system not extend to situations where if the source of contamination and the destination of affected products are identified, the farms and products involved could be quarantined?  Where confidence exists, as it seemingly should have in this case, that an outbreak has been limited and contained, should the remainder of the sector not be allowed to continue as normal?  I raise these matters to highlight an aspect of the situation that should also be subject to departmental review.There is also the question of whether meat from pigs reared organically should have been subject to the restrictions imposed.  A further issue arises in that some of the wrapping that was supposed to be removed at the Millstream plant may have found its way into the production process.  In a written reply yesterday, the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food avoided answering in respect of this specific point but stated "there is no evidence to suggest that any residual wrapping material that may be present in the product presents any health or environmental hazards to human or animal health".  While that is all well and good, I do not think people will be satisfied that animals may have been fed foodstuffs that include plastic bags and wrapping paper.  Surely ensuring that does not happen, and that the wrapping material is properly and fully removed, ought not be a huge task?The article by Sean McConnell in today's The Irish Times addresses some of the issues relating to the contaminated oil thought to have contained the dioxin found in pork.  For example, he quotes some of those involved in the investigation to the effect that the oil, believed to have come from electricity transformers, may only be exported by companies issued with a special licence.  Also, waste oil from the electricity transformers, and containing high levels of PCBs, is passed to these companies for export and destruction under special conditions, a process that involves incineration at temperatures greater than 1,200 degrees and which is not carried out in this country.  I am told also that the same companies are involved in collecting similar oil from transformers in the Six Counties which they are supposed to take to England for destruction.An even more disturbing aspect of this situation is that it has been claimed by some people involved in the general sector that one of those licensed to export the oil in question has been supplying the plant, where the contamination originated, with oil collected from the electricity transformers.  Instead of the oil in question being exported and destroyed as detailed above, it was being used in the processing plant.This, if true, is a serious claim and one that needs to be thoroughly investigated.  I presume it is one of the aspects of the case currently being examined by the Garda.  If it is the case that the oil was being sold in this manner, this raises several questions regarding the integrity of the company involved.  Is it the case that these companies are being paid twice, once in respect of collection of the oil from ESB transformers for supposed export and destruction and again when they sell it on to the processing plants?While the actual danger to human health in this instance may have been minimal, a huge question hangs over the supplier in question and his entitlement to hold a licence for the purpose of dealing with this oil.  This, if found to be true, should be thoroughly investigated and dealt with.  It is particularly important, in terms of the recovery of the pigmeat sector and for the overall image and health of the food production industry, that companies involved in any aspect of food processing is operating in full compliance with the relevant regulations and is in general worthy of trust.Sean McConnell also highlighted the fact that as yet no satisfactory response, or indeed any response, has been issued by the Environmental Protection Agency in regard to the licensing requirements to export the oils in question.  Also, he referred to the fact that the Health and Safety Authority has not yet been requested to conduct an inquiry into any possible negative health issues concerning the workers at Millstream Recycling.  It is hoped the level of risk involved is similar to that related to the eating of any contaminated pigmeat.  Nonetheless this issue needs to be addressed, if only to put at ease the workers' minds.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	589	I have taken note of the order and will endeavour to respond to Members' questions as best I can.  I thank Members for their contributions.There is no doubt that the pig sector has been adversely affected by recent events.  The primary responsibility of Government was to protect public health and to safeguard the excellent reputation of Irish food.  The evidence shows that the Government acted responsibly and correctly to the dioxin incident.  This is not alone our view but the view of others who commented on the matter independently of Government.When the positive analysis result was received, we acted immediately and effectively.  The decision to recall pork products was not a decision taken lightly but it was, as acknowledged, a necessary one.  It is worth referring again to the international and expert commentary cited by the Minister, Deputy Brendan Smith, that shows we are viewed as having taken decisive action and as having informed the public as to exactly what we were doing.  In addition, the BBC was complimentary as to the manner in which we handled the incident and pointed to the "meltdown" the industry would have faced had we not acted as we did.  The Minister referred earlier to the costly alternative, a bill of €140 million per annum, with which we would have been faced had workers been let go en masse, a danger while evident at the time has now been rectified.As Deputy Creed stated the timeframe involved is critical.  The Minister will tomorrow attend a Council of Ministers meeting in Brussels.  We needed to bring before the Dáil this Supplementary Estimate prior to the Houses going into recess.  In response to those Deputies who requested a further breakdown of the details in regard to this Supplementary Estimate, it was not possible, unfortunately, to do so as this would have caused unnecessary delay.  We are caught between a rock and a hard place in this regard.

#TrevorSargent	unknown-#TrevorSargent-party	unknown-#TrevorSargent-dob	unknown-#TrevorSargent-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	592	I do not accept that.  On the public health issue, I need only refer to the independent scientific assessment from the European Food Safety Authority.  I take this opportunity to once again emphasise that Irish pork and bacon is safe to eat.  It is important also to reiterate that we continue to take seriously our food safety responsibilities.The Minister, Deputy Smith, referred to the national residue monitoring programme, which together with the national feed inspection programme, makes up the national food and feed control plan for Ireland.  The sampling regime under this overall plan is an internationally recognised risk-based assessment and is comprehensive in nature.  I accept urgent lessons need to be learned.  This review is part of the overall response to the crisis.I visited the laboratories at Backweston and noted there a huge level of commitment and urgency in respect of testing.  It is well established but not widely known that Irish laboratories can turnaround tests in respect of PCBs.  While this is not yet the case in respect of dioxins, it is hoped it will be possible for them to do so by late February or March.Apart from the determination to safeguard public health, our economic interests dictate that our agri-food sector is safe and of the highest reputation.  For example, the meat sector accounts for €2.4 billion worth of exports and is a major contributor to employment and investment, in particular in rural areas.  I agree with Deputy Creed that we should not exclude secondary processors who, along with renderers, were represented at the negotiations.  They continue to work with the Department to identify, quantify and value the product in-store and for recall.  I assure Deputy Creed that they are being included.The agreement between my Department and the pig processors provides the necessary framework and allows for stocks and other product covered by the product recall to be removed for destruction.  This will free possible bottlenecks in the processing sector.  As I stated earlier, we are caught between a rock and a hard place in this regard.  Obviously, protection of workers was a huge priority and we need approval of this Supplementary Estimate to ensure this.  It is not, unfortunately, possible to provide Members with all the details they seek although we would do so if we had the luxury of more time.I am heartened by the support and understanding shown by our EU colleagues and the Commission.  The financial assistance being provided for private storage is tangible evidence of their good will.  I am grateful to Bord Bia, the Minister and his officials who worked hard while visiting other countries to ensure we return our market, following temporary suspension of our exports in some countries, to full capacity.  I am also grateful to the House for the general interest and support in the national interest in the past ten days.  The investigation is ongoing involving all agencies.  In reply to Deputy Ferris, the investigations have to involve the Garda Síochána, given the reasons he outlined.  The Supplementary Estimate is a necessary part of that process and I commend it to the House.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	596	I raised this issue yesterday.  I pointed out to the Minister that where a woman is undergoing a course of IVF treatment, that treatment is only available privately and it is very expensive.  First, there are detailed medical investigations to find out whether a woman is suitable and, second, people undergoing treatment are advised that they will often need three or more courses of treatment.  As the cost of each stage can be in excess of €2,000, and even €3,000, it is not unusual for a course of IVF treatment to cost €10,000 and I have heard of cases where the cost was €20,000.When the Minister flat-rated medical expenses he exempted, correctly, people paying nursing home fees.  For the relatively tiny number of people who use IVF as one of their last avenues to have a baby, which they long to have, the Minister's decision can make the finances of IVF extraordinarily, additionally expensive, especially for people who are in the middle of a course of treatment.  For a course of treatment costing €10,000 the tax relief would have been €4,000 but that will now be slashed to €2,000, reducing the relief expected by €2,000, and that is at the cheaper end of the scale.Even if the Minister does not accept the amendment I urge him to examine the situation to see if the State can do something.  I spoke also to the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Harney, who said she might consider some kind of State scheme.  The amendment deals with a particular situation.Yesterday we heard about the situation where children who are committed to undergoing an expensive round of orthodontic treatment cannot opt out once started.  Again, that has a particular impact on families who often save to allow their child to undergo such treatment.  Up to now the tax relief has been an important element in relieving the overall financial burden.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	597	We dealt with the amendment in some detail last night.  The position is that income tax relief in respect of health expenses will be granted at the standard rate of tax for 2009 with the exception of nursing home fees, which will continue to be granted at the marginal rate.The changes provided for in the Finance Bill follow on from the changes made in the Finance Act 2007, with the removal of the de minimis threshold for a single individual and a married couple.  The 2007 Act also provided for the removal of the requirement that there be a defined relationship between the taxpayer and the person who is the subject of the tax claim.Standard rating health expenses relief will make the tax system fairer and more equitable for all taxpayers in accordance with Government commitments.  The standardising of health expenses relief brings it in line with other reliefs such as rent relief, trade union subscriptions relief, medical insurance relief, third level fees relief and service charges relief.In addition, the standard rating of health expenses relief will mean better value for money for the Exchequer and will ensure that the relief will benefit the broadest range of taxpayers in a fair and equitable manner.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	598	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 47, between lines 20 and 21, to insert the following:"(c) are derived from innovative activities meaning the development of a new technological, telecommunication, scientific or business process”.I beg the Acting Chairman's pardon.  I was momentarily distracted.  This matter came up in the Committee Stage debate when we were discussing the remittance tax basis, which is a concession being given by the Minister to certain high earners who come here for a limited period and who significantly add value by their location in Ireland.  The Committee Stage debate revolved around the potential of the scheme to be used for purposes for which it was not really intended by the Oireachtas, as we were drafting and as I understood the Minister's presentation of the proposal.I have added an additional condition into the requirements of the scheme that would provide that the employee involved would derive income from innovative activities, namely, the development of a new technological, telecommunications, scientific or business process.  It is a definition the Minister has used elsewhere in the Bill to ring-fence certain desirable activities he is seeking to promote in the research and development area and it could be similarly applied to the section here where we are trying to delineate the cases where the remittance scheme could apply.It is a generous concession but at the same time I recognise that if individuals can be attracted to the area of science and development, for example, if one could have a team leader here even for a period of time he or she could be a catalyst from which beneficial activities could be derived.  In the amendment I was trying to meet a broad sense of the committee's deliberations that this should be more targeted than in the existing draft.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	599	I am happy to support amendment No. 18.  In the course of Committee Stage the Minister spoke on several occasions about how he seemed to see this package as being particularly attractive to people in the financial services sector, such as the IFSC.  Given that our economic situation is facing meltdown, does the Minister consider that this is the time to attract more international bankers to the IFSC with schemes, or whether it is time to regulate the IFSC properly?I question whether this scheme should be concerned with traditional research and development and the improvement of new products and processes, especially where the emphasis is on science, technology and communication — the kind of areas that would employ many people and add real value to exports in terms of the Irish economy — or whether this is to be another string in the packages offered in the IFSC where, effectively, the Financial Regulator has a completely hands-off approach to regulation and where there is a kind of innovation in banking products.  Some of this has found a home in the IFSC and has led to the financial ruin the world is facing.  Does the Minister really want to attract more of this, or do we want Ireland to get back to work in a decent and sound manner, and forget the type of bubble of speculation that has characterised his party over the last ten years and brought the country close to a perilous economic situation?  We shall not now see the brighter side of this for probably two to three years.The amendment by Deputy Bruton seeks to corral and rein in the Minister's desire to hand out the remittance basis to anybody who suggests he or she has something to offer.  Deputy Bruton's amendment seeks to corral the definition of who it applies to.  It is a very reasonable comprehensive definition.  It allows latitude to technology, communications, science and business procedures, and at least reins in latitude on fly-by-nights, who are interested in many cases in using the name of Ireland in a way that is no longer an advantage to us as an economy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	600	The purpose of section 13 of the Bill is the attraction of individuals from overseas with the necessary high level skills that are required in the current economic climate.  These individuals will, in turn, act as potential magnets to attract individual levels of business to Ireland, which will enhance our ability to further develop the sectors within which they work.  It will also enable us to benefit from emerging areas of growth in the future.  These factors are especially important in light of the current increasing competition Ireland faces from other jurisdictions in attracting high skilled people.The Deputy's amendment seeks to restrict the scope of the new remittance basis for foreign employment to individuals working only in certain industries.  This would involve obtaining information from a number of Departments as well as substantial cost to the Exchequer.  In relation to the high skill sectors, I mentioned specifically on Committee Stage, and I reiterate on the floor of the House, that I only received direct representations from foreign direct investment in Ireland in industry in connection with this particular relief.  I referred to a report prepared by a high level group at the Department of the Taoiseach, which has responsibility for the financial services industry and its future.Deputy Burton should realise that we are dependent not just on domestic banking, but on our international traded banking sector for a substantial proportion of our gross domestic product, so I hope the people involved in that sector are not fly-by-nights, or there will be a considerable loss to the State.Those which should benefit from the remittance scheme include the ICT sector, where some of the biggest multinationals based here stressed the importance of having such a scheme.  They indicate it would help them being the best people in Ireland in roles such as principal investigator for major research and development projects and vice-presidential roles overseeing plant expansion and other product line introduction.  In the pharmacam sector it is seen as having particular potential to help attract plant and new process managers.  In particular, specific skill sets likely to be attracted include research and development, senior management, quality, project and validation managers.  For the medical devices sector, which is seen as very important for research and development, process development and also marketing are vital.  Medical devices and marketing are seen to have a low-level capacity in Ireland and need to attract specialist skills.As regards the financial services industry, it helps build businesses and employee teams around key talented people, with a significant multiplier effect.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	601	The Minister coughed at the moment he was saying that my amendment would prove to be of high cost to the Exchequer.  My understanding was that restricting it would reduce the cost to the Exchequer, by confining it.  I could not quite follow the logic of what the Minister was saying.In his elaboration of the cases, where he sees opportunities for this scheme, the only deviation I saw from my amendment was that it should, perhaps, be the development and application in Ireland of new technological, telecommunication, scientific or business processes.  He envisaged that the management of the installation of new processes would also be strategic.  I should be happy, if the Minister is disposed towards broadening it slightly, to say "the development and application in Ireland" or words to that effect, which would catch the import of what he is saying.

There is no doubt that globally there are many examples of people who come with gifts, for want of a better term, who are gifted and who can bring substantial worth, whatever their industry happens to be.  I am instinctively supportive of Deputy Bruton's amendment, however, because he shares my concern as regards monitoring as he said on Committee Stage.  How can one ensure the system is not abused, and that we can keep an edge on it so as to stop the abuse that happened in the past?  I suspect that is exactly what Deputy Bruton is doing here, trying to limit the areas where it might apply and in so doing, the potential for abuse.I support what the Minister is doing, but I have a substantial concern as regards monitoring.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	603	I thank Deputy Morgan for his support as regards the general principle of the measure.  It is designed to attract people into this country and can play a key role in that regard.  It is not being introduced on the same basis as in the past.  Revenue will have a far more effective policing system for this relief in a number of ways.  First, the relief will be by way of repayment of tax, so all of the salary related to the exercise of the foreign employment in the State will have to be subject to the PAYE system in the first instance.  Indeed the levy will be deducted from it in addition to that, as I pointed out yesterday.  If Revenue is not satisfied by the information provided by the person making a repayment claim under this section, the official may refuse it and the individual will then have to appeal if he or she is dissatisfied with the ruling.  Any abuses of the new arrangements will be reported by the Revenue Commissioners to my officials.  In those circumstances I believe that on this occasion, unlike in the past when this relief was enforced, we have ample powers of surveillance of the operation.  It would be better to let the relief proceed on that basis, given the welcome it has had, and monitor its operation.  If any disturbing trends emerge, we will be in a position to legislate to deal with them at that stage.I do not believe it is a good idea to narrow it too much at the very initial stage, along the lines suggested by Deputy Bruton, although I cannot rule that out with the passage of time.  However, rather than making a prejudiced view about a particular sector of industry or services, we should simply start on the basis that this is a way of attracting a number of individuals into Ireland who can generate economic activity here.  If we are concerned about any trend establishing itself, we can immediately move to deal with that in next year's Finance Act.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	604	I am not really satisfied with the Minister's response.  I can see the "suck it and see" argument and accept that the "surrender and regrant" approach has a long tradition, which goes back into the annals of history.  People pay the money, in effect, and the concession is regranted.  That gives a better hold, as the original inventors of the scheme thought it would, over their fiefdoms.  I am still uneasy, however.  While the Minister says Revenue may refuse, it may not do so on grounds that are of concern to people on this side of the House, namely, that this is being used for purposes for which it was not intended.  The only grounds on which Revenue could refuse it would be those as set out in the sections.  The Revenue Commissioners cannot act unreasonably.  They are not courts and cannot invent reasons for challenging a relief of this nature.  While they can use these sections, they can only ask whether a claimant was here for a period of three years or whatever.  It is a very limited box-ticking exercise.  Once claimants comply with these very narrow requirements they will be seen to be in order, even if the purpose is wholly different from that which the Minister has described in his articulation of the scheme.  I have no doubt the Minister has the numbers to get his way, but I am not happy about introducing a scheme that is loose in its drafting in the hope that it will work out.  We, as an Oireachtas, never get to see these things again.  Perhaps in ten years time some expensive consultant will do a report that tells us we got it wrong and defined the scheme too widely when it was originally designed.  We will rub our hands sagely and say: "What foolish people the original draftsmen were."  We might as well draft this tightly now and, perhaps, expand it next year if the Minister feels it is not achieving the required results.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	608	I move amendment No. 19:
In page 50, between lines 12 and 13, to insert the following:"16.—Retirees partaking in a private pension scheme may postpone the purchase of an annuity for up to two years.".It is one of those delicious ironies of the parliamentary draftsman that the previous amendments concerned the Minister's decision to reintroduce a remittance scheme for highly paid people coming into this country, where only the first €100,000 of their income would be subject to tax.  Any tax they paid over and beyond that is to be refunded.  On the other hand, amendment No. 19 attempts to address the situation relating to the pension funds of tens of thousands of people.  Following the Minister's predecessor's — Charlie McCreevy's — deregulation of much of the pension regulation here in order to let people make up or invest in their own pension fund and then purchase an annuity, many people followed that process.  Many of those pension funds are now in crisis.A proposal has been made, which I understand has been accepted in principle by the Minister, that people in a defined contribution pension scheme should not be required now, as normally required, to purchase an annuity when they come to retirement age.  The Minister must bear in mind that, unfortunately, many of these schemes, as a result of what has happened in capital and investment fund markets, are worth only a fraction of what people reaching retirement age expected them to be worth.The Government, through the Minister for Social and Family Affairs and all its Ministers for Finance over the years, encouraged people to invest in the private pension fund sector.  My amendment seeks to provide some flexibility for these people so they can salvage something from the situation.  Many people of relatively modest means who have worked hard all their lives put their money into a pension scheme and were encouraged by the Government to do so.  They were encouraged by a Government which has also, through the kind of political economic structure it has developed, encouraged the disappearance of defined benefit schemes.  Significant numbers of companies have closed such schemes in favour of defined contribution schemes.We did not expect that Irish pension funds or funds in which Irish people looking forward to retirement hold their money would be subject to the kind of dramatic fall they have suffered.  Therefore, my amendment urges the Minister to announce, as he has indicated he may do, flexible arrangements with regard to the requirement to purchase an annuity.  I see no reason the Minister cannot be positive and make this arrangement and announcement now.With regard to the regulations governing the employers' side of defined contribution schemes, we know that under technical regulations, many of these schemes will be in default if the stock market continues its current trend, because employers are required by law to top up the contributions to an appropriate level to keep the fund viable.  Again, we have suggested that the Government should state clearly the position in this regard.I am aware that the Minister for Social and Family Affairs, Deputy Mary Hanafin, has suggested on several occasions that she is agreeable to making this change with her colleague, the Minister for Finance.  However, there is currently no certainty for people about to retire as to the situation.  People who ring up to inquire about their pension funds can get no hard information or advice in this regard.  They do not know what will happen if they reach the age of 65 in January or March or whenever.  In the normal course of events, these people would, by law, be required to purchase an annuity within a short period of time.I urge the Minister to accept the principle of this amendment.  More importantly, he should set out clearly what will happen with regard to those people who are living in fear and dread.  They do not know what has happened to the money they invested in good faith or what will happen them now with regard to their pensions.  The Government is going to provide up to €10 billion for bankers who have behaved unbelievably recklessly, but there is much less certainty about what it will do for people on trolleys in accident and emergency units where services will be cut or for people who in good faith put their pension funds into investments.  They had no other choice but to do so, because they were required by their employer and encouraged by the State to do it.  Will the Minister indicate clearly where they stand now?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	609	I am not exactly clear as to the Government's intention.  I understood it proposed a period to allow for the postponement of the purchase of an annuity.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	611	That does not seem to be reflected in the Finance Bill as we have seen it.  My amendment is a reflection of an amendment I tabled last year and relates to the inequity of the current arrangements whereby people in defined contribution pension schemes are forced to purchase annuities, whereas self-employed people investing money in retirement funds have the flexibility, once they have other income that provides an income to the value of at least the non-contributory old age pension rate, to put their money into a fund and manage it according to different rules.  There is clear discrimination, therefore, against people paying into a standard contributory scheme, which is the predominant type of scheme for people currently.  People who pay into defined contribution schemes are being discriminated against by being forced to purchase these annuities.The Government is being forced, due to the collapse of interest rates and the deplorable value in the purchase of an annuity, to make the provision it proposes for two years.  However, I raise the wider issue of why it would treat some people as fish and others as flesh.  It seems that the former Minister's, Charlie McCreevy's, approach towards the self-employed, allowing them flexibility, should be applied equally to people who pay contributions towards pension funds that are equally subject to the vagaries of the market.  They should be allowed the flexibility to manage them as best meets their needs.  I will be interested to hear the Minister comment on the wider issue, as well as on the two-year moratorium on what I regard as an unfair rule.
#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	612	I support the principles behind both amendments.  There is a simple point about pensions.  A person gets tax relief on the amount of money put into a fund.  When one takes it out one pays tax.  I always felt it was wrong to put too many restrictions on the ways people deal with their pension money.  Circumstances are different for different individuals.  Some people may need money immediately and others may not.When one's pension age, or retirement age, arrives one can take the pension, automatically.  However, some people continue in employment, do not need the money and want to allow it increase.  The way things are going, people will work beyond the usual retirement ages of 60 or 65.  I always fail to see why the State should worry too much about when a person takes his or her benefit.  Whenever people take their benefit they will be taxed fully.Deputy Bruton made a point about the self-employed.  I can offer a personal example.  My retirement age was 60 and I got the fund but because I was still working I did not need to draw down my money.  I spoke on this issue last year.  The Minister required that 1% had to be taken last year, 2% this year, 3% next year.  My fund has decreased considerably——

#SeanBarrett	unknown-#SeanBarrett-party	unknown-#SeanBarrett-dob	unknown-#SeanBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	614	——but I still must take out 2%.  My point is that the tax the Minister will get on the 2% is far less than he would get if it were allowed to recover and grow.  Taking 2% of a lesser amount means taking less tax.  It seems crazy that people in my position are forced to take 2% at a time when it is not required.  If my retirement age were 65 it would be a different matter.  Flexibility, whether of defined benefit or defined contribution, or for the self-employed, is irrelevant.  People should be treated as individuals.  The money is theirs and they should be allowed take it when they feel like it.  Once they pay their tax, whenever they take the money, the State will not lose anything.This is a time for radical thinking in the whole area of pensions, particularly given the circumstances in which we find ourselves.  I chose where I would invest my money and in what retirement fund I would invest it but everybody does not have that choice.  Perhaps it is time we looked at regulations concerning where pension fund moneys should be invested.  An employer, or the person advising an employer, can use his or her discretion to invest money in funds without the knowledge or the authority of the individual whose money it is.I believe we have learned a lesson from what has happened to pension funds.  Perhaps we should look at flexibility with regard to where people invest.  It is different for the public servant who gets a pension and does not have to worry about the funds.  This applies to all of us in the House.  However, people outside here, whose retirement age is this year, are devastated.  To say that the State will force them to purchase annuity at this——

I am pleased the Minister is making provision in this regard.  Perhaps we might have an opportunity to discuss the issue further in respect of next year's Finance Bill.There are two parts to section 15, which concerns the assessment of days spent outside the country.  The Minister said the change in question will occur as and from 2009.  Is it reasonable to expect somebody to change lifestyle from one year to the next?  Would the Minister not consider that the appropriate date should be 2010?  That would give people a chance to make alternative arrangements.  The Minister is changing regimes all of a sudden and this will affect many people.  Ultimately, he will lose revenue because of this move.  The fewer days a person stays in this country the less money will be spent.  To change from one regime to the next on 1 January appears to me somewhat harsh.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	617	This is a very important issue.  We are dealing with people who have just arrived at their pension age.  I agree with Deputy Barrett that people should have options.  I shall give an example.  In recent years I have seen a significant change in attitude in a number of Departments, including the Departments of Social and Family Affairs and Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, and also within the Revenue Commissioners.  To some degree, personnel are trying to give people what they are entitled to receive.  Things could be better but in recent years there has been a considerable improvement.In similar fashion, we should seek to accommodate people who arrive at pension age in order to get the best possible options for them.  That is surely the least we can do for people who have worked all their lives.  I support the amendments because they endeavour to give better options to people who have arrived at pension age.  Making a simple change of date, from 2009 to 2010, would be an immediate example of a better option, if it were possible to do that.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	618	Members will be aware I recently announced that the rules relating to the requirement for members of defined contribution occupational pension schemes to purchase an annuity with their pension funds in retirement are to be relaxed by the Revenue Commissioners, on a temporary basis.These amendments have, therefore, been overtaken by events.  The deferral arrangement will be operated on an administrative basis by the Revenue and I understand it has finalised the detailed arrangements of the initiative with the pensions industry since my announcement.  Under the arrangement, members of defined contribution occupational pension schemes who retire in the period from 4 December 2008 to 31 December 2010 have the option of taking their tax-free lump sum and purchasing a retirement annuity immediately on retirement, or they can take the lump sum and defer the annuity purchase, subject to agreement with their scheme trustee, up to and including 31 December 2010, by which date the concession will end.By way of background, my Department was approached by the Irish Association of Pension Funds and others in the pensions industry to look at this issue.  They were seeking some flexibility on the timing of annuity purchase in view of the fact that affected defined contribution scheme members retiring at this time will have suffered considerable losses in the value of their pension funds in the past year.  The argument was made that in the event of such individuals having to purchase an annuity immediately on retirement these losses would be locked in.Coupled with more recent falls in interest rates and the likelihood of more interest rate reductions to come, the purchase of an annuity in current market conditions with depleted funds would prove likely to be more costly.  It would not provide the same level of guaranteed income as in the recent past.  The point was also made to me that the position is even more acute for those who have not yet reached normal retirement age, but who are obliged to retire early due to redundancy.  This situation, unfortunately, has been increasingly evident in recent months.  This is because the normal shift to a more conservative investment strategy in the years running up to retirement will not have occurred for those individuals as they would not have been planning to retire at this time in the normal course.In acceding to the request, I was conscious that any decision to defer the requirement for annuity purchase is not a risk-free option for the individuals concerned.  As I said in my press statement when I announced this change, in giving individuals the option to purchase the annuity immediately, or within the two year deferral period, there is no guarantee they will get better value if they postpone, for two years, or a later date, the decision to purchase.  Those individuals who are retiring now or approaching retirement must take this into account.  In this regard, I am happy to note that as part of this initiative, the Pensions Board will publish appropriate risk guidance in this matter in the near future.I also wish to emphasise that the deferral of annuity purchase announced recently is the result of consultations carried out with the pensions industry and represents what the industry proposed as a means of addressing the immediate issues facing certain individuals coming up to retirement or facing redundancy.  In light of the fact that the Revenue Commissioners are facilitating a relaxation of the annuity purchase rules, which largely do what these amendments seek, I do not propose to accept the amendments.Deputy Bruton asked some wider questions about pension policy in general.  He is seeking flexibility for employees to put pensions into an approved retirement fund, ARF, or a personal retirement savings account, PRSA.  This is a wider issue to be dealt with in the context of the Green Paper on pensions.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	619	Will the Minister make arrangements to have that broadcast fairly widely?  People are in fear and trepidation that what they have saved for is literally gone down the Swanee in terms of the money they put into their investment funds.  I hope the Minister will be open-minded enough so that if the current falls in the markets continue for more than two years, as it would seem they may do, he will be flexible.  There is an opportunity here for the National Treasury Management Agency, for example, to offer a safe vehicle for an annuity at a low cost.  The Minister makes friendly references to the pensions industry.  The reality of the pensions industry in Ireland is that, among the pensions industries of the world, it has the highest level of charges.  Other jurisdictions seek to limit and cap charges but our Government does not.I would also like the Minister to address an issue which is very important from an employment point of view, namely, how he, as Minister for Finance, proposes to advise his colleagues about the treatment from an employer's point of view of defined contribution schemes where the current rules are that if the scheme comes into deficit, the deficit must be topped up.  If the deficit is not topped up, the scheme technically comes into default.  If that issue is not addressed rapidly, that default will become a reason for many companies seeking the protection of receivership if the deficit involved in pensions schemes for which they have a liability becomes excessive.  In the time available, I would like the Minister to address his attention to this.  It is very important from the point of view of thousands of companies and their continuation through very lean times.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	620	The Minister contends I am raising a wider issue; I am not.  In two years time, the Minister will be faced with this same issue.  As he rightly says, if the market has not recovered he will again force people to buy at low interest rates annuities that will be wholly unsatisfactory.  I raise the point that what is good for the self-employed and has applied to the self-employed for a considerable period is just as good for people in defined contribution schemes which are reaching maturity.If the Minister did want to raise the wider issue, Deputy Burton has raised it, namely, what happens to people in their 60s who have a pension fund.  It is the existing pensioners who have priority.  Someone very close to retirement age is no more secure than someone aged 20 in the status of a defined benefit pension scheme that is in difficulty.  Those are the wider issues we would like to see addressed.  However, I am sticking strictly to the context of the forced purchase of annuities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	621	The deferral arrangements for annuity purchase which I announced recently are by definition temporary.  However, as Deputy Burton suggested, if present conditions persist over an extended period, that issue might have to be revisited.  Changing the scope of the existing ARF arrangements is one of a range of issues to be addressed in the long-term pensions policy framework being developed by the Government.Some speak of extending the ARF option as though it was a panacea for the problems of the pensions area.  It is an important issue but not as simple as it is portrayed.  There are arguments for and against extending it to pension arrangements where they are not available at present.  The arguments are set out in the Green Paper and relate to the whole question of balance.I was giving Deputy Burton attention when she asked about the accounting treatment of pension funds at present.  As I understand the position, and the Deputy will appreciate it is a prudential issue rather than a revenue issue so I am speaking without the benefit of official advice, there is an EU requirement in regard to the accountancy standards that must be observed.

In page 52, to delete lines 1 to 21 and substitute the following:"20.—Section 26 of the Finance Act 2008 is repealed.".The amendment seeks to delete section 26 because this section facilitates tax exemptions for the private health care sector.  I would argue it facilitates a road towards the privatisation of the entire health care system in the State, to which I am clearly opposed.There are many examples of problems having arisen.  The Bill deals specifically with enhancing tax relief for hospice facilities.  We all want to see and there is a huge need for the provision of additional hospice services throughout the State.  Currently, 12 counties have no hospice facilities.  Rather than providing those facilities, a trend for 11 years under this Government has been to hand over that section of the health care service lock, stock and barrel to the private health care industry.  This is unacceptable.I do not disagree in principle with certain tax incentive initiatives.  Several years ago, for example, we saw derelict parts of towns which attracted exemptions for a short while — some would argue for far too long — which increased activity in that area of the town and renewed activity.  While I am not against such initiatives per se, I am against them with regard to the health service.  For example, to take the issue of nursing home beds, since the huge tax incentives were built into that section of the health service, only a very small number of public beds have been provided.  It has got to the stage where people are almost wholly dependent on the private sector for nursing home beds, which is a bad situation.The National Treatment Purchase Fund has a similar effect with regard to the privatisation of health care.  Our Lady's Hospital in Navan, which has been closed since mid-November and will remain closed until mid-January, is the orthopaedic hospital in the region where hip replacements and such treatments occur.  The people who would have attended for hip treatments are on the waiting list and will remain there for three months, when they can apply for the National Treatment Purchase Fund scheme.  Each of those procedures would cost between €3,500 and €4,500.  As the HSE has admitted, the only savings made will be in regard to replacement artificial hips, yet a significant number of these people will be referred through the National Treatment Purchase Fund to private hospitals for that procedure.  In that event, the cost of the procedure will be somewhere between €8,000 and €12,000.  Clearly, this is not a cost-saving exercise.  It is about driving an ideology and driving the privatisation of the health care system, which I totally oppose.I will give one other example.  Although it has not been announced, the ambulance service has recently been subject to significant cutbacks because the operatives are not allowed overtime.  Rather than have people working, especially at this time of year when there is increased activity on the roads because of parties, additional home visits etc., the ambulances will be parked.  There is a significant increase in the rate of accidents and deaths on the roads at this time of year.  The HSE stated its position in the event of someone not being available because overtime could not be facilitated.  For example, if an operative is out sick, he or she cannot be replaced by a colleague because overtime would be incurred.  In such cases, ambulances from other outlying areas would be required to cover that area.  Such an ambulance would require additional time to arrive at the scene of an accident, involving a heart attack victim or whatever the emergency.  That is completely unacceptable.

Rather than pay some operatives in the local area overtime, it will incur not only the cost of the two operatives in the ambulance, but the cost of the private ambulance itself.  It is a substantially increased cost and it makes no sense.In 2006, the last year for which figures are available, tax exemptions for developers of private hospitals cost the State €10 million.  We are all aware of how €10 million could be spent.  Such an amount could not be found for the cervical cancer vaccine programme.  It was found and then cancelled.  However, in this case a preference is given to developers of private hospitals, which is alarming and I am concerned that this is the case.

It was introduced last year at the request of the relevant voluntary groups.  Developing hospice care was widely welcomed at the time.  Deputy Morgan's amendment proposes that the new scheme of capital allowances for the construction and refurbishment of buildings to be used as specialist palliative care units does not come into effect.  I appreciate Deputy Morgan tabled an earlier amendment which was ruled out of order, and that he spoke to that.  However, the scheme Deputy Morgan seeks to repeal was introduced in Finance Act 2008 but has yet to receive EU Commission approval from a State-aid perspective and be commenced by me.  It was introduced in response to identified gaps in the supply of and demand for palliative care facilities throughout the country.  The scheme has similar terms, conditions and exclusions to those that apply in the case of qualifying private hospitals and qualifying mental health centres.  It aims to encourage private sector investment to fill some of those gaps, but only where proposed developments of facilities are in line with the longer term public health policy objectives in this area.  For expenditure to qualify for capital allowances, the development of a facility must have pre-approval from the Health Service Executive, with the consent of the Minister for Health and Children, as being in line with national development plans and needs assessments for palliative care facilities.As the Deputy will be aware, the Finance Bill contains some amendments that will make the scheme more effective when it comes into operation.  Since I was persuaded by the arguments made during the debate on the introduction of this scheme in the Bill that the minimum bed capacity requirement of 20 beds could be a significant hurdle for some palliative care units, I am lowering this requirement to eight beds.  I am also allowing capital expenditure under the scheme to qualify for capital allowances from the date of the enactment of the Finance Act 2008, because I do not believe it is reasonable that legitimate capital expenditure on qualifying projects should be excluded from benefiting under the scheme in the period pending EU Commission approval.Tax incentives for similar schemes have proved to be an effective way of attracting the necessary private investment into areas of the economy where investment is needed.  This scheme has the potential to make a real contribution to increasing the provision of much needed palliative care facilities and I am, therefore, unable to accept the amendment.  As with similar schemes that have been reviewed in recent years, I will keep this scheme under review to ensure that it meets the requirements I have in mind for it.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	630	I am unsure if the Minister understands that the financial world as we knew it has changed.  Tax-based capital schemes led his predecessor in office, the Taoiseach, Deputy Brian Cowen, to ruin in respect of the economy.  It produced activity which, as it turns out, is unsustainable.  The contribution of the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Mary Harney, and her party, the Progressive Democrats, now happily deceased, to health services has been ruinous.  It has produced several investments backed by groups of private investors.  They have established private hospitals, some of which are independent and some of which are proposed for public hospital lands.The basis of these schemes is the use of leverage, which is made easier by the availability of generous tax breaks.  It involves high net worth individuals or groups of such people, lending or, more likely borrowing, large volumes of capital.  The borrowings are then used to fund private health care initiatives which are given tax breaks by the State at the top rate of 41%.  That form of leverage is over.  As in his dealings with the banks, the Minister does not seem capable of appreciating this fact.Earlier this year, the Minister introduced the scheme for hospices.  Initially, those connected with the hospice movement knew nothing of the scheme.  It turned out a party colleague of the Minister prevailed upon an institution in Munster to seek this scheme, presumably to assist in an investment by a select group of investors.  These high net worth individuals planned to borrow money for the investment and consequently receive a very handsome tax break at the marginal rate of 41%.  This year, the Minister announced an amendment to reduce the number of beds required for the scheme.  I do not understand why the amendment was necessary.  However, it was probably on the basis of some kind of representation from some individual investor or private project to which the amended scheme would be more attractive.Unfortunately, instead of representing fairness and universality of treatment, the health service has been driven into a two-part system by the Government, the better and faster treatment privatised.  However, there was the case of Ms Susie Long, who became very ill and died.  Her colonoscopy was delayed entirely because she was a public patient.  She wrote to Mr. Joe Duffy on "Liveline" using the name Rosie, and referred to a person seeking treatment at the same time as her.  It turned out that, luckily, the man had private health insurance and consequently could avail of private treatment.  As a result, that person was able to get the test in sufficient time to save his life.  In her case this was not possible.I do not understand why the Minister is so determined to extend these schemes when everyone knows that given the current collapse of the financial markets such schemes are as dead as a doornail.  No financial adviser worth his or her salt would advise people to proceed with such a scheme.  In any event the money is not available in banks.  The banks do not have funds to lend for such schemes.  These are the banks to which the Minister proposes to give €10 billion of pensioners' money.  He ought to be deeply ashamed.The Minister's proposals are little better than the Ponzi scheme that gentleman in New York used to rip off approximately $60 billion.  This is the Government's own version of a Ponzi scheme.  I do not understand what the Minister is playing at.  Members have never been informed who are the precise beneficiaries of this proposal.  However, although the Government introduced the original scheme less than 12 months ago, the Minister already seeks to amend it to favour more intensively a group of unknown investors.  The Minister ought to share this information with the Dáil.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	631	I must repeat that I accept the need for palliative care beds.  As my constituency in particular has one of the highest rates of cancer on the island, which consistently is 12% or 13% above the national average, I accept such a need completely.  In a way, I accept that in respect of occupancy, better efficiency is to be gained, for example, from a ten-bed unit than from a 20-bed unit.  Consequently, I see some merit in the Minister's specific amendment to the scheme.  From the perspective of the investor, having full occupancy would be efficient.However, this should not be about investors.  People's health care should be dealt with by the State and they should not be obliged to enter private hospice care.  This is the biggest issue in this regard.  Another point worth making is that tax breaks cost taxpayers money.  They do so for the simple reason that the cash does not come in.  However, the Government appears to be in favour of writing off as many schemes for tax breaks as one wishes, which I consider to be a ridiculous concept.  This appears to be the prevailing mentality, with both the present Minister and successive Ministers for Finance, for a considerable time and is particularly lamentable.In conclusion, I am not opposed to hospice care.  I see more than enough of it through visits to the small number of hospice beds that are provided.  While I recognise the need for them, they should be provided by the State and we should not be moving in this direction.

This restriction on reliefs was introduced by my predecessor, the current Taoiseach.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	670	My understanding is that this section introduces a concession for urban dockland developments where there is a need to move certain activities from such lands to new sites to free the former for wider development.  In principle, I can see the merit in a tax relief.  However, the Minister will have had sight of the letters sent to the committee in which it has been presented that this provision, as it has been structured, will disadvantage many investors who are already engaged in such activity.  There will not be a level playing field because although there are 95 designated Seveso sites, under this proposal only eight would become eligible for some tax support.The issue is that this provision will create a non-level playing pitch and the proposal must be reconsidered in some way to make it more broadly based.  I understand that those who consider themselves to be adversely affected have submitted an amendment — I presume it has reached the Department as I received it by e-mail — that they believe would create a level playing pitch.  A genuine concern exists in this regard, which was shared by all sides on Committee Stage.  However, Members were frustrated that the guillotine prevented them from reaching this matter.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	671	This is another example of lobbies that have the ear of the Minister for Finance, which gives rise to legislation that results in significant tax advantages to a select few.  When the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Brian Cowen, was finally persuaded that the structure of capital-based tax breaks he had introduced was dangerously damaging the property market and creating a property bubble, comprehensive studies were conducted by an independent firm of consultants and studies were carried out by the Department of Finance.  Unfortunately, the bubble has burst, leaving many construction workers unemployed and the State coffers heavily depleted.  The outcome of such studies was a declaration by the Minister that he would row back on the principle of tax breaks for property development and that where he proposed to introduce other tax breaks, a clear cost-benefit case study analysis would be undertaken that would show exactly what was involved, what were the benefits of the suggested action and what were the costs of the suggested action, in respect of tax forgone.When the Minister announced this in the budget, it was immediately suggested that this measure would particularly advantage certain developments in the Cork docklands area and, potentially, certain developments in or near the Dublin docklands area, and particular developers, whose investments would be significantly enhanced by these developments, were also named in the media, some of them prominent supporters of the Minister's political party.We, along with other Deputies in this House, received representations from developers and investors in other schemes around the country who suggested that, because the developments or locations named by the Minister on budget day would get a specific advantage, they would be heavily disadvantaged.  Clearly, the investors concerned in the Finance Bill would have a very attractive way of reducing their exposure to taxation by investing in the Minister's scheme.From a public interest point of view, it is really important that the details of this come out.  It is, of course, potentially, a state aid to industry and I understand it must be examined by the European Commission with a view to seeing whether it constitutes an unfair illegal state aid to industry to particular groups as opposed to other groups.There are all around the country dockland areas where, for instance, part of docklands were used to import and hold liquid petroleum gas, oil and other items which give rise to a Seveso-type definition if, subsequently, those sites come to be redeveloped because they are heavily contaminated.On the additional tax breaks the Minister has put forward for wealthy people to reduce their incidence of taxation, all of the Deputies speaking in this debate have asked for details, for cost-benefit analyses and the identity of the beneficiaries, but we are none the wiser.  This is why the business of tax breaks by his Government and the tent at the Galway races have become such bywords for a kind of political corruption, which has plagued this country and which in the end has been one of the reasons for the severity of the economic decline we are now suffering.The Minister is proposing another one of these tax incentives.  There are profound arguments in their favour but they must be done fairly, openly and honestly.  The regime of the Minister's party and Government has been anything but.

We all received the correspondence from the particular Seveso company and it should be looked at by the Minister in terms of equity.On the broader issue of docklands development, in the context of my own constituency in Limerick we have a working dock but we would like to see development of the area as an amenity.  The Minister needs to look at the overall development of docklands from a sustainability viewpoint and strictly not from the viewpoint of this issue, which is not equitable to all the Seveso sites.  In fact, it only applies to eight out of the 95.  The Minister might take that on board.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	675	Yes.  I can arrange for that to be done.  I really deplore Deputy Burton's suggestions of corruption in respect of developers.On the section, it is not a tax incentive for property developers.  It is a scheme to remove and relocate industrial facilities involved in the regeneration of urban docklands because of health and safety concerns that arise under legislation in the Seveso directive.The section only applies to Seveso sites which a local authority wants to remove for urban regeneration purposes.  That is important.  That is written into the section.  It is not a question that any developer, any owner of land or any dockland can trigger this relief.  It is under local authority control.  There must be a proper regeneration scheme.On the correspondence received by Deputies which I myself read with great care, it must be borne in mind that written into the section is a provision for the clawback of the benefits in cases where there is any element of undue competition.  Indeed, Deputy Bruton raised that question.  The clawback provision in the section deals with the danger identified in the correspondence of unfair competition.  The clawback provision is essential under the state aid provisions applied by the European Commission.

The Minister's officials, or the officials of the relevant Department, have not succeeded in convincing the companies concerned that this represents a level playing pitch.I am very uneasy about accepting at this very late stage an assurance that there is an adequate clawback provision.  My reading of the section led me to table amendments seeking to restrict it because I thought it was broadly phrased.I realise we are time constrained, but when the Houses are informed that this is discriminatory and that it will apply to only a limited proportion of the sites that have the problems to which the public policy issue accords, we need a more comprehensive statement from the Minister before we would be asked to give our approval of this.It is not the Chair's fault, but it is unsatisfactory not to have had a Committee Stage debate on this.

It is a concrete jungle.  There is not a proper road in or a proper road out.  There is no school in the area.  We all could argue that that planning process was conducted under the auspices of Meath County Council but there are issues involved that require explanation.  I would merely suggest that that is what is causing suspicion on this side of the House.

The scheme is, of course, subject to EU approval.  It is good that the European Commission will have to test the clawback provision for its robustness.In response to Deputy Morgan, in this instance we are talking about a regeneration programme specifically drawn up by a local authority.  It is not a question of planning around the country, although I appreciate his comments.There is a problem with the regeneration of dockland areas in the State.  There are very onerous obligations imposed under the Seveso directive and it is important that those obligations are complied with.  They amount to a substantial disincentive for the regeneration of these areas and the relief is designed to address that issue.I ask Deputy Bruton to bear with me for a moment.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	691	Deputies will appreciate that I am somewhat slow in responding, as I am not briefed for Committee Stage.
#KieranODonnell	unknown-#KieranODonnell-party	unknown-#KieranODonnell-dob	unknown-#KieranODonnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	692	I will make allowances for that.  This section deals with Seveso sites in urban dockland areas which are subject to local area plans.  It does not provide for Seveso sites which are located in non-urban dockland areas.  That strikes me as anti-competitive.  If an operation is required to relocate from a Seveso site in an area other than docklands, it should be given the same tax breaks.  That is the essential point being put across in the correspondence we are receiving on the matter.  I would like to hear the Minister's opinion of this straightforward point.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	693	The purpose of the scheme is urban regeneration.  There is no requirement in respect of non-urban regeneration.  Section 380W states clearly that where the allowance under the sections has been made to any person in respect of expenditure incurred on the provision of machinery or plant or the construction of a building or structure that was sold by the person without the machinery, building or structure having been used for the purpose of the relevant trade within two years from the date on which it began to be so used, then the allowance under those sections will be withdrawn and all such additional assessments and adjustments will be made.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	694	The restrictions to which the Minister adverts mean that if greater capacity is created than the original or if the plant is not used within two years, the relief will be restricted.  However, there is no way in which these provisions could be interpreted as dealing with a concern that some sites are being ring-fenced as qualifying for this relief while other similar sites are not.  I do not see how an unfair competition element is built into either of the clauses to which the Minister drew my attention.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	695	I ask the Minister about section 380R(6), which provides that the market value of the whole or part of establishment land means the price that whole or part might reasonably be expected to fetch on a sale on the open market if the old installation was removed.  In the context of current market values, what exactly does that mean?  What values and dates are we considering?  Some of these developments changed hands at the height of the property bubble and their value could reasonably be expected to be considerably lower.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	696	On the issue of competition which Deputy Bruton raised, the allowances available under the scheme are limited to the net cost of the removal and relocation.  This means the benefits from the sale of the land where the industrial facilities were previously located will be deducted.  The allowance granted will also be adjusted in the case of productivity gains which may occur when a company constructs a more efficient facility.  That is the reason for the sections to which the Deputy referred.The additional capital allowances for the purchase of new plant and machinery and buildings will be clawed back if they are sold within the two year period.  All that is permitted is the replication of the existing facility without any undue advantage to the person making the relocation.  Nothing more than that is permitted under the relief.  The reason for these provisions is to ensure there is no prejudice against competing providers.  The clawbacks and the provisions to net off the benefits from the sale of the land of the initial site ensures that the scheme will be fair and reasonable in only meeting costs necessitated by the removal and relocation of Seveso listed industrial facilities which are hindering the regeneration of an urban dockland area.  That is essential in order to comply with EU requirements.  In respect of market value, the adjustment is the actual sale price when sold in this context.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	697	What are the relevant dates?  Can they be carried back to when the property market was at its height or are these values carried forward?  It seems obvious that some of the competition issues discussed earlier would arise in lands which are less valuable because they are not in, for example, Dublin 4 or the south Cork docklands.  The enhanced market values would be very important in this case.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	698	The relevant expenses that attract capital allowances include both the removal of the old installation and the set up of its replacement.  There are two elements.  If one does not have this relief, one does not get relief on either element.  The Minister stated that the removal is a necessary additional cost.  The logic of what he said is that he would restrict the relief to the removal element and would not therefore be offering a competitive advantage.  At least in terms of a level playing field, it would seem that confining the relief to the removal element and not allowing it on the new investment would be a fairer way of proceeding.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	699	Market value is based on the date when the relocation starts but the final adjustment is made by reference to the actual sale price of the lands.  It is the actual market price rather than a notion of past market values.

In other words, a notional value is fixed at the start of the relocation but an adjustment is made by reference to the actual sale price agreed.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	707	That is fine.  Let us tease out Deputy Burton's question first.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	708	I will make it easier for the Minister.  What extent of backdating is included in this provision?  How far back does it go in regard to acquisitions?  Does it simply provide for future deals and, if so, how are the market values dated and what is the composition of those values?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	709	On that issue, it is prospective in effect.  It is subject to the existence of an urban regeneration plan developed by the relevant local authority.  The market values will be determined when the relief is claimed and the relocation is made.  The final payment represents the actual market value for the lands in question.  Past market values are irrelevant to the measure.
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	710	Land involved in Seveso type activities may have changed hands several times or a canny developer may have passed it through several companies.  It may well be that two years ago the value of this dockland site was potentially very high.  Some time later, such as now and into the future, the market value, as I understand it, will have plummeted.  How is market value categorised?  Is it open market value or fair price at the date or going forward?  Is it fair price at arm's length between a willing buyer and seller as determined by an independent arbitrator?  Is it a built-up market value?  If we go back to market values of some years ago, they would be far higher.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	711	As Deputy Burton knows, the market value is always what a willing purchaser will give a willing vendor in an open market.  This must be determined.  In this context it is not a matter of going back to past values.  This is a prospective relief and the market value is fixed by reference to what value is attached at the time of the relocation.  There is provision for an adjustment where the market price diverges from that.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	712	I am anxious to let Deputy Bruton in at this stage.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	713	I raise the point that if the Minister was——
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	714	I was going to reply on the matter.  It is clear we have restricted the legislation with regard to any suggestion of a productivity gain by the relocating enterprise, any suggestion of an additional benefit from the sale of lands and also in the non-use of the new facilities.  We have attempted to deal with those matters.
#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	715	Before calling the Deputy, I indicate we should make progress on this issue as there are only approximately 35 minutes left to deal with all other amendments.  I know Deputies are anxious to make progress.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	716	I will leave it at one point.  If we are seeking to provide some assistance to the cost of moving out of an urban dockland, the relief should be confined to the cost of moving from the urban dockland rather than, as this section seeks, include the cost of the establishment in the new location.  If the cost of establishing the new location is grant-aided, an uneven playing pitch is being created for others with similar facilities.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	717	I do not understand how one could incentivise the removal without giving the person providing the service the incentive to replace it with a facility that was of no greater advantage to the enterprise than the pre-existing facility.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	718	I move amendment No. 25:
In page 63, line 10, to delete "23 per cent" and substitute "22 per cent".The Minister stated very clearly on Committee Stage that he sought to introduce uniformity in the taxation of certain transactions such as capital acquisitions and capital gains.  He seemed to lose his way when it came to the treatment of deposit interest retention tax, DIRT, when he applied a 23% rate rather than a 22% rate.  I hoped to give him the opportunity on Report Stage to mend this error that he overlooked.It has been indicated to me that there is an unfair aspect of DIRT in that banks do not provide people with a statement of their deposit interest retention tax, which would give them the opportunity to claim it back.  Should there be a legal provision requiring the banks to give a statement?  Older people are entirely entitled to claim relief if they are not in a taxable position and such a statement would inform them of the tax they pay in deposit interest and would prompt them with the opportunity to claim it back.

The 3% increase as provided for in section 26 was necessitated by general budgetary constraints.  I was influenced by the fact that general levels of deposits in banks are very high currently.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	721	Interest rates are very low.  Does the Minister care to comment on the point of requiring banks to issue a certificate?

In page 76, to delete lines 6 to 20 and substitute the following:"‘Threshold amount' means a baseline of zero spending on research and development as and from the start of the tax year 2009;',".Since we debated this I received comments from the taxation division on the possible costs.  This related to research and development going back to a baseline of zero.  I am not disposed to withdraw the amendment so may I have clarification from the Minister about his intentions regarding other published or discussed concessions relating to research and development, which we hear is part of the Government's economic recovery strategy?  Are these additional concessions and will we have occasion to debate them?  Are these the concessions being talked of when the Minister says he will have a research and development package?
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	727	The fiscal elements of the package are contained in the Finance Bill before the House currently, other than those regarding intellectual property.

#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	729	I move amendment No. 30:
In page 100, line 14, after "2008" to insert the following:"except in the case of disposals arising from compulsory purchase orders, it shall apply to disposals, on which the order was confirmed on or after 15th October".This amendment, which we did not have the opportunity to discuss on Committee Stage, deals with the capital gains tax threshold, which has been increased from 20% to 22%.  The difficulty arises with regard to lands that were the subject of a compulsory purchase order during the periods in question.  With one example in Ballaghaderreen in my constituency, An Bord Pleanála confirmed the compulsory purchase order on 26 September.  As a result of the way the legislation is currently written, it will be liable for the higher rate of capital gains tax.In light of the fact that the Department of Finance must provide the funds in the first place to allow for the higher rate of capital gains tax because the compensation must include the tax element, it makes sense to accept this amendment.  In the first instance, this means the Department of Finance pays compensation — and the related tax — at the lower rate.  It also means the land owners in question are not liable to the higher rate of tax.There is no financial benefit in this issue.  The amendment facilitates streamlining the proposal for everybody involved.  There will be an additional cost on the Department of Finance in furnishing the funds in the first instance before having to recoup them through capital gains tax.  There would be net saving to the Exchequer so I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	730	The general principle, as has always been the practice, is contained in section 542 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 where the compulsory purchase order was confirmed before 15 October but the local authority had not agreed compensation with the owner of the land or entered on the land by that date.  That is the case identified.The general principle, as set out in section 542 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997, has always been clear.  The time of disposal of land acquired under a compulsory purchase order is either the date when the compensation is agreed or the time when the local authority enters on the land, whichever is earlier.  However, where a disposal of farm land is made under a compulsory purchase order for road building or road widening, the CGT liability will not arise until the year of assessment in which the compensation in received.  I do not consider that one can have an exception in the rate of tax applicable to disposal on or after 15 October 2008, notwithstanding the Deputy's generous suggestion.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	731	The Minister has highlighted another problem in that the CGT liability will be paid at the higher rate for landowners or farmers who are paid subsequent to the date of the legislation's introduction.  Therefore, where CPOs were agreed a considerable time ago, the compensation has also been agreed but because of delays, due sometimes to the incompetency of the National Roads Authority, farmers will be liable to a higher rate of tax even though the compensation was agreed at the lower rate.  Will that have to be revised due to cost implications for the Department of Finance?  Surely it would make sense for everyone if it kicked in at the lower rate.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	732	Under the arrangement, the landowner who happens to be a farmer is at an advantage in that there is no obligation to pay the CGT when the land is taken.  In that sense, there is an extension of a facility to that landowner as against any other class of landowner in the interim period.
#DenisNaughten	unknown-#DenisNaughten-party	unknown-#DenisNaughten-dob	unknown-#DenisNaughten-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	733	But at the higher rate.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	734	No.  It is an entire liability which is deferred under the operation of this section.  The fact that the rate increased this year means it is at the higher rate, which can happen in any financial legislation.  The fundamental point is that the landowner who happens to be a farmer can defer his liability under this section.  I am advised that the rate of tax does not affect the amount of compensation.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	738	I move amendment No. 34:
In page 116, line 30, to delete "33" and substitute "20".On Committee Stage, we discussed this amendment which concerns the concession on VRT to people in the rent-a-car industry.  The concern is that the Minister is moving rapidly to withdraw a concession that was designed to promote low-cost access for tourism.  In the past, it was deemed to be an important element of the attraction package for the tourism sector.  The case against it was not well made by the Minister.  On Committee Stage, he indicated he felt the provision was being widely abused.  I do not know whether the Minister has had occasion to give the section any further thought having no doubt received further representations on the matter from the industry.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	739	I support this amendment on the basis that it would benefit the tourism sector, which I appreciate is a very important one and is most affected by this measure.  In addition, many people who do not need to own cars would be happy to hire them if they were more reasonably priced.  That would have a major benefit for CO2 emissions.  The amendment goes beyond the tourism sector in that regard, so I strongly support it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	740	The Finance Act 1993 introduced a VRT repayment system for the short-term car hire sector — that is, cars hired on contracts for 35 days or less.  The purpose of the scheme was to address shortages in the supply of cars for hire within the tourism industry at that time.  The effect of the repayment scheme is that a car is effectively free of VRT for the period it remains in the car hire fleet.Arising from Revenue audits, especially in 2007 and 2008, there is strong evidence that the sector has manipulated contracts to ensure that cars used for the provision of services, which were not originally envisaged under the scheme, nonetheless benefit from the VRT relief available.  In addition, operators have applied the scheme to cars for use outside the tourism area, including enabling corporate clients to provide a pool of cars to visiting executives or to their own staff, and also allowing VRT-free driving by Irish citizens who hire rather than own a car, while their neighbours who own cars have to pay VRT.The scheme was amended by section 80 of the Finance Act 2008 to try to limit such abuses.  However, the sector raised objections and concerns.  The scheme, especially following amendment, necessarily imposes a considerable administrative burden on individual firms, and on Revenue, to ensure that the conditions for the VRT refund are being met and that the scheme is not being abused.  A number of meetings were held between Revenue and the sector.It has been complained that the scheme, if operated correctly, is complex to administer.  It was also argued that it not only restricts normal competitiveness between firms, but limits the potential to grow the car rental market outside the tourism sector to other longer term rentals.  Some operators have made the point that to continue to qualify for the relief on cars actually used in the provision of cars to tourists, as the scheme intends, they would have to maintain two separate vehicle fleets — one for hire to tourists and another for the domestic market — and this would be uneconomical and unworkable in practice.Easing further the terms of the scheme, while widening its availability, would not cover everyone currently availing of the scheme, legitimately or otherwise, nor would it significantly reduce the growing administrative burdens.  It would also effectively remove any distinction between short and long-term car hire.The cost effectiveness of the relief is now questionable, as rental prices in Ireland are quite low compared to equivalent prices in other EU member states.  In addition, the increasing use of the scheme to support a range of business models, which have little to do with tourism, would indicate that the current supply of vehicles required for the tourist industry in the State more than meets current demand and the excess is therefore being put to other non-tourist related uses.Given that the scheme is prone to abuse, and the considerable necessary administrative burdens imposed on both Revenue and operators to ensure that the conditions for the VRT refund are being met and that the scheme is not being abused, a decision to phase out the scheme has been taken.  I see this as a balanced response to the issues of short-term car-hire repayments.The retention of existing repayment provisions for 2009 recognises the difficulties being experienced by the car sector generally at present.  It also affords the sector further time to make considerable savings on VRT liabilities by switching more of the rental fleet to lower CO2-emitting vehicles in 2009.  Abolition of the scheme will remove existing restrictions and allow operators to develop their business models based on the domestic rental market.While some firms in the sector may resist the phasing out of the scheme, other operators have indicated that they would prefer abolition of the scheme, rather than having its use restricted, as a consequence of which some business models would qualify under the scheme while others would not.I see no need for an adjustment to the phasing provisions included in the Bill, hence I cannot accept the amendment.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	20366	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	745	This amendment deals with the increase in VAT.  There is a general sense that this was not the most appropriate move to make at present.  It may serve to depress the market, particularly at the present time with Border trade suffering acutely.  The gap has widened between the UK's rate, which has decreased to 15%, and the rate that applies in Ireland.  It was not the best move in the budget and seems to be causing problems for traders, particularly those on the Border.  There appears to be a sharp fall in retail trade, which may be making matters worse.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	746	Increasing the VAT rate in the budget was a disaster and had a considerable psychological blow.  It is unfortunate in terms of revenue income that the British sought to reduce their VAT rate by 2.5% effectively at or about the same time.  The impact was significant.  I will not share any more of the incidents from Newry car parks or precincts with the House because the media had a particular interest in those episodes the last time.  We will stick with the VAT issue.Even a marginal reduction would have had a significant positive impact as opposed to the increase's negative impact.  I regard it as ham-fisted and unnecessary.  We should be seeking to stimulate the economy and encourage people to get back into spending mode, but the opposite is occurring.  Consumption rates are decreasing across all indices.The increase was wrong because VAT has a disproportionate effect on low income families.  For this reason alone, it should not have been increased.  Many household goods that those families would seek to purchase have been affected.  The additional annual cost to them is approximately €500.  Instead of increasing the rate, will the Minister consider reducing it at this late stage?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	747	When the Minister sat down at the conclusion of his Budget Statement six weeks ago, the Fianna Fáil, Green Party and Progressive Democrats Members rose to give a standing ovation to a budget that unravelled faster than knitting.  Of all the disastrous aspects of the budget, aspects that have not just been unlucky for the Minister, the Government and his party, but also for traders and businesses across the country, the decision to raise the VAT rate by half a point has left unbelievable misfortune in its wake.The Minister's argument, to which there is some point, is that the vast wedge between prices North and South is being driven by the failure of importers, British multiples and others to pass on the reductions in the value of sterling.  Nonetheless, the psychological hammer blow was struck by his foolish decision to increase the VAT rate from an already high 21% to 21.5%.Currently in the Chamber there are five Members, not including the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, four departmental officials and a number of other officials.  I remember the benches opposite being full of people screaming about the budget's wonders.  It followed the Minister's call for patriotism.  Is there not a Chinese curse to the effect that one should be careful what one wishes for?  For a long time, many of us have wanted an all-Ireland economy, following on the patriotic tones of Wolfe Tone and others.  We now have that economy, but it is like West Germany after the fall of the wall, in that those in West Germany needed to pay for reintegration.The Minister has driven shoppers in their tens of thousands north of the Border.  Traditionally, people within 20 miles of the Border have shopped on whichever side of it the advantage lay.  Perhaps the standing ovation was for this.  The Green Party Members would possibly have disapproved on the grounds that driving trade north would lead to greater emissions, unless people were driving hybrid cars.  However, the Fianna Fáil and Green Party backbenchers jumped up and applauded until the Minister's ears rang.  It has been the single most disastrous policy in a disastrous budget that also included attacks on the elderly and schools.A Spanish curse tells people to ask of God what they want, but to then pay.  The Minister is paying.  It is the 11th hour and only 15 minutes remain until the end of the debate on the Finance Bill.  The Minister should withdraw it.  While that would not produce a significant immediate change, it would signal that the Government is recovering some element of economic sense.  While it would cost the State, it is replaceable by other revenue-raising amendments.  The Minster applied a levy that could not be called income tax and he increased VAT so that he could say that he had not increased income tax.It is a disaster.  The Minister has an opportunity in the 11 minutes remaining for an 11th hour convention and to withdraw the measure.  I strongly suggest that he do so in the interests of trying to restore some sense of financial rationale to the budget.

He introduced it for the month of December, but the increase of 0.5% will drive down the tax yield.  Representatives of the small business sector appeared before the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service yesterday.  The sector is struggling to make ends meet.  December has been a rough time for it, as the numbers shopping are decreasing.  People are conscious of the extra 0.5% in VAT and are going North.  The Minister expects traders to adjust everything in the middle of the November-December VAT period because of 0.5%.The measure is impractical and will drive down revenue for the month of December.  The decision should be reversed.  Last Thursday, the Minister assured the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service and the House that a report on the impact of the VAT changes in the South and the North has been drafted by his officials.  While we wish for the North to do well, we must be competitive and consider our businesses and jobs on this side of the Border.  The Minister's measure will lead to a reduction in taxes and job losses.  These are the practicalities.When will the report be ready?  It will hardly be ready before 7 o'clock so that we can make the changes.  This is an impractical measure.  It will not deliver any additional taxes and will instead result in job losses.

Officials from Revenue and the CSO met yesterday to consider how best this task can be undertaken.  The difficulties involved in trying to accurately estimate the extent of increased cross-Border shopping and the resulting direct cost to the Exchequer from increased levels thereof should not be underestimated.  As already stated, there are factors other than taxation differentials at play, most notably the euro-sterling position.  The position in respect of the 0.5% is that it is an estimated yield of €227 million in a full year.Deputy Burton seems to entertain a number of extraordinary economic theories, one of which is that one of my predecessors as Minister for Finance, Charlie McCreevy, is singularly responsible for the collapse in world stock prices.

I never appealed to people's sense of patriotism in order to encourage them to shop at home.  However, I have stated that if they shop at home, they will support their local economy and tax base.  I have never made any secret of that.  The euro-sterling differential is the major factor responsible for the shopping crusade to Northern Ireland.  A second factor, which Deputy Burton acknowledged, is the variable pricing policies employed by the UK multiples.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	755	I was not particularly upset by Government backbenchers applauding the Minister on budget day.  The response of the backbenchers opposite reminded me of what used to happen on Hughie Green's programme "Opportunity Knocks" — which the Minister may be too young to remember — when someone at the front of the audience would hold up a sign proclaiming "Clap now", "Cry now" or "Laugh now".  I did not find the response of the Government backbenchers on budget day at all enthusiastic.I am of the view that it would be more patriotic to develop good public policy in order to assist families on lower incomes and those who need help most.  While substantial numbers of shoppers continue to travel north, traditional traders in the North are not really enjoying the benefits of what is happening because their regular customers cannot get to their shops as a result of the traffic from the South.  I am sure the major British retailers are enjoying what is happening because it is they who are really benefiting.The Minister estimated that the loss to the Exchequer will be of the order of €227 million in a full year.  I am of the view that this figure understates the position.  The Department of Finance has not been entirely accurate in the context of projections it has made in recent times.  We must, before it is too late, consider what happened.  There is still time to turn matters around, particularly for those low income families who can least afford to be affected.  Perhaps the Minister will reconsider the position.

#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	762	I move amendment No. 42:
In page 136, between lines 24 and 25, to insert the following:"92.—The annual charge for the bank guarantee shall be brought within the scope of published exchequer accounts and budget forecasts and shall be earmarked as a contingency fund for 2010.".The annual charge for the bank guarantee is €1 billion — calculated at €100 million per annum for ten years — and payable in instalments over a two-year period.  The amendment suggests that this should come within the scope of published Exchequer accounts because it will otherwise be floated out as a fund until 2010.  If it is not called upon, it will then revert to the Exchequer.  While I do not want to attribute any bad intentions to the Minister, if the fund comes to the benefit of the Exchequer after 2010, it would make a nice pot of money for distribution as we move towards a general election at that time.  We may, of course, have a general election before then.Events have shown that, in respect of the fund, the banks got off extraordinarily lightly.  The fund is simply payable by way of the provision of monetary amounts and there is no provision for an additional gain to the taxpayer for this extraordinary guarantee which, in the case of some banks, may need to be called upon.  Subsequent to the publication of the scheme, the Minister altered the terms in order that the banks will not be obliged to support each other in the first instance.  The calls will be on the State guarantee provided on the basis of taxpayers' money.  The amendment will clarify the position in respect of the fund, which could otherwise be used to gain a political advantage by the parties in government.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	763	In light of our current fiscal and budgetary position, it would be useful to have this sum at my disposal.  I am not sure it would be any more useful to have it at my disposal at the end of 2010.  The position is that the sums are credited to a designated account maintained by the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland as a reserve for any payments to be made under the scheme.  The sum remaining in the account on 30 September 2010 will then be paid to the Exchequer.  In the financial year of 2010, it will become a benefit to the Exchequer.  I am not sure there is any great difference, in fiscal terms, in allocating approximately €500 million to the Central Fund in 2009 and a similar or slightly greater sum in 2010 or paying it in one lump sum.The previous Dáil was dissolved in 2007.  In the normal course of events, I would not anticipate a dissolution of this Dáil until 2012.  In such circumstances, I fail to see the relevance of the amendment.Deputy Burton made a serious point with regard to the guarantee being called upon.  There has been no suggestion that the guarantee will be called upon.  The only circumstances in which it could be called upon would be where there was a run of deposits on Irish financial institutions.  There has been no evidence whatever of the latter since the guarantee was provided.  With the important task of capitalisation under way, the guarantee has given us time to assess the actual deficiencies in the loan books of the banks.  The figure identified by the Government in respect of that capitalisation will give us the opportunity to reduce the exposure of the State on foot of the guarantee by ensuring that the capital base of the financial institutions is sound.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	771	I thank the Labour Party and Sinn Féin for bringing this important motion before the House, which Fine Gael supports.Homelessness in 21st century Ireland has taken on a whole new meaning and reality for a broad-based spectrum of people who are falling victim to the current economic crisis.  We are seeing a new threat of homelessness generated by house repossessions.  The social wreckage that has been caused by the giving of loans to people who cannot afford to repay them is impacting on the rapidly rising homeless figures.According to the Financial Regulator almost 14,000 mortgages were more than three months in arrears at the end of June this year.  That figure represents 1.4% of residential mortgages and is up from the end of December 2006, when 11,252 mortgages or 1.2% of all mortgages were in arrears.  Figures for repossessions by court order show that there was a total of 128 repossessions between January 2005 and June 2008.The Labour Party is calling for a new code of practice for financial institutions to provide for a moratorium on repossession orders for family homes during the current recession.  I support such a move.  I called on the Government in an Adjournment motion last month to introduce mortgage rescue schemes similar to those already in operation in many European Union countries.The rising number of homeless people will impact adversely on the inadequate Government provision of social housing, with the numbers on the waiting lists rising from 43,000 in 2005 to in excess of 56,000 at the end of March this year.  It is disturbing to think there are also 5,000 plus people experiencing homelessness in this country currently, of which a shockingly high proportion are children.  Within a quarter of a mile of the Houses of the Oireachtas one can see homeless people sleeping in doorways and alleys.  That is a grave indictment of the Government's housing policy and an indication of the imperative need to address the problem.The situation arises at a time when the traditional support systems are under severe financial pressure, due to the economic downturn and Government cutbacks.  The Society of St. Vincent de Paul, which has been the bedrock of aid and support, has said this week that several of its branches, particularly in urban areas, are running out of money.The Simon Community has warned that its services are operating at full capacity and that it urgently needs more support as homelessness is due to rise.  Origins of home ownership in Ireland date back to the rural land reforms of the early 20th century and the policy of tenant purchase of local authority housing, which emerged from reform precedents and led to a long tradition of grant giving.  Fiscal supports for owner occupation have also played an important role in the development of housing policy.  Housing rights, as defined at UN level, include the right to affordable housing, but personal or household costs should not threaten or compromise the attainment or satisfaction of other basic needs.Rights to adequate housing should be in tandem with a location which allows access to employment, health care, schools, child care and other social facilities.  The Council of Europe is creating a precise definition of affordable housing rights in accordance with Article 31 of the revised social charter — although the Government has refused to ratify this article.  We are, unfortunately, dealing with a Government that lacks credibility, whose policies have failed to deliver for those most in need — and its housing policy has been high on aspiration and spin, with no delivery.  A Government that cannot provide housing for its citizens, which is the most basic of human needs and rights, looks to others to do it.  The social partnership agreement, Towards 2016, endorsed the principles set out in Building Sustainable Communities.  It envisaged that through the provision of social and affordable housing, the housing needs of 60,000 households would be met between 2007-09, according to the Irish Council for Social Housing.  This is just another useless aspiration, an empty promise from the Fianna Fáil-Green Party Government, and the way it has behaved since the last general election is scandalous.  It promised plenty and has delivered little.Due to the last housing boom, developers had a free hand, literally, throwing up houses wherever they could without providing the necessary facilities, which of course were promised but never delivered.  There are currently 300 recorded unfinished estates in the country, which are long past their completion dates and by no means up to taking-in-charge standards.The Minister of State has failed to address the excessive enforcement period, which under section 180 of the Planning and Development Act 2000 provides for a seven year check to ensure developers have completed an estate to the required standard.  This is totally ridiculous, working as it does in the interest of the developer, against the owner occupiers.The Office of the Director of Corporate Enforcement published guidelines on management companies today, but unfortunately it does not offer much in the way of positive help to apartment holders who fall victim to such companies.  What is needed is legislation to copperfasten suggestions as outlined in these guidelines, but where is it?  My colleague, Deputy Terence Flanagan, has asked on numerous occasions when such legislation will come before the House.  On each occasion he was assured it was being drafted, but it is still no further on, today.  Unless it is being produced to the standard of a work of art or Celtic treasure, surely the Minister of State will agree that the drafting process is going on for an unduly long time.  The losers are the apartment owners who are being ripped off by both the Government and the management companies, which are being allowed to get away with blatant extortion.  The Minister of State should end the delay and bring the property services regulatory authority Bill before the House directly after the Christmas recess.  That is why I believe we should come back one week earlier to introduce this and other pending legislation.  The long break in the month of January is scandalous when the country is in crisis and on its knees.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	773	An alternative viewpoint to the emphasis on home ownership asserts that by taking a comprehensive view of the rental as well as the ownership occupation markets, a strong case could be made for new affordable housing initiatives being directed in equal measure and perhaps even primarily at the rental sector.  I would also support the acceleration of social and affordable housing, although this as such was axed by the Minister for Finance in the 2009 budget and lumped into the Government equity initiative about which we have heard absolutely nothing further — fine words but no follow-on, as usual.  This has been the policy of the Government over the past 12 months — negligence to our community.The association of affordability and the rental sector needs to be examined and plans made to open up the concept to other interpretations, to offer some hope for those seeking access to realistic accommodation.  We must look to the rental option, which despite the historical emphasis on ownership, may be the answer to the local authority lists, which are growing in every county as we speak.

Deputy Lynch might pass to the leader of the Labour Party that he should, perhaps, exert some control over his councillors so that they actually practise what Labour is preaching here in the Dáil.Several Deputies have referred during the course of the debate to the need to regulate apartment management agents and mediate between agents and apartment owners.As set out in the counter motion tabled by the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, the Government is committed to bringing forward legislative proposals in response to the Law Reform Commission's report on multi-unit developments.  The Government's legislation programme for the current Dáil session, published in September, listed two important items of legislation for regulating this area.  The property services regulatory authority Bill will establish a regulatory authority on a statutory basis.  Its primary task will be to operate a licensing system for auctioneers, estate agents and property management agents and to improve standards in the provision of property services by licensees.The authority will specify and enforce qualification requirements for licences, including levels of education, training and experience and other requirements such as minimum levels of professional indemnity insurance.  The authority will establish and operate a system for investigating and adjudicating on complaints against property service providers.  In this context, the legislation will refer to the possibility of resolving disputes by mediation between the parties concerned.  With a view to improving client protection and ensuring clarity with regard to the services being provided by a licensee, the legislation will require that property services agreements be entered into between service providers and their clients.  Such agreements will specify the services to be provided, fees payable by the client, details of redress procedures etc.In the planning area, the Law Reform Commission made a number of recommendations in its consultation paper issued in late 2006.  It recommended a review by planning authorities and the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government of planning and housing policy relating to multi-unit developments.  It identified issues relating to the physical nature of such developments, such as their size, configuration, facilities and location.  In particular, the commission considered that in the past far too many multi-unit developments had not been built to suit families, which was undesirable in terms of sustainability.  The commission also recommended that guidelines should be issued on the taking in charge of estates.I am aware that in its final report the commission commended the progress made by the Minister and his Department on these matters, noting that in the period since the publication of the consultation paper, the Minister has published a suite of planning guidelines focused on planning and a sustainable built environment.  These include, in particular, Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Design Standards for New Apartments, published in September 2007.  These promote successful apartment living for individuals and families, by responding to people's reasonable demand for well-designed apartments, particularly in terms of better internal space standards, including storage areas.I understand also that the Minister has finalised and will shortly publish Guidelines for Planning Authorities on Sustainable Residential Development in Urban Areas, which is accompanied by a best practice urban design manual.  These guidelines will promote high quality living standards in new residential developments, encourage higher density developments at appropriate locations, such as those with access to public transport, and emphasise that new residential development must be integrated with facilities and services for the new community and promote energy efficiency.  In addition, the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government published comprehensive guidance on the taking in charge of residential developments and management arrangements in February 2008.In its final report the commission stated that it considered these guidelines to planning authorities should have the status of policy directives.  While I understand that the Minister does not agree that directives are appropriate, as guidelines of their nature allow a degree of latitude and discretion in their application, consideration will be given to including a provision in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill to replace the current requirement that planning authorities should "have regard to" ministerial guidelines with a stronger provision which would require them to adhere to or substantially comply with such guidelines.  This amendment will have the effect of substantially implementing the commission's recommendation.In its final report the commission also recommended that the wording of section 180(6) of the Planning and Development Act 2000, which allows occupiers as well as unit owners to vote on the question of taking in charge of a multi-unit development, be reconsidered in light of the practical difficulties pertaining to the current wording.  I welcome the fact that such an amendment is being considered in the Planning and Development (Amendment) Bill, and also welcome the full range of actions being taken by Government in this important area.

There are many aspects of the housing issue on which we could focus, but I would like to refer to the area of private rented accommodation.My area, the South Dublin County Council area, was one of the areas used to pilot the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which has proven very successful.  I meet constituents with housing requirements on a regular basis and the scheme is proving popular with them.  When the scheme was launched initially, there was much scepticism as to how effective it would be.  However, the beneficiaries of the scheme hold it in high regard and it has proved an effective means of providing residential accommodation.One of the issues raised last night concerned the standard and inspections of rental accommodation.  Last night many Deputies called on the Government to enforce and improve standards in the private rented sector, but many of the comments made were inaccurate.  I would like to set the record straight on some of those issues.In the partnership agreement, Towards 2016, the Government committed to updating and effectively enforcing minimum standards regulations for rented housing.  Updating these standards is a core component of the housing policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, and the Government recently delivered on this commitment by approving a package of measures to update the standards regulations.It is important that these regulations reflect the requirements of the modern rental sector and general quality-of-life improvements over the past number of years.  With this in mind, and as part of the overall package of measures approved by Government, new regulations entitled the Housing (Standards for Rented Houses) Regulations 2008, under section 18 of the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 1992 were made recently.  These will come into effect on 1 February next year, with certain provisions not coming into effect until 2013.All landlords have a legal obligation to ensure that their rented properties comply with the standards regulations.  Responsibility for enforcing the regulations rests with the relevant local authority, supported by a dedicated stream of funding allocated by the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.  The resources allocated by the Department to assist local authorities in their statutory functions in enforcing standards are significant.  Over €9 million has been provided to local authorities for this purpose since 2004.Funding for inspections, which is paid from the proceeds of tenancy registration fees, has more than doubled since 2005 when €1.5 million was disbursed.  In the current year, 2008, some €4 million has been allocated for this purpose.  Increasingly this funding is being related to inspection performance, effectively rewarding those authorities that are most vigorous in their approach to inspections, and the trend towards performance-related funding will continue.However, it is not just a matter of increasing funding and hoping that, of itself, will solve the problem.  The increased funding is having a significant impact on the number of inspections carried out by local authorities.  For example, in 2005 local authorities carried out a total of 6,800 inspections.  The following year, 2006, that figure rose to 9,800, an increase of 44%.  In 2007, over 14,000 inspections of rental accommodation were carried out by local authorities, an increase of 42% on the figure for the previous year.

Each year there was a 40% plus increase since the previous year.  Clearly, the enforcement regime stepped up to the plate in terms of co-ordination and effectiveness.This will continue to be the case once the new regulations have commenced.  There is no doubt that effective enforcement of the new regulations will be the key to their success.  I welcome the fact that local authorities will be encouraged to focus their inspection efforts on properties most likely not to be in compliance with the minimum standards, rather than inspecting new properties that are less likely to be in breach of the regulations, focusing the glare of the inspection regime where it is needed most.  This is important.I gave the figures, but Deputy Lynch disputes them.

It is important to point out that standards are already improving in this context.  We should be heartened to note that the rate of non-compliance with the existing regulations among those properties targeted for inspection has decreased.  Whether we agree or disagree on the figures the rate of inspections has risen substantially and it is important to note that with regard to those properties targeted for inspection for non-compliance, the rate of non-compliance has decreased significantly, to 16% of the properties  inspected in 2007, compared to over 30% for non-compliance two years earlier in 2005.  The rate of inspection has increased substantially and the rate of non-compliance has halved during the period.  I will conclude as my time is up.

It is important to bring attention to the challenges that face us with regard to housing.The motion points out, rightly, that there are important issues to address in respect of housing policy in Ireland.  The broad range of changes we have seen in housing, social housing and policy over the past ten years have been, in general, positive.  By way of circular letter and changes in legislation, we have seen a move away from the very large local authority housing estates that characterised housing policy in the 1970s, up to the late 1980s and early 1990s.  There has been a move away from the very strong segregation of private and public housing.  I look back on some of the schemes that were built over the past ten or 15 years and see that there has been a quantum change and improvement in the quality of housing on offer.  When one considers that, and puts it together with the improvements in building performance in respect of energy performance brought in by my colleague, the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, Deputy John Gormley, we can see the bar is set much higher today than it was in years past.  In housing provision the emphasis must be on quality as well as quantity.It is important to applaud the successes of the voluntary housing agencies that have been at work.  They moved in to play a central role in the provision of housing construction and management.  In many respects that is a positive situation.  One can look at the record of local authorities, particularly one such as Dublin City Council over the years.  It has been one of the largest, if not the largest, landlords in the State.  It has had a chequered record in management and maintenance of its own housing stock.  The addition of the voluntary and social housing agencies that play a very valuable role has been an important one.  That role is set to continue.In my area of Dún Laoghaire-Rathdown, I note very significant new housing developments that will be under the control of the National Association of Building Co-operatives and other agencies involved in housing construction.  This is a positive role.The targets were set quite high in the national development plan but we are not far off them.  Last year, in Towards 2016, we had a record 9,000 social housing starts.  That is not bad.  We could do a lot better but it is a step in the right direction.

The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, clearly showed the extent to which the Government has demonstrated its commitment to tackling homelessness.  It set itself a target of ending long-term occupation of emergency accommodation and the need to sleep rough.  This commitment is clearly shown by the fact that, despite the most difficult budgetary situation in decades, we are increasing the funding for homeless accommodation by 5% to over €62 million in 2009.Some Opposition Deputies claimed that 5,000 people will be on the streets this winter.  This is wrong and I do not know whose interest they are trying to serve by exaggerating the figures for homelessness.  The 2008 housing needs assessment, the most reliable and accurate means by which national housing need is measured, identified 1,394 homeless households that had applied for, and been considered eligible, for social housing support.  That is a decrease of 30% on the last assessment in 2005.The needs assessment does not capture all homeless people, only those who have applied for social housing.  The Count It In report launched by the Minister last Monday provides a very comprehensive method of measuring general homelessness.  It indicates that homelessness in Dublin has not changed significantly since 2005.  There has been a small decrease relative to population growth.  This did not stop Deputy Ó Snodaigh from coming out with his gem, namely, that the number of homeless people is growing by 1,800 every year or that there are 2,300 people on the streets of Dublin.
#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	812	That is right.

#AineBrady	unknown-#AineBrady-party	unknown-#AineBrady-dob	unknown-#AineBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	815	——provides a very refined and comprehensive method of measuring homelessness.  It indicates there were 110 sleeping rough, down 40% on the figure for 2005, and less than 5% of the figure used by Deputy Lynch.  Of course, this is 110 persons too many.  That is why Departments and agencies are working to eliminate the need to sleep rough and long-term homelessness.  Those are the key aims of the strategy on homelessness.  This blatant twisting of statistics does nothing to advance these aims.With regard to the overall net need figure published for the 2008 housing needs assessment, it is unclear how Deputies have managed to concoct the charge that we massaged figures when an increase of 30% in the number of households in need was reported.  Surely massaging the figures would have yielded a better result.As usual, the Labour Party and Sinn Féin, rather than engaging in a serious discussion on the issue, went straight to wild accusation.  Had the Deputy actually read the needs assessment guidelines given to local authorities——

In summary, those guidelines make clear that it is true that households that apply to a local authority for housing support which are already in local authority housing, are not included in the assessment.  These cases are called transfers.  The exception is those who apply for reasons of overcrowding or unfit accommodation.

The Deputy will also find an instruction to authorities to pay particular attention to capturing the housing needs of older people and those with a disability.It is in nobody's interest, least of all that of the Government, to misrepresent the number of households in need of housing support.  An accurate picture of need is our key tool in prioritising the very substantial resources the Government is making available.  The Minister of State has been very clear in identifying the challenges that lie ahead for housing and the broad range of measures he is putting in place to meet these challenges.  Once again this demonstrates the Government's commitment to meeting housing need.  It is to be hoped that in future debate on this issue of great importance to the Government the Opposition might offer more constructive participation, rather than making unsubstantiated and factually incorrect accusations.

Deputy Gilmore is very welcome.As my party colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, pointed out yesterday, the doomsday scenario being painted for mortgage holders is inaccurate and irresponsible when all logic suggests that early contact between a distressed lender — we all know them — and a borrower is the best way to avoid the trauma of repossession.  There are those who continue to raise the spectre of mass repossession, encouraging people to keep their heads in the sand and avoid the very engagement that could ease their troubles.  I sincerely hope that mortgage holders facing difficulties with their repayments pay less heed to that loose talk and take heart from the findings of the Financial Regulator on arrears and repossessions.I wish to put on record some of the facts on home repossessions.  Following a new examination of procedures for handling arrears and repossessions of properties, the Financial Regulator has confirmed that repossession is a very last resort for lenders, which should be welcomed across the House.  The study did find that in line with the requirements of the Irish Banking Federation code of practice on mortgage arrears, which is mandatory for the covered institutions benefiting from the State guarantees, lenders accept revised payment arrangements when a person is in financial difficulty and is willing to repay a mortgage.  The consumer director in the Office of the Financial Regulator has urged people to contact their mortgage providers as soon as they become aware they will experience difficulty in meeting their mortgage repayments, as if they do so it is unlikely the question of repossession will arise.The Financial Regulator has carried out research which bears out the effectiveness of arrangements adopted by mainstream lenders for dealing with mortgage arrears.  Out of a total of almost 1 million mortgage accounts, a total of 128 residential properties were repossessed in the three years to June last and of these 19 were investment properties.  Comparing 2007 to 2008 to date, there is no indication that the trend has accelerated significantly.Statistics from the Financial Regulator illustrate an increase in the number of people falling into arrears, which reflects the deterioration in economic and financial conditions.  Once again, however, the picture emerging from the regulator's research — that is, the one based on actual evidence — is that this is not the epidemic of loan difficulties some would have us believe exists.  According to the research, the number of mortgage accounts in arrears represents less than 1.5% of total residential mortgages.  Nevertheless, for the households experiencing those difficulties, this is evidently a traumatic time.  It is essential that we maintain our strong performance in this area and ensure best practice procedures are in place for dealing with mortgage arrears governing the activities of all lenders.As a Dublin-based Deputy, I welcome the fact the Minister of State responsible for housing has acted so promptly, meeting both the Financial Regulator and the Irish Banking Federation earlier this week to examine how the code of practice could be extended to the whole of the mortgage lending sector.  Progress on this is expected, I am told, in the new year.  This is a further demonstration which I am sure will be accepted across the House of the Government's close attention to and proactive engagement with this important issue.  Safeguarding the interests of households that experience difficulties in meeting their mortgage repayments owing to circumstances beyond their control can make a significant contribution to supporting confidence in the economy and its future prospects.I also wish to refer to the issue of homelessness.  Deputy Ciarán Lynch spoke well and sincerely about the issue yesterday.  I will not stand here and deny there is a problem.  Those who know me know I am a proud Dubliner from these parts, although they might not know it from my accent.  Like everybody else, it upsets me to walk the streets, not only in my home town but in the centre of the city also — I hope the city-based Deputies do not mind.  We have gone through a time of economic growth and we are now in very difficult times but I always made the point, standing by my social inclusion principles, that at a time when all boats are rising, we must remember the little boats, and shame on anybody who does not do so.  At a time of difficulty, we must help the little boats.There is a range of issues and all Members are having many issues brought to their attention each day.  It is sad that one can walk these streets and find people who are homeless.  I will take Members out to Tallaght, where I live——

#JoeCostelloLAB	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-party	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-dob	unknown-#JoeCostelloLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	849	I compliment Deputy Ciarán Lynch for tabling this motion, which is extremely relevant in terms of the times we are in and the fact we are coming close to Christmas.  The opening sentence of the motion sums it up where it refers to "the huge increase in the numbers on social housing lists which have jumped from 43,700 to nearly 60,000, an increase of more than 30% in just three years".  That is an increase in the social housing lists in three of the supposed best years ever in the history of the State.  While the private residential construction sector was literally going through the roof, on the other side of the coin local authority housing construction was spiralling downwards.  That was the contradiction of the Celtic tiger.A huge surplus overhang of private construction, which nobody wants or can afford to buy, is lying idle at present or in various stages of part completion.  It is frozen in time and I am sure this year will be remembered as the great recession of 2008.  Meanwhile, 60,000 households who are desperately in need of social housing have no new homes to go to.  The Government put pressure on local authorities to provide social housing through the public private partnerships, giving their developer friends a share in the rich bank of prime location social housing sites and dressing it up as "social regeneration".  Residents were promised long overdue social and community facilities and new modern homes to replace much neglected and poorly maintained flats.  The Government parties told these residents it would be a win-win, that the developer was taking the risks and that there was no risk to the local authority.  There was supposed to be no risk to the tenants.  However, we saw what occurred on 26 May.  Five public private partnership projects worth in the region of €2 billion collapsed, four of which were in my constituency.  It was not the developer who took the risk and paid the penalty but the tenants who had worked hard with the developer, the local authority and the Government and who had waited years for the regeneration of their communities.  In my constituency last week another public private partnership regeneration project went belly up and the hopes of a further 100 tenants have been dashed.I note the Minister of State with responsibility for housing, Deputy Finneran, is present.  The Government's policy of forcing local authorities to fund projects through PPPs and under Part V of the housing Act was clearly aimed at helping developers to profit from public lands in good times.  The Government facilitated such people at the time, but washed its hands of responsibility when the going got tough.  That is what is taking place.The budget for 2009 provides further evidence, as if it were needed, that the Government is looking after the developer at the expense of social housing provision.  The new home choice scheme was not produced by a benevolent Government wishing to provide housing for first-time buyers.  Rather, it was a rescue package for developers to continue to sell houses at inflated prices.  While local authorities are starved of funding to provide for those on housing waiting lists, the State is paying a small fortune to private landlords in rent allowances.  In the meantime the recipients of rent allowance are not allowed to work and, therefore, forced into a poverty trap.  If they could access local authority housing, they would be in a position to find a job and thus improve their circumstances and those of their family.The right to a home is one of the most basic civil and human rights.  For more than 11 years the Government had unlimited funds to put together a comprehensive housing programme.  The figures speak for themselves.  The developer and landlord led approach to the provision of social housing by the Government is a complete and utter failure.  The Labour Party motion proposes a new way forward which, if adopted, could resolve the failures of the current social housing policy.
#SeanSherlock	Labour	13160	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	850	There is a local authority housing development in Mitchelstown, north County Cork.  The houses are some of the finest I have ever seen and there is a mixture of social and affordable housing.  However, many of the affordable houses are empty because they cannot be sold.  The empty houses have given rise to anti-social behaviour, as a consequence of which they have been vandalised.  The estate is wonderful and the residents are very proud of where they live.  They have organised residents' associations.  However, they are very concerned that some of the empty affordable houses will not be sold, as they have been on the market for almost two years.  I have a list as long as one's arm of people in the Mitchelstown area who would gladly take one of these houses if they were transferred to social housing status.Officials in the northern division of Cork County Council told me that because of certain funding and resource stipulations put in place during the preparation of the affordable housing scheme, the status of these houses cannot be changed from affordable to social housing.  I am certain that is not the only such estate in the country.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government should allow some flexibility.  In cases where the social housing waiting list is of a certain size, it could show some degree of flexibility to ensure such houses are occupied.  In this way the problems of anti-social behaviour can be offset.  We need a common-sense approach to the use of empty houses under the auspices of local authorities.I refer to the tenant purchase scheme.  I have encountered many people who have paid rent to local authorities and invested thousands of euro in their house during the years.  As a result of restrictions on the tenant purchase scheme, they are prevented from purchasing their house.  If there was greater flexibility and the discounting system was more extensive, many older local authority residents who have invested much money in their house and made it their own could purchase it.  It would realise a certain amount for the State and allow it, in turn, to embark on a further housing programme.  I realise that my colleague, Deputy Lynch, has done a lot of work in this area, which I acknowledge.  The State must find imaginative solutions to this problem and should examine the possibility of introducing such schemes.  The Acting Chairman, Deputy Cuffe, stated in his contribution to the debate that some progress had been made.  However, a good deal more could be made and many imaginative solutions implemented.  We may propose such solutions through motions and the work of Deputy Lynch who is the Labour Party spokesperson on the issue.  Such solutions must be taken on board.  We seek to work positively to address the issue.Many rural dwellers do not wish to be shepherded into large urban areas to be facilitated in social housing.  The State must make provision for such persons and allow them, if eligible for social housing, to be housed within their communities.  The vibrancy of any community depends on a housing mix in which that demographic is also catered for.
#JackWall	unknown-#JackWall-party	unknown-#JackWall-dob	unknown-#JackWall-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	851	I congratulate Deputy Lynch on tabling the motion and I thank Deputy Costello for sharing time.I reject the comments made on the homeless in Dublin.  The first citizen of Dublin stated homeless services were as chaotic as the lives of some of the people for which they were in place to help.  One should listen to such statements because the first citizen is a member of Fianna Fáil.  I understand from reading the newspapers that she works hard to help people on this issue.  Her assertion contradicts the statement by the Minister distributed to previous speakers which, in turn, rejected the statements of Deputy Lynch on the matter.  She merely states a fact, as will be evident when the Lord Mayor's dinner which will be attended by several thousand takes place.  It has not been derived from a civil servant writing a speech for someone to deliver in the House, the contents of which may try to reject statements made on the Opposition side of the House.  The problem of homelessness has been articulated by someone who is knowledgeable and has worked in the area for many years.I refer to rented accommodation.  During the debate on the Social Welfare Bill I raised a matter of some disgrace for the Government.  There was a decision by the Minister of Social and Family Affairs to give €7 to senior citizens, single parents and others in rented accommodation.  However, the value of that rise was removed in one fell swoop by the Minister through a claw-back measure and given to owners in the rental accommodation sector — friends of Fianna Fáil.In many cases, such unfortunate people are obliged to live in hovels because of the downturn in the economy.  The owners of such buildings lease them to try to lower the cost factor in respect of the mortgages that have caused so many problems for the banks lately.  However, no inspection system exists to assess the hovels into which senior citizens and single parents are being put and that is a downright disgrace.  The Green Party is as responsible as Fianna Fáil in this regard as the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government is in charge but has done nothing to counteract this.Perhaps the Government's financial position is in such a state that it must claw back €4 from the senior citizens and single parents who live in such hovels.  Every Member is familiar with the conditions to which I refer.  During the general election campaign, one would know whether one was approaching rented accommodation because the door would be hanging off, the windows would be bad etc.  However, were the occupant to seek help to do something, it would transpire that the landlord had an agent through whom one spoke and no work ever got done.  This is the position we face in respect of rented accommodation.  I refer to those who are in need of houses that are not being provided by either the Government or the local authorities that seek funding from the former for such housing.The Minister, Deputy Gormley, and the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, both are present in the Chamber this evening and I ask them to put in place an inspection system in respect of rented accommodations to benefit those who suffer and who in many cases are afraid to make a complaint to the local authority because the hawks who are in charge of such places threaten to evict their tenants if they report them.  This is a fact of which all Members are aware, because everyone encountered such scenes during the election campaign.  When debating the fair deal scheme, Members may argue that one's home is one's castle.  Although the people to whom I refer are far from living in a castle, absolutely nothing is being done about it.  If anything is to emerge from this debate, it is that the Minister should give an undertaking to the House that he will provide an inspection system that will offer some assurance as 2009 approaches.

#ArthurMorganSF	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-party	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-dob	unknown-#ArthurMorganSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	860	Behind the headlines of the banking crisis, bank guarantees and proposals for recapitalisation lies a human story.  The credit crunch and subsequent recession is not only putting developers out of business and constructions workers out of jobs, it also is putting people out of their homes.  According to Threshold, every week an increasing number of people are having their homes repossessed because of difficulties in paying their mortgages or are being threatened with illegal eviction as some landlords attempt to hike up rents.  This of course is against the general trend in respect of rental rates at present and approximately ten families a week experience such threats.  Earlier this year, Threshold estimated that at least seven families were having their homes repossessed by the banks every week and as many as ten families in the private rented sector were being threatened with, or actually evicted from, their homes.Moreover, yesterday's newspapers reported that according to the Financial Regulator, almost 14,000 people were unable to meet their monthly repayments on home loans.  The same report indicated that 1,000 people have run up mortgage arrears with sub-prime lenders.  According to yesterday's edition of the Irish Independent:Figures gathered from 24 mortgage lenders by the Financial Regulator show that 13,931 mortgage accounts were three months in arrears by June this summer.  This was up from 11,252 at the end of December 2006, a rise of 24pc over that period.However, the scale of the crisis is probably worse, as a significant number of cases of voluntary surrenders never make the headlines.  While it has been suggested by certain mortgage experts that there may be a substantial number of voluntary repossessions, the exact number may not come into the public domain as the banks will try to keep a lid on it.  John Monaghan of the Society of St. Vincent de Paul spoke recently of personally knowing of 16 cases of voluntary surrender, one of which involved a sub-prime lender.When responding yesterday to the crisis facing families with mortgage and rent payments, the Minister of State spoke with breathtaking arrogance and again demonstrated that Ministers are on a different planet.  He accused Members of "foaming-at-the-mouth scaremongering" and "wide-of-the-mark claims" but the facts to which they have referred have been taken from reports such as that produced by Threshold, as well as the number of cases of repossessions that come before the High Court on a weekly basis.  Last Monday, almost one third of cases listed before the weekly chancery summonses resulted in an order for possession.  This is simple fact, not scaremongering.It is clear to everyone but the Minister of State that this is a crisis and it beggars belief that his only response is to give people "sound advice on what action to take" and to "warmly welcome the publication by the Financial Regulator of best practice guidance".  Despite all the reports of the rising numbers of people who are in default of their mortgage repayments, the Minister of State did not come up with a single new initiative to deal with this emergency.  There is no doubt that repossession orders, evictions and defaults in mortgage repayments are tied to rising unemployment.  More than 100,000 people have been laid off in the past 12 months and the unemployment rate could rise to 10% by the end of 2009.  Due to the Government's mishandling of the economy and the public finances over the past 11 years, take home pay rose at a far greater rate than did unemployment benefit.  There is a substantial difference between people's average pay and unemployment benefit.  This means that workers who now face unemployment and are on welfare will take a significant cut in their income.  As Ireland has the highest mortgages and rent payments in Europe, this obviously has placed the homes of hundreds of thousands of people in jeopardy.The problem is further compounded by the reported delays of up to 12 weeks in processing applications for jobseeker's allowance.  If job losses rise as expected over the next 12 months, the delays in processing jobseeker's allowance can only increase.   In addition to the economic impact, the real human costs are almost unquantifiable.  Repossessions and illegal evictions significantly increase people's level of housing need and increase their risk of homelessness.  As with social housing and homelessness, the Government is failing to address this specific level of need and all indications suggest the problems are going to get much worse.Nevertheless, many things could be done, if the political will to do them existed.  The Government could intervene to halt repossessions and illegal evictions.  It could use its political and financial influence with both banks and wayward landlords.  The Government could introduce a two-year moratorium on repossessions, while requiring lenders to conclude an affordable mortgage and debt payment arrangement, which would protect a minimally adequate standard of living.  The Government also could increase the resources allocated to the money advice and budgeting services, MABS, to ensure that debtors are guaranteed access to MABS personnel when they are negotiating the affordable mortgage and debt payment arrangements.  The lending institutions who, together with the Government are responsible for this crisis, should be compelled to suspend interest and other charges and penalties, as these only exacerbate a family's financial distress.Furthermore, introducing a court protocol to require lenders seeking a repossession on secured debt to be forced to show they have explored all possible alternatives through the above debt settlement mechanism is another option that should be explored.  Repossession should always be the last resort and mortgage lenders must be compelled to carry their responsibility for lending recklessly, which has caused the nightmare for many unfortunate families in the first place.  To help people who are now unemployed, the Government should increase awareness of, and access to, mortgage interest supplement to assist those mortgage holders experiencing temporary financial difficulties.  This would require a reversal of the cuts made in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill which will limit the payment of mortgage interest supplement.The Government must engage in a similar process with private sector landlords and their lenders, securing a protocol on repayments by developers to their banks; a moratorium on evictions; greater access to MABS for those in financial hardship; and a significant increase in the resources of the Private Residential Tenancies Board to deal with those threatened with illegal eviction.Repossessions and illegal evictions are bad for families, bad for communities and even bad for the economy.  The Government must intervene now and take the necessary steps to reduce the burden on those currently experiencing such housing need, and to halt the growth of families being placed in financial hardship and at risk of homelessness by lenders and by some landlords.The proposed recapitalisation scheme may provide a golden opportunity to tackle the impending housing crisis that faces us.  While speaking to an Oireachtas committee on 14 October last, Mr. Patrick Neary, CEO of the Irish Financial Service Regulatory Authority, told us that such speculative lending to the construction and property sectors in the State amounted to €39.1 billion and that he anticipated "losses on property-related loans".  He also stated that "increased provisions and write-offs will be necessary".Mr. Neary also revealed that a PwC audit of the six largest Irish banks had found that €15 billion of the lending was secured on those properties alone.  Can we learn anything from the Swedish experience in the early 1990s, where a similar case of ill-advised commercial lending in a property boom led to a collapse in its banking system?  As part of the Swedish bailout, its government forced banks to write down losses and sell off the distressed assets.  In the Irish case, some of the assets in question are the land banks amassed by speculators, unfinished housing estates and commercial retail ventures that should be sold off as bad debts.The Swedish Government formed a new agency to supervise institutions that needed recapitalisation and another that sold off the assets, mainly property, that the banks held as collateral.  In Ireland, we have a unique opportunity to return control of the planning process and commercial development to local government by breaking up the property cartels that have been holding Dublin city and many other towns across this land to their own development strategy, wilfully thwarting local council development plans.  As property prices fall and these assets are sold, local government could provide a unique route to dealing with the growing housing crisis and the taxpayer could be given a better return for the investment in the banks, rather than let cash-strapped developers sit on these assets now only to make a significant profit on them in the decades to come.  I hope the Minister will heed some of these suggestions.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	861	I thank Deputy Morgan and Sinn Féin for allowing me the opportunity to share its speaking time.  I also thank the Acting Chairman, Deputy Cuffe, for the opportunity to speak on this Private Members' motion on housing, and particularly social housing and homelessness.I speak as a former full-time voluntary worker and also as a former soup runner for Simon Ireland, the homelessness charity.  I worked in the night shelters and in the housing projects, and I also worked on the streets assisting the homeless.  It deeply saddens me that this debate is still going on and that we are still here pushing the housing issue and the urgent need for action on this matter.It is time to ask serious questions about what is going on in the State when there are still 60,000 on social housing waiting lists and an estimated 5,000 people experiencing homelessness at any one time.  Coming up to Christmas, this is all the more relevant when one thinks of the families and the young children involved.  It is important to remind ourselves, those of us who have a home, of the families and the young children who do not have a home.Why is there always a problem or a big deal about funding issues such as the medical card for the elderly, retention of class sizes, cervical cancer services and tonight's issue of homelessness?  There is never an issue about assisting the banks or the meat industry.  I supported the action needed on these issues, but what about families and young children without a home?  This is a question we all and the Government must ask ourselves.  The Government can get €180 million to support an industry and come up with €10 billion to support the financial services and the banking industry, and although I accept we have an economic problem, how come we can never find the few millions of euro required to fund homelessness services, cervical cancer services or education and class size issues?  It is important that we ask these questions in the debate tonight.Why are these always at the bottom of the priority list?  Tonight's motion, which I strongly support, attempts to bring them to the top of the list.  Where I come from, health disability, education and housing should always be top of any priority list.  These are the kinds of tough decisions that I would like to see people in this House make, and they should be made in the interests of the weaker sections of society.There is nothing tough or macho about cutting services.  It is a hell of a lot tougher to tell people straight that we are increasing taxation in order to develop public services or housing projects for the homeless.  That is the reality we should face as well.If we approve an additional 10,000 social housing units each year for the next three years, one should think of those from the construction sector who are on the dole at present coming into the industry and then paying their taxes.  That would make a massive contribution to the economy.  These are the tough decisions that I would like made, in the interests of the people, in this debate.I also strongly support the part of the motion dealing with the code of practice on the financial institutions providing for a moratorium on repossession orders for family homes during the current recession.  This is a sensible proposal and is one of the other reasons I am supporting it.  In the current climate, that is sensible and we all should agree that is a solution for many families.I also strongly support the section which calls for the resourcing and funding of The Way Home, a clear strategy to address adult homelessness.  These all are sensible proposals which should be backed by every Member of the House.The motion refers to anti-social behaviour.  Most Deputies deal with this matter on a regular basis at clinics in their constituencies.  This is a significant problem and it only surfaces when somebody is actually killed.  Most people do not even bother reporting anti-social behaviour to the Garda and others are so intimidated by fear that they regularly contact their Deputies and councillors rather than contact the Garda.  Fear and intimidation are widespread in our communities and some of these people from hell are destroying private and local authority houses while 60,000 good people wait for a home.  It is not acceptable.

It is a housing policy that has, at its heart, a range of flexible and graduated housing supports to meet the full diversity of need.  It is a housing policy that delivers real and tangible outcomes for households in need, with over 13,000 social and affordable housing units delivered in 2007 and the needs of almost 18,300 households met across the housing spectrum.Regarding the policy statement, Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, a housing policy which I suggest both parties read,——

For example, while its motion seems to suggest that it has no future plans to cater for the needs of older people and people with a disability, we are committed to completing and publishing a national housing strategy for people with disability, carrying out a review of the operation of the housing adaptation grant schemes for older people and people with a disability, and implementing recommendations and developing an approach to the delivery of sheltered housing for older people to feed into the Government's national positive aging strategy.

On behalf of Sinn Féin I thank those who have participated in this debate and especially those who have exposed their outrageous dispositions to these glaring social needs.  Ranked not least among these is the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, whose efforts last night regarding turkeys and stuffing was an absolute disgrace.  I thank the Labour Party for joining Sinn Féin in putting forward this motion on the crisis in housing and homelessness in our country.All I can say in response to the Minister's remarks on inconsistency is "wow" because he should know a great deal about that subject from his time in Government.  I will rehearse a statement with which I very much agree:the Government congratulates itself on the tremendous level of activity which is in progress, while overlooking the misery, injustice and division which it is creating for generations to come.  There is no planning.  There is no environmental or social thinking and ultimately that will be a cost to our economy.These words are not mine.  They are the words of the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Eamon Ryan, when he spoke on behalf of the Green Party in November 2003 in support of a Sinn Féin Bill that would enshrine the right to housing in the Constitution.  He was describing the disastrous lack of policy on housing in successive Fianna Fáil-led Governments over the past decade.  That approach to housing was developer driven and greed based.  It was fuelled not by the housing needs of the people but by the profit motive of developers and the avarice of banks and other lending institutions.  We can see the consequences in the virtual collapse of the Irish financial system and the deepening recession in the economy.Ironically, after a decade of madly spiralling house prices, over-dependence on construction for employment, reckless lending, massive mortgage debt and the construction of unprecedented numbers of private dwellings, we still have a housing crisis because tens of thousands of our people do not have adequate homes.  More than 60,000 people are on the local authority waiting lists for housing, a jump of more than 30% in the three years during which the Green Party has been a shareholder in this coalition arrangement.  At the same time the phenomenon has arisen of empty houses and apartments in unfinished estates around the country, especially in the commuter belt surrounding the greater Dublin area.  This is a mess of the Government's own making.I was shocked and greatly disappointed by the remarks made by the Minister of State.  I have seldom heard such an insulting speech as the one he delivered.  His juvenile jibes at the Labour Party and Sinn Féin for bringing forward this considered and substantive motion are beneath contempt but they will be especially felt by the homeless and those who languish on housing lists throughout the State, including in his own constituency of Roscommon-South Leitrim.  His contribution will not be forgotten by the people who have been languishing for years without their needs being addressed.More than 40,000 households in the private rental sector are in receipt of rent supplement.  These households are more likely to live in dwellings which do not meet the Government's existing standards.  Many tenants are on low incomes and are more at risk of living in sub-standard units.The capacity of local authorities to enforce standards needs to be increased.  This critical area has not been sufficiently addressed.  The Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government must ensure that local authorities take a proactive approach to their responsibilities for inspecting rented accommodation as part of the first line of defence for those who are in need of support and who cannot be expected to indefinitely occupy inadequate or inappropriate housing.I urge all Deputies to support this motion and to reject the Government's amendment.  We do not have to walk far from the gates of this institution to see the reality of the 5,000 people who are homeless on the streets of our major towns and cities at any given time.  That is an absolute disgrace and it cries out for the Government to face up to its responsibilities.  The contributions we have heard last night and again tonight are another exercise in hand wringing with no commitment and clearly no strategy.  The Minister and his team of colleagues in Government, at either Minister or junior Minister level, must pull their act together or the next Government will have to pick up on the failures the current Government has presided over.

President Mugabe then appeared on the screen to tell us this was all some kind of Western conspiracy, there was no cholera in Zimbabwe and anybody who had the disease had been cured.I do not want to accuse our Government or imply it has gone quite as far as President Mugabe but there are parallels in the kind of delusion that people in power for too long tend to suffer.  The contribution last night of the Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, and to some extent that of the Minister, Deputy Gormley, tonight is evidence of that kind of delusion.

The Minister of State, Deputy Finneran, stated the motion before the House is ill-judged and accused the Labour Party, and myself in particular, of being hysterical, scaremongering and causing panic and unease.  The point of the motion is to address the panic, unease, fear and in some cases hysteria among people who are now afraid of losing their home.In the High Court last week there were 37 cases for repossession of homes and we know cases are being queued for house repossessions.  We have heard of something in the order of over 7,000 people who are now in receipt of mortgage subsidy, many experiencing the pleasures of social assistance for the first time.  Some 14,000 people are now behind in their mortgage payments by a minimum of three months.  There are many people who are worried about losing their home, and as more people lose their jobs and businesses, that is likely to increase.It does not have to be like that.  There is a way in which people can be reassured that they can continue to live in their own home.  It is possible to devise arrangements whereby for the period of the recession — we may be talking about a period of two to four years — people can at least be reassured that they will not be put out of their home.  That is a practical proposal which can be achieved through arrangements with the banks, for which the Government is acting as guarantor.  Apparently the Government will recapitalise the banks by putting at least €4 billion from the pension reserves into them in some form or other.In any event, if people have their homes repossessed, the Government will have to pay rent allowance or provide social housing or some kind of shelter for people losing their homes.  It makes sense for those arrangements to be recast so that people will know if they lose their job because of bad times for a couple of years, at least they can continue to live in their own home.If the Government did this, far from creating panic, fear and all the other things we are accused of, much of the fear among people about their future and where they will be for the next couple of years would be reduced.  If the Government could do that much in that kind of climate, new possibilities would be opened for the direction of the economy.  Confidence would be increased and the kind of reassurance would be provided for people to enable other necessary actions through social partnership over the next year or two.  It is a practical proposal.What is the Government's response to this?  It rejects the proposal.

This is hardly comfort to people worried about losing their jobs.We can consider the position the Government has led us into.  This country has had a number of years of record housing output.  Over the past three years we produced 90,000, 80,000 and 75,000 housing units respectively.  In that period, the Government managed to bring about a 30% increase in the number of people on council housing waiting lists.  There are 60,000 families——

Sticking with the official figure, even the 60,000 on the council waiting list is the highest number of people applying for council housing since 1964.  That was a time which caused people to rise in Dublin and march on the streets and led to the establishment of the housing action committee.We have proposed a very simple solution.  We have indicated there is a housing overhang but the Minister, Deputy Gormley, came in here and thought it outrageous that we should suggest that surplus houses built in the private sector might be made available to address a public housing need.

#SeanSherlock	Labour	13160	Cork East	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	947	In raising this matter, I am seeking to highlight the fact that, in the view of the 100 plus GPs who refer people to it, Mallow General Hospital is a centre of excellence.  It is also a secondary care facility that caters for the needs of a population base of well over 100,000.  If the national service plan, as envisaged, is implemented, the accident and emergency department at Mallow General Hospital will be downgraded to a minor injuries unit.  The GPs from whom I have received representations and the people who live in the area want to know what will be the future of the accident and emergency department.  There is a concern that if it is downgraded to the status of a minor injuries unit, many GPs in the area will bypass Mallow General Hospital and refer people instead to Cork University Hospital, CUH.  Given an expected population base of 4.53 million in 2009, it is vital hospitals such as Mallow General Hospital maintain some coherence in terms of accident and emergency services.  Reducing or diminishing it to a minor injuries clinic will result in more people being put into the narrow funnel that is Cork University Hospital, which is not the way to go.I have taken advice on the matter from general practitioners who refer stroke patients and people with heart complaints to this hospital.  Many of these interventions can be dealt with by the accident and emergency department.  Downgrading the hospital to a minor injuries unit will have an adverse effect on outcomes for patients.
#JanOSullivan	unknown-#JanOSullivan-party	unknown-#JanOSullivan-dob	unknown-#JanOSullivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	948	I concur with what Deputy Sherlock said.  A Teamwork report completed in the mid-west more than a year ago has not yet been published.  There are all sorts of rumours going around about accident and emergency services at hospitals in Nenagh, Ennis and Limerick being reduced.  There is no evidence whatsoever that capacity in the Mid-west Regional Hospital in Limerick will be increased to cater for extra patients.  People living in places like west Clare will be a considerable distance from the central hospital in Limerick should this downgrading go ahead.  We are hearing rumours to the effect that this will happen in March 2009.I have repeatedly called for the publication of the Teamwork Management Services report and have received conflicting answers, some of which indicate the report has not yet been submitted to the board of the HSE and others from the Minister and Professor Drumm who indicated in committee that they do not want to publish it because it may give rise to opposition.  This is no way to democratically address the issue of how we run our hospital services in this country.It is important to state on the record that secondary hospitals have an important role to play.  They are much more cost effective in dealing with certain matters than are tertiary hospitals.  We need to have a proper debate and evaluation of the role of secondary hospitals before they are downgraded in some type of secret operation, with no publication of a plan and only a vague generalised reference to reconfiguration as set out in the HSE plan launched yesterday.While a copy of the Teamwork report is floating around in the mid-west it has not yet been published.  In effect, patients, the public and public representatives are being denied an opportunity to participate in a debate on this issue and to ensure we maintain a level of service in secondary hospitals in the mid-west, south, north-east and in various other parts of the country that is appropriate to what a secondary hospital can do.  An excellent service is being provided by these hospitals in a cost effective manner in comparison with larger hospitals.It is appalling that this is happening in a type of secretive manner without any public discussion.  I urge the Minister to genuinely address the issues of concern in these areas because people do not know what is happening.  I have spoken about the issue to people in Clare, north Tipperary and Limerick.  They are hearing rumours about what is proposed for their hospitals but there is no public announcement in this regard.  It is almost as if this is being done behind closed doors with only particular people being brought on board and senior rather than regular staff at the hospitals being told about it.

Patient safety is of paramount importance in ensuring people have confidence in the services and that the best possible patient outcomes are achieved.  It is essential that patient safety and quality are prioritised and that services are organised and managed accordingly.The six hospitals in the mid-western region providing acute services have a complement of 828 in-patient beds and 124 day beds.  Between them, the hospitals have a total operating annual budget of €275 million, with a staffing complement of 3,248.  The activity profile for the service consists of 47,000 in-patients, 34,000 day cases, 180,000 out-patient attendances and 110,000 accident and emergency presentations per annum.  The maternity hospital deals with 5,500 births per annum. These figures underline the importance of the work done by the hospitals in the mid-west area and the contribution they make to the health services of the region.Mallow General Hospital provides a valuable range of in-patient, out-patient and day case services.  It is, and will continue to be, an important health care facility.  In the past years, there has been a considerable level of investment in equipment and infrastructure at the hospital.  A capital sum of €1.5 million was provided for the provision of CT scanning services at Mallow General Hospital on a five-day week basis. The support staff has been put in place and the CT scanner has been operational since September of this year.  A refurbishment programme has also commenced at the hospital.  Work on the upgrading of the emergency department has been completed and work on the extension of the regional laboratory system is about to commence.  A sum of €260,000 was allocated in the current year for ward and other minor equipment, upgrading of toilets and compliance with hygiene and decontamination standards.The HSE has commissioned a number of strategic reviews of the configuration of acute hospital services including in the mid-west and the south.  In each case, the first priority is patient safety.  The challenge in the years ahead will be to organise, manage and deliver high quality services that are focused in the first instance on the safety of patients.  Horwath Consultants in association with Teamwork Management Services were commissioned by the HSE to work on the strategic reviews in the mid-west and southern regions.  The reviews focus on identifying the best configuration of acute hospital services in the regions, including arrangements for accident and emergency, critical care, acute medicine and surgery, together with diagnostic services so that the highest quality of care can be delivered to the population of the regions concerned.The HSE reviews will act as inputs to decisions on how best to reconfigure acute services in the regions concerned.  The Government and the Executive are committed to ensuring that the approach to reorganisation of services is carried out in consultation with the key stakeholders and that each element is progressed incrementally.

This approach will, she is confident, produce the best outcome for patients.  Patient safety will determine how services in the mid-west and the south are configured in the future.A detailed planning process is currently underway in each network to ensure that secondary care services are assigned to each hospital in the network in an appropriate manner, which takes account of their ability to manage complex care safely and to the highest standard.  The Government is committed to ensuring high quality acute services throughout the country.

#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	954	Throughout the local development sector there is grave concern at the savage cutbacks that have been imposed on Pobal and its staff with resulting negative impacts on local development companies and partnerships.The establishment of the ADM company under the partnership process was a significant step in delivering necessary centralised and efficient back-up to hundreds of local development projects across Ireland, with which the Minister and I are familiar.  The evolution of ADM into Pobal under the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs was a milestone in creating an accountable and more effective local voluntary and social economy sector.  The organisation has received a great deal more work in terms of invigilation and an increased accounting role as a result of the recent changes introduced in the management of such companies.The Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs has, under budget 2009, imposed a savage 33% cut in the administration and support costs of social inclusion programmes which are managed by Pobal, with a clear indication that even more severe cuts of up to 50% will apply in 2010.  As I understand it, the result will be the loss of almost 100 jobs in Pobal.I am informed by Pobal staff representatives that 74 redundancies are now being sought from a workforce of 250.  I am aware also of course that 90 Pobal workers have less than two year's service and that their work has developed as a result of recent changes introduced in the organisation.  Clearly, these extraordinary cuts in a relatively small organisation seem totally disproportionate, even in the context of the overall severe budgetary cuts being imposed for 2009.  The Department's justification is to enable the maintenance of frontline services but the key liaison support and development functions performed by Pobal with local agencies will clearly be damaged by these cutbacks.  The result will be major cuts at local level in supports for effective and transparent delivery of funds to communities.  Cuts will also affect specialist support staff in employment, community development, and educational disadvantage, including disadvantaged groups, Travellers, lone parents, prisoners and citizens recovering from addiction.Similarly, cuts will affect the connection between Departments and beneficiaries at local level, in addition to their impact on evaluation and research capacities, the production of strategy guides and good proactive tool kits, and in necessary networking meetings of partnership staff, and other cross-learning events.The local development social inclusion, LDSIP, programme supports local agencies such as partnerships to address complex problems of inequality, poverty and social inclusion.  The Minister, Deputy Ó Cuív, and the Department of Finance value for money review of the LDSIP clearly identified the need for ongoing "sophisticated" evaluation and ongoing guidance and technical support for local groups.  However, the Department has said it is employing the Centre for Effective Services, CES, to design a successor programme to the LDSIP.  I understand that the CES received funding from Atlantic Philanthropies in addition to funding from the Department of Community, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.Why could the work not have been carried out by Pobal?  There does not appear to have been any tendering process for the work that will now be carried out by the Centre for Effective Services.  I am further informed that Pobal was not given a chance to tender for the project, which seems central to its statutory remit and for a task in which it has built up 16 years of valuable experience.  The VFM to which I referred identified areas for improvement in Pobal but it did not question the fundamental capacity, integrity or efficiency of the organisation.  How can its vital public support and invigilation role in local development be effectively delivered with the massive cut of 100 jobs?Ireland is plunging into a severe recession, partly due to gross errors by the Government since 1997.  Unemployment may rise to in excess of 10%.  The impact may be most severe in disadvantaged and low income communities.  It seems crazy therefore to impose this level of cutbacks in Pobal that will have a knock-on effect on important local employment and enterprise programmes across the country that are served by Pobal.The Ceann Comhairle is aware that I have long experience as a community activist with local development projects.  I am a long-time director of Coolock Development Council and of the Northside Partnership and a number of its related companies.  As a community director, it is always reassuring to know that Pobal exists and that high standards of invigilation and audit are being maintained.  The new light touch invigilation proposed by the Minister, including an end to quarterly reports that must be presented to and invigilated by Pobal, will result in weakening the system of accountability, which may have disastrous consequences.  I am also a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, which is currently invigilating a major State agency where it appears lapses occurred.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	955	I fully concur with the Deputy on the need to keep an eye on money and to make sure it is spent where it should be spent.  Pobal is a private company.  It is not a statutory company or agency and it is important that one would understand that.What is proposed is a 33% cut in funding for 2009, as referred to by Deputy Broughan, relating to administration and overhead funding.  It is not commensurate with overall funding for programme delivery for 2009.  The reduction in the administration funding available to Pobal reflects an emphasis on the prioritisation of front-line services over intermediary and ancillary supports.As the Deputy is probably aware, Pobal administers a range of programmes and schemes on behalf of my Department, namely, the local development social inclusion programme, LDSIP, to which Deputy Broughan referred, and the dormant accounts fund, DAF, which will give rise to less activity next year because it has less money.  It is inevitable that this would happen over time.  We are considering the structure of the community services programme, CSP, in order to streamline it.  Other programmes include the RAPID programme, the rural social scheme, RSS, and grant schemes to community and voluntary organisations.  The overall provision in the Abridged Estimates for 2009 for these programmes is just under €175 million.As previously indicated to the House, my primary concern is to make every effort to ensure that the front-line services provided by, or supported through, my Department — especially those focused on the needs of the most socially deprived communities — are protected.  That is being achieved by requiring significant administrative savings in my Department and public bodies within its ambit, through the cessation of the use of intermediary bodies, such as community development support agencies and by reducing administrative overheads across bodies such as Pobal.  In that way, the wide range of services my Department provides, including services under its social inclusion programmes, can be broadly maintained.It is appreciated that Pobal has had a key role in the delivery of successful local development services and programmes for many years for several Departments.  The Government has acknowledged the work and commitment of board members past and present, both individually and collectively in contributing to the many achievements of the company.  It is those achievements and commitment that gives confidence that the board of Pobal will support the Department in prioritising the restricted resources that will be available in the coming years in the interests of the programme beneficiaries.  Intensive discussions are ongoing with Pobal in regard to how the administrative costs and overheads can be reduced while maintaining service delivery at 2008 levels.The situation amazes me but it is inevitable in politics.  We are told there are too many overheads and too many administrators.  We hear that every day from the Opposition.  I have been trying to rationalise this sector for a long time, as it was all over the place with community partnerships, area partnerships, Leader companies and Leader partnerships.  There was a significant amount of companies.  I have streamlined all of that and I will keep streamlining it.Deputy Broughan might disagree with me but my absolute obligation is to get the money on to the ground.  We have to look after the money but that does not have to be done through the creation of endless reports that do not determine the value for money on the ground.  I am determined to protect front-line services for people who need them and if that means cutting administrative overheads then so be it.  I look every day at ways of cutting the administrative overheads right across all of the agencies under my Department.  I am right to do that.  I have been doing it for a long time.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	960	I thank the Ceann Comhairle for allowing me to raise this matter on the Adjournment.  It is an important issue in my area given the urgent need for the Minister for Education and Science to provide funding for a new school building for St. Mary's national school, Edgeworthstown, County Longford.  I seek an update on the loss of essential teaching staff at the school despite rising roll numbers.The reality for St. Mary's is that it needs a new 16-classroom school at the cost of €3.6 million, as compared to the shameful waste of €1.1 million from 2002 to date on temporary accommodation.  Just in case basic maths is a problem for the Minister, the new school has already reached a cost of €4.7 million and that is without including fees of €120,000 paid to consultants or the €40,000 for ESB for the temporary prefabs and the rising cost associated with the delay in the commencement of works.If the new school building were to be deferred for another few years, which is beyond contemplation, the cost of building it would have been totally thrown away on temporary accommodation, which would still be temporary and by then in urgent need of replacement or restoration.  That is madness.  As I have continually said, the Government is penny wise and pound foolish.  It makes no economic sense to continue to throw away money on temporary accommodation that would be better utilised on permanent buildings, particularly as one third of the final cost has already been spent on temporary structures.St. Mary's currently has 20 teachers and their pupils in prefabs.  The school which is expecting to have 120 plus EAL pupils in September 2009, is losing three language support teachers.  It currently has five language teachers for 99 EAL pupils, which again if you will forgive me for drawing attention to the basic maths, does not add up, and the children will suffer as a result.  The general allocation for learning support will have to absorb the balance, encroaching on the already overburdened learning support teachers.  The school is also to lose one class teacher.  In September 2008, enrolment was five pupils above the appointment-retention figure of 367 and with the increase in class size it is now three short of the 375 appointment-retention figure.  To retain the teacher, enrolment will have to increase by 25 pupils to achieve developing school status.  St Mary's is a vibrant school which serves the community under the excellent care of the principal, Ms Helen O'Gorman.  It provides a first class education for a rapidly increasing primary school-going population in Edgeworthstown and surrounding areas.  It does so despite the limitations imposed by the Government, but the built environment is becoming more and more of an issue for teachers, pupils and parents.  The population has grown by 68.4% in the five years from 2001-06 and enrolment has grown accordingly, but EAL has remained static.  The school should be included in the Department of Education and Science's development area units.I am asking the Minister to stop throwing good money after bad.  Instead of ploughing more money on top of the third of the cost of the new building already spent into temporary accommodation which is totally unsuited for the purpose and facing rising costs, building must be permitted to go ahead at this school.  I hope that in the Minister's reply, there will be a Christmas box for students, teachers and parents in the Edgeworthstown area.  I should very much appreciate a favourable response to this important motion for this area of my constituency.
#EamonOCuiv	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-party	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-dob	unknown-#EamonOCuiv-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	961	I thank the Deputy for raising this matter as it provides me with an opportunity to outline to the House the position with regard to the proposed building project for St. Mary's national school in Edgeworthstown, County Longford and the position in relation to the allocation of teaching resources for the new school year.St. Mary's national school was formed as a result of an amalgamation of St. Mary's boys' and St. Elizabeth's girls' national schools in September 2001.  The St. Mary's boys' national school building was deemed suitable to act as a host for the school and it is operating from these premises at present.  However, in the intervening years, enrolments have increased by over 60% at the school and the Department of Education and Science has provided temporary accommodation to meet this growing need for pupil places, including three new prefabs for the current school year.  It accepts, however, that a new building is needed to provide adequately for the school.A project to provide this new building is currently at stage 2 of the Department's architectural planning process, which is the initial sketch scheme stage.  A revised stage 2 submission in this regard has been received from the school authority and this is currently being examined by the Department's professional and technical staff.  While the Department is not in a position to say when the project will be allowed to proceed further after the stage 2 submission has been approved due to the level of demand on its capital budget, the Minister for Education and Science is committed to delivering the project as soon as the necessary funding is available.  With regard to teaching resources, when the country was able to afford it, the Government reduced the basis on which primary teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of pupils per teacher from 35 down to the current level of 27.The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher has to be viewed in that context.  Significant additional support went into schools, particularly in the area of special education.  The Government also reduced class sizes for the most disadvantaged in our DEIS schools to an average of one teacher for every 20 pupils in junior classes and an average of one for every 24 pupils in senior classes and these will not be changing in 2009.  When all the teachers in the system are added up, there is one for every 16 pupils in our primary schools.It will be necessary in the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone.  While teacher numbers are important, numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that teacher quality is the single most important factor, far above anything else, in improving educational outcomes for children.  Ensuring high quality teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit this represents a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.The Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to staffing allocations.  The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools.  The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the new year.  The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules.  In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers the Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support.  The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.The Minister for Education and Science has no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers to schools for the 2009-10 school year.  The Minister will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published and it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.At this time the priority for the Department within the resources available to it is to carry out those processes in a timely manner.  Diverting resources in order to create staffing profiles for the school requested by the Deputy, information which at this time would only be speculative, could not be justified and would in fact impede the process.The Minister for Education and Science is confident that as the global economy improves, it will be possible to build again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner consistent with overall prudent management of the economy.  As the full extent of the global crisis seeps into public consciousness, the Minister believes there will be general acceptance that taking difficult decisions now in order to secure future economic prosperity and secure employment is the first imperative of Government.Again, I thank the Deputy for raising the issue.

Is ceist thábhachtach í seo, ní hamháin don Ghaeilge, ach do oideachas na tíre agus don Ghaeltacht.  Táim cinnte go n-aontóidh an tAire liom go bhfuil stair fhada glórmhar ag na coláistí Gaeilge sa tír, a théann siar breis agus céad bliain ó bunaíodh an chéad choláiste Gaeilge i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, i gContae Chorcaigh, Coláiste na Mumhan.Bliain nó dhó ina dhaidh sin bunaíodh an dara choláiste Gaeilge i mo cheanntar féin, i nGort ‘a Choirce, Coláiste Uladh.  Coláistí iad seo a raibh freastal ag mór laochra agus pearsain mhór i staire réabhlóide na tíre seo orthu.  Mar shampla, i gColáiste Uladh bhí daoine móra cosúil le Ruairí Mac Easmainn, an Piarsach féin agus ar ndóigh daoine ó Thuaisceart Éireann a bhain leis an aicme eile, an aicme dílseoirí.Ainm amháin a thagann chun mo chuimhne ná Róis Ní Ógáin, Rose Young, sean-aintín leis an Tiarna Brookeborough, a tháinig go rialta chuig Gort ‘a Choirce agus a d'foghlaim a cuid Gaeilge agus a chuir an Duanaire Gaeilge ar fail.  Taispeánann sé sin an fiúntas, an feabhas agus an mhaitheas a rinne na coláistí Gaeilge ó bunaíodh iad breis is céad bliain ó shin.  Tá áthas orm go dtí an lá inniu go bhfuil na coláistí sin ag gníomhú go héifeachtach ar fud na tíre.'Sé an tAire féin a dúirt go raibh freastal de 6,020 dalta ar na coláistí Gaeilge i seachtan amháin i mbliana.  Dúirt an tAire sa ráiteas sin gur fiú €50 milliún do cheantair Ghaeltachta na tíre seo tionscal na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Ní hamháin go mbíonn na daltaí ag freastal ar na coláistí, ach bíonn a gcuid tuismitheoirí agus a gcuid gaolta agus daoine eile ag tabhairt cuairteanna orthu i rith an tsamhraidh.  Ar ndóigh, dúinne a bhfuil cónaí orainn sa Ghaeltacht, bíonn na coláistí Gaeilge agus teacht na ndaltaí cosúil le teacht na bhfáinleog sa samhradh, faoi mar a bhí ag an Phiarsach sa scéal sin Eoghainín na nÉan.  Táim cinnte go bhfuil eolas ag an Aire ar an scéal sin.Bhí trí fhoinse d'ioncaim ag na coláistí Gaeilge i gcónaí, an táille a dhíol na tuismitheoirí féin as na daltaí a chur chun na Gaeltachta, an táille a dhíol Roinn an Aire a chuaigh go dtí na mna tí agus an deontas caipitíochta a thug an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta le haghaidh gach dalta.  Cuireadh ionadh an tsaoil orm nuair a tarraingíodh siar go huile agus go hiomlán san cháinaisnéis  an deontas caipitíochta sin.  Tá mé cinnte go n-aontaíonn sibh gur buille mór sin dos na coláistí Gaeilge a chuireann ar chumas daoine óga, ní hamháin dul agus an Ghaeilge a fhoghlaim ach eolas a chur ar chultúr agus thraidisiún na tuaithe agus na Gaeltachta agus an cheantair sin den tír.  An méid atá á tarraingt siar le ciorrú an deontais seo ná €1.25 milliún, amach as €9.5 milliún, an caiteachas ar fad don Roinn.  Suim an-bheag í don Roinn, ach is suim an-mhór í dos na coláistí Gaeilge.Beidh roinnt de na coláistí Gaeilge ábalta é seo a sheasamh ar feadh bliana nó dhó.  Sin iad na coláistí atá sean-bhunaithe a bhfuil airgead cruinnithe acu agus nead déanta acu mar go raibh siad ag cruinniú fá choinne na coise tinne.  Ach ba mhaith liomsa go gcuimhneodh muid ar na coláistí atá ag na comharchumainn, na coláistí atá ag eagraíochtaí cosúil le Gael Linn, a threoraíonn an t-airgead agus an brabús a dhéanann sé bliain in aghaidh bliana isteach sna comhluadair agus na ceantair ina bhfuil siad lonnaithe.B'fhiú smaoineamh freisin ar choláistí nach bhfuil ach i ndiaidh tosnú.  I mo cheantar féin tá coláiste úr i mBun an Inbhir, a bhí ann don chéad uair athrú anuraidh.  Is beag achmhainní atá ag an gcoláiste sin go fóill.  Tá siad ag tógáil chomh maith agus is féidir leo agus ag iarraidh níos mó daltaí a fháil.  Cuirfidh an tarraingt siar den deontas seo isteach go mór ar na haicmí sin.Iarraim ar an Aire, cé go bhfuil a fhios agam nach eisean atá i gceannas na Roinne Oideachais agus Eolaíochta — ach tá sé i gceannas ar An Roinn Gnóthaí Pobail, Tuaithe agus Gaeltachta agus tuigeann sé an cás agus cé chomh trom agus a bheidh an buille seo ar an chuid is mó de na coláistí — dul chuig a chomhghleacaithe agus an Rialtas agus iarradh orthu athmhacnamh a dhéanamh ar tharraingt siar an deontais seo agus é a thabhairt do na coláistí i mbliana.  Níl i gceist ach €1.25 milliún, suim bheag i gcomhthéacs caiteachas na tíre seo, ach suim mhór chomh fada agus a bhaineann sí leis na coláistí.Tá an tAire in ann agus san áit cheart le bronntanas breá Nollag a thabhairt dos na 633 teaghlach, de réir a fhocail féin, a dheineann freastal ar na daltaí seo i rith an tsamhraidh sna ceantair Ghaeltachta.  Go raibh maith agat.

Táim anseo thar cionn an Aire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta mar go mbaineann an scéal leis an Roinn sin.Go deimhin, bhí spéis agam sa mhéid a bhí le rá ag an dTeachta maidir le bunú na gcoláistí Gaeilge.  Mar a tharlaíonn sé, sa bhliain 1903, bhí cruinniú i gCorcaigh, agus ag an gcruinniú sin, mhol mo sheanathair, Seán Ó Cuív, go mbunófaí coláiste Gaeilge.  Ag éirí as sin, bunaíodh coláiste Gaeilge Béal Átha an Ghaorthaidh.  Aisteach go leor, bhí an seanathair eile ag an gcomóradh a rinneadh in 1966 ar bhunú an choláiste agus bhí mise, mar Aire na Gaeltachta, ag an gcomóradh a rinneadh ar bhunadh an choláiste sin 100 bliain i ndiaidh a bhunaithe.  Mar sin, tá ceangal fada ag mo mhuintir leis na coláistí Gaeilge.  Go deimhin, d'fhreastal mé féin ar an gcoláiste i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh ar feadh trí bliana, agus uair amháin sa Spidéal.  Mar is eol don Teachta, caithfidh go ndeachaigh an Spidéal go mór i gcion orm, mar phós mé bean as an Spidéal ina dhiaidh sin.Aithníonn an tAire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta ról tábhachtach na gcoláisti samhraidh Gaeltachta agus molann sé obair na gcoláistí as ucht Iíofacht a chothú i measc na mac léinn a dhéanann freastal orthu.  Is ábhar dóchais é go leanann líon suntasach mac léinn orthu ag freastal ar na coláistf seo sa Ghaeltacht.  Aithním chomh maith go mbíonn tionchar nach beag ag na coláistí ar eacnamaíocht na gceantar Gaeltachta in a bhfuil siad lonnaithe.Ni raibh aon dul as, afach, ach roghanna deacra a dhéanamh thar gach réimse de chaiteachas poiblí i mbuiséad 2009.  Rinneadh na cinntí seo chun srian a chur le caiteachas poiblí agus marthanacht a áirithiú sa fad-téarma.  Ina leith seo, níorbh fhéidir an t-oideachas a sparáil ina iomláine cé gur cosnaíodh é níos mó ná formór na reimsí eile den chaiteachas poiblí.Níor mhór roinnt bearta a chur i gcrích in earnáil an oideachais chun cabhrú le costais na hearnála poiblí a shrianadh agus soláthar a dhéanamh ag an am chéanna d'athruithe deimeagrafacha agus eile.  In ainneoin an mhéadaithe de €302 milliún sa bhuiséad oideachais do 2009, éacht nach beag agus an eacnamaíocht mar atá sí, ni raibh aon dul as ach roinnt cinntí crua, deacra a dhéanamh.Léiríodh na cinntí seo i mease na bhfógairtí lá an bhuiséid, agus ina measc bhí cealú an deontais a bhí á íoc ag an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaíochta do na colaistí samhraidh Gaeilge.  B'é ráta an chúnamh deontais seo, a cuireadh ar fail i 2008, ná tuairim is €53 in aghaidh gach mhic léinn a bhí rollaithe ar chúrsa trí seachtaine, méid ab ionann is cuid bheag go leor den chostas foriomlán a ghabhann le freastal ar an gcúrsa.  Cuireadh an chabhair a soláthraíodh in aghaidh an mhic léinn ar fail ar bhonn an lín fhoriomláin a bhí rollaithe ins na cursaí samhraidh, is cuma faoi acmhainní na dtuismitheoirí.Leanfar le tacaíocht an Stáit do mhic léinn a fhreastalaíonn ar na coláistí samhraidh Gaeltachta i bhfoirm na bhfóirdheontas a íoctar le teaghlaigh a chuireann cóiríocht ar fáil do na mic léinn.  Ina theannta sin, leanfar leis an maoiniú a dhéantar ar fhreastal ábhar oidí ar na coláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht agus leis na socruithe maidir le saoire phearsanta bhreise a cheadú do mhúinteoirí bunscoile a mhúineann ins na coláistí samhraidh.Tuigeann an tAire Oideachais agus Eolaíochta an tábhacht chultúrtha agus socheolaíoch a bhaineann leis na limistéir Gaeltachta d'fhoghlaimeoirí na teanga agus leanfaidh an Roinn Oideachais agus Eolaiochta le tacaíochtaí Stáit a thabhairt de réir mar is féidir sin leis na hacmhainní mar atá siad ins na toscaí deacra eacnamaíochta atá ann faoi láthair.Cuireann an Roinn raon bearta ar fáil chun tacú le múineadh agus foghlaim na Gaeilge agus le foghlaim trí Ghaeilge.  Orthu seo tá: tacaíochtaí breisithe múinteoireachta agus maoinithe do Ghaelscoileanna; forbairt ghairmiúil do mhúinteoirí ag an leibhéal bunscoile agus iarbhunscoile tríd an gclár tacaíochta don churaclam bunscoile agus tríd an tseirbhís tacaíochta dara leibhéal, faoina gcuirtear 34 oiliúnóir lánaimseartha ar fáil; cláir mhodúlacha do mhúinteoirí tríd an nGréasán lárionad oideachais; agus soláthar téacsanna, ábhar agus acmhainní i nGaeilge trí fhorbairt Shéideán Sí agus obair na Comhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscolaíochta.Tá mórán athruithe tarlaithe sa bhliain a chuaigh thart agus is í an chéad aidhm atá ag an Rialtas ná an t-airgeadas poiblí a chosaint.  Is é seo an t-aon bhealach inar féidir linn gnóthachain a choimeád agus cur ar ár gcumas féin feabhsúchain a dhéanamh amach anseo.  Táimd ag déileáil, áfach, le staid eacnamaíochta a bhfuil deacracht gan fasach ag baint leis.  Tá sé de dhualgas ar an Rialtas aghaidh a thabhairt ar seo agus cinntí fíor-dheacra a dhéanamh ar mhaithe leis an náisiún.  Agus sin á dheanamh againn, tá iarracht déanta againn foscadh éigin a thabhairt don earnáil oideachais, ach i bhfianaise scála an chaiteachais phoiblí ar an oideachas, ní féidir cinntí crua a sheachaint.Cabhróidh bearta an bhuiséid lena chinntiú go mbíonn Éire suite go maith chun tairbhe a bhaint as nuair a thiocfaidh feabhas ar an eacnamaíocht domhanda agus nuair a bheidh ar ár gcumas tógáil arís ar éachta móra na mblianta deireanacha agus déanamh amhlaidh i slí a bheidh i gcomhréir le bainistíocht chríonna eacnamaíochta na hÉireann ina iomláine.Ba mhaith liom mo bhuíochas a ghabháil arís eile leis an dTeachta as ucht deis a thabhairt dom an fhreagra seo a thabhairt ar son mo chomhgleacaí, an tAire Batt O'Keeffe, agus an scéal a mhíniú ar a shon maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh Gaeilge agus a Roinn.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	964	My Department was established in 2002 and since then it has experienced significant functional and staffing change that has contributed to the present situation whereby the Department's staffing complement of approximately 450 Dublin-based staff is dispersed in six locations.This level of dispersal has posed considerable operational difficulties in the delivery of a satisfactory standard of accommodation in all cases. A more cohesive accommodation structure is therefore considered essential to address these difficulties. For this reason my Department, in conjunction with the Office of Public Works, has devised detailed plans to consolidate and reduce the number of buildings it currently occupies in Dublin from six to three.These plans are at an advanced stage and it is envisaged that this consolidation will be achieved by the end of 2009.  With a fewer number of buildings to manage, my Department will also be able to take a more focused and cost effective approach to the delivery of maintenance and improvement works in the future.In addition to progressing the rationalisation of the Department's accommodation portfolio, my Department has in the past year carried out a number of miscellaneous office improvement schemes such as office layout. It is planned to deliver a series of other improvements in the coming years with the assistance of the OPW.  The basic objective of these schemes is to ensure that working conditions are to an acceptable standard.

We are currently updating our Customer Charter and Action Plan, which will apply for the period 2009-2011. A customer service survey will be carried out early in 2009 as part of this exercise and the results will be published.While the 2003 Customer Service Survey was published on 14th November 2003, due to an oversight the 2005-2006 Customer Service Survey was not published on the website but was made available internally on the Staff intranet.

This discretion is provided in acknowledgement of the fact that urgent medical attention may be required for seriously injured victims and must take precedence over breath testing.In addition, a Garda may request a blood or urine sample from a driver who is in hospital following a vehicle incident, where the Garda believes that person was intoxicated.Advice has been received from the Attorney General on possible amendments to legislation to provide for mandatory alcohol testing at the scene of a collision which continues to take overriding medical circumstances into account. The issue is included in the Road Traffic and Transport Bill, which is currently being drafted.  It is expected that the Bill will be published early next year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	967	Bus services in Co Cork are provided largely by Bus Éireann. The company has a fleet of 164 buses in  Co Cork. Of these, 116 are wheelchair accessible which represents over 70% of the fleet and, as older buses are replaced, all new urban buses are required to be wheelchair accessible. In fact, all bus services in Cork city are operated with low floor buses.My Department's Sectoral Plan under the Disability Act 2005, titled ‘Transport Access for All', contains time bound targets for the progressive realisation of accessible transport in Ireland. To achieve these targets some statutory measures have been adopted and others are planned. The Plan provides that by 2015 practically all vehicles used for bus and coach services will be accessible. The Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 requires public transport service contracts to provide, inter alia, for accessibility standards for services. I intend to include a similar measure for areas outside the Greater Dublin Area as part of proposals that I am developing to modernise the 1932 Road Transport Act. I also intend that the Authority may impose minimum accessibility standards on licences for commercial bus services operated by both public and private operators.In addition, the system for tendering and procurement of services under my Department's Rural Transport Programme (RTP) has been reviewed to ensure that incentives and weightings are applied to encourage compliance with accessibility goals. Also, community owned vehicles are either already accessible or are being adapted to ensure that they meet accessibility requirements.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	968	I have confidence in the technical ability and competence of my officials in the information and communications technology area to deliver quality service to my Department.   However, I agree with the findings of the recently published Organisation Review Programme Report (ORP) that long-term unfilled vacancies together with increased workload consequent, inter alia, on the acquisition of new maritime functions have limited the capacity of the Information Services Division to deliver the full range of services.My Department's current ICT Strategy envisaged a significant increase in staffing in our Information Services Division.  However, difficulties arose in filling the vacancies in question.  Accordingly, the Division has taken steps to increase its capacity to deliver the necessary services, primarily through outsourcing work.Looking to the future, the simple solution to these challenges cannot always be the allocation of extra staffing.  While the Department wants a radical increase in the deployment of ICT, prevailing external factors place constraints on our ability to fully resource the development of the IT function. Difficult choices will have to be made in reviewing ICT priorities in light of the new constraints on budgets. My Department will also seek support from our agencies and other Departments with relevant ICT expertise to further our priorities.In this context, my officials will focus in 2009 on the development of those new systems that can have the most direct and immediate impact on the efficiency of the Department on the basis of agreed priorities.

This is in line with the commitments that I made earlier in the year and which never included a target of the second quarter 2008 for publication.The final approved policy will set out the detail of the measures which will range from cycling infrastructure and traffic management to issues such as training and awareness.  I intend that the National Cycling Policy will be not only a comprehensive response to current difficulties faced by the cycling community in terms of road priority and safety issues, but will also prove to be a springboard to creating a culture of cycling in Ireland.  In this respect I have indicated that the proposed policy should aim to increase modal share of cycling from 2% to 10% by 2020.

When I have considered the Report I will be in a position to determine if any amendments to legislation are required.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	971	I propose to take Questions Nos. 77, 83, 88 and 120 together.At the launch of Transport 21, the Government identified the projects in the national roads, public transport and regional airports sectors that it wishes to see prioritised for development in the ten-year period from 2006 to 2015 and provided indicative completion dates for the major projects contained.Significant progress has been made on Transport 21 in its first three years and a number of projects have been completed and others are well advanced in planning terms.A very extensive construction programme is also currently underway and a number of additional projects were approved recently to go to construction, including the N18 Gort to Crusheen, the Citywest Luas extension and Phase 1 of the Navan rail line.The adjustment in the capital allocation for Transport 21 in 2009 has brought about a re-examination of the priorities in the investment programme.  My priorities for investment in national roads are the completion of the major interurban network by 2010 and the progressive development of the Atlantic Road Corridor. I understand from the NRA that it is currently in the process of drawing up its programme of works for 2009 based on its funding allocation for the year.On the public transport side, the provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining investment priorities. Given their potential to greatly increase capacity of the public transport network in the Greater Dublin Area, Metro North and the DART Underground are key priorities.  Investment in increased bus capacity, subject to the outcome of the cost and efficiency review of the CIE bus companies, and bus priority are also investment priorities.The adjustment in capital funding in 2009 will not have a significant effect on the roll out of the Transport 21 public transport programme and will not result in the postponement of the start of construction of any public transport project.The planning of the major transport capital projects identified in Transport 21 is continuing and these will be released for construction as soon as they are through statutory procedures and the available financial resources permit and consistent with the priorities I have outlined.The Programme for Government contains a commitment to commence the preparation of a successor to Transport 21 in 2011.  This work will take account of the updated CSO population projections.

Notwithstanding these measures, the benefits of which have yet to be fully realised, emissions from the transport sector have continued to grow very much in line with economic growth, a trend that is normal in other developed countries.It is clear to me that more needs to be done if the transport sector is to play its part in reducing emissions generally.  I signalled that when I launched a public consultation process on sustainable transport in February of this year. The detailed issues I raised and the public's response are available on www.sustainabletravel.ie.Following on from that consultation process, it is my intention to publish the Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which will detail the measures that need to be taken not only to reduce emissions but also to enhance competitiveness, reduce congestion, deliver dividends in relation to public health and social inclusion and improve quality of life, as early as possible in 2009.

There were also difficulties in filling some of the remaining vacancies due to the specialized  nature of these posts. As a result the overall complement of ICT staff was not reached.The requirement on the Department to reduce overall staff numbers means that a number of the vacancies have had to be suppressed.As part of the Action Plan prepared in response to the findings in the Organisational Review Programme (ORP), my Department will review the allocation of resources required for delivery of our strategies, including delivery of the ICT Strategy. The Department will also seek support from our agencies and other Departments with relevant expertise to assist us in furthering ICT priorities.

In the case of Dublin Port Company, there are three local authority directors, two employee directors and one CEO director. The remaining six directors are Ministerial appointees.The Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008, which is currently at Committee Stage in the Seanad, proposes changes to the structure of port company boards. The Bill proposes to remove the statutory right for local authorities to elect three directors, and to reduce the number of employee directors in the larger port companies from two to one. This will reduce the size of the boards from the current twelve to eight.

The Sustainable Travel and Transport Action Plan, which I intend to publish early in 2009 and which benefited from consultation with relevant Departments, including the Department of Education and Science, will refer to this aspect of travel in some detail.My Department is well aware of An Taisce's Green-Schools Travel Module and I intend to continue, in 2009, to provide significant financial support to the Module, through the Dublin Transportation Office.  The Module is planned to encompass 534 schools next year.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	978	The provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining investment priorities in the coming years.   Earlier this year, I mandated the Railway Procurement Agency (RPA) to proceed with planning the delivery of Line BX/D, based on the Agency's preferred route for Line BX and the use of the Old Broadstone railway alignment for Line D.It will not be possible to fully construct Luas Line BX at the same time as construction of Metro North because of the traffic management implications which would arise in the city centre.  The RPA is developing a construction strategy for Luas Line BX, in close co-operation with Dublin City Council (DCC), which includes use of Metro North construction sites and recognises the traffic management requirements of the city centre.  The RPA is also engaging with DCC on the basis of the contemporaneous delivery of Lines BX and D. In this regard it is the intention of the RPA to make a single railway order application for the combined Line BX/D to An Bord Pleanála in the latter part of next year.The emerging preferred route for Metro West was announced by the RPA in July 2007.  The selected route alignment will connect Tallaght, Clondalkin, Liffey Valley and Blanchardstown and also connect with Metro North at Metro Park, close to Dublin Airport.  It will provide for integration with the Luas Red Line, the Kildare and Maynooth suburban rail lines and the Lucan Luas line.A further round of consultation is now underway to provide greater definition to the route after which the RPA will proceed with the preparation of a railway order application.  The RPA plans to apply for a railway order in 2009.The RPA announced the emerging preferred route corridor for the proposed Lucan-city centre Luas Line in October this year. The selected route is based on route options that were originally presented to the public in September 2007.  Having selected the route corridor, RPA will begin the next phase of consultation focused on design. This consultation will confirm the specific location of the alignment, Luas stops, Park and Ride and a depot.The second Railway Safety Programme commenced in 2004 and will be completed, as scheduled, at the end of 2008.  The programme involved a €444 million investment in renewing the Iarnród Eireann fixed infrastructure (including track, fencing, signalling,    level-crossings, bridges, cuttings and embankments etc.) in order to bring it up to an acceptable safety standard.  A further €68 million was invested in enhancing the safety culture and safety management systems in Iarnród Eireann, through measures such as safety training, development of standards, safety auditing and the development of tools such as the Risk Model and the Infrastructure Asset Management database. Discussions on the composition of the third Railway Safety Programme are ongoing.The Interconnector, which is now known as DART Underground, is planned to be completed in 2015. Further funding for this vital project was approved by my Department in November 2008 and I understand that an application for a railway order will be made in September 2009.The first phase of the Western Rail Corridor will be completed by mid-2009. I understand that further studies are planned for 2009 to determine up to date costings of phases 2 and 3 of the Western Rail Corridor.The start and completion dates of Transport 21 projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. The commencement dates for these projects will also be influenced by the time taken for public consultation, the relevant statutory process and the procurement and contract award processes.

The Deputy will be aware that both companies made public statements following the meetings.As regards the reinstatement of the Aer Lingus Shannon Heathrow service I have taken every opportunity I could since August of last year to make it clear to Aer Lingus Management and Board Members with whom I had contact to stress the importance Government attaches to the resumption of a Shannon Heathrow service. I will continue to do so in the future.

The net effect has been a significant increase in both the policy and service delivery functions of the Department and a great degree of change for staff. The frequent churn and change and the fact that the Department is evidently stretched, as acknowledged by the Organisational Review Programme (ORP) has militated against rapid re-deployment of staff to areas of greatest need in recent years.  In response to the findings of the ORP my Department has prepared an action plan which includes the implementation of a structured approach to the assignment, development and promotion of staff.  The structure of the Department is being re-aligned to focus on updated priorities and a resource capacity study will be conducted during 2009 to review the capacity of the reducing staff quota to deliver on the Department's agenda and how available resources might be deployed more efficiently.

I can appreciate the concerns that have been expressed in the region in response to this development. My colleague, Minister for Transport Noel Dempsey, T.D., recently met with representatives from county councils in Cork and Kerry who outlined to him the detrimental effects this suspension has had in the South West.Quantification of adverse effects on tourism in the region would be a matter for my colleague, the Minister for Arts, Sports and Tourism, Mr. Martin Cullen, T.D.The Port of Cork Company is continuing to engage in discussions with a number of interested parties and stakeholders with a view to the latter commencing a new passenger and freight service on the Cork-Swansea route. The Port of Cork Company also completed a feasibility study on the route and this indicated that a service, subject to procuring a suitable vessel, could be feasible for an operator for year round passenger and freight operations. The Port of Cork Company will continue to do what it can to facilitate resumption of a service.As Minister of State for Transport, I feel it is important that the market offers a diverse range of viable maritime links in and out of the State. This is vital to facilitate trade and tourism. I certainly hope that the current efforts show that the service is commercially viable and that it can be resumed as soon as possible.

As part of the airport restructuring process the boards of Cork and Shannon airport are required to prepare business plans for eventual separation.All three airport business plans have to be coordinated by the Dublin Airport Authority for eventual approval by myself and the Minister for Finance.  Among the requirements to be satisfied in advance of separation is the need to ensure the financial sustainability of all three state airports.I have now received business plans from each of the state airports and I have been in consultation with the three Airport Authorities concerning the approach to the separation of Cork and Shannon having regard to the current economic climate and trends in the aviation market generally.  I hope to announce the outcome of those consultations shortly.I should add that the repeal of the State Airports Act, 2004 does not arise.

The provision of dedicated park and ride facilities at railway stations is a matter for Irish Rail, and at Luas and proposed Metro sites it is a matter for the RPA.  Local authorities also have a role in providing commuter park and ride facilities.In the Greater Dublin Area, the TAS consultancy Report for the DTO indicated that overall bus-based park and ride has a limited role to play because of the population size and distances involved.  However, the Report indicated that there is some potential for satellite park and ride facilities.  The local authorities in the hinterland area of the Greater Dublin Area have been examining the potential of such satellite park and ride facilities, and while funding has been made available by my Department no proposals have been submitted by local authorities as yet.  In at least one case, this is due to planning difficulties.In Cork, one very successful park & ride has been developed on the southern side of the City.  A proposal for a second park and ride is currently being actively developed by Cork City Council on the western side of the city.  In Galway, Limerick, and Waterford the local authorities are continuing to examine the feasibility of permanent park & ride while a temporary Christmas park & ride is currently being operated by Galway City Council.My Department makes funding available to local authorities for the development of park and ride facilities both in the Greater Dublin Area and in the regional cities and is prepared to provide capital support for such facilities on the basis of sound business plans from proposers for the projects.I have no plans at this time for a review of park and ride provisions nationwide.

Subject to the grant of an enforceable railway order, preparatory works such as utility diversions will commence in 2009.  Good progress is also being made in planning work for the DART underground (Interconnector) and Irish Rail has set itself a target of making a railway order application in 2009.Pending the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority, the Dublin City Manager chairs the Dublin Transport 21 Implementation Group which co-ordinates and oversees the investment programme in Dublin.  The Group comprises the chief executives of the principal implementing agencies, an Assistant Secretary from my Department, the Fingal County Manager, the Director of Traffic and representatives of the Garda Síochána and business associations.Two sub-groups have been established and the business community is represented on both:The Contingency Planning Group is overseeing the preparation by Dublin City Council of a traffic management strategy for the Transport 21 construction phase, focussed particularly on the city centre.  This strategy will take account of other construction activity by local authorities, public bodies and private developers.The Communications Group is preparing a co-ordinated communications strategy for the construction period of major Transport 21 projects, such as Metro North and the Interconnector.  The theme of this strategy will be "Dublin is open for business".In addition, Dublin City Council is holding focus meetings with the city centre business community while the RPA continues to meet individual businesses and residents' organisations along the Metro North preferred alignment to inform them of its plans and to address issues of concern.  I understand that in early in 2009 a multi-agency joint strategy, including a public information and awareness campaign, will be rolled out.It will not be possible to fully construct Luas Line BX at the same time as construction of Metro North because of the traffic management implications which would arise in the city centre.  The RPA is developing a construction strategy for Luas Line BX, in close co-operation with Dublin City Council, which includes use of Metro North construction sites and recognises the traffic management requirements of the city centre.  The RPA is engaging with Dublin City Council on the basis of the contemporaneous delivery of Lines BX and D (City Centre — Liffey Junction). It is the intention of the RPA to make a single railway order application for the combined Line BX/D to An Bord Pleanála in the latter part of next year.I hold regular quarterly meetings with the Transport 21 implementing agencies, An Garda Síochána and business organisations in Dublin to identify the principal concerns of the business community and to review progress on traffic planning for the construction phase of Transport 21 projects.  I last met with the Dublin City Centre Stakeholders Group on 29 September 2008.  It was agreed at that meeting that the next meeting of the Stakeholders Group will be in January 2009.

However, the Commission does not have any remit or statutory power under the Taxi Regulation Act in relation to the control of the number of licences issued.My Department has received a copy of the opinion of the Senior Counsel on taxi deregulation referred to by the Deputy.   In response I wish to say that I have no proposals to introduce quantitative restrictions on entry to the taxi market.   I do support, however, the application of standards of a qualitative nature, which are determined by the Commission.  The proposed new standards for the taxi industry were published in November 2007 and I understand they will be introduced on a phased basis from next month and will be fully rolled out by 2012.In addition, the Commission has appointed consultants to undertake an extensive economic review of the small public service vehicle sector.  I understand that the review will be completed early in the New Year.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1005	The High Level Review of the State Commercial Ports, carried out by Raymond Burke Consulting in association with Posford Haskoning Consulting Engineers and Farrell Grant Sparks, was published in May 2003. This was the first such review of the port companies established under the terms of the Harbours Act 1996.Subsequently, the Review was the subject of an extensive public consultation process on its findings and recommendations. The work undertaken as part of the Review, and the earlier statutory Performance Audit of the State Port Companies in 2001 carried out by Jonathan Packer, together with the submissions and observations received during these processes, fed into and informed the development of the Ports Policy Statement in 2005. The development of a ports policy statement was one of the recommendations of the Review itself.A key focus of both the High Level Review and the Ports Policy Statement was the need to further enhance the commercial ethos conferred upon the port companies by the Harbours Act 1996. To that end, important recommendations were made inter alia regarding board size and composition.The Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008 is intended to give a legislative basis to these recommendations by reducing the number of directors on port company boards from 12 to 8, removing statutory local authority representation, ending the practice of appointing port users to boards and standardising the number of employee directors at one per port company.The Bill also contains other amendments to support the recommendations contained in the Review and Ports Policy Statement designed to enhance the commercial ethos of the State port companies. These proposals include allowing port companies to invest in commercial opportunities outside their harbour limits and introducing a greater degree of flexibility regarding borrowing by port companies, which will aid their continued development and progress.The High Level Review also specified the desirability of recognising the integral role of the ports sector in the overall transport chain by transferring responsibility for the ports from the then Department of Communications, Marine, Energy and Natural Resources to the Department of Transport. This transfer took place in January 2006.The High Level Review and the subsequent development of the Ports Policy Statement provided a clear framework for the development of the commercial ports sector in the State. The Harbours (Amendment) Bill 2008, when enacted, will considerably supplement the progress made since the High Level Review was published in 2003.

I will consider the report's findings upon receipt and take appropriate action.I am aware that Dublin Port Company has lodged a planning application with An Bord Pleanála under the Planning and Development (Strategic Development) Act 2006 to reclaim and develop 21 hectares of foreshore within the port area.As a "prescribed body" under that Act, I was formally notified of the application and my Department has written to An Bord Pleanála with an update on the progress of the Dublin Port study.

The mandate specifically states that the possible decisions concerned would include decisions on proposals with significant local or national economic implications including a direct impact on employment.It is a matter for the directors concerned to respect the mandate in the context of their overriding fiduciary duties under the Companies Acts to act in the best interests of the company and shareholders generally.I am pleased to note that the Unions and management at Aer Lingus have found a mutually acceptable way forward at a very challenging time for the aviation industry generally.

This  includes legislation dealing with minimum wages.If the vessel is not registered in Ireland, then the port state control inspections cover the International Maritime Organisation's various Safety and Environment Protection Conventions as well as the International Labour Organisation Conventions.  The inspection of the latter includes the welfare of the crew (food, accommodation, hours of work etc) but would exclude rates of pay.The number of marine surveyors, who carry out a range of duties, employed by my Department currently stands at 22.The figures for port state control inspections under the Paris Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) on foreign flag merchant ships visiting Irish ports in 2005 to 2007 were 422, 440, and 410 respectively. Inspections to date in 2008 are just over 400.In addition to the Port State Control Inspections, safety inspections on ro-ro passenger ferries and high-speed passenger craft operating on scheduled international routes to/from Ireland are conducted.  The figures for these inspections are 24 each year for 2005 and 2006 with 31 last year and 28 to date in 2008.Ireland has consistently supported the International Labour Organisation in its efforts to promote global labour standards for seafarers. A new consolidated Maritime Labour Convention was adopted in February 2006 at the 94th International Labour Conference in Geneva. Ireland was represented at the Conference by a tripartite delegation consisting of Government officials, nominees of the employers (IBEC) and of the workers (ICTU). The new Convention sets out clear principles and rights for seafarers. EU member states are committed to ratifying the new Convention by 31 December 2010 and it is expected to come into force internationally in 2011.

In recent months all buses in the Dublin Bus fleet have been fitted with smart card validators and smart cards are now in use on these buses in respect of a number of ticket products such as annual and monthly bus tickets, annual and monthly integrated bus and rail tickets and 5-day rambler tickets.Irish Rail will launch its own interim smart card scheme from next summer. These smart card schemes will enable both users and operators to familiarise themselves with the use and flexibilities of smart card systems in advance of the introduction of the single smart card scheme.From late next year, a single smart card will be introduced for ticket products on Dublin Bus and Luas services. This smart card will also have an electronic purse capability for use on both services.This single smart card system will then be extended to Irish Rail DART and commuter rail services within a further 12 months. The new gating systems at Irish Rail stations in the GDA have been designed to handle the new smart card.In relation to Bus Éireann, the smart card will be introduced on a pilot basis on a number of its commuter routes in late 2010. It is also envisaged that private bus operators will join the scheme over this timeframe.The overall capital budget for the project is €55.4 million.
#NoelAhern	unknown-#NoelAhern-party	unknown-#NoelAhern-dob	unknown-#NoelAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1011	My Department's approach to maritime safety involves an appropriate combination of statutory regulation, safety awareness promotion and enforcement.  The balance to be struck between regulation and safety awareness promotion has a particular significance in relation to recreational craft, which are intended for leisure and sporting purposes.  It is the responsibility of owners and operators of recreational craft to ensure that a vessel is properly operated, equipped and maintained.To assist them my Department developed and published in 2006, the Code of Practice for the Safe Operation of Recreational Craft following a public consultation process.  The Code sets out in a user-friendly way, the legislative requirements and standards relating to recreational craft and guidance on best practice.  It includes information on legal requirements on voyage planning relating to amongst other things, the capability of the boat, pre-departure safety checks and safety equipment.The Code also outlines the requirements of the Recreational Craft Directive (RCD) which has been transposed into Irish law.  The RCD provides that recreational craft placed on the market since June 1998 must comply with specified safety requirements.  These requirements include being appropriately marked with the number of persons recommended by the manufacturer for which the boat is designed to carry when underway and the manufacturer's maximum recommended load for which the boat is designed.The Code of Practice gives advice to members of the public on the purchasing of recreational craft having regard to the requirements of the Recreational Craft Directive.I consider that the legislation in place together with the Code of Practice is an appropriate and proportional response to addressing the issue of overloading on recreational craft.  If observed they can save lives.  There is an onus on all of us to take personal responsibility for our safety whether on the roads or on the water.

The implementation of individual national road projects, including the Dublin Port Tunnel, as well as the responsibility to secure the provision of a safe and efficient network of national roads, are matters for the National Roads Authority (NRA) under the Roads Act, 1993 in conjunction with the local authorities concerned.The construction of the Dublin Port Tunnel project was procured by Dublin City Council and funded through the NRA.  In relation to cost matters, discussions between the contractor and Dublin City Council concerning the finalisation of outstanding cost issues are continuing, utilising the relevant mechanisms set out in the contract between the parties, and I understand that good progress has been made in this area.

#BrianCowen	unknown-#BrianCowen-party	unknown-#BrianCowen-dob	unknown-#BrianCowen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1019	I propose to take Questions Nos. 134, 135, 140 and 141 together.I am advised by the Attorney General that when seeking contract drafters the Office of the Attorney General requires candidates to possess very high levels of skill and experience in common-law jurisdiction.  Many have formerly been heads of Offices in their own jurisdictions and all come with the highest recommendations.  Where it is necessary, the Office arranges appropriate training to ensure that such staff are fully competent to perform any particular task they are assigned.  This is in accordance with Office practice as training is available to all Office staff as necessary.Contract drafters are given any necessary guidance in relation to relevant issues including Irish Constitutional Law, Administrative Law, European Law and the European Convention on Human Rights.  It is not a requirement that contract drafters have a prior knowledge of Irish and European Community Law on their engagement as this expertise already exists in the Office.  Contract drafters are assigned to Groups within the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel to the Government.  These Groups are headed by permanent Parliamentary Counsel at Assistant Secretary and higher level who provide the necessary expertise where required, including in Constitutional, Irish and European law.  These Parliamentary Counsel monitor and guide the work of the contract drafters and deal with issues on drafting files as appropriate.  Additionally, as with all drafting staff, contract staff work closely with Advisory Counsel in the AGO who are specialists in their legal field.  Contract drafters are supplied with the Office's Drafting Manuals and this assists in ensuring a standard approach.  Finally, of course, like all drafters, contract drafters work in close liaison with the Departments sponsoring the Bills and statutory instruments that they are drafting.There are procedures within the Office for quality assurance of all drafting files prior to the transmission of final drafts of legislation to client Departments. Furthermore, where legal issues arise on drafting files, requests for advice are made to Advisory Counsel and in some cases submissions are made by the Advisory Counsel to the Attorney General in relation to these issues.It should also be noted that contact drafters have, allied to their extensive drafting skills, and experience, brought other insights and expertise into the Office.  Their advice in respect of Bill management at Government level and their knowledge of other jurisdictions' steps to improve the clarity of legislation have been of much assistance to the Office in developing its views and know-how on these matters.  This is an important contribution to the continuous development of skills and expertise in the Office.  The Office also utilises the skills and experience of the contract staff in the training of its own permanent staff.

It is applicable to all staff and sets out the policy regarding appropriate hotel accommodation to be used.  The aims of the travel policy are to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.Hotel bookings in relation to my official foreign travel are made by the Department of Foreign Affairs in consultation with the host Government and the local Irish Embassy.  In regard to procurement arrangements for sourcing hotel accommodation, the central contract for travel booking services for government officials includes provision for making hotel reservations.  This contract is currently held by Club Travel Limited and was awarded following an EU-level advertised procurement process conducted under the lead of the Department of Finance earlier this year.With regard to Departmental staff, in most instances, hotel bookings are centrally co-ordinated by my Department's Finance Unit which ensures that the travel policy and Department of Finance guidelines are complied with.  A designated Travel Officer has responsibility for making bookings on the basis of a decision by the Department of the options put forward by Club Travel.  Where exceptionally, Department officials book their own hotel accommodation, they are required to adhere to the Department's Travel Policy.The procurement arrangements in NESDO are to select a hotel which is convenient to the location of the official business and which is competitively priced.  With regard to the Central Statistics Office (CSO), the normal civil service rules for travel and subsistence expenses apply to staff of the CSO travelling on official business. Staff claim travel and overnight expenses in accordance with the rules and rates appropriate to the relevant destination. In general, staff travelling on official business make hotel bookings themselves and pay directly for their accommodation.As a decentralised Office, the CSO occasionally pays directly for hotel accommodation in Ireland, for a small number of meetings involving staff from the Dublin and Cork offices.  When the CSO sources accommodation for official purposes (e.g. meetings, interview rooms, overnight accommodation) the Office follows national procurement guidelines.  All bookings are made on the basis of the most economically advantageous tender.

No. 370 of 2006). These Regulations were subsequently revoked by and reincorporated in the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work (General Application) Regulations 2007 (S.I. No. 299 of 2007) in an exercise of consolidation and simplification of regulatory provisions in the area of occupational safety and health.Specifically, Chapter 2 of Part 5, Regulations 133 to 142, and Schedule 6 of the 2007 General Application Regulations retransposed Directive 2002/44/EC into Irish law.This Chapter sets out requirements relating to the control of vibration at work including exposure limit values and action values, determination and assessment of risks, provisions aimed at avoiding or reducing exposure, employee information and training, health surveillance, records and effects and exemptions. Regulation 134, inter alia, provides that Regulation 139, relating to the application of exposure limit values, applies on and after 6 July 2010, but not until then, where work equipment is used which was first provided to employees before 6 July 2007 by an employer, and does not permit compliance with the exposure limit values.

None has been recovered or found.  There have been no other computers or data devices reported lost, missing or stolen during this period.It is my Department's policy to invoke the facility to remotely erase all data from a BlackBerry device as soon as it is reported missing, and immediately cancel the subscription with the service provider.  In the case of the stolen BlackBerry it was not possible to do this locally and the device was disabled by the service provider at my Department's request.It is also the policy in my Department to encrypt all new laptops before they are issued.  A project to encrypt all laptops already issued to officers of my Department is currently underway and should be completed by year-end. The two missing laptops were not encrypted but they were reported not to contain any sensitive or private data at the time of their loss.

In accordance with Department of Finance travel and subsistence regulations, staff are usually paid a flat rate allowance in such circumstances to cover their combined accommodation and subsistence costs.  My Department does not generally receive or record details of their hotel costs.Occasionally, my Department organises meetings in hotels which necessarily require accommodation for some staff of the Department.  The accommodation costs in such cases usually form part of a wider package of conference facilities and are paid as part of a total invoice.  The accommodation costs are not recorded separately on my Department's accounting systems in such instances.Where an officer avails of hotel accommodation while engaged on official business abroad, he/she may be reimbursed expenses by way of: (a) a flat-rate allowance to cover combined accommodation and subsistence costs, or (b) vouched accommodation costs, with a reduced subsistence allowance.Any hotel accommodation costs reimbursed by my Department in these situations are aggregated with associated subsistence costs on my Department's accounting systems and are not recorded separately.Similar procedures also apply in relation to hotel accommodation costs for myself and my Ministers of State.  In accordance with Department of Finance travel and subsistence regulations, Ministers and Ministers of State are reimbursed vouched accommodation costs and receive a reduced subsistence allowance for overnight absences on official business, whether in Ireland or abroad.  However, the accommodation costs are not recorded separately on my Department's accounting systems.It is not feasible, therefore, to identify separately the amount of money spent on hotel accommodation by my Department, as this exercise would require every expenses claim and a number of individual invoices processed by my Department to be reviewed.  My Department processes several thousand expenses claims each year.Expenditure on hotel accommodation by the State agencies under the aegis of my Department is an administrative matter for the agencies concerned and my Department does not have direct access to those details.

Public Procurement procedures apply in organising such meetings.With regard to the sourcing of hotel accommodation for official business abroad, my Department, together with a number of other Government Departments, has engaged the services of a travel management company to process flight and hotel bookings.  The contract for these services was awarded following a public tendering process managed by the Department of Finance.  The service provided by the travel management company allows my Department to access competitive hotel rates abroad, often at short notice and in times of peak demand.In some situations, hotel accommodation for Ministerial visits abroad is organised through the Department of Foreign Affairs or by agencies such as IDA Ireland and Enterprise Ireland.  My Department does not have any role in the selection of hotels in these instances.The procurement of hotel accommodation by the State agencies under my Department's remit is an administrative matter for the agencies concerned and my Department does not have direct access to the details of their procurement arrangements.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1040	The information requested by the Deputy insofar as my Department is concerned is set out in the tabular statement below.The figures provided relate to consultancies as defined in the Department of Finance December 2006 "Guidelines for the Engagement of Consultants and Other External Support by the Civil Service".My Department continues to seek greater efficiencies, effectiveness and value for money in the administration of its financial resources.  My Department's requirements for consultancy only arise where appropriate skills, knowledge or expertise are not available within the Department, or where a particular need arises that cannot be addressed within the resources available.  When it becomes necessary to engage consultants, Government tendering procedures are followed, which ensures that contracts are awarded to the most suitable and cost effective tenderer.  Where possible, my Department utilises the expertise available in other Government Departments and Offices, such as obtaining legal advice from the Chief State Solicitors Office in preference to engaging external consultants.A feature of the Department's procedures for approving funding for consultancies under the Consultancy Subhead (Subhead A07) or, indeed, the Research Subhead (Subhead U), is that before any funding is approved by the Management Board of my Department, the Line Section requesting such funding must make a strong business case, outlining the anticipated benefits, the value-added nature of the consultancy, and the argument for engaging outside consultants in preference to undertaking the work using the internal resources of the Section.I would point out to the Deputy that, even on occasions where consultants are engaged, significant skills transfers occur.  Additionally, training and development resources are allocated to encourage participation in appropriate third level and postgraduate courses, designed to meet the business goals of the Department.  During the period in question (i.e. 2007 & 2008), thirty-one staff participated in courses designed to enhance their competencies in the areas of policy analysis, economic policy studies and project management.  This training will contribute towards reducing dependency on consultants in future years.  Furthermore, a number of officers in my Department have undertaken training courses provided through the Department of Finance's Expenditure Reviewers Network, to provide them with the appropriate skills sets and techniques to undertake work which may otherwise have needed to be undertaken by external consultants.  Although the input of consultants is still sometimes required in some expenditure reviews, the level of input and the associated expenditure is considerably reduced.In light of the need to pursue greater efficiencies and value for money, my Department will continue to endeavour to ensure that any funding provided for consultancies is necessary, and results in the optimal use of the Department's financial and human resources.Name of ConsultantsPurposeCost€Leo BurnettAdvertising increase in National Minimum Wage50,163Corporate Risk Strategies Ltd (CRS)Prepare a Health and Safety report on each of the Department’s buildings together with the appropriate Safety Statements.24,200ESRINational Survey on Workplace Bullying84,232Tom WalshTo provide advice to the Department on the development of occupational health and safety policy and legislation81,493Arup Consulting EngineersTo support the Department in its review of Review of Dangerous Substances legislation28,814Indecon Economic ConsultantsTo prepare a report on the EU Emissions Trading Scheme.30,000Indecon ConsultantsPrepare a Report — Value for Money Review of Science Foundation Ireland (SFI)111,244The Media GroupTo devise, implement and manage a national promotion and advertising campaign across a range of media for the ICT Audits Programme for Small Business in Ireland135,000Noel J.

This situation is unwelcome and is an indication of the challenges that are now facing the labour market and that are within the economy as a whole.The Government is taking specific measures to address this challenge and to ensure that job losses are minimised as much as possible and for as short a time as possible.  The enterprise development agencies, along with FÁS the employment and training authority, are actively engaged in facilitating job opportunities in Kildare.At present there are 25 IDA Ireland supported companies in Kildare employing approximately 10,356 people.  Kildare has in recent years attracted some world class manufacturing companies including Wyeth Medica, Braun Oral B, Intel and Hewlett Packard.  The Millennium Park in Naas has three modern 40,000 sq.ft. advance office buildings which are now available for marketing to inward investors, with  all the necessary infrastructure, including ducting for broadband.New indigenous companies have also been established and have created new employment in the county.  The major €22.6 million expansion investment, supported by Enterprise Ireland, is underway and on target in Green Isle Foods.  It is expected to lead to the creation of 130 new jobs in the area.  A major investment of €28 million also is underway in Dawn Farm Foods Ltd.  Overall 100 new jobs will be created.FÁS is providing a number of training and employment programmes in Kildare and has, with the Local Employment Services, geared up its Employment Services further to provide increased capacity for increased referrals from the Live Register.
#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1043	IDA Ireland is the agency with statutory responsibility for the attraction of foreign direct investment to Ireland and its regions.  The marketing of individual areas, including Kildare, for new or expansion FDI investments and jobs is a day-to-day operational matter for the Agency.  While I may give general policy directives to the Agency, I am precluded under the Acts from giving directives regarding individual undertakings or from giving preference to one area over others.I travel abroad on missions organised by IDA Ireland to assist the Agency in the attraction of foreign direct investment to this country.  These visits are targeted at specific sectors and do result, in some cases, in follow up visits by foreign companies to this country.  The arrangement of such itineraries, is a day to day operational matter for the Agency and not one in which I have a function.  In the final analysis, it is the investing company, who decides where to invest and where to visit.  However I have been informed by IDA Ireland that there have been 2 IDA sponsored  itineraries to Kildare during 2008.I also travel on trade missions abroad that are organised by Enterprise Ireland.  The aim of these visits is to promote the exports of goods and services produced in this country into foreign markets and to thereby grow indigenous Irish firms.

I understand that the Board of IDA approved the sale of all these lands to Kildare County Council at its Board meeting on April 9th 2003.  However, this transaction was never finalised due to a failure in negotiations.The Agency also has  approximately 1.72 hectares available in Tipper Road NaasIDA is currently reviewing the future use of  all these lands. As part of this review, in November 2008 IDA had meetings with Kildare County Council to determine their interest in the acquisition of these lands. At present these discussions are ongoing pending a review of the current land prices.

#MaryCoughlan	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-party	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-dob	unknown-#MaryCoughlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1048	I have previously advised the House of the Government's concerns in relation to the importance of retailers passing on to consumers the benefits of the Euro's appreciation in value against Sterling. Given widespread concerns that consumers were not enjoying these benefits in terms of the prices that they pay for goods, particularly goods sourced in the UK, I initiated an engagement with the retail sector in June of this year as to the reasons why the benefits of the Euro's appreciation were not being passed on to consumers. In the course of that engagement I met with IBEC and leading members of Retail Ireland, and also wrote to major individual retailers to express the Government's concern on this matter.By way of response, retailers advised that while the retail price of goods imported from the UK had lagged exchange rate movements due to factors such as the forward purchase of goods and currency, there had already been reductions in the price of some goods and further reductions were in the pipeline. In this regard, I would acknowledge that since my initial engagement with the sector in June, there has been some reduction in prices and the Deputy will be aware of the price campaigns of the various retailers, which has helped to some degree in the ongoing reduction in the annual inflation figure.Notwithstanding these welcome price reductions, concerns still remain in relation to the differential in prices between the north and south. Retailers have contended that one of the main reasons for this price differential is that the cost of doing business in Ireland is significantly higher than that in the UK. To that end, in September of this year, I requested Forfás to carry out an analysis of the relative cost of doing business in a number of locations in the Republic, Northern Ireland and the UK.  I expect to receive Forfás' analysis of its findings on this matter very shortly. I recently met again with the retail sector to discuss some of Forfás' preliminary findings and to reiterate the Government's concerns in relation to the level of the differential in prices between the north and the south.It is my strong view that where there are significant differentials in consumer prices and retailers have a duty to their customers and to the economies in which they operate to explain why there are such differentials. It is my intention to continue to pursue this matter with the retail sector.

Incremental increases are not therefore individually costed and there is no separate provision for incremental increases in my Department's estimates.  Therefore it is not possible to provide the Deputy with the information requested for the years 2002 to 2008 or for 2009.The cost of incremental pay increases awarded to existing staff in the agencies under the remit of my Department is a day to day matter for the agencies concerned.

The number of staff in this decentralised advance office is 98.  This number is expected to increase to 103 in 2009 with the balance of staff decentralised in 2010.  Of the 98 staff in place in Carlow, 60 have decentralised from Dublin and 38 from outside Dublin.Health and Safety AuthorityUnder the decentralisation programme, 110 staff of the Health and Safety Authority were assigned to decentralise to Thomastown, Co Kilkenny. In anticipation of the move to Thomastown, the Authority established an interim office in Kilkenny city in August 2006.The Authority currently has 33 staff based in its interim office in Kilkenny.  Of these, 7 staff have relocated from its Dublin Office and the remaining 26 staff have been assigned to Kilkenny on recruitment to the Authority.Significant further progress on decentralisation within the Authority awaits the review of decentralisation to be completed in 2011.FÁSThere are currently 25 posts in Birr and all of these posts have been transferred from Head Office, Dublin.FÁS will continue to seek to accommodate 15 additional posts for transfer to Birr, as the vacancies arise.

Since the budget announcement my Department has being working in conjunction with both bodies to bring about a smooth transition to a unified single body to oversee the area of competition and consumer protection.As both the National Consumer Agency and the Competition Authority were established under statute, it will be necessary to give effect to the newly merged body by way of primary legislation. It is my intention to bring forward the necessary legislation to give effect to this merger as soon as possible. In so far as cost savings are concerned, whilst it is expected that the synergies arising from the merger of the two bodies will result in savings to the Exchequer, particularly in areas such as shared services, it is not possible to precisely quantify the amount of savings involved at this stage.

The Network currently has over 170 active mentors.  I am informed that the number of new mentors to be added in 2009 will be determined by client demand.The Enterprise Ireland Mentor Network was set up in 1988, and has provided thousands of Irish companies across the sectors with tailored advice, guidance and support, helping them accelerate growth and build management capability.  Enterprise Ireland has published a Best Practice Guide which incorporates elements of International Best Practice and ensures the Mentor service is delivered to a consistently high standard across the Network.The Mentor Network carries out approximately 300 assignments a year for Enterprise Ireland clients and also for clients of the County Enterprise Boards.  Mentors on the Enterprise Ireland Network are successful senior executives, entrepreneurs or owner managers who volunteer to advise clients based on their own business experience.Each year the service develops in order to be able to assist Irish companies to meet the challenges and opportunities they face.  In 2009 the services of the Mentor Network will be expanded to:First Time Exporter clients of the County Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland under the First Flight programme.Mentors with significant experience of diverse economic conditions that can advise companies throughout 2009.Mentors with experience in the high growth markets where new opportunities exist, e.g. Brazil, China, India, Russia and the Gulf States.Enterprise Ireland is also leveraging the deep experience that exists within the mentor network through utilising the mentors as advisers on the International Selling Programme that will have between 75 and 90 companies participating next year.Enterprise Ireland also has a number of senior executives in international markets that mentor and advise our client companies.The County and City Enterprise Boards are the principal government agencies at local level with responsibility for enterprise promotion and micro business development. The key objectives of the Boards are to stimulate and promote local enterprise culture and entrepreneurship and to assist new business start ups and the expansion and growth of existing small business. The Enterprise Boards pursue these objectives by providing a number of crucial management and capability development or soft support services to businesses and individuals across a diverse range of sectors, including a business information service, business mentoring, business consultancy, business training programmes and various business networking opportunities.  Over 143,000 people have participated on the various Management Development and Mentoring Programmes available from the CEBs since their inception in 1993 to end 2007.

Business advice, mentoring and management capability and development programmes are provided as part of this assistance.The UK health check system referred to by the Deputy is an on-line web based facility which enterprises may use to assist them to identify key areas of potential weakness in their businesses.  Where such weaknesses are identified, individuals are generally directed to obtain specific advice and assistance. The UK facility is similar to the European Commission's "Vaccinate Your Business Against Bad Times" available to SMEs in all Member States, including Ireland, through the Commission's "European Portal for SMEs".In view of the assistance already provided by the State development agencies, I have no plans to introduce a specific on-line web based facility similar to the UK.  The agencies are already responding to the challenges presented by the current economic difficulties.  The type of assistance from these agencies is kept under review and will be modified to reflect changing needs of enterprise.

As National Authority for the ESF, my Department receives all ESF monies paid to Ireland by the European Commission.  The ESF received by Ireland is used for the implementation of agreed Programmes or Initiatives, which are implemented by a range of Government Departments and States Agencies, and my Department transfers ESF payments to the Departments and Agencies concerned.For the 2007 to 2013 round of funding the European Commission has allocated a total of €375.36 million of assistance to Ireland from the ESF.  A total of  €18.768 has been received to date.Under the 2000 to 2006 round of funding a total of €1,030.05 million has been received to date by Ireland through the ESF.  That assistance was delivered through five Operational Programmes operated by various Departments and Agencies.

However, the IMF has indicated that Latvia is experiencing a sharp downturn in output growth and external funding pressures and that accordingly the Latvian authorities have asked the Fund, together with the EU, to provide technical and financial support.Under Council Regulation 332/2002, the EU can grant medium-term financial assistance to Member States outside the Euro area. This arises from Article 119 of the Treaty, which says assistance can be provided to a member "in difficulties or seriously threatened with difficulties as regards its balance of payments either as a result of an overall disequilibrium in its balance of payments or as a result of the type of currency at its disposal". The Council Presidency and the Commission are in close consultations with the Latvian authorities and the International Monetary Fund with a view to developing a joint response to the economic and financial situation in Latvia.  It is expected that an agreed funding package will be decided on shortly.

Instances of non-compliance with registration plate regulations are initially dealt with by means of verbal or written warnings and subsequently followed up by officials to confirm that the position has been regularised.In the course of such checks, sixty-nine formal warnings issued for non-compliance with VRT number plate regulations in 2008. Follow-up assurance checks have confirmed compliance with the regulations, following the issue of warnings. Accordingly, no summonses were issued to date in 2008 for contravention of the VRT number plate regulations.The Deputy will be aware that An Garda Síochána also has a role to play in policing number plate legislation.

However, to take account of the wide variation in circumstances that can arise with foreign travel, in some cases, instead of an overall subsistence rate, the cost of the accommodation can be separately claimed by the official. In such cases, the rate of subsistence is reduced. There are different rates for different locations. Accommodation is generally arranged by the officers themselves.From time to time the Revenue Commissioners books hotels for conferences, seminars etc. Given the geographic spread of Revenue staff, it will be appreciated that such events may include overnight accommodation. To ensure optimum value for money, the accommodation costs for staff can be included as part of the overall package agreed with the hotel, with corresponding reductions in subsistence payments.  Procurement for this type of accommodation is carried out in accordance with EU and National guidelines.When I travel abroad on official business the relevant Embassy advises on the most suitable accommodation.

At my meetings with certain financial institutions over the last two weeks, I asked those institutions covered by the Government's guarantee Scheme to consider the contribution that they can make to the economy through appropriate credit initiatives in relation to small and medium sized businesses and otherwise.  I have, therefore, welcomed the fact that certain institutions have announced initiatives in this regard.The Deputy may also wish to be aware that I recently met Mr Plutarchos Sakellaris, Vice-President of the European Investment Bank, which recently announced that it was providing additional funding through its lending facility for SMEs in the European Union.  Mr Sakellaris confirmed that the Bank has been in discussion with a number of Irish financial institutions about participating in this facility for SMEs and that the EIB hopes that agreements to provide such loan facilities can be finalised as soon as possible.   I have urged Irish banks to utilise the facility to the maximum extent possible with a view to making the additional funding available to SMEs as soon as possible. It is therefore pleasing to note that a number of banks have announced their intention to do so.  Additionally, with my colleague, the Tánaiste and Minster for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, I have been in regular contact with the banks regarding the flow of lending to small business.The Central Bank's October Monthly Statistics showed that lending to the Irish economy was essentially flat in October and this is a matter of concern. However, we should be cautious about drawing strong conclusions from one month's data. Forfás/Enterprise Ireland are surveying 200 clients or County Enterprise Boards and Enterprise Ireland in order to gather more detailed information.

Relevant notes relating to items in the table are also set out below.Projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the data requested by the Deputy for the years 2006 to 2009 in relation to the above mentioned reliefs.The numbers availing represent income earners who were in a position to absorb at least some of the tax relief and thereby give rise to an Exchequer cost. They do not include the numbers of potential claimants whose entitlements to other tax reliefs were sufficient to reduce their liability to tax to nil without reference to the specific relief. The numbers availing are rounded to the nearest hundred as appropriate.A married couple who has elected or has been deemed to have elected for joint assessment is counted as one tax unit.2002200320042005Tax Relief ProvisionEstimated cost1Estimated cost1Estimated cost1Estimated cost1INCOME TAX€mNumbers€mNumbers€mNumbers€mNumbers

They include the cost of marginal relief for taxpayers whose incomes are not greatly in excess of the exemption limits.(3) The figures shown for the basic personal tax credits (married, single and widowed) are the costs of these tax credits as if all other tax credits and the exemption limits did not apply. They do not include individuals who are not on Revenue records because their incomes are below the income tax thresholds.(4) Arising from the change over to Tax Relief at Source the figures relate to the number of policies issued. These include policies where subscriptions were paid by businesses on behalf of their employees.(5) Part of the cost of contributions to Permanent Health Benefit Schemes is not identifiable as a result of the move to a "net pay" basis for contributions by PAYE taxpayers from 6 April 2001.(6) See the following table "Green Paper on Pensions" for background commentary and cost figures for 2006.(7) Arising from the work on the "Green Paper on Pensions" (2007) the basis for costing this item has been changed and is not directly comparable with the figures for earlier years. See also the following table "Green Paper on Pensions" for more recent figures.(8) The figures shown for Personal Retirement Savings Accounts for 2004 are derived from personal tax returns and are understated because they do not include contributions made by employers or by employees through their employers. See 2005 and the following table "Green Paper on Pensions" for more complete figures.(9) "Other" relates to borrowings for purposes such as acquiring an interest in a company or partnership or to pay death duties.(10) The cost of exempting the income of charities, colleges, hospitals, schools, friendly societies, etc. from income tax includes the sums repaid in respect of tax credits and income tax deducted at source (certain dividends, other investment income and payments received under covenant), donations made by the PAYE sector to approved bodies but does not include income tax relief in respect of donations made by the self-employed. It also includes the cost of exempting certain bodies from the deduction on income arising from government securities. Information is not available about other income received gross.(11) The cost figures for relief for donations to Approved Sports Bodies and for certain Sports Persons are based on self assessment returns.(12) In the absence of other information, tax has been assumed at the standard rate of income tax even though a different rate might be appropriate in many cases.(13) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with "unused capital allowances", that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company's profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. It is estimated that €3500 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2005 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided.(14) The tax cost shown for section 23 type relief is the estimated ultimate tax cost relating to the total allowable expenditure in respect of claims  made in 2004 and 2005 tax returns for the first time. The cost shown is for income tax cases only.Green Paper on Pensions — updated estimates of cost for 2006As part of the work on the Green Paper on Pensions, a review was carried out of the current regime of incentives for supplementary pension provision with a view to developing more comprehensive and reliable estimates of the cost of reliefs in this area. The review examined, among other things, the current reliefs and incentives for investment in supplementary pensions and the data available on which to base reliable estimates of the costs in revenue foregone to the Exchequer.The review drew on newly available 2006 aggregate data on contributions to pension schemes by employers and employees arising from a P35 initiative introduced on foot of provisions that were included in Finance Act 2004 with a view to improving data quality. Arising from the review, estimates of the cost of tax for private pension provision for 2006 have been made. As similar data sources would not be available for previous years, it is not possible to provide costings on a similar basis for those years except in the case of 2005 for which tentative estimates have been compiled.Estimated costsNumbers*€millionEmployees’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes540680,000Employers’ Contributions to approved Superannuation Schemes120362,000**Estimated cost of exemption of employers’ contributions from employee BIK510362,000Exemption of investment income and gains of approved Superannuation Funds1,200Not availableRetirement Annuity Contracts (RACs)380Not available for 2006Personal Retirement Savings Accounts (PRSAs)12071,500Estimated cost of tax relief on “tax-free” lump sum payments130Estimated cost of PRSI and Health Levy relief on employee and employer contributions220Not availableGross cost of tax relief3,220Estimated tax yield from payment of pension benefits320Net cost of tax relief2,900*Numbers as included in P35 returns from employers to Revenue for 2006.

The information provided covers the period from 2002 to 2006, the latest year for which most of the necessary detailed data is available. Data is not yet available for 2007 as the tax returns for that year are currently being processed. Tax returns for 2008 are not due until next year. Projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macro-economic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the information requested by the Deputy for 2009 in relation to these reliefs.A number of tax reliefs, credits and deductions (for example, personal credits, pension contributions, BES, Film relief and property based tax incentives), which are also available to self-employed and PAYE taxpayers, are not exclusively available for business reasons and have not been included in the table.20022003200420052006Title of Relief/ CreditNo’sCostNo’sCostNo’sCostNo’sCostNo’sCost€m€m€m€m€mCapital Allowances (1)N/Av1595.0250,0001580.3272,3001683.6266,2001877.5N/AvN/AvEffective Rate of 10% for Manufacturing and Certain Other Activities (2)4,7201174.13770525.73,361354.13,034396.02,831384.1 (provisional)Group Relief1,290166.81,400150.71,472207.61,578421.61,592255.6 (provisional)Research & Development  Tax Credit (3)N/AvN/AvN/AvN/Av7370.513565.214174.7 (provisional)Exemption for patent incomeN/AvN/AvN/AvN/Av84962.8103075.6112083.8 (provisional)Relief for Management Expenses64554.064064.759247.862751.973153.7 (provisional)Stock Relief (4)N/Av1.9N/Av1.9N/Av1.9N/Av2.0N/AvN/Av(1) The cost shown for capital allowances does not include any cost associated with "unused capital allowances", that is, capital allowances which are not absorbed by a company in the accounting period in which they arise because they exceed the amount of the company's profits of that accounting period which are available for offset. Unused capital allowances can be offset as losses against taxable profits arising in the previous accounting period and against certain profits arising in future accounting periods and can be offset against the profits of another company in the same group of companies. As an example, it is estimated that €3500 million of unused capital allowances were claimed in respect of 2005 accounting periods but as the proportion of this item which is included in previous years losses and in group relief is not separately identifiable a reliable estimate of the cost of the capital allowance element cannot be provided. The figures shown for 2002 are an estimate.(2) The cost does not include any notional cost associated with IFSC companies. The International Financial Services activity in Ireland represents new business which has developed as a result of, among other things, the concessionary tax rate. This means that as the cost of the concessionary rate is not just the difference between the concessionary tax rate and the full tax rate, it is therefore not quantifiable. In regard to the cost shown for the effective rate of 10 per cent for manufacturing and certain other activities, no account is taken of the fact that without these incentives, many enterprises may not have set up here. To the extent that profits earned by such enterprises would not have been available for Irish tax purposes, part of the cost figure shown might be regarded as notional.(3) The cost shown for R&D is for claims for R&D on corporation tax returns for accounting periods ending in years 2004 (when the scheme commenced), 2005 and 2006. However, the cost includes the cost associated with claims where the company was entitled to the credit but was unable to absorb it in that accounting year.(4) Tentative estimate.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1074	As I stated in my replies to oral questions last week, all indications are that economic activity in 2009 will contract by significantly more than the forecast in the recent Budget with an overall contraction of perhaps somewhere in the region of 3 to 4 per cent.At Budget time, I identified that there were significant risks to the economic and fiscal forecasts for 2008 and for 2009. The further deterioration in tax receipts in 2008, as seen by the end-November Exchequer Returns, the continuing weakening of consumer and investor confidence, adverse currency movements, continued difficulty in the international financial markets and depressed economic conditions, are all evidence of those risks materialising. The drop in the 2008 revenue take alone would push the 2009 General Government Deficit up by about €1.5 billion to 7¼ per cent of GDP. In addition, each 1 per cent decline in economic activity in 2009 beyond the contraction of 1 per cent already forecast would increase the General Government Deficit by about ½ per cent.The Budget day forecast for unemployment next year was based on the assumption that while employment would decline, reflecting the contraction in activity, there would be some easing in the growth of labour supply, brought about by lower participation rates and lower rates of migration. Clearly if, as I have already indicated, the economy is now likely to contract significantly more than previously expected, this will have an impact on the outlook for the labour market.Upon receipt of the end-year fiscal data and the latest economic data, including the third quarter national income data and December Live Register figures, a revised economic and fiscal assessment will be prepared by my Department in early January and brought forward for Government consideration. This assessment will reflect the dramatically changed environment now being faced.In light of the further deterioration in the economic and budgetary situation, the Government is continuing to identify measures to ensure the sustainability of the public finances, while also focusing on areas that can expand the productive capacity of the economy. In this regard, the Taoiseach will shortly publish a programme for the renewal of the economy. The stabilisation of the public finances is the central immediate element of this framework.

I can say that Ryanair released its formal offer document on 15 December and, as the Deputy is aware from recent comments from the Minister for Transport, the Government will evaluate the offer from the perspective of the Government as a shareholder and having regard to a range of issues including Ireland's aviation policy.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1081	The National Treasury Management Agency have advised me that the current aversion to risk in global markets has led to an increase in the cost of insuring exposure to all counterparties, and the associated increase in credit spreads has more to do with the general sentiment in the credit markets than the financial position of individual issuers.  Irish government debt has not been immune to this trend.  However, while the Government's bank guarantee scheme is certainly a contributory factor to the increase, the market for Irish government credit default swaps is small and prices quoted are volatile. Also, it should be noted that such spreads represent a cost to the investor and do not directly affect the cost of debt to the Exchequer.The following table sets out CDS prices for Irish and German Government bonds on the 29th and 30th of September and at close of business yesterday.29/09/0830/09/0816/12/08Ireland 5 year CDS32.960.4189.7German 5 year CDS8.812.347.5Ireland has the top AAA rating from all the major rating agencies.  In assessing overall credit worthiness, consideration has to be given to the overall level of government debt.  The government debt ratio was forecast in Budget 2009 to be around 36% of GDP at end-2008.  This ratio does not take into the account the assets of the National Pensions Reserve Fund or the significant cash balances that the NTMA has built up for the Exchequer.  When the assets of the NPRF are netted off, the projected net indebtedness position for end-2008, as set out in Budget 2009, is in the region of 25% of GDP.  The projected EU average for end 2008 is around 60% of GDP.  However, given the continuous deterioration in the public finances, as evidenced in the end-November Exchequer returns, and the downside risks to growth next year, it is inevitable that our borrowing will rise in the years ahead. The Government is concerned at such a development and is giving priority to stabilising and restoring the public finances to a sustainable position, particularly by bringing the current budget back to balance as soon as possible.

However, the main principle is that the Minister for Finance estimates an aggregate cost that the State will bear as a consequence of the guarantee and each covered institution will pay its share in accordance with its risk profile and the guarantee charging model, subject to the estimated cost to the Exchequer being fully recouped.  In case the actual cost for the State is higher, the charge will be adapted accordingly.The Deputy will be aware that a cost of €1 billion over two years was the original estimate for recouping the cost to the State of extra borrowing. Nothing has yet arisen to suggest that this estimate was inaccurate. The cost of public borrowing constantly changes in the financial markets in response to many different influences, and there is no reason to suggest that these changes are all driven by the guarantee scheme.

The estimated costs are set out as follows.YearEstimated Tax ForgoneNumbers of individual  claimants€m200322239,800200428450,800200539360,6002006 (provisional)57263,700The estimates are based on assuming that tax relief was allowed at the top income tax rate of 42% and the figures provided could therefore be regarded as the maximum Exchequer cost in respect of those taxpayers.Corresponding suitable data is not available for the year 2002. I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that data for the tax year 2007 is not yet available as the appropriate income tax returns for that year which were recently due for filing are currently being processed. It should be noted that any corresponding data returned by PAYE taxpayers in the income tax return form 12 is not captured in the Revenue computer system. However, any PAYE taxpayer with non-PAYE income greater than €3,174 is required to complete an income tax return form 11. This return is the source of the figures provided in this reply.Projections for income tax receipts are based on assumed movements in macroeconomic parameters and not by reference to the costs of individual tax reliefs. Accordingly, I am not in a position to provide the data requested by the Deputy for the years 2007 to 2009 in relation to this relief.Income tax relief is also claimed by individuals who have invested in private residential property under the various property based tax incentive schemes in the categories of urban renewal, town renewal, seaside resort, rural renewal, living over the shop, park and ride, student accommodation, holiday cottages and housing for the elderly and infirm.  Based on information that has been received and collated to date for the tax years 2004, 2005 and 2006, the position in terms of estimated tax relief allowed in respect of these schemes is set out in the following table.No specific Revenue information on the cost of these schemes is available for the tax year 2003 or previous years and I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that data for the tax year 2007 is not yet available as the appropriate income tax returns for that year have only recently been filed and have not yet been processed.

This applied, not only to non-domiciled business executives, but to all non-domiciled individuals working in the State.  As the Deputy is aware, that type of remittance basis gave rise to a number of abuses and, as a result,it was curtailed in the Finance Act 2006.With effect from 1 January 2006, the remittance basis of taxation no longer applies to the income of a non-Irish sourced employment attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of that employment.  Section 13 of the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2008 as recently amended by the Select Committee on Finance and the Public Service proposes to introduce a new type of remittance basis of taxation to the income of a non-Irish sourced employment attributable to the performance in the State of the duties of that employment which was debated at some length at Committee Stage of the Bill.As to potential loss to the Exchequer, individuals chargeable on the remittance basis are obliged to declare only so much of the foreign income received in, or remitted to, the State. Accordingly, details of un-remitted employment income under foreign contracts, in respect of which Irish tax was forgone, either by business executives or other occupations, are not available.Budget of 2006 stated that the Exchequer yield from discontinuing the remittance basis with effect from 1 January 2006 was estimated at over €50 million in 2006, €75 million in 2007 and €100 million in subsequent full years. These estimates were arrived at on the basis of the evidence of the promotion of the use of the remittance basis which the changes in the Finance Act 2006 were designed to eliminate.As regards the proposed scheme as outlined in the present Finance Bill, as I stated at the Committee Stage of the Bill, it is difficult to estimate but I believe it could cost about €10 million per annum.

These buses offer significant environmental benefits over diesel, including 96% lower emissions of nitrous oxide, zero particulate emissions and much lower noise levels.The total number of passengers carried on the service between 4 May 2008 and 26 October 2008 was 17,345.  The total cost of providing the service between the beginning of May to the end of October was €183,934.00.  The business plan for the service envisaged a build-up of passengers on a progressive basis from a small start-up base.  Given the take-up on the service to date however, its continued operation at its present level is being reviewed.

The Steward's House was refurbished to provide additional guest accommodation as part of the overall Farmleigh complex, but separate from the main house.As part of the Farmleigh Estate, it is available for official use.  Since it became available for use, one group of 3 guests, the EU Commissioner for Agriculture and two others, were accommodated in the Steward's House for 2 days and 2 nights.  It has been used by the Taoiseach for a small number of informal meetings over recent weeks.  The Taoiseach has also stayed overnight on 5 occasions when official duties prevented his return to his residence.  The question of the basis on which such use might arise in the future is currently under consideration.Since the Steward's House has only recently been refurbished and renovated, the annual maintenance costs for the House are minimal.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1088	I am advised by the Revenue Commissioners that, in common with any trader engaged in taxable activities, property developers engaged in the building and selling of houses are entitled to deduct VAT incurred on their input costs.  The position regarding property developers who, having deducted VAT incurred on the development of residential property, subsequently rent rather than sell completed houses is set out below.Where a house is completed before 1 July 2008 and rented on or after that date, there is a full claw-back of the VAT deducted by the developer.  This claw-back is triggered by section 4C(3) to the Value-Added Tax Act 1972, as amended, and is effected at the time the letting of the residential property is created.The Finance Act 2008 introduced a new VAT on property regime from 1 July 2008.  The new regime includes a capital goods scheme (CGS) that regulates VAT deductibility in relation to property by reference to the taxable and exempt use of the property over the "life" of the property, which in most cases is 20 years.  Where a house is completed on or after 1 July 2008, and rented on or after 1 July 2008 (an exempt activity), no immediate claw-back of the VAT occurs.  Instead, the developer is required to adjust the VAT deductibility at the end of the second CGS interval and each subsequent interval until the property is sold.  In effect, therefore, VAT deducted by the developer is clawed back proportionately by reference to the length of the letting over the 20 year "life" of the property.  Full details on the CGS are available under Chapter 6 of the VAT on Property Guide, which is available on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie.I would add, however, that the subsequent sale by a developer of a residential property that he has rented out remains fully taxable.

The day-to-day responsibility for the supervision of financial institutions is a matter for the Financial Regulator, which is statutorily independent in the exercise of its regulatory functions. The Financial Regulator is also obliged to treat as confidential the information it holds on regulated entities.  Consequently the Settlement Agreement entered into with the insurance company in question is strictly a matter between the parties.The Deputy will be aware that in light of the ongoing turmoil in financial markets, the Financial Regulator is continuing to intensify its on-site and off-site supervision of financial institutions. In this respect the Financial Regulator has advised me that on the basis of the latest figures available, all insurers meet the statutory solvency margin requirements. On the banking side, I have met with the Governor of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator to discuss the report on the financial position of the major financial institutions participating in the Government Guarantee Scheme. This report which cannot be disclosed because of its confidential and commercially sensitive nature presents an analysis of the institutions having regard to their loan books. The report confirmed that the capital position of each of the institutions reviewed is in excess of regulatory requirements as at 30 September 2008. The report also concludes that even in certain stress scenarios the capital levels in the financial institutions will remain within regulatory requirements in the period to 2011.

The relevant threshold for Irish issuers is 3% and each 1% thereafter up to 100%. The notification requirement only applies to shares with voting rights attached. The notification requirements also apply to a person who holds, directly or indirectly, financial instruments which result in an entitlement to acquire, on such holder's own initiative alone, under a formal agreement, shares to which voting rights are attached, already issued, of an issuer.A person making a notification to an issuer shall at the same time file a copy of such notification with the Irish Stock Exchange by e-mail. Upon receipt of the notification the issuer must make public all the information contained in the notification.In the case of a bank, any person proposing to acquire 10% or more of its shares or voting rights must notify the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland in advance and receives its approval for an such acquisition.  The Financial Regulator has raised with my Department the question of extending disclosure requirements to other types of financial instruments, such as contracts for difference, and proposals are expected shortly.

However, international capital market expectations in relation to capital levels in the banking sector have altered.In my statement on 28 November, I indicated that it would be appropriate for the State in certain circumstances, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing private investment with State participation. Following on from this, the Government announced on 14 December its intention to support, alongside existing shareholders and private investors, a recapitalisation programme for credit institutions in Ireland of up to E10 billion. In that regard, the State is open to supporting proposals from potential investors that would add value to the security and stability of the financial system and would enhance its ability to contribute in a positive way to economic development.I have met in recent weeks with a number of banks and investment businesses.  I have indicated that it is a matter for the Board of each financial institution concerned to develop further their own plans for raising capital where appropriate. Following the Government's announcement of 14 December, relevant credit institutions are expected to develop detailed proposals and these institutions have been asked to submit their proposals by early January.Any parties with serious propositions for investment in an institution are of course referred to the institutions concerned.  Any proposals involving State participation or investment would be considered only following advice from the NTMA and from financial and legal advisors as appropriate.It would not be appropriate for me to comment on any specific proposals or specific meetings with interested parties, as the details of any discussions are potentially market sensitive.

These reports indicated that the capital position of each of the institutions reviewed was in excess of regulatory requirements as at 30 September 2008 and also concluded that, even in certain stress scenarios, the capital level will remain within regulatory requirements in the period to 2011.As the Deputy would expect, continued vigilance is appropriate during the period of the Government guarantee and further work continues on the review of covered institutions' loan books.  The outcome of this work will be considered by the Financial Regulator as part of the ongoing supervision of the covered institutions under the Scheme and more generally.While the Price Waterhouse Coopers reports have provided an assurance on the capital position of the covered institutions, I also recognise that market expectations on appropriate capitalisation levels have changed and that it is also necessary to ensure that the banks are in a position to lend to business and personal customers in a sound financial position.  It is for this reason that I announced a programme of capitalisation for credit institutions in Ireland.The extent to which impaired loans have been provided for is a matter for each institution and its auditors to report on, in accordance with supervisory and accounting requirements, as the institutions publish results for the appropriate periods.  The Financial Regulator will be in ongoing contact with the covered institutions on this matter having regard to the continuing work of Price Waterhouse Coopers and other information obtained within the regulatory framework.

These amounts do not include the cost of long service increments which are only payable after satisfactory service of 3 and 6 years at the highest points on incremental scales.It should be noted that since the introduction of the revised Performance Management and Development System (PMDS) in the civil service, the payment of all increments since 2007 is dependant on staff receiving a satisfactory rating.No dedicated annual provision is made for the payment of increments in my Department. Expenditure may vary from year to year depending on the number of staff who are on points below the maximum of their scale and the number of staff who have reached the maximum of the scale.  Retirements and replacement of promoted staff by persons at lower scale points of their former grade also impact on costs from year to year.It is not possible in the time available to give a complete statement of the actual cost of increments in any given year.

#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1100	Section 262 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997 already provides that a financial institution must, following a depositor's request, provide a statement to the depositor showing the gross amount of any relevant interest paid or credited to the depositor, the DIRT deducted, the net payment and the date of that payment.  I have no plans to amend this legislative provision at this time.Section 34 of the Finance Act 2007 introduced a new scheme to allow the operation of DIRT exempt savings accounts subject to two conditions: (1) the account holder must be aged 65 years of age or over or be permanently incapacitated; and (2) the account holder's total income must not exceed the relevant exemption threshold, i.e. €19,000 (for an individual) or €38,000 (for a married couple).In 2007, Revenue widely publicised these changes. An Information Leaflet (DE1) giving comprehensive information for qualifying taxpayers on how to have interest credited to their savings accounts without deduction of DIRT was made available at Revenue offices. Information on DIRT exemption was also included on the Revenue website at www.revenue.ie. Application forms and information leaflets were also made available at most financial institutions. Revenue also arranged for an information leaflet to be issued to social welfare customers in receipt of state and other pensions.

We now face a position where tax revenues are back to 2005 levels while spending by 2009 is estimated to have increased by 35%. Clearly we have a substantial gap.The Government's priority is the restoration of a balanced current budget over the medium term. Achieving this will inevitably mean that it will be difficult to deliver on the priorities outlined in the Programme for Government given the level of resources available.That said the Government is also continuing to commit substantial funding to public investment to secure the future growth potential of the economy, thereby maintaining employment and competitiveness and enhancing the productive capacity of the economy.Finally, as I have said in response to previous PQs on this issue the Programme for Government is a five year programme which must be judged over the full five years of the Government.

The Structural Funds comprise the: European Regional Development Fund (ERDF); European Social Fund (ESF); Fishery Funds — Financial Instruments for Fisheries Guidance (FIFG) and European Fisheries Fund (EFF); and Agriculture Funds — European Agriculture Guidance and Guarantee Fund (EAGGF), guidance element and the European Agricultural Fund for Rural Development (EAFRD).My Department is responsible for, amongst other things, overall policy in relation to Ireland's EU Structural and Cohesion Funds. It is responsible for drawing down the European Regional Development and Cohesion Funds which are paid into the Central Fund as a capital receipt. It also plays a central role in the development and monitoring of the programmes/projects through which the Funds are drawn down.Ireland has qualified for Structural Funds since we joined the EU in 1973 and for the Cohesion Fund from 1993 when it was established.  However, due to the economic progress the country has made, Ireland no longer qualifies for Cohesion Funding since 2004.Details of receipts Ireland has received from the EU Budget under the various funds since we joined the EU in 1973 can be obtained from Table 11 of the document "Budgetary and Economic Statistics" published by my Department in September.

This grant was decommitted and transferred to the NCIP as the applicant could not proceed to contract at that time.  As the applicant could not secure a lease agreement in the time required under the NCIP, the funding was decommitted again in August 2008.  This decision was appealed however, given that the applicant had not secured a lease for the project, the original decision to decommit funding was deemed appropriate.I also understand that Greencastle Community Childcare Centre has submitted a further capital grant application for €680,821 and that this application is currently in the appraisal process. A decision on this application will be made in due course following which the applicant will be notified of the outcome.

Under the new legislation, prospective adoptive parents will be able to adopt from countries which have also ratified the Hague Convention, and countries with which Ireland has a bilateral agreement which meets Hague standards.While it is true to say that our current Agreement with Vietnam is based on Hague principles, as part of the preparations for our new legislation we need to ensure that our Agreement reflects the Hague Convention as comprehensively as possible. A new Agreement allows the opportunity to elaborate and strengthen some existing provisions to meet the standards which it is anticipated will be set in draft legislation. There have been considerable developments in intercountry adoption in Vietnam since the Agreement was signed 5 years ago. This progress also needs to be reflected in any new Agreement.There is a clause in the current Agreement which states that the Agreement will be automatically extended for another 5 year term unless one State notifies the other State to the contrary. Because of the changes to our adoption legislation, the Agreement cannot ‘roll over' in its present form for another 5 years. As a result, the Irish Government was obliged to formally notify Vietnam that there can be no automatic renewal of the Agreement when the five year term expires on 1 May, 2009.I am aware of the concerns of those parents who have already adopted and those who hope to adopt from Vietnam in the future. I would like to assure the Deputy that officials from my Office and the Adoption Board have been continuously monitoring the situation and liaising closely with colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and our embassy in Hanoi over recent months. In November, a senior official from my Office led a delegation to Vietnam accompanied by the Chairman and CEO of the Adoption Board. While the purpose of this visit was to commence discussions with the Vietnamese Authorities on the possible renegotiation of the Agreement, the delegation also availed of the opportunity to meet with officials from various embassies and with UNICEF to discuss the their views on intercountry adoption from Vietnam.The Irish Government has issued a formal request to the Vietnamese Authorities stating that we wish to enter into discussions immediately for the purpose of negotiating a new Agreement to follow on from the existing Agreement. We are currently awaiting the response of the Vietnamese authorities.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1123	Tackling all Health Care Associated Infections (HCAIs), including MRSA, continues to be a priority for the Government and the Health Service Executive (HSE).  HCAIs are not a new phenomenon and have always been a potential complication of medical treatment, especially in hospitals.  This is the case worldwide.It should be noted that if a patient is diagnosed with a bloodstream infection at a given hospital, it does not indicate that the infection was acquired at that hospital.  Many bloodstream infections are acquired in the community, but only diagnosed upon admission to hospital.  Or, a patient may have acquired the infection in one hospital, but the infection may be diagnosed on transfer to another hospital.A new National Surveillance System has been established by the HSE to collect data and provide information on a quarterly basis to monitor HCAIs in our health system.  This data has been compiled and published for 2006, 2007 and the first 2 quarters of 2008.  I attach in table format an extract of the relevant information for the Deputy, taken from the recent reports of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre.  The table gives the number of MRSA bloodstream isolates by acute public hospital for 2007 and the first 6 months of 2008.  Most of the variation in reported numbers of S. aureus bloodstream infections between hospitals can be explained by differences in hospital size, activity and patient populations.  At present there is no way to adjust the data to allow for these differences and hence direct comparisons between hospitals are not possible.The State Claims Agency handles all MRSA claims against individual hospitals in the public sector, the HSE and/or the Minister for Health and Children.  There are currently 98 alleged healthcare associated infection claims and to date one case has been settled.  It will be appreciated that each case has it own complexities and there are issues involved beyond MRSA.  It is policy not to divulge either the details or amounts concerned in individual cases.Acute Public HospitalTotal number of isolates of MRSA 2007Total number of isolates of MRSA Q1 & Q2 20081Adelaide, Meath and National Children’s Hospital, Tallaght, Dublin1813Bantry General Hospital81Beaumont Hospital (including St. Joseph’s Hospital, Raheny), Dublin5025Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, Dublin00Cavan General Hospital91Children’s University Hospital, Temple Street, Dublin00Connolly Hospital, Blanchardstown, Dublin142Coombe Women’s Hospital, Dublin20Cork University Hospitala399Galway University HospitalscN/A23Erinville Hospital, CorkaN/AKerry General Hospital, Tralee1610Letterkenny General Hospital, Donegal1310Lourdes Orthopaedic Hospital, Kilcreene00Louth County Hospital, Dundalk13Mallow General Hospital, Co.

These EU-SILC tables have been made available to Opposition parties.

#MaryHarney	unknown-#MaryHarney-party	unknown-#MaryHarney-dob	unknown-#MaryHarney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1127	The aim of the acute hospital co-location initiative is to make available approximately 1,000 additional public acute hospital beds for public patients by transferring private activity, with some limited exceptions, from public acute hospitals to co-located private hospitals.Significant progress has been made on the implementation of the co-location initiative. The Board of the HSE has approved preferred bidder status for the development of co-located hospitals on six sites. Project Agreements for four of these have been signed and preparatory work for the remaining two is proceeding.  Planning permission was granted for one project last month and two other projects are under consideration by An Bord Pleanála.A tender in respect of Connolly Hospital has been received by the Health Service Executive and is under consideration.Each co-location project is required to demonstrate value for money for the State, taking into account its comprehensive benefits, as well as the cost of tax allowances and private bed revenue currently accruing to public hospitals. The scheme of tax allowances under the Finance Act 2001 means that, for each €100 million of qualifying capital expenditure, the cost of tax relief to investors (assuming a marginal tax rate of 41% for those investors) will be some €41 million in gross terms, spread over 7 years. The on-going revenue cost to the public hospitals will be minimal.  This is because the beds in public hospitals to be freed up for public patients are already staffed and the back-up services and facilities required to support them are in place.  The only staffing cost envisaged is the appointment of additional consultants which is being pursued in the light of the agreement on the new consultants' contract.  Additional revenues will accrue to the Exchequer from the extra activity generated by the construction of the hospitals, the employment arising and the related services provided on which taxes will be paid.It is a matter for each of the successful bidders to arrange to finance the projects in accordance with the terms of the relevant Project Agreement. Although it is certainly the case that the funding environment has changed radically in the last six months, in relation to both public and private sectors, the co-location initiative like other major projects has to deal with this.  The successful bidders are working on the details of contractual terms with banks and other arrangers of finance in the very difficult and changed credit environment.  The HSE is continuing to work with them to ensure that the co-located hospitals can be built and brought into operation as soon as possible, and that the goal of achieving new public acute bed capacity at value for money to the State is achieved.My Department has requested the Parliamentary Affairs Division of the Executive to arrange to have the detailed operational matters raised by the Deputy  in respect of the Connolly co-location project investigated and a reply issued directly to her.

Therefore, there is no specific budget provided in any year for the payment of increments, as my Department is expected to meet such costs, if any, from within its overall pay allocation. The costs, if any, arising in relation to this matter will vary based upon the length of service of existing staff and replacement of those retiring or resigning by new entrants at the lowest point of the salary scale. The Department manages all of these issues within the overall pay allocation. A similar situation applies in health agencies with no additional funding made available for such costs and agencies required to address the issue from within their existing pay allocation.

The work being done in my Department at present relates to data collection and analysis across the fifteen Agencies together with the progressing of a number of pieces of legislation relevant to rationalisation and the discussions with Agencies which are now underway.While there is clearly a need to secure efficiencies from the rationalisation programme, the primary aim of these measures is to streamline service delivery, professional registration and policy making in a number of areas in the health sector, through the integration and/or amalgamation of function. Efficiencies will derive over time from economies of scale and the elimination of duplication in areas such as recruitment, procurement, payroll and ICT systems.

This work is funded out of each authority's own resources, supplemented in the case of regional and local roads by discretionary and block grants allocated annually by my Department.  In the case of national roads, funding for maintenance, which includes the gritting of roads and other safety related work in winter, is provided by my Department to the NRA which allocates it among the local authorities.Local authorities are advised that they should set aside contingency sums from these resources to finance works necessitated by severe weather conditions.  In 2008, the total discretionary maintenance grant allocated to county councils by my Department was €29.56 million and the total block grant allocated to urban authorities was €16.133 million.  The maintenance grant, including winter maintenance, forecasting and monitoring, by my Department to the NRA for allocation to local authorities in 2008 was €58.21 million.  Local authorities are regularly reminded by my Department of their responsibilities in relation to winter maintenance of roads.  During 2008, the matter was brought to the attention of local authorities on 5 February and again on 10 December.

The policy, as set out in my Department's current statement of strategy, is to promote regular, safe, cost effective and competitive air services linking the country and key business and tourism markets.  The priority, from an Irish economy perspective, is to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world and my Department will continue to closely monitor developments in the aviation sector that impact on that objective.I would also refer the Deputy to by reply to today's priority PQ 46527/08.

The priority, from an Irish economy perspective, is to maintain the highest possible levels of connectivity between Ireland and key markets around the world.The Air Travel Tax announced in Budget 2009 will come into force in respect of passengers departing from Irish airports on and from 30 March 2009.  The decision to introduce the new tax was taken in the context of the overarching priority to reduce the budgetary deficit.Ireland is not unique in regard to applying a tax on air travel.  I understand a number of countries within the EU apply similar taxes including, the UK, France and the Netherlands, as do Australia and New Zealand.  The proposed rates for the Irish air travel tax at €10 and €2 are not unreasonable when compared to rates in other countries.I understand that tourists will only be subject to the tax on their return journey and, on this basis, it is envisaged that the additional €10 or €2 in the context of a much larger purchasing decision involving travel, hotel expenditures etc. should not have much of an effect on tourist numbers.I appreciate the airline industry continues to go through a difficult period reflecting in the main weak world economic activity.  However, this is somewhat offset by the recent fall in oil prices.  Oil prices which have now more than halved from the all-time high prices experienced earlier in the year.  Moreover, fuel used by commercial airlines is completely exempt from tax so it is a sector that already has considerable preferential treatment.The cost implications for airlines arising from the air travel tax would be a commercial matter for each airline concerned.  It is open to the airlines to decide whether or not they wish to pass the tax on in full to their customers.

For my Department, this involves the establishment of the Dublin Transport Authority and the amalgamation of air, marine, and rail accident investigation functions.It is proposed that the Dublin Transport Authority will incorporate the Dublin Transportation Office, the Commission for Taxi Regulation and the Public Transport Licensing function of my Department. My Department has recently prepared an implementation plan in this regard, the details of which are under on-going discussion with the Department of Finance. I am not, therefore, in a position to comment further on the plan at this stage.I am satisfied that substantial benefits will accrue as a result of the improved procurement, regulation, management and co-ordination of transport services. Those benefits will accrue to the travelling public, employers, taxpayers and society at large and will make an important contribution to sustaining competitiveness and addressing the increasing challenges of climate change.In relation to the amalgamation of the accident functions, the position is that I have recently accepted a proposal for merging the three accident investigation areas into one organisation, on an administrative basis initially, through the establishment of an Office of Accident Investigation attached to my Department. I have also recently established an implementation team to draw up an implementation plan for my approval. The Department of Finance has been advised of the position in this regard.  I believe also that the amalgamation of the accident investigation functions will enable efficiencies to be achieved primarily from the integration of support functions.

#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1156	Major improvements have taken place on the Kildare and Maynooth lines in recent years. Capacity on the Kildare Line has been increased by 160% in recent years. In addition platform extensions allowing for longer trains, introduction of Sunday services and the turnback facility at Newbridge have facilitated better services. The Kildare Route Upgrade Project which is currently under construction and due to be completed in 2010 will more than treble capacity for commuters on the line.The position in regard to the improvement of railway services on the Maynooth line is that capacity has been trebled in the last five years. I understand from Iarnród Éireann that it plans to re-signal the line and to close a number of level crossings to improve journey times. The line will also be electrified as part of the re-alignment of the Dart services which is a necessary precursor for the Dart Underground. I understand from Iarnród Eireann that both the re-signalling and electrification should be completed by 2013.

The total sum of EU aid involved (€2,820m) has been a major contributory factor to the provision of key infrastructure and economic development in Ireland and the importance of the EU contribution is fully recognised and has been acknowledged. Full details of the Programmes concerned, the current status of each Programme and the total amount of EU aid received was provided in response to a similar question tabled by Deputy John O'Mahony on Tuesday, 5th February 2008. A copy of that reply is attached for the information of the Deputy. A copy of the detailed follow-up data referred to in that reply will be sent to the Deputy in the near future.EU funding for transport projects was also received under various other Programmes including a number of INTERREG Programmes, the Peace Programme and the Cohesion Fund 1993-2003. EU funding for local and regional roads has also been received under the Regional Operational Programmes for the Border, Midlands and Western Region (BMW) and the Southern and Eastern Region (S&E). My Department does not have lead responsibility for any of these Programmes.
#NoelDempsey	unknown-#NoelDempsey-party	unknown-#NoelDempsey-dob	unknown-#NoelDempsey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1158	The provision of increased capacity will be a key consideration in determining public transport investment priorities in the coming years. Given their potential to greatly increase capacity of the public transport network in the Greater Dublin Area, Metro North and the DART Underground are key priorities.  Investment in increased bus capacity, subject to the outcome of the cost and efficiency review of the CIE bus companies, and bus priority measures are also priorities. The adjustment in capital funding in 2009 will not have a significant effect on the roll out of the Transport 21 public transport programme and will not result in the postponement of the start of construction of any public transport project.All of the public transport projects currently under construction will continue on schedule and some, such as the Cork — Midleton line, Phase 1 of the Western Rail Corridor and the Luas extension to the Docklands, will be completed in the course of the year. The start and completion dates of public transport projects, which have not yet commenced, will be determined by the funding allocation available during the current difficult economic climate. The commencement dates for these projects will also be influenced by the time taken for public consultation, the relevant statutory process and the procurement and contract award processes.

My Department's approach to the regional airports is to implement targeted safety and other investments in the regional airports and targeted subventions for regional air services.This overall approach is reflected by my Department providing direct financial support for the six regional airports under two schemes — one relating to operational expenditure and the other to capital investments. In addition funding is provided by my Department in respect of the provision of PSO services connecting Dublin Airport with Kerry, Galway, IWAK, Sligo and Donegal regional airports and with the City of Derry Airport.

The High Court's judgment upholding the constitutionality of the legislation was delivered in early 2006 but it has since been appealed to the Supreme Court.  While operation of the law in relation to ground rents continues to be reviewed in my Department, there are no proposals for changes pending the outcome of the appeal that I have mentioned.It should be noted that the law already provides a statutory scheme for the acquisition of the fee simple in dwellinghouses which is set out in the Landlord and Tenant (Ground Rents) (No. 2) Act 1978.  Part III of that Act makes provision for a streamlined procedure, operated by the Property Registration Authority, whereby a person may acquire the fee simple in their dwellinghouse.

Their purpose is provide a forum where An Garda Síochána and the local authority — the two organisations which make the most significant contribution to preventing and tackling crime in a specific area — can come together, with the participation of members of the Oireachtas and community and voluntary interests, on matters affecting the area.On 24 September I launched, with my colleague the Minister for the Environment, Heritage and Local Government, the roll out of the Committees from an initial pilot phase in 29 local authority areas to all 114 local authority areas.  The Guidelines which I made set out the membership of, and the procedures to be followed in setting up, the Committees.Membership will be made up of local authority elected members, Oireachtas members, local authority officials, Garda officers nominated by the Commissioner and persons representing the community and voluntary sector.Following the formal decision by a local authority meeting to establish a Committee, a process is set in train to select the Committee members from the elected members of the local authority, the members of the Oireachtas who have registered their interest in becoming members and the community and voluntary sector, and various procedural matters have to be dealt with.  The Garda Síochána representatives will be appointed by the Garda Commissioner.I am informed that the relevant local authorities, including Limerick County Council, have been requested to take the necessary steps to secure the establishment of these Committees, and I understand that this process is now underway.  In addition, my Department has written to the Garda Commissioner requesting that he arrange for the establishment of the Committees in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.

These goals are backed up by strategic actions which include a commitment to continue and intensify intelligence-led operations against groups and individuals engaged in the trafficking of illegal drugs, guns and immigrants into and within the State.An Garda Síochána utilises intelligence-led operations to target organised crime gangs. All available intelligence is fully analysed and used in the strategic deployment of both local and specialised operational Garda units to target particular gangs.Organised crime is being targeted on a number of fronts, including the use of uniformed and plain-clothes Gardaí overtly and covertly disrupting known criminals in the course of criminal activities. Specialist units from National Support Services are also assisting in these operations and apply their expertise to different aspects of criminal activity. A number of organised crime groups have been targeted in this manner recently with firearms being recovered and drugs seized resulting in a number of people being prosecuted and convicted before the Courts.In November 2005 the Organised Crime Unit at the National Bureau of Criminal Investigation was set up to combat the growth of organised crime, and in particular armed criminal gangs. The Unit will continue to work closely with other specialist units, including the Garda National Drugs Unit and the Special Detective Unit / Emergency Response Unit, in targeting those suspected of involvement in organised criminal activity.Senior management in An Garda Síochána will continue to monitor the activities of criminals to ensure that law enforcement activities adapt to changing circumstances.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1176	The Garda Commissioner informs me that 31 legally held handguns have been stolen since the start of 2004.  As the Deputy is aware, for over 30 years prior to 2004, it was policy not to license handguns in this jurisdiction.  Following a series of judicial decisions, that is no longer the case and approx.  1,800 handguns have been licensed since then.  This was not the result of a considered or deliberate public policy decision.  While, thankfully, violence related to the troubles in the North has largely been brought to an end we are now faced with a gun culture operating in criminal gangs.  It is a matter of great regret that the activities of criminal gangs should impinge on the interests of law abiding licensed firearms owners but I cannot overlook the fact that the overall level and kind of licensed firearms prevalent in the community is relevant to the prevention of crime, in the same way the prohibition on handguns was considered appropriate from the early seventies on.I have been conscious too of the remarks of Mr. Justice Charleton in a recent judgement that a reasonable person is entitled to feel alarmed at the proliferation of handguns.  I am aware too of calls made by members of the Oireachtas from a number of parties to address this situation.  I am aware that some people have a strongly held view that once they are of good character and make the necessary secure arrangements for the storage of their firearms they should be free to have firearms of any kind licensed to them.  I feel that that would represent an unacceptable situation where our gun laws could mirror those of countries such as the United States and that, if the present situation continued unchecked, this would happen.It was against this background that I directed my Department and An Garda Síochána to carry out an urgent and intensive review of the firearms law. Proposals arising from that review will be reflected in a Criminal Justice (Miscellaneous) Provisions Bill which will be published shortly.  My proposals for reform in this area include a ban on issuing new licenses for handguns, although there will be limited exceptions in relation to Olympic sports.  Those who have licenses already can, when they are due for renewal, apply to have them renewed under a new licensing procedure where the safety of the community will be paramount.  Together with the Garda Commissioner I will keep under annual review the outcome of the licensing procedure and, if the outcome leaves a situation which still poses an unacceptable risk to the community, will use new powers to ban particular types of firearm.  There have been suggestions in some quarters that this move arose, in some way, as a response to recent gangland crime. It did not.I have been on record for many months saying I was looking at this issue, especially in light of Judge Peter Charleton's remarks in July.  I felt that it was incumbent on me and the Oireachtas to respond to his views.  Otherwise in the light of tragic incidents the public would correctly ask the question: Why, when they were warned, did the politicians not do something about it?  I am aware that the vast majority of licensed firearms holders pursue their interests legitimately and I am conscious too that many of them deeply resent any connection that is made to the issue of licensed handguns in the context of our crime problem.  But as Justice Minister I cannot avoid the reality that the overall number of weapons in circulation and the type of those weapons can add to a gun culture which I do not believe is acceptable.  My proposals for reform in this area represent a balanced approach and it is important to stress that these proposals will not impinge on the vast majority of licensed firearms holders.  While any inconvenience caused to those who will be affected by the proposals is, of course, regretted I am satisfied that my proposals will be in the public interest.

While these negotiations are advanced stage they have not yet been completed to the point that the Project Agreement can be signed.  I am advised by the Irish Prison Service that it is anticipated that it will not be possible to have a contract signed this year.  The aim would be to have a contract signed early in 2009.  Construction will commence immediately after contract award and should take no more than 3 years.  This timeframe is subject, of course, to the successful completion of the contract negotiations.  If, for any reason, these negotiations are not successfully concluded there are other tenderers and other options which can be considered.The Thornton Hall project is a complex Public Private Partnership Project which involves the construction of more than 30 buildings, including 8 prison facilities on the site, a major internal road network, extensive perimeter security and a vast array of security systems both physical and electronic.  Additional matters have had to be addressed following the extensive public consultation involving the publication of the Environmental Impact Assessment and consideration of the development by the Oireachtas.  Pressures on the international financial markets have had implications for a number of major capital projects including Thornton. In particular the availability and cost of finance has been affected.The National Development Finance Agency, as the financial adviser to the Irish Prison Service, is keeping the financial impacts of the current international "credit crunch" situation under review.  Before a contract is awarded the final cost must be within the budget (capital envelope) allocated to the project and be under the Public Sector Benchmark.  The Public Sector Benchmark is a monetary value that represents a risk adjusted cost, over the construction and 25 year maintenance period, to the sponsoring agency of delivery the project using ‘traditional' public sector procurement.  The National Development Finance Agency will advise my Department whether the project represents value for money when compared to the Public Sector Benchmark.

Five hundred and sixty civil servants have already moved to their decentralised locations.  Two hundred and ninety two moved from provincial locations and two hundred and sixty eight staff moved from Dublin.  Overall, this represents over 60% of the target numbers for my Department and we now have a presence in all of the seven locations covered by the programme.  It is anticipated that a further seventy staff will have moved by the end of 2009, bringing the total number up to six hundred and thirty.

This includes those agencies that are staffed by my Department.  It does not include bodies in the wider Justice sector that recruit their own staff such as those of the Courts Service, Garda Síochána, Garda Síochána Ombudsman Commission, Legal Aid Board, Property Registration Authority and non-administrative staff in the Irish Prisons Service.  Figures for previous years are not readily available and in any event they would not be comparable with current figures.  A breakdown of the number of staff in the various income bands outlined by the Deputy is set out in the following table:Income BandNumber of staffUnder €50,0001,503€50,001 to €60,000312€60,001 to €70,000251€70,001 to €80,000121€80,001 to €90,00099€90,001 to €100,00023Over €100,00098As certain grades are in two or more income bands due to the salary range and/or the work attendance patterns of individuals, it would not provide any meaningful information to include a breakdown of the grades under each band. The staff of my Department and associated agencies covered in this reply are distributed across a large number of locations in Dublin and around the country. Staff in Dublin are currently based in some 29 individual locations across the capital, including 10 Probation Service offices. Outside Dublin, staff are based in 7 decentralised locations (Killarney, Longford, Tipperary, Portarlington, Portlaoise, Navan and Roscrea).  In addition, there are 31 regional Probation Service offices.  In view of the large number of staff, grades and locations involved, the provision of a detailed breakdown in this regard would involve a disproportionate amount of staff time and resources.

The court also ordered compensation to be paid, and I understand this was done.  I am also informed that subsequent civil proceedings were settled before coming to court.  Where an offence is disclosed, the matter is investigated by An Garda Síochána and an investigation file prepared for the law officers, who, in the exercise of their independent role, determine the matter of criminal charges against any person.  As the Deputy is aware, the courts are, subject only to the Constitution and the law, independent in the exercise of their judicial functions, and it is not open to me to comment on or intervene in any way in the conduct of, or decision in, any individual court case.

The Garda Juvenile Diversion Programme, operated by Garda Juvenile Liaison Officers, has proved to be highly successful in diverting young persons away from crime by offering guidance and support to juveniles and their families.  It also enables referral to the Garda Youth Diversion Projects which are community-based, multi-agency crime prevention initiatives operating separately from the Diversion Programme.  There are currently 100 of these projects operating in various locations throughout the country.The Children Act 2001 is now fully in force and provides a modern framework for responding to the needs of young people who come in contact with the criminal justice system.  The Irish Youth Justice Service has been established to develop an integrated response to youth offending.  This response is set out in the National Youth Justice Strategy 2008-2010, launched last March.  There is a deep responsibility on parents where the behaviour of their children is concerned. The Children Act 2001 provides a number of measures in relation to parental responsibility in respect of children involved in anti-social behaviour, and children found guilty of offences.Public disorder offences make up a significant proportion of crime committed by juveniles, and are an issue where cooperation between the Gardaí and the local community is vital.  That is why I am proceeding with the roll out of the joint policing committees, following their successful pilot phase.  These committees enable local authority representatives and officials and the Gardaí, with the participation of Oireachtas members and community interests, to get together in a structured way to discuss matters affecting the policing of the area.Operation Anvil commenced in the Dublin Metropolitan Region in 2005 to deal with serious crime and was extended nationwide in 2006.  The primary focus of the Operation is the targeting of active criminals and their associates involved in serious crime by preventing and disrupting their criminal activity through extensive additional overt patrolling and static checkpoints by uniform, mobile and foot patrols, supported by armed plain clothes patrols.  Under Operation Anvil up to the end of November, 1,200 firearms have been recovered in Dublin and 1,000 in the rest of the country.  There have also been over 7,000 arrests for serious crimes such as murder, robbery and burglary and 67,000 searches for weapons, drugs and stolen goods.  In this way, the Gardaí will continue to address the issue of illegal guns relentlessly.  Funding for Operation Anvil will increase in 2009 from €20 million to €21 million.  I can assure the Deputy that I attach the highest importance to tackling the serious threat posed by firearms. The Gardaí will pursue relentlessly those who use firearms in the commission of crime, and I will provide both the resources necessary to do this and legislation required to prevent the availability of such weapons.

Details of the number of asylum seekers and irregular migrants from non-EU countries who voluntarily repatriated during the period since 2003 are outlined in the following table:YearNumber of self-managed voluntary returnsNumber of voluntary returns — International Organisation for Migration assistedTotal20033614017622004218393611200512521033520066317523820071622554172008 (to 15 Dec)72434506In relation to the number of persons who voluntarily leave and subsequently reapply to work here as a non-EEA national, I can inform the Deputy that, although immigration history is taken into account in visa decisions, my Department does not record the personal and immigration history of visa applicants in a statistical format.  Consequently, it is not possible to provide the information requested by the Deputy.  I should also inform the Deputy that not every non-EEA national is visa required.  Where non-EEA nationals are visa required, visas for the purpose of employment are issued worldwide by both my Department and the Department of Foreign Affairs.  Each case is dealt with on its own merits on a case-by-case basis at the time of processing.

On examination of this application it was determined that the person in question did not meet the statutory residency requirements as set out in the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended.  A letter informing the applicant of this was issued on the 16 March 2007 and the person in question was invited to make a new application under his existing reference number.  The purpose of this letter was to ensure that the person concerned would not lose his place in the processing queue.  This application was lodged on 23 April 2007.  Officials in the Citizenship Section of my Department inform me that processing of this application has commenced and the file will be forwarded to me for a decision in the coming months.

This initiative led to the arrest of 155 individuals, and the commencement of 236 proceedings for related offences.An Garda Síochána is represented by a Garda Inspector on the Local and Regional Drug Task Forces. This officer provides relevant information on drug prevalence and supply to the Local and Regional DTF's. In addition An Garda Síochána is also represented by a Garda Superintendent on the National Drug Strategy Team and he provides continuous feed-back on various operational initiatives which have relevance and feed into the ongoing work of the Local and Regional Task Forces. This assists the Local and Regional Drugs Task Forces in the preparation of strategies to reduce demand for, and target the supply of, illegal drugs in Ireland.

I am informed by the Garda authorities that one of the unsuccessful tenderers has requested clarification. The issues raised are expected to be resolved shortly, and An Garda Síochána are expected to commence contract discussions with the preferred bidder.As soon as the contract is concluded, roll-out of the network of cameras will commence. Roll-out will involve a service start-up phase, which will include drawing up policy and procedures by the service provider and their approval by An Garda Síochána; service testing, following which the Garda Commissioner will issue a service commencement certificate; and roll-out of the service until operating at full capacity.  Every effort is being made to proceed with this project as speedily as possible. Until the contract discussions are concluded it is not possible to indicate a specific timescale for the project.The 2009 Estimates provide €10 million in the Garda Vote for the provision of the service, which will allow the project to proceed to full roll-out in 2009.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1201	I share the concerns of the Deputy about the oppressive treatment of the Baha'i minority in Iran. In my reply to Written Question 42351/08 on 25 November, I set out these concerns in detail, as well as the action taken by the Government to impress these concerns on the Iranian authorities.Further to that reply, I wrote last week directly to Foreign Minister Mottaki of Iran on a number of human rights issues. In that letter, I set out at length my deep concern about the treatment of the Baha'i in the strongest terms, including urging that detained Baha'i be released and that the Baha'i community be afforded the same protection and tolerance as all other Iranians.My Department will continue to monitor actively the situation of the Baha'i community in Iran, and to convey my strong views to the Iranian authorities.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1202	I propose to take Questions Nos. 344 and 346 together.The Government remain seriously concerned about the humanitarian situation in Gaza, which has effectively been isolated since the Hamas takeover in June 2007, even during a ceasefire between Israeli forces and Hamas which was broadly respected from 19 June 2008 until 4 November 2008.  Since then there have been a number of clear breaches on both sides.The Government has consistently and repeatedly called for an end to the isolation of the people of Gaza, in particular through the re-opening of crossing points for the movement of people and goods. The Government agree with those who state that the effective isolation of Gaza constitutes collective punishment and is illegal under international humanitarian law. Ireland will continue to work with EU partners to ensure that our concerns about the situation in Gaza are conveyed to the Israeli Government at every appropriate opportunity.Since 4 November, Israel has effectively closed all border crossings for commercial goods, and even for humanitarian supplies. I understand, however, that the situation has improved somewhat in recent days and that Israel has allowed more vital supplies, including fuel, to be delivered to the people of Gaza. This is a welcome development but the population of 1.5 million people continue to face virtually unsustainable conditions.While expressing our humanitarian concerns about Gaza, the Government unreservedly condemn the recent renewal of rocket attacks from Gaza on towns in southern Israel. An immediate end to all violence is essential. In this regard, it is vitally important that both sides re-instate and renew the ceasefire originally agreed last June and which will formally expire on 19 December. Ireland will continue to support Egyptian efforts to restore the truce.I raised the situation in Gaza with EU partners at both the meeting of the General Affairs and External Relations Council in Brussels on 8 December and a Foreign Ministers' discussion which took place en marge of the European Council on 11-12 December. Ireland was instrumental in ensuring that the Council Conclusions adopted on 8 December call for the humanitarian situation in Gaza to be addressed with all urgency, as well as stating that crossings should be opened for the supply of goods and services, and that the ability of the UN Works and Relief Agency (UNWRA) to deliver humanitarian assistance should be assured. The European Council, in its Conclusions of 12 December, also reiterated that the Middle East Peace Process and efforts to achieve a viable two-State solution must be a priority for the international community in 2009.Ireland also raised the situation in Gaza during the Universal Periodic Review of Israel at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva on 4 December, calling on Israel to respect its obligations under international human rights instruments and international humanitarian law.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1203	On 27 November, together with Chief Executive of the Football Association of Ireland, Mr. John Delaney, I announced the appointment of Terry Conroy as the new FAI welfare officer for Britain. This followed a two-stage interview process conducted by the FAI and officials from the Irish Abroad Unit of my Department.  This initiative is a direct response to concerns that the welfare needs of young Irish players who travel to Britain to take up positions at professional clubs be addressed. The vast majority of these young people are ultimately released by their clubs and some experience considerable hardships.The new welfare officer will liaise with clubs in Britain on behalf of players and their families, particularly in cases where difficulties arise in relation to alcohol, substance abuse or gambling. He will work directly with the players to ensure that they are aware of local educational and other vocational training opportunities and will also be available to assist retired Irish footballers who may have fallen on hard times.The Department has allocated a €50,000 grant towards the programme this year, with matching funding provided by the Football Association of Ireland, under whose aegis the welfare officer is employed. The welfare officer will report directly to the FAI, which will in turn report to the Department on the programme's progress. A comprehensive progress report will also be submitted to the Department within twelve months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1204	While the situation in Thailand remains tense, the demonstrations mounted by the People's Alliance for Democracy, which paralysed the capital and key airports in recent weeks, have ended. A new Prime Minister — Abhisit Vejjajiva, leader of the opposition Democrat Party — was elected by the parliament on 15 December, and the process of establishing a new government is now underway. However, in response, supporters of the previous Government launched their own protests in the capital and the situation remains volatile, with the deep-seated polarisation of Thai politics and society unresolved. Thailand also faces both economic difficulties and the task of restoring its international image as a major tourist destination.If political stability is to be achieved, and if Thailand is to successfully address the many challenges it faces, it is vital for the parties there to engage in dialogue in a spirit of national reconciliation. Defining the role of the military will need to be a feature of this process. Of key importance also, in both the short and longer term, will be observance of the rule of law, respect for the Thai constitution and protection of the democratic process.With regard to the situation of Irish citizens in Thailand, the main airports have now reopened and officials and airlines are working to clear the backlog of stranded passengers. Assistance to Irish citizens continues, of course, to be available through our Honorary Consul in Bangkok and our Embassy in Kuala Lumpur, should it be required.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1205	India remains in a state of heightened alert in the aftermath of the Mumbai attacks.  There are concerns that there may be further terrorist incidents, particularly as the country prepares for national elections due before May 2009.  Security remains tight throughout the country, particularly in major cities and at installations such as airports and Government buildings.  My Department is currently advising travellers to exercise caution in relation to journeys to and within India.My Department provided consular assistance to over 30 individuals with whom it was in contact.  Thankfully, there were no Irish injuries, but several Irish citizens had been in hotels attacked by the militants.  All of these managed to escape without injury, though some were deeply distressed by the experience.  Assistance provided to them included replacement of travel documents which had to be abandoned when the attacks took place, travel arrangements home or out of Mumbai and general advice about the situation and safety issues.  My Department is not aware of any Irish citizens that now require follow-up advice or assistance in the affected region.  The Irish Ambassador in India visited Mumbai on 15 and 16 December for a series of official meetings and calls, including a number of calls on persons and agencies who were helpful to Irish citizens during the crisis.At their meeting on 8 December, EU Foreign Ministers renewed their strong condemnation of the attacks in Mumbai and reiterated their expression of condolences to the families of the victims and their solidarity with the people of India and with the Indian authorities.  Ministers also reiterated their determination to contribute to the fight against terrorism throughout South Asia and called for the stepping up of regional cooperation in combating terrorism.  They also underlined their hope that Pakistan will cooperate fully with the Indian investigation into the attacks and that both countries and their neighbours will work together to bring those responsible to justice.In terms of my own contacts, as I stated in response to a previous Parliamentary Question on 4 December, I spoke with the Indian Ambassador in Dublin on 27 November, the day after the attacks began, to convey my sincere condolences on behalf of the Irish people at the tragic events which were taking place at that time.  I also expressed the hope that the Indian authorities would be able to resolve the situation without further loss of life and that those who carried out or plotted these attacks would be brought to justice.  On 9 December I wrote to the Minister of External Affairs of India, Shri Pranab Mukherjee, to express my personal condolences on the tragic loss of life which occurred at Mumbai and to express the deep appreciation of the Government for the support extended by the relevant Indian security and emergency services to officials in our Embassy in New Delhi and our Consulate General in Mumbai as they carried out their consular duties following the attacks. I assured the Minister of our support and solidarity at this most difficult time for India.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1206	I propose to take Questions Nos. 349 and 350 together.The third session of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) mechanism of the UN Human Rights Council took place in Geneva between 1 and 15 December 2008.  The UPR is one of the major new aspects of the Council, which subjects each UN member State to a thorough review of its human rights performance every fourth year.  The reviews are based on information provided by the concerned State, compilation reports prepared by the Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) and input from NGOs. Each review is facilitated by three States members who act as rapporteurs.  During the UPR Working Group sessions, States and NGOs have the opportunity to participate in an interactive dialogue with the State under review.Sixteen countries were reviewed at the third UPR session, namely Bahamas, Barbados, Botswana, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cape Verde, Colombia, Israel, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Montenegro, Serbia, Turkmenistan, Tuvalu, United Arab Emirates and Uzbekistan. Ireland participated actively at the session, putting questions and recommendations to Botswana, Burundi, Colombia, Israel, Montenegro, Serbia and Uzbekistan.  The questions and recommendations of participating States, including those from Ireland, are reflected in the outcome reports that were adopted by the UPR Working Group and can be viewed on the website of the Human Rights Council: http://www.ohchr.org/EN/HRBodies/UPR/Pages/UPRmain.aspxIn relation specifically to the examination of Colombia, the Irish Delegation raised issues and made recommendations regarding human rights defenders, victims of gender-based violence and extrajudicial killings. Ireland welcomed recent Colombian government assurances on the protection of Human Rights Defenders and the development of a Protection Programme for Human Rights Defenders.  Ireland also recommended that Colombian legislation on Human Rights Defenders be implemented in full.  Ireland recommended that the Colombian government implement the May 2008 Constitutional Court ruling that the witness protection programme be revised to deal with gender-based violence.Ireland recommended that the Colombian Government implement urgently the recommendations of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights from 2008.  In welcoming recent Colombian government efforts to end the incidence of extrajudicial killings in Colombia, Ireland further recommended that the new National Plan of Action on Human Rights and International Humanitarian Law be used to address comprehensively the issue of extra-judicial killings.  Ireland will examine the conclusions and recommendations of the report of the Universal Periodic Review of Colombia which was adopted on 15 December.The establishment of a strong UPR mechanism was viewed by Ireland and the wider EU membership as a key innovation of the Human Rights Council.  Its universal nature counters charges of selectivity. We have stressed the importance of ensuring that experts and NGOs are fully involved in the process, and the importance of concrete outcomes and operational follow-up.  The first two UPR sessions took place in April and May 2008 respectively.  As 16 States are reviewed at each session, a total of 48 States have been reviewed so far. Ireland is due to undergo the UPR process in 2011.

This contract is currently held by Club Travel Limited and was awarded following an EU-level advertised procurement process conducted earlier this year.  Club Travel is used by my Department to book hotel accommodation for officers travelling to Brussels.The central aims of the travel policy of my Department, which is based on the travel policy for Government Departments laid down by the Department of Finance, are to minimise official travel costs and to achieve value for money for expenditure necessarily incurred, consistent with the effective discharge of official duties.  The Departmental travel policy advises that the most reasonably priced, appropriate, hotel accommodation should be used when engaged in official travel.Throughout Ireland's diplomatic network of 75 Missions abroad, Embassies and Consulates maintain lists of Hotels with which special rates have been negotiated locally.  When official or Ministerial travel is being undertaken abroad, the Mission accredited to the country will book appropriate accommodation for officials and Ministers in line with Departmental travel policy and in consultation as necessary with the Minister's Office.

This programme ran from 1995 to end-December 2001, with continued funding being drawn down to the end of 2005.This Department had responsibility for two measures under the sub-programme of Peace I which dealt with cross border development. The first of these two measures was entitled Measure 3.3 on Cross-Border co-operation between Public Bodies and had an expenditure of approximately €11 million. The second was entitled Measure 3.1 on Cross-Border Business and Cultural Linkages and had an expenditure of €12 million. The latter measure was implemented by an intermediary agency, Co-Operation Ireland, under the supervision of this Department.

#MartinCullen	unknown-#MartinCullen-party	unknown-#MartinCullen-dob	unknown-#MartinCullen-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1225	I propose to take Questions Nos. 373 and 375 together.Under the Sports Capital Programme, which is administered by my Department, funding is allocated to sporting and community organisations.  It is the main vehicle for development of sports facilities at local, regional and national level throughout the country.Since 1998 the Sports Capital Programme has allocated over €725m to 7,401 sports facility projects.  This investment has transformed the sporting landscape of Ireland with improved facilities in virtually every village, town and city.  The facilities funded range from new equipment for the smallest clubs, to regional multi-sport centres and national centres of sporting excellence.  For a project to be considered for funding under the programme it must first meet a certain number of basic requirements such as showing evidence of the minimum required level of own funding or evidence of freehold or sufficiently long leasehold to ensure that the facility stays in sporting use.  All projects that do not meet these minimum requirements are considered ineligible and are not assessed for funding.When assessing applications that have met these minimum requirements the Department uses a number of criteria.  Applications are scored according to how well they meet these criteria and then ranked in order of priority within their own county. The amount of funding available for distribution under the Programme in each county is determined on a pro-rata basis based on the 2006 Census of Population.  This method of assessment and allocation ensures that all counties, including those with   growing populations, receive proportionate levels of funding.  However, if a county does not have a sufficient number of eligible projects it is of course not possible to allocate that county's share of the total allocations. In these cases the funding is distributed to projects elsewhere.Information in relation to the number of applications received under the sports capital programme nationally and in Kildare, and the number of successful applications from Kildare, in each of the last five years and the amount of outstanding allocations as at the end of October is set out in the table below:YearNo. Of Applications — TotalNo. Of Applications — KildareNo. Of Successful Applications — KildareFunding allocated nationally but still to be drawn down€20041,304442712,532,16820051,362441615,863,30620061,338331934,465,95820071,533381756,699,57420081,453442147,298,000The amount of funding allocated to clubs and organisations in Kildare over the period 2004 to 2008 but not yet drawn down is almost €6.5 million.

The aim of the Programme is to maximise participation in sport through the provision of modern high quality, safe, well-designed and sustainable facilities and sports equipment.  The provision of such facilities allows for increased numbers to participate in sport.A grant of €120,000 was provisionally allocated to the project in question under the 2007 Sports Capital Programme. A number of queries have been raised by my Department in relation to the procurement of works carried out in relation to this project.  The club responded to these queries last week and the matter is currently being considered.  It is expected that a letter will issue to the organisation in question later this week.

The rationale for this is based on the principle that the overall cost of increments for staff should be offset by reductions in costs arising from the retirement or other movements of staff at higher points on pay scales and their replacement by staff at lower points.The figure for 2009 is calculated on the basis of existing staff in the Department but the final figure will be impacted, inter alia, by further staff turnover in the context of finalising the decentralisation of the Department to Killarney in early 2009.The cost of incremental pay increases for the agencies under the remit of the Department is a matter for each agency to be met from within their particular pay budget allocation.

The changes in 2005 were due to the establishment as separate legal entities of the National Museum of Ireland and the National Library of Ireland, which were up to then part of the Department.  The figures also reflect a continued reduction in staffing numbers from 2002 in line with Government policy.  The additional figures for 2006 arose from the amalgamation of the Regional Tourism Authorities with Fáilte Ireland, involving an incorporation of the former staff of the Regional Tourism Authorities and the recognition of the Crawford Gallery as a National Cultural Institution.

Such standard payments are intended, inter alia, to cover any hotel accommodation costs for officials that may arise.  However, direct expenditure on hotel accommodation may arise in certain cases — for example, if the overnight subsistence rate does not cover the cost of hotel accommodation for officers travelling abroad.  In the case of hotels abroad, my Department has a contract in place with a service provider who has special negotiated hotel rates in Brussels hotels and access to a global hotel programme with over 12,000 properties in 47 countries, with an average discount of 20% on corporate rates.  All such expenditure is paid in accordance with Department of Finance guidelines.  Similar arrangements to those set out in the preceding paragraph also apply to Oifig Choimisinéir na dTeangacha Oifigiúla and the Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests.  With regard to other bodies funded from within my Department’s ministerial Vote group, my Department has been assured that the procurement arrangements in place comply with relevant Department of Finance guidelines.  Relevant information on direct expenditure on hotel accommodation costs arising in respect of my Department and bodies funded from within my Department’s ministerial Vote group is being compiled.  I have arranged for it to be forwarded to the Deputy as soon as possible.

The programme provides financial assistance to projects to help meet the cost of staffing and equipping local resource centres, which provide a focal point for community development activities. Projects are concerned with the needs of women and children, those with disabilities, the homeless, lone parent families, the elderly, the unemployed, young people at risk, Travellers and other disadvantaged groups.  Kilmore West community development project has been funded through the programme since 1999.  Its principal activity is to establish and organise community development projects and to act as promoters of such projects for the benefit of the local community and environs.  The management committee of Kilmore West community development project is made up of local people from target groups in the community, such as older people and lone parents.  Core funding under the programme for Kilmore West community development project for 2008 was set at €120,483.  Many projects leverage additional funds from a variety of sources, including the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform, the Health Service Executive and the VEC.  Kilmore West community development project reported the receipt of additional funds of €34,400 from the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform in 2007, and over €43,000 in 2008 from the Department of Health and Children in support of an after-school project.

In the normal way, the overall cost of increments for some staff on incremental scales should be offset by reductions in cost arising from retirements or other movements by staff on higher incremental points and their replacement by staff on lower points.  I can confirm that there is no increased provision for increments in the pay bill in my Department's group of Votes for 2008, nor is such a provision being made for 2009.  The position would be the same in relation to previous years.

To date, 100 civil servants have moved to interim accommodation in Tubbercurry, County Sligo, 51 of whom relocated from Dublin.  It is not planned to move any further staff to this location until a permanent headquarters is in place in Charlestown in mid-2011.  The decentralisation of ten civil servants from my Department to Na Forbacha, County Galway, is now complete, with five of the staff concerned having relocated from Dublin.  In relation to Foras na Gaeilge, none of the public servants employed in that organisation has relocated to Gaoth Dobhair, County Donegal, as yet.  The matter is being pursued in a North-South context.  It is anticipated that five staff will relocate in 2009.  For the sake of completeness, I should add that 25 of the staff of Pobal, a private company with charitable status, have relocated to Clifden, County Galway.  All except one were recruited locally. I understand that it is not planned to move any further staff to this location in 2009.

In accordance with a decision made by the North/South Ministerial Council and in order to secure good practice and value for money, the functions and funding of Bord na Leabhar Gaeilge transferred to Foras na Gaeilge with effect from 1 January 2008.  The Council has also decided that the functions, staffing and funding of Colmcille in Ireland should transfer to Foras na Gaeilge and arrangements to that end are in hand.The Charities Bill 2007, which was passed by Seanad Éireann on 11 December 2008, provides for the dissolution of the Office of Commissioners of Charitable Donations and Bequests for Ireland. The Bill further provides that the Office of Commissioners will be replaced by a new Charities Regulatory Authority, which will take on the statutory functions of the Office of Commissioners, as well as having broader statutory regulatory functions relating to charities operating in the jurisdiction.A total of 94 local development bodies and 184 community development projects receive funding through my Department or through Pobal for local delivery of community and rural development measures. Arising from the cohesion process, which involves the merger of overlapping LEADER and Partnership groups, the number of local development bodies is being reduced from 94 to 54.Further opportunities to secure improved efficiencies and outcomes across bodies within the ambit of my Department will be pursued over the coming period.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1246	I propose to take Questions Nos. 398 and 415 together.The requirement to be habitually resident in Ireland was introduced as a qualifying condition for certain social welfare payments with effect from 1 May 2004, in the context of the Government's decision to open the Irish labour market to workers from the 10 new EU Member States without the transitional limitations which were imposed at that time by most of the other Member States.It applies to claims for jobseeker's allowance, non-contributory State pension, blind pension, non-contributory widow's and widower's pensions and guardian's payment, one-parent family payment, carer's allowance, disability allowance, supplementary welfare allowance including rent supplement, and child benefit.The effect of the condition is that a person whose habitual residence is elsewhere is not qualified for these payments on arrival in Ireland. Three out of every four claims that require detailed examination with regard to the habitual residence condition are found to satisfy that condition.  Those who are refused are mainly people who have not been granted access to the labour market or people who have had no attachment, or insignificant attachment, to the work force since arrival in Ireland.  There is therefore no conflict between this provision and the policy of attracting to Ireland qualified workers to fill jobs which cannot be filled from the current labour force.No distinction is drawn in social welfare legislation on grounds of nationality. To introduce any such distinction would be in conflict with the provisions of the Equal Status Acts and with international conventions.  Therefore Irish people are subject to the habitual residence condition in the same way as others when they claim one of the relevant payments.It is not the case that a person "who has been abroad more than once in the past four years will be deemed ineligible".  The factors taken into consideration in deciding whether the condition is satisfied include: length and continuity of residence in Ireland, length and purpose of any absence from Ireland, the nature and pattern of employment, the applicant's main centre of interest and the future intention of the applicant.   These factors were originally set down in judgements of the European Court of Justice and were included for clarity in the Social Welfare Consolidation Act in 2007.  Taking into account, particularly, the last two of these factors, Irish nationals returning to live here on a permanent basis should experience no difficulty in demonstrating that they satisfy the requirements of the Habitual Residence Condition.The Department consulted with the Attorney General's Office in the course of drafting the habitual residence legislation and subsequently when issues were raised regarding compliance with the EU legislation and other international convention commitments.  None of the issues raised with the Department have warranted a change in the legislation.The habitual residence condition does not apply to exceptional or urgent needs payments under the Supplementary Welfare Allowance scheme.  In addition to this, the EU regulations covering migrant workers who have been employed in Ireland since arrival here are carefully observed.  Direct provision is also available for asylum seekers.  In these ways, the application of this provision conforms fully to our EU and international obligations.The guidelines for deciding officers with regard to the habitual residence condition are updated periodically and published on the Department's website at: http://www.welfare.ie/EN/ OperationalGuidelines/Pages/habres.aspx   Similar guidelines have been circulated to community welfare officers of the Health Service Executive who administer the supplementary welfare schemes.

Every effort will be made to have this appeal dealt with as quickly as possible.The Social Welfare Appeals Office is an office of the Department that is independently responsible for determining appeals against decisions on Social Welfare entitlements.
#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1248	This Department administers some fifty schemes and makes payments to one million people each week.  Because of the nature, scale and diversity of its work, the Department holds extensive and detailed personal information about its customers and takes its responsibilities to safeguard this data extremely seriously.  Every effort is made by the Department and the agencies under its aegis to ensure that personal customer data is held securely.In the past 12 months, the following equipment and data was lost or stolen from the Department:Two Desktops — Social  Welfare Local Office,  Buncrana, Co. Donegal;Two Laptops — (1 house break-in, 1 office break-in).None of the equipment held sensitive data.  The two desktops were used to access applications which are run from the DSFA Data Centre in Dublin.  All client data is held on central databases and, therefore, no client data was held on the desktops.  The laptops were being used to access centrally-stored client information through a secure remote log-in.  No client data was retained on the laptops after the remote sessions ceased.  It is Departmental policy that sensitive data is not to be held on mobile devices unless absolutely necessary and, even then, only when appropriately secured.  All new laptops are fitted with full disk encryption software before issue, and all existing laptops are being recalled for encryption.

The capacity of each server is dependent on the nature of the application involved and the particular ICT service being provided. Most servers are connected to a Storage Area Network and the amount of disk capacity allocated varies according to the function assigned to the server at any given time.A migration programme is currently underway to move all remaining Open VMS applications to the Windows platform and the implementation of consolidation and virtualisation initiatives has commenced to reduce the physical number of servers deployed.

#MaryHanafin	unknown-#MaryHanafin-party	unknown-#MaryHanafin-dob	unknown-#MaryHanafin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1260	In Budget, 2009 the Government announced proposals in relation to the future of two of the agencies under the aegis of the Department — the Combat Poverty Agency and the Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS).  The legislative provisions to give effect to the proposed changes for the Combat Poverty Agency and the MABS are contained in the Social Welfare (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2008.The Combat Poverty Agency is to be integrated with the Office for Social Inclusion in a new Division within the Department of Social and Family Affairs. The decision on integration was informed by the findings of a review of the Combat Poverty Agency undertaken on foot of a Government Decision of 6th June, 2007.The Department is working with the Board of the Agency in finalising a plan for the smooth integration of both bodies.  This will include meetings and workshops with the staff involved before the plan is finalised and subsequently in the course of its implementation.  A Steering Committee comprising senior officials in the Department and members of the of the Agency has been set up to oversee the integration project and it is envisaged that a six month period will be required to complete the arrangements for the transition of the Combat Poverty and the Office for Social Inclusion to the new Division.The integration of the Combat Poverty Agency and the Office for Social Inclusion will create a stronger, more cohesive and better resourced body to support the Government's anti poverty and social inclusion strategies, including engagement with the social partners and other stakeholders.  The quality and extent of the support provided will be much greater than each body has been able to provide separately.  Integration will represent much better value for money not only for taxpayers but also for those experiencing poverty and social exclusion in terms of the improved overall support which can now be provided.  There will be additional direct savings in terms of accommodation and support services.  The extent and timing of these savings will be identified and dealt with as part of the implementation process which is underway.The Money Advice and Budgeting Service (MABS) is the main Government funded service which provides assistance to people who are over-indebted and need help and advice in coping with debt problems.  It is widely recognised as providing a high quality, confidential, personal service to the public that makes a significant difference to the lives of many people.  There are 53 independent companies with voluntary boards of management and over 240 money advice staff operating the local services throughout the country.  However, it has been recognised for some time that the Service needs a proper legislative basis and structure.  The Government has decided that this can best be achieved by placing the MABS with the Citizens Information Board.  It is not envisaged that significant savings or additional costs will arise on the assignment of the provision of the MABS to the Citizens Information Board.  Rather the intention is, in line with the Programme for Government, to provide strong management support to the local voluntary companies in the provision of a high quality service to meet the needs of people encountering debt difficulties in today's society.  Cost efficiencies will be realised in the medium to longer term through the integration of support services such as administration and IT.It is envisaged that a six month period up to July 2009 will be required to complete the arrangements for the transfer of responsibility for the MABS to the Citizens Information Board.  Details of the implementation plan are being worked out in consultation with the Citizens Information Board and the Chief Executive Officer.

Payment ceased when he failed to sign the Live Register on the appointed day (23 October 2008) and thereby failed to prove he was unemployed from that time.He made a repeat claim on 10 November 2008 and the claim was disallowed on the grounds that he had failed to submit any evidence of his efforts in seeking employment.Notification of the decision and his right to appeal issued on 12 November 2008 and an appeal was received on 15 December 2008.  All relevant papers will be sent to the Appeal Office as soon as possible and they will be in touch with him in due course.In the meantime it is open to him to contact the local Community Welfare Officer who may be in a position to help him.

The laptop was encrypted and sensitive or private data was not compromised.In relation to all other non-ICT items of equipment or data held by the Defence Forces, the information cannot be assembled in the short timeframe available, given the scale and variety of equipment and the geographical spread of the Defence organisation, at home and abroad.  However, this information will be collated as part of the accounting cycle for the twelve months ending 31st December 2008 and will be available in early 2009.  I will provide details to the Deputy as soon as they are available.

In certain limited cases, my Department pays the cost of hotel accommodation directly.  However, records are not readily available in these cases and it would take an inordinate amount of time and resources to manually compile the information.I am satisfied that the procurement arrangements in place in my Department and its agencies for sourcing hotel accommodation when necessary are in compliance with the Department of Finance guidelines.  Approval for overnight accommodation in relation to official business is sought in advance from a senior official in my Department and sanction is only authorised when it is established that the overnight accommodation is essential.  In advance of payment, claims made in respect of overnight accommodation are certified by an authorised official as being in accordance with the provisions of the appropriate Department of Finance Travel and Subsistence circulars.  The Department of Finance circulars on Travel and Subsistence are brought to the attention of all staff and are readily available on my Department's intranet site.

The capacity varies according to need.  There is also a wide geographical spread, given the nature and scope of the Defence organisation.  The following is a summary of the position.Civil Branch of the Department, including integrated civil/military modules: a total of 79 Servers; the storage capacity varies from 300 GB (gigabyte) to 1.0TB (terabyte; 1 TB=1000GB) per server.  None is leased. Defence Forces — military only applications: a total of 152 servers.  The storage capacity varies from 70GB to 1.1 TB per server.  There are four servers leased by the Defence Forces.  Three of these have a 160 GB capacity and one has a capacity of 144 GB.

This work is currently underway.  It is hoped that these remedial works will assist in the takeover of the estate by Kildare County Council.Since that meeting, my officials have been in contact with Kildare County Council in order to arrange a meeting to discuss the taking over of the estate.  A response is awaited from Kildare County Council to my department's invitation to discuss the matter.

These figures are based on existing personnel numbers and do not reflect any changes in numbers or profile of staff that might take place in the future.  Some of the factors that can influence this are resignations, career breaks, retirements and decentralisation.

The meeting was an important stocktaking exercise at the mid-way point between last year's agreement on the Bali Road Map and the new global climate change agreement that will be reached next year in Copenhagen. A number of important decisions were made at the meeting, including on accelerating the negotiations in 2009.  This will be facilitated by the work programmes agreed that provide an ambitious and clearly defined timetable for the different stages of the negotiations next year, including the production of a negotiating text by June 2009 for the future global climate agreement.  Agreement on the operational of the Adaptation Fund was also reached in Poznan, so that funding will be available for climate change adaptation projects in developing countries from 2009.  I delivered a national statement in the Plenary Session, focusing on adaptation of developing countries to the inevitable effects of climate change, and I intervened in the Ministerial Roundtable on a shared vision on long-term cooperative action.  I also participated in the daily meetings of the EU Ministers to coordinate the position of the Community's negotiators.  Members of my delegation participated in the negotiations as active and important players in the broader European Union delegation, including negotiating and presenting on behalf of the EU.

This assessment comprised three distinct modules, and the consultants had available the advice of the Environmental Protection Agency, the Marine Institute and the Health and Safety Authority in their development:1. assessing quality of surface water, marine sediment and mussel bivalves in the vicinity;2. assessment of any health or environmental risks posed by current site conditions;3. ambient air monitoring.Analytical results in respect of the above modules were compared against the most relevant and appropriate comparative screening values in all cases. Ambient air monitoring was undertaken in accordance with relevant national and international occupational exposure limit values, finding that air quality complied with all relevant standards and guidelines, including in Cobh which was the main population centre that was monitored, and that there is no occupational risk to human health from airborne substances.Similarly the assessment of water, sediment and mussel samples employed the relevant applicable screening criteria and found no identifiable risk to the residents of Cork Harbour, though some findings do merit further investigation and monitoring.  In the case of assessing the health and environmental risks posed by potential contaminants in the waste material on the East Tip itself the screening was undertaken using threshold screening values for commercial/industrial use. These human health generic assessment criteria which are derived from guidance issued in the UK are considered most appropriate for the site and are conservative for on-site exposures for current land use. In that context any exceedances of these screening values identified in the report do not suggest a risk to health of people on site undertaking normal activities or to those in the Cork harbour area including the Naval Base.Furthermore, at the request of the local residents and public representatives, it was arranged that the site assessment reports be reviewed by independent experts in order to offer reassurance to the local communities that the scope of works, tests and analysis employed conform to best international practice in determining whether there exists any immediate health or environmental threat posed by the site.  Professor Phillip Morgan (Sirius Geotechnical & Environmental Ltd) and Dr. Marcus Trett (Physalia Limited, Consultant & Forensic Ecologists) carried out this peer review and considered the aspects of the WYG reports relating to the potential risk posed by contamination present in, on or under the land to human health and environmental and ecological receptors that could realistically be impacted by such contamination. The peer reviewers considered that, overall, the reports represent work that is of a quality consistent with good professional practice for such projects.In relation to consultation with the local communities my Department and I have previously met with the local residents and, while their views are well known to my Department, it is intended that further consultation will take place in the New Year prior to my submitting proposals to Government in respect of the future use of the site.

I have put in place a rigorous supervisory framework to ensure that good quality drinking water is available to the public and that effective mechanisms exist to deal quickly and effectively with any problems which may arise.  Under the European Communities (Drinking Water) (No. 2) Regulations, 2007, local authority drinking water supplies are subject to supervision by the EPA and I have given the Agency the necessary resources to back up its new enforcement powers.Substantial funding towards local authorities' water conservation programmes, including replacement of old pipework, is being provided under my Department's Water Services Investment Programme.  In this context it is open to each authority to prioritise any necessary pipe replacement in its own area.In relation to individual service connections and internal plumbing, water services legislation provides that the owner of a premises is responsible for ensuring that the internal water distribution system is capable of delivering drinking water that complies with drinking water standards. My Department's Water Services Investment Programme does not extend to funding or providing grants for replacement of individual services connections or other measures relating to single households.

The seventh ordinary member would be an officer of the Minister.  Under this structure, if a vacancy occurred on the Board following the retirement, resignation or removal from office of a nominated ordinary member, it may follow that, pending the filling of that vacancy, there would be no nominee of the panel concerned on the Board.   However, the 2000 Act provides that the Board may act notwithstanding a vacancy in the office of Chairperson or among the ordinary members, as long as there is a minimum of three members to form a quorum for a meeting of the Board.   Where a vacancy occurs, the Minister shall, as soon as may be, take steps to fill the vacancy.Accordingly, I am advised that while there have from time to time been vacancies on the Board, it was nevertheless entitled to act and to continue to perform its functions under the 2000 Act.               The 2000 Act was amended in 2006 to provide that the Board would comprise a Chairperson and 9 ordinary members, and that the Minister would appoint 2 ordinary members from among persons nominated by each of four panels of prescribed organisations representing various sectoral interests.  Given that the terms of office of various ordinary members spanned the transition from a Board of 7 ordinary members to one of 9, and a change in nominating panels, it followed that the distribution of backgrounds currently envisaged under section 106 of the Act need not be immediately achievable and might fall to be dealt with as future vacancies arise.

Local authorities have powers under the Housing Act 1966 to acquire dwellings for social housing purposes and must consider such acquisitions in the context of their housing action plan and their available funding.As is the case with all Social Housing Investment Programme projects, proposals for acquisitions must be developed in accordance with the policy framework set out in Delivering Homes, Sustaining Communities, addressing inter alia an identifiable housing need and promoting a desirable tenure mix in the wider locality, and must also fully comply with the usual procurement requirements and procedures as outlined in my Department's Circulars which place particular focus on achieving best value for money.

My Department does not hold information in relation to the numbers currently on waiting lists in County Donegal.The 2008 statutory housing need assessment indicated that the net housing need in County Donegal at 31 March 2008 was 2,519 households.  The breakdown by authority in that county is:Donegal County Council — 1,763 households;Bundoran Town Council — 91 households;Buncranna Town Council — 150 households; andLetterkenny Town Council — 515 households.The Government has been responding to the increased social housing need over the last number of years by expanding its social housing investment programme.  Local authorities have recorded significant levels of housing output culminating in a record output of over 9,000 units in 2007.  Indications are that the public housing programme will provide over 9,000 new dwellings again in 2008 through a combination of local authority construction and acquisition programmes, the programmes of voluntary and co-operative housing bodies and by means of long term arrangements with private property owners under the Rental Accommodation Scheme.Looking to the future, €1.66 billion in funding has been provided for housing in the 2009 Estimates which will support continued strong momentum towards meeting housing needs, our commitments in Towards 2016 and our long-term goals under the National Development Plan.

Equally, local authorities must ensure full value for money for the resources invested, and seek the maximum efficiency across their operations.General purpose grants are important in assisting local authorities to balance their budgets, and comprise about one fifth of the funding required by authorities to provide their day to day services, although the proportion varies between authorities.Local authorities receive income from a range of sources including rates, charges for goods and services, specific State grants and general purpose grants from the Local Government Fund.Donegal County Council's general purpose grant allocation for 2009 is €41,475,164.  General purpose grants to Donegal County Council have increased by some 218% since 1997.I am satisfied that the general purpose allocation I have provided for 2009, together with the income available from other sources, will enable Donegal County Council to provide an acceptable level of service to their customers.

#JohnGormley	unknown-#JohnGormley-party	unknown-#JohnGormley-dob	unknown-#JohnGormley-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1314	Work to merge the Local Government Management Services Board and the Local Government Computer Services Board, into the Local Government Services Board, has been initiated and is expected to require the preparation of legislation.  These Bodies are funded through the local government system rather than by way of direct Exchequer subvention, and their merging will be designed to promote further efficiency and effectiveness in shared service provision in local government.  It is, accordingly, not possible to provide the requested level of detail at this time.It is planned that the Rent Tribunal will merge with the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  My Department is currently examining appropriate mechanisms for advancing the merger.  I anticipate that legislation will be required and in that event it will be introduced through the Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill, 2008.  No savings will accrue to the Exchequer in 2008 and the expected savings in 2009 will be dependent on the timing of the merger.  The full year savings arising are estimated to be in the region of €70,000 to €100,000 per annum.

The 2008 boundary alteration was supported by both Limerick City Council and Limerick County Council.The Green Paper on Local Government, Stronger Local Democracy — Options for Change, which I published in April 2008, discusses the issues of the governance of the gateways, the establishment and role of the Local Government Commission, and local authority boundary changes.  The White Paper on local government, which I am currently finalising, will set out the Government's proposals in relation to these matters.

#MichaelFinneranFF	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-party	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinneranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1317	My Department made combined capital allocations of €1,962,090, €2,545,140 and €1,008,930 to the North, South and West Divisions, respectively, of Cork County Council and €1,855,620 to Cork City Council, in May 2008, for the operation of the Housing Adaptation Grant Schemes for Older People and People with a Disability.  The schemes are funded by 80% recoupment available from my Department together with 20% contribution from the resources of the local authority.  In light of particularly significant levels of activity experienced by Cork County and City Councils this year, I announced in October 2008 a supplementary Exchequer allocation of €1,200,000, (that is €300,000 for Cork City Council and €300,000 for each of the County Council's three Divisions), towards the operation of these schemes in 2008.  It is a matter for local authorities to decide on the specific level of funding to be directed towards each of the schemes, from within the combined allocation notified to them, and to manage the operation of the schemes in their areas from within this allocation.My Department is in the process of liaising with all local authorities regarding their funding requirements under the schemes in 2009 and it is my intention to notify individual allocations to local authorities early in the New Year.In line with my objective of prioritising the needs of the most vulnerable households, the total financial provision secured for housing in 2009 will allow for the level of funding allocated towards housing supports for older people and people with a disability next year to be increased by 8% over the initial estimate for 2008.  This provision will enable local authorities to continue effectively to respond to the housing needs of these target groups through the payment of increased numbers of grants.

It acknowledges the opportunity for national government to devolve functions which can be delivered at local level, but that local government needs to be strengthened if it is to take on greater responsibility.The conclusions of the OECD's recent Review of Public Management in Ireland, and the subsequent Report of the Task Force on the Public Service are also of relevance to the balance of functions between central and local government.  The Report of the Task Force in particular recommends that local government structures should be drawn upon to enhance public service delivery, particularly through leadership at local level of shared services, case-based approaches and integrated responses. The Government's proposals in relation to the strengthening of local government will be set out in the White Paper on local government which I am currently finalising.  These proposals will be taken forward in parallel with the overall proposals for public sector reform set out in the recent Government statement on Transforming Public Services and the above-mentioned Report of the Task Force on the Public Service.

Historic information on the extent to which EU assisted expenditure has been incurred for the entire period concerned is not readily available in my Department.  Receipts received by this country since Ireland joined the EU can be obtained from the document Budgetary and Economic Statistics published by the Department of Finance which is available on the website www.finance.gov.ie.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1321	I am providing funding for two programmes that assist households in need of improved insulation.The Warmer Homes Scheme is targeted at households on low incomes, such as those in receipt of fuel allowance, invalidity or disability benefit.  The Scheme provides cavity wall insulation, attic insulation, boiler lagging jackets, draught proofing measures and Compact Fluorescent Lamps (CFLs).  Advice is also provided to householders on minimising energy use.  These measures are provided free or at a nominal cost.The Warmer Homes Scheme is delivered principally through community based organisations.  Sustainable Energy Ireland (SEI) oversees the Programme.  Applications for assistance under the Scheme should be made via the relevant community organisation, details of which can be found under the grants section of SEI's website (www.sei.ie/grants).  I have increased the funding for this Scheme to €5 million in 2009 and have secured another €5 million in matching funding from ESB Customer Supply and Bord Gáis Éireann.The Home Energy Saving Scheme, which is also managed by SEI, will provide grant assistance to householders generally to install energy efficiency measures from next year.  I launched the Scheme on a pilot basis earlier this year, in a selected number of areas and with a budget of €5 million.The pilot phase of the Scheme is providing 30% grants towards cavity wall insulation, wall lining insulation, external insulation, attic insulation, heating controls and low-e double glazing.  This pilot phase is informing the design of the wider roll out of the Scheme in 2009 for which provision of €20 million has been made.  I am currently finalising the operational details of the full Scheme, including the measures that will be supported, and I expect to be in a position to make an announcement in respect of new applications at the beginning of 2009.

The companies contracted by the ESB to dispose of oils used in their electricity transformers do not convey any waste products into the food business.  The waste oils are used in the production of asphalt for road building purposes.  The ESB has longstanding contracts with these companies but in light of the recent pork industry crisis, the ESB undertook discussions with the relevant companies to ascertain the up-to-date position and, based on the assurances it has received, the board is confident of the traceability of such waste products.

Under REPS 4, all payments are to be made in just two instalments. The first payment, of 75%, can be made only when all administrative checks on all 2008 applications for REPS 4 and the Single Payment Scheme are completed.  This is why it has not yet been possible to release payments even to farmers who applied for REPS 4 some time before the closing date of 15 May.Most REPS plans are now prepared using eREPS, the electronic planning system approved and funded by my Department.  As the information in these plans is in computerised format, the administrative checks can be carried out quickly.  However a substantial minority of plans submitted this year were not prepared using eREPS.  Administrative checks on these have to be done manually and are extremely time-consuming.  An effect of recent industrial action in my Department's local offices was that this process was delayed.  While normal working has resumed in the local offices following the intervention of the Labour Relations Commission, there is still much to be done before the administrative checks are completed.  In these circumstances my Department sought some flexibility from the European Commission which would have allowed payment of those REPS 4 cases which had been fully cleared, but the Commission were not prepared to allow this.  As a result, it is now apparent that REPS 4 payments cannot issue before the end of 2008.While I am anxious that the REPS 4 payments should go out as soon as possible, and my Department will make every effort to facilitate this, there are of course still over 48,000 farmers in REPS 3 and just under 16,000 of those have anniversary dates on 1 November and 1 December this year.

Such opportunities are provided through access to information, justice, and through consultation on certain key documents.The transposition of the EU Public Participation Directive 2003/35/EC will include consents granted under the Foreshore Act 1933-2005 where an Environmental Impact Assessment is required under the European Communities (Environmental Impact Assessment) (Amendment) Regulations, 1999 (S.I. No. 93 of 1999).My Department is currently putting in place the necessary measures to ensure that the Foreshore Acts 1933-2005 fully complies with the Public Participation Directive 2003/35/EC.The Government decided on 2 October 2007 that responsibility for certain foreshore functions under the Foreshore Acts 1933-2005 would transfer to the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government.My Department is currently putting in place the necessary arrangements to ensure the efficient and effective transfer of the appropriate legislation and associated functions.My Department will continue to work closely with the Department of the Environment, Heritage and Local Government in the context of progressing the various elements required to fully transpose the EU Public Participation Directive 2003/35/EC in the context of the Foreshore Acts 1933-2005.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1341	The provision of 100% grants for the establishment costs of afforestation has been a key element of national forestry policy and is considered essential to overcome the traditional reluctance to plant and to recognise the long-term commitment of land to forestry.  However, the maximum grant aid available to applicants in Ireland for any afforestation scheme co-funded from EU and Exchequer funds under the Rural Development Regulation 1698/2005 is 80%.The EU, however, has no objection to Member States paying a higher rate of aid on a national basis.  In fact, the EU makes specific provision in its state aid rules for a 100% rate of aid in countries, like Ireland, where forest cover is particularly low. Consequently, and in order to provide for the continued payment of 100% grants, it was decided not to include the forestry measures under the Rural Development Programme and to fund them from the Exchequer instead.The overall amount of EU support for rural development in Ireland for the period 2007 to 2013 was fixed at €2.339 billion in 2006 and is fully allocated to other schemes in Ireland's Rural Development Programme. Accordingly, the decision not to include the forestry programme in the Irish Rural Development Programme has no bearing on the total amount of EU support for rural development in Ireland.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1342	I propose to take Questions Nos. 567 to 569, inclusive, together.I am aware of the report referred to by the Deputy.  My Department conducted a series of countrywide information meetings for farmers on the introduction of the Single Payment Scheme during the latter half of 2004 and again during 2005.  In addition, my Department published two separate booklets on the introduction of cross-compliance and copies were sent to every farmer in the country.  These booklets dealt with the 18 Statutory Management Requirements (SMRs) and Good Agricultural and Environmental Conditions (GAEC) under cross-compliance.  A separate information booklet dealing with the Nitrates element of cross-compliance issued to all farmers during September 2006 and this was followed in November 2006 by a further series of countrywide information seminars for farmers.   More recently, in August 2007, my Department issued a further information leaflet to every farmer in the country setting out, in simple language, what to expect in the event of being selected for an on-farm cross-compliance inspection.  All of these information booklets are available on my Department's website www.agriculture.gov.ie.Ireland also has a farm advisory service (FAS) in the form of Teagasc and private REPS planners.  My Department has organised training for these advisers with particular emphasis on the cross-compliance requirements. Details of all the agencies approved as FAS agencies are held on my Department's website and farmers have been encouraged to make use of these agencies. Furthermore, as advertised in the national press, Teagasc, in conjunction with my Department, has recently undertaken practical on farm demonstrations for farmers on the requirements of cross-compliance.The rate of on-farm inspection required for cross-compliance is 1% of those farmers to whom the Statutory Management Requirements or GAEC apply. However at least 5% of producers must be inspected under the Bovine Animal Identification and Registration requirements as this level is prescribed under the relevant Regulations. In the sheep sector 3% of producers must be inspected annually involving 5% of animals.   Over the four years 2005 to 2008, my Department carried out 23,684 on-the-spot inspections for cross-compliance and applied sanctions in 3,811 cases.I am satisfied that my Department is making every effort to ensure that Irish farmers are fully aware of the cross-compliance requirements.  While we have effective monitoring and control arrangements in place, I have asked my officials to examine in detail the recent Court of Audit Special Report and I am happy to consider any recommendations which would further enhance my Department's implementation of the cross-compliance regime.

In line with this funding, an Operational Programme for Fisheries in  support of the seafood industry has been developed and approved by the EU Commission. Priority has been given to the Decommissioning of Fishing Vessels Scheme for which a total of €32 million has been set aside.  A scheme for vessels over 18 metres in length was launched earlier this year and payments are currently being made.In relation to aquaculture, the EU Commission was not prepared to support the inclusion of aquaculture development in the EU Operational Programme for Fisheries because of its concerns in relation to environmental compliance issues by Ireland.  Aquaculture development will now be supported by state funds.  In 2009, €5 million has been made available for aquaculture development support, in addition to funds provided by BIM. A further €1.46 million has been set aside specifically in 2009 to support compliance of fisheries and aquaculture with respect to activities in Natura 2000 sites.

The European Commission has since reaffirmed that it expects Ireland to respect this deadline strictly.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1352	An application was received on 14 May 2008 requesting the transfer of 23.93 Single Payment Scheme entitlements to the person named from another farmer by way of lease.  The application was processed on 12 November 2008. In addition to the payments that issued to the person named on 16 October and 1 December relating to her own entitlements, a supplementary payment for the leased entitlements issued on 9 December.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1354	As this matter is the subject of a Garda investigation it would be inappropriate for me to comment at this time.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1355	There is no specific budgetary provision for staff incremental pay increases in 2009. The cost, which is part of the overall salaries provision for the Department, will be determined by the numbers of staff qualifying for increments and the stage in the year from which individual incremental payments are made. Precise information is not readily available but the estimated cost for my Department in 2008 and 2009 is €2,054,000 and €2,245,000 respectively.It is not feasible to compile information on comparative costs from 2002 to 2007 having regard to the complexity and extent of the calculations for the staff numbers involved.  Incremental increases awarded by State Agencies which come under the remit of my Department are an operational matter for the agencies themselves.
#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1356	My Department's original Decentralisation Implementation Plan allowed for a phased move to Portlaoise and the 2005, 2006 and 2007 advance phases were completed on schedule.  To date, the Department has met its targets set out in its original plan and in total, since the programme was announced, there has been an increase of 297 full-time posts in Portlaoise and 84 in Clonakilty.  The Department's move to Clonakilty is now substantially complete.  Of the 297 posts moved to Portlaoise and 84 to Clonakilty, all were civil servants; 220 and 33 respectively were from Dublin.The OPW announced late last year that a consortium, the Macquarie Partnership, has won the tender for the project to build the permanent offices in Portlaoise, Mullingar and Carlow (a design, finance, build and maintain contract). Planning permission has been granted and following the budget announcement that the project will proceed, we are expecting an update on timeframes shortly. To reflect the changes to the timetable and the progress so far, as well as the evolving operating environment, a revision to the Department's Decentralisation Implementation Plan is now being considered. As part of this an additional advance phase has been agreed that will involve some 150 posts in the period until completion of the permanent accommodation. The exact breakdown of these posts in terms of those who are relocating from Dublin and relocating from elsewhere is expected to be similar to the proportions evidenced to date.

#BrendanSmith	unknown-#BrendanSmith-party	unknown-#BrendanSmith-dob	unknown-#BrendanSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1360	Included in the Budget statement by the Minister for Finance on the 14th October was the decision to transfer the marketing functions of Bord Iascaigh Mhara to An Bord Bia and to merge the National Council for Forestry Research and Development (COFORD) into my Department.The Government's initiative in transferring the seafood marketing and promotion functions to Bord Bia will ensure the strengthening of seafood marketing as part of a more cohesive overall food marketing effort, while allowing BIM to focus all its energies in developing the seafood industry in line with the Cawley Strategy — Steering A New Course.The integration of seafood marketing with the State's domestic and international food marketing body will deliver synergies and opportunities for seafood producers where Bord Bia can draw on its expertise in the food sector to identify key future trends and opportunities for growth while pre-empting and reacting to market, competitors and global changes.The amalgamation of the promotion and market development functions of BIM with Bord Bia, will enable one single agency to manage Ireland's food and drink marketing effort on domestic and international markets. This will facilitate a more effective and efficient marketing effort. It will include the merging of the agencies presence internationally, which overlap in the four markets where BIM currently has a presence.  My ambition is that the transfer will be effective from early in 2009, subject to the appropriate legal instruments being in place.As Bord Bia determines funding priorities and allocations within its Estimate it is not possible at this stage to estimate possible savings to the Exchequer for the years mentioned.  The amalgamation of COFORD into the Forest Service of my Department early next year will produce savings in the area of accommodation currently taken for that Organisation.  Further possible savings will be accessed as part of the overall estimate provision for the Forest Service in 2009 and beyond.

However,  due to the low sensitivity of the technique, the Department carries out pooled tissue culturing on a percentage of all badgers captured (currently approximately 2,500) across all of the DVOs. Culturing a pooled sample, which involves mixing tissue extracted from up to 14 sites from an individual badger, is significantly less sensitive than the most detailed culturing techniques available (which involve culturing 30 pieces of tissue for each badger), but is deemed to be sufficient for research purposes. From a cost perspective, it would not be economic to carry out laboratory culturing on all badgers and the current arrangements are considered by this Department to be a prudent use of scarce resources. Where detailed post mortem with culturing of tissue is undertaken, TB has been confirmed in 45%-50% of badgers.The number of badgers that have been subject to post mortem and the results of these for each District Veterinary Office area are not available.

Is ábhar dóchais é go leanann líon suntasach mac léinn orthu ag freastal ar na coláistí seo sa Ghaeltacht.

This includes the establishment of special classes in various geographical areas as required and the discontinuation of such classes where the need no longer exists.The continuation of the class referred to by the Deputy is no longer warranted on the basis that the children enrolled in the class do not meet my Department's criteria for enrolment in the class.  A number of discussions have taken place involving the HSE, NCSE and National Educational Psychological Service to determine the best arrangements for pupils with a disability living in the locality. The SENO is awaiting proposals from the school management in this context.  All schools have the names and contact details of their local SENO. Parents may also contact their local SENO directly to discuss their child's special educational needs, using the contact details available on www.ncse.ie.

It is encouraging that a significant number of students continue to attend these colleges in the Gaeltacht.  I recognise also that the colleges have a considerable influence on the economy in the Gaeltacht areas in which they are located.  However, the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.Notwithstanding the increase of €302 million in the education budget for 2009, which is a real achievement in the current economic climate, a number of tough and difficult decisions had to be taken. These decisions were outlined in the Budget day announcements and included the abolition of my Department's grant to Irish summer colleges.  The rate of grant assistance provided per student enrolled on a three week course in 2008 was approximately €53 which represented a relatively small portion of the overall cost of attending.State support will continue for students who attend the summer colleges in the form of the subsidies which are paid to families which accommodate students. The funding of student teachers' attendance at summer colleges in the Gaeltacht and the arrangements regarding additional personal leave for primary teachers who teach in summer colleges will also continue.  I understand the cultural and sociological importance of Gaeltacht areas for students of the language and I am delighted that support will continue to be given to them.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1367	The 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In this respect, the education sector, while protected to a much greater extent than most other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared. The various impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even with the Budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased borrowing requirement in 2009.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation to their staffing and grant allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The staffing allocation processes, including notification to schools, will commence early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers, my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the operation of the redeployment panels, which provide for the retention of a teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed terms of the scheme.I have no difficulty in setting out for this House or for the public generally the overall changes on aggregate teacher numbers or on grant levels in schools for the 2009/10 school year. I will do this when the allocation processes have been completed.  Furthermore, the staffing schedule will be published; it is a transparent and clear way of ensuring that schools are treated consistently and fairly and know where they stand.

The progression of all large scale building projects, including this project, from initial design stage through to construction is dependent on the prioritisation of competing demands on the funding available under my Departments capital budget. This project will be considered on an on-going basis in the context of my Department's multi-annual School Building and Modernisation Programme.  However it is open to the school in question to apply for an emergency works grant. Emergency works grants are made available to schools most in need of resources as a result of unforeseen emergencies of a capital nature that may rise during the school year. Should the school submit an application it will be assessed and the school notified of the outcome.

These are the Higher Education Grants Scheme, the Vocational Education Committees' Scholarships Scheme, the Third Level Maintenance Grants Scheme for Trainees and the Maintenance Grants Scheme for Students attending Post Leaving Certificate Courses. The Higher Education Grants Scheme is administered by the local authorities.  The other three schemes are administered by the Vocational Education Committees.In January each year my Department carries out a survey of the 66 local authorities and VEC's in respect of the status of applications. The survey indicates, on a specified date, the number of applications received, the number awarded a grant, the number refused a grant and the status of other applications on hand. The details in respect of applications for student grants for the academic year 2008/09 will not be available until the January 2009 survey is completed and analysed.In relation to the amount of money allocated for higher education grants I can confirm that the allocation in 2008 is €263 million.  This allocation spans two academic years — the second and third recoupments of the 2007/08 academic year and the first recoupments of the 2008/09 academic year. The first recoupments of the 2008/09 academic year are currently being processed by my Department; this process will be completed by the end of December.

In relation to the procurement arrangements in place in my Department the position is as follows. In instances where overnight accommodation is required for particular purposes for example conferences, training and development programmes etc where possible, quotes are obtained from a range of hotels which best meet the accommodation and facilities requirements of the particular event.  Advice is usually sought from the local Irish embassy in relation to obtaining suitable accommodation for the Minister at official events abroad.  With regard to bodies under the aegis of my Department the expenditure incurred and the procurement arrangements are a matter for each agency and this information is not collated centrally.I recently wrote to the Chairpersons of agencies under my Department's aegis to remind them of the need to ensure efficiency and effectiveness in respect of expenditure of public funds generally and in particular in relation to business travel and subsistence expenditure.  I emphasised the importance of the agencies being in a position to provide assurance, through appropriate control procedures and monitoring arrangements, that the necessary measures are in place to ensure compliance with prescribed procedures in relation to expenditure and that such procedures are documented and being implemented as required by statute, regulation or guideline as appropriate.

In considering the  need to provide extra resource and other teachers to schools in recent years,  the Government could have decided to make children wait until permanent  accommodation could be provided. However, we prioritised putting the extra  teachers into schools as soon as possible. Against this background, my  Department has nonetheless managed to keep expenditure on temporary  accommodation low.  It should be noted that the amount spent on rental  accommodation was still only 5.5% of the total investment in school buildings  in 2007.It should also be noted that temporary accommodation is not limited to prefabs  and can also involve the rental of high quality buildings.

It is a matter for the individual  school authority,as employer, to determine whether any particular post when  vacated may be filled on a permanent basis.In arriving at its decision in this regard, the school authority must take  account of the current and future requirements of the school and the  flexibility needed to meet those requirements.The information in the format requested by the Deputy is not available in my  Department.  I will arrange for information in regard to the current number of  posts in the different categories referred to by the Deputy to be forwarded to  him.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1380	I propose to take Questions Nos. 619 and 620 together.The schools to which the Deputy refers are among the schools that were judged  by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level  of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion. The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010. There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.These schools were among 73 post primary schools that retained resources, both human and financial, under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage. When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact  on these schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate,  difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non  DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS  schools. There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most  need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations  of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on  Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most  disadvantaged communities.The process of identifying schools for participation in DEIS was managed by the  Educational Research Centre (ERC) on behalf of my Department and supported by quality assurance work co-ordinated through the Department's regional offices  and the Inspectorate.The ERC's overall approach was guided by the definition of educational  disadvantage in the Education Act (1998), as: ". . . the impediments to education  arising from social or economic disadvantage which prevent students from  deriving appropriate benefit from education in schools".In the primary sector, the identification process was based on a survey carried  out by the ERC in May 2005, from which a response rate of more than 97% was  achieved. The analysis of the survey returns from primary schools by the ERC  identified the socio-economic variables that collectively best predict  achievement, and these variables were then used to identify schools for  participation in the School Support Programme. The variables involved were:% unemployment% local authority accommodation% lone parenthood% Travellers% large families (5 or more children)% pupils eligible for free books.In the case of second-level schools, the Department supplied the ERC with  centrally-held data from the Post-Primary Pupils and State Examinations  Commission databases. Based on an analysis of these data, the variables used to determine eligibility for inclusion in the School Support Programme were as  follows:Medical card data for Junior Certificate candidates (including Junior Certificate School Programme candidates) 2002, 2003, 2004Junior Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 school  entry cohorts Junior Certificate exam results aggregated to school level (expressed as an OPS  — "Overall Performance Scale" — score).This was based on each student's performance in the seven subjects in which s/he performed best aggregated to school level for the 2002 and 2003 examination cohorts Leaving Certificate retention rates by school for the 1995, 1996 and 1997 school entry cohorts.The identification process was in line with international best practice and had  regard to and employed the existing and most appropriate data sources available.A review mechanism was put in place to address the concerns of schools that did not qualify for inclusion in DEIS but regarded themselves as having a level of  disadvantage which was of a scale sufficient to warrant their inclusion in the  programme. The review process operated under the direction of an independent  person, charged with ensuring that all relevant identification processes and  procedures were properly followed in the case of schools applying for a review.Out of a total of 3,300 primary and 733 second-level schools, 876 schools have  been included under the DEIS action plan. These comprise 673 primary schools  and 203 second-level schools.Targeting resources at the most disadvantaged schools that are working to  counteract educational disadvantage will continue to be a priority for the  Government.

The Statement should identify potential hazards, assess the  risks to health and safety and put appropriate provision in place to safeguard  the safety and health of employees and pupils. The Safety Statement should be  reviewed on a regular basis. In practical terms, individual school authorities  are best placed to assess the detail of their own health and safety  requirements.Sections 14, 15 and 23 of the Education Act,1998 assigns each Board of  Management and Principal Teacher responsibility for the day-to-day management of schools. Principals should organise supervision for the order and general behaviour of pupils during school hours. In particular, they should organise and participate in the effective supervision of the pupils during breaks,  lunch-breaks, assembly and dismissal.Rules 121(4) and 124(1) of the Rules for National Schools and Section 23(2) of  the Education Act 1998 also oblige teachers to take all reasonable precautions  to ensure the safety of pupils and to participate in supervising pupils when  the pupils are on school premises, during school time and/or on school  activities.
#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1382	I have consistently said that the 2009 Budget required difficult choices to be  made across all areas of public expenditure. These decisions were made to  control public expenditure and to ensure sustainability in the long run. In  this respect Education, while protected to a much greater extent than most  other areas of public expenditure, could not be totally spared.The various  impacts at school level were included in the Budget day announcements. Even  with the budget measures in place there will still be a significantly increased  borrowing requirement in 2009.When the country was able to afford it we reduced the basis on which primary  teachers are allocated to schools from being based on an average number of  primary pupils per teacher from 35 pupils in 1995/96 down to the current level  of 27 pupils. This is reflected in the improvements that we have made on class  sizes over the years and these improvements reflect our commitment to  education. The change to a new average of 28 pupils per teacher from September  2009 has to be viewed in that context. Although it reverses some of the  progress that we have made in recent years I had no option but to curtail the  annual increase in teacher numbers. The reduced class sizes for the most  disadvantaged in our DEIS schools of an average of 1 teacher for every 20  pupils in Junior classes and an average of 1 teacher for every 24 pupils in  Senior classes will not be changing in 2009.While the budget measures will impact on class sizes it will be necessary in  the more testing economic climate ahead for us to continue to target and  prioritise our resources to maximum effect for everyone. While teacher numbers  are important numerous influential reports have highlighted the fact that  teacher quality is the single most important factor — far and above anything  else — in improving educational outcomes for children. Ensuring high quality  teaching and learning is a challenge and dealing with factors that inhibit it  represent a challenge for the Government, the Department, school management and indeed the teacher unions.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has commenced with  the processing of enrolment data that has been received from schools. The  staffing allocation processes including notification to schools will commence  early in the New Year. The allocation process includes appellate mechanisms  under which schools can appeal against the allocation due to them under the  staffing schedules. In addition to the mainstream classroom teachers my  Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special needs and  language support. The final allocation to a school is also a function of the  operation of the redeployment panels which provide for the retention of a  teacher in an existing school if a new post is not available within the agreed  terms of the scheme.I am confident that as the global economy improves it will be possible to build  again on the significant achievements of recent years and do so in a manner  consistent with overall prudent management of the Irish economy.

Details of the  criteria and application dates for appeal are contained in the staffing  schedule which issues annually to all Boards of Management and is also made  available on my Department's website. The criteria are also available in  Circular 0024/2007 (Appeal Board for Mainstream Staffing in Primary Schools)  which is also on my Department's website.The Appeal Board operates independently of the Department and its decision is  final.My Department will be advising individual schools in the normal way in relation  to their mainstream staffing allocations. The preparatory work for this has  commenced with the processing of enrolment data that has been received from  schools. The staffing allocation processes including notification to schools  will commence early in the New Year.  In addition to the mainstream classroom  teachers my Department also allocates teaching resources to schools for special  needs and language support.The budget measures will mean that the level of language support will be  reduced from a maximum of six extra teachers per school to a maximum of two  teachers per school, as was the case before 2007.Nonetheless, schools that require language support will still be entitled to  get it. We still envisage having over 1,400 language support teachers in our  schools in September 2009 and up to about 500 other teachers in part-time  posts. By any standards this is a very significant resource and the challenge  will be to ensure that it is used to maximum effect.As I announced on budget day we will also provide for some alleviation for the  position of those schools where there is a significant concentration of  newcomer pupils as a proportion of the overall enrolment. This will be done on  a case by case basis.The allocation process for language support teachers is an annual one and  existing provision is not rolled over automatically. Schools will be applying  afresh in the spring and early summer of 2009 for the 2009/10 school year,  based on their assessment of the prospective needs of existing pupils and any  new pupils they are enrolling. The position for individual schools will become  clear at that stage.

#BattOKeeffe	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-party	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-dob	unknown-#BattOKeeffe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1394	The following measures were also taken by my Department as part of the Government's programme for the rationalisation of agencies.The National Qualifications Authority of Ireland (NQAI), the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) and the Further Education and Training  Awards Council (FETAC) are to be amalgamated into a single agency.An Implementation Advisory Group, representative of the key stakeholders in the amalgamation process, has been formed to advise the Department of Education and Science in relation to the functions of the new organisation.  An implementation paper will be produced covering the functions of the new agency and key legislative considerations.  A period of public consultation will then take place, followed by legislation.  Allowing for planning and consultation, it is anticipated that the legislative process will be complete and the new statutory agency will be established by the end of 2010.  Options for closer co-operation and sharing of administration support between the existing bodies prior to statutory establishment are being explored.It should be noted that the primary reason for the amalgamation is not to achieve cost savings in themselves, but to ensure a more coherent approach by establishing a single integrated organisation.  Savings would not arise from the abolition of functions but from efficiencies resulting from them being performed by a single body.  It is anticipated that some savings will arise, inter alia, from the removal of parallel top level management and board structures and from the sharing of administrative support.  Further work on administrative planning will be required before savings can be quantified.The Educational Disadvantage Committee was formally abolished in October 2008.  If provision was to be made for the Committee's reconstitution it would have been of the order of €100,000 per annum.The National Adult Learning Council (NALC) was formally disbanded in October  2008.  The expenditure incurred on the National Adult Learning Council was as follows:€21,012 in 2002;€59,491 in 2003.The Council has not met since 2003 and no further expenditure has been incurred.  It is estimated that to have proceeded with the Council as originally envisaged would have involved significant additional annual expenditure.The Centre for Early Childhood Development and Education was closed in  September 2008.  Recurrent annual funding for the Centre was in the region of €1 million.

The Department's International Section, which is responsible for the EU dimensions of education and training, purchased a number of copies, from the Institute, of its publication "Consolidated Version of the Treaties amended by the Treaty of Lisbon" for official use.

The terms of the arrangement provide that a teacher in a recognised primary or second level school whilst a member of the Oireachtas can retain their teaching post subject to the approval of the school's managerial authority.Teaching salary is paid to the Oireachtas member for the duration of the arrangement but the total cost of the replacement teacher including pension and PRSI contributions is deducted from the salary.  The arrangement allows that the balance of salary, if any, remaining after the deductions have been made may be paid to the Oireachtas member.  A number of Oireachtas members do not accept any balance of salary that may be payable.The information requested will be forwarded to the Deputy.

Accordingly my Department has focused on delivering as many large projects as possible in 2008 and funding was not made available for a Summer Works Scheme this year.I intend to have a Summer Works Scheme in 2009.  The details of the operation of the scheme and the level of funding to be made available under the scheme in  2009 are currently being considered and will be completed as soon as possible.  The Professional and Technical Reports provided by schools for 2008 can be used again for future projects so that schools will not be at the loss of expenditure on them.

#SeanHaughey	unknown-#SeanHaughey-party	unknown-#SeanHaughey-dob	unknown-#SeanHaughey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2008-12-17 00:00:00	Prelude	1401	The school to which the Deputy refers is among the schools that were judged by an independent identification process in 2005 not to have a sufficient level of disadvantage among their pupils to warrant their inclusion in DEIS (Delivering Equality of Opportunities in Schools), the Action Plan for educational inclusion.  The next identification process is scheduled to be held at the end of the current DEIS programme which runs from 2005-2010.  There will not be an opportunity before this to be included in the current DEIS programme of supports.This school together with 26 other urban primary and 73 post primary schools retained resources, both human and financial, including Home School Community Liaison services under pre-existing schemes and programmes for addressing educational disadvantage.  When DEIS was introduced, a commitment was given as a concessionary measure to these schools that they would retain a level of support for the duration of the DEIS Initiative.While it is appreciated that the discontinuation of these resources will impact on these schools, given the current volatile and challenging economic climate, difficult decisions had to be made in order to contain public sector spending.  One of these decisions was to advance the withdrawal of such supports from non  DEIS schools to the beginning of the next school year.The main focus of Social Inclusion measures will be to retain resources in DEIS schools.  There is a need to focus targeted resources on the schools in most need and this approach is in line with the broad thrust of the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General which are set out in his report on Primary Disadvantage of 2006, which recommended that my Department should focus its educational disadvantage measures on those schools serving the most disadvantaged communities.
