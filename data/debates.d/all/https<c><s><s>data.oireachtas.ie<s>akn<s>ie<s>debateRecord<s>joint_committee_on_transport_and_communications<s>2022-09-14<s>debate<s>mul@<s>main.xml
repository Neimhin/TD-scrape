          <p eId="para_14">The purpose of today's meeting is to discuss issues impacting the taxi industry. Before we begin I want to welcome our new clerk to the committee, Iqra Zainul Abedin.</p>
          <p eId="para_15"> Today I am pleased to welcome, on behalf of the committee, Mr. Alan Cooley, Mr. James Maguire, Mr. Philip Egan and Mr. Des Dempsey from the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation; Mr. Alan Brennan and Mr. David McGuinness from Tiománai Tacsaí na hÉireann; Mr. Kevin Barrett from the Taxi Alliance of Ireland, who is attending remotely; and Mr. Jim Waldron from the National Private Hire and Taxi Association. </p>
          <p eId="para_16"> Witnesses are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice that they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable or otherwise engage in speech that might be regarded as damaging to the good name of the person or entity. If their statements are potentially defamatory in relation to any person or entity, they will be directed to discontinue their remarks and it is imperative that they comply with any such direction. </p>
          <p eId="para_17"> Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable. I also remind members of the constitutional requirement that they be physically present within the confines of the Leinster House complex to participate in public meetings. I will not permit a member to participate where he or she is not able to meet this constitutional requirement. Therefore, any member who attempts to participate from outside the precincts will be asked to leave the meeting. In this regard, I ask any member participating using Microsoft Teams to confirm that he or she is on the grounds of the Leinster House campus prior to making his or her contribution. If attending in the committee room, members are asked to exercise personal responsibility to protect themselves and others from the risk of contracting Covid-19.</p>
          <p eId="para_18"> I now invite Mr. Cooley to make an opening statement on behalf of the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation.</p>

          <from> Mr. Alan Cooley<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_19">I thank the Chairman and committee members for the invitation to speak here today. My name is Alan Cooley and I am the president of the Irish Taxi Drivers Federation. I am joined by Mr. Philip Egan, our secretary, Mr. Des Dempsey, our assistant secretary, and Mr. James Maguire, our airport representative. We are grateful for the opportunity to appear before the committee to share our views on the taxi industry. The main points we wish to discuss today are the extension of the nine-year rule, the transfer of taxi licences, credit cards, the lack of suitability centres across the country, and the Uber situation in Ireland.</p>

        <speech by="#KieranODonnell" eId="spk_3">
          <from> Chairman<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_20">Thank you, Mr. Cooley. I now invite Mr. McGuinness to make an opening statement on behalf of Tiománai Tacsaí na hÉireann.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_4">
          <from> Mr. David McGuinness<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T13:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_21">I also thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity to address the committee today on issues affecting the taxi sector.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">At the outset of the pandemic, we requested a five-year extension of the vehicle age for all vehicles to include new vehicles with loans attached and older vehicles due to exit the sector. Currently we have an electric vehicle, EV, grant. However, stock has become a real issue. Drivers with older vehicles cannot source an electric vehicle. If the operator changes vehicle in the short term due to end of vehicle life, the vehicle purchased may not meet the criteria for the EV grant. We have requested a common-sense approach, leaving operators in existing vehicles until EVs become available. We have written to the Minister for Transport with this request and so far received no reply.</p>
          <p eId="para_23"> It is our view the sector needs to be incorporated into the public transport system. Taxis are the only 365-days-per-year, 24-hour, door-to-door transport service. This would lead to inclusion at large-scale events, resulting in temporary taxi stands and set-down and drop-off facilities. Currently large venues throughout Dublin have no taxi stands or set-down or drop-off areas resulting in operators not offering their services at the venues. Difficulties with parking and the threat of being fined are some of the reasons operators quoted. Dublin City Council's lack of engagement with the taxi sector at major public events needs to be addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_24"> Tiománaí Tacsaí na hÉireann resigned its seat on the taxi advisory committee, TAC, during the early months of the pandemic. It is our view the sector should be in a negotiation position as opposed to an advisory position with the Department of Transport. We requested changes to the committee subsequent to our resignation but all were refused. Many of the proposals we submitted to the Department and the TAC were not adopted. The TAC needs to be disbanded for a national transport forum that allows all bodies that provide public transport to input positively to the transport system of Ireland.</p>
          <p eId="para_25"> Currently licences are non-transferable except on the death of the licence holder. Up until this decision, a taxi operator saw his or her licence as a business with the opportunity to build a small business to be shared or passed on to a suitable family member and, therefore, bringing younger generations into the sector. As this is no longer possible until after death, many drivers see the licence as a way of earning a weekly wage and do not see it as a small-business opportunity.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_5">
          <from> Mr. Kevin Barrett<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_26">I thank the Chairman and the committee for inviting me. I am a representative of the Taxi Alliance of Ireland, operating in County Tipperary and I have worked in the industry for nearly 30 years. I will bring some of the issues forward to the Chairman.</p>
          <p eId="para_27"> There are a large number of illegal operators throughout the country. In the past 12 months, we have had success in catching some of these individuals with the help of the Garda and National Transport Authority, NTA, enforcement officers. However, many of these illegal operators continue to work as the Garda and the NTA do not have the resources to catch all of them. One way to resolve this issue is the establishment of a transport police with the powers to deal with this issue and the resources to deal with this problem on a permanent basis. In order for more people to join the taxi industry, especially in rural Ireland, these illegal operators need to be dealt with immediately before we lose more drivers. For example, a person was caught six months ago, taken to court and prosecuted, got a €200 fine and was operating the night after. That has to be stopped.</p>
          <p eId="para_28"> Another issue I will bring to the attention of the committee is the buy-back of taxi plates. We need to make this process easier to engage in to recruit more taxi drivers to the industry, . At present, if a driver retires or leaves the industry, the driver cannot transfer his or her small public service vehicle, SPSV, plate to another individual. If a transfer of plate and other business areas such as phone and cars were easier, it would entice people to join the industry.</p>
          <p eId="para_29"> To provide more SPSV operators available for closing time of pubs and nightclubs, we need to get the committee to consider asking the Licensed Vintners Association to come forward with a proposal to stagger the closing times of these establishments. This would reduce the number of people looking for taxis all at once at peak times on the weekends. It would also reduce stress on taxi drivers trying to provide a service as they can become overwhelmed with people trying to get taxis at those peak times.</p>
          <p eId="para_30"> The Taxi Alliance of Ireland is a voluntary organisation to help the SPSV industry for urban and rural Ireland. We want to our industry to be as professional as any other industry in our country. The committee should feel free to ask me any issues about the above issues.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#" eId="spk_6">
          <from> Mr. Jim Waldron<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T13:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_31">I ask that the committee forgive me if some of this is repetitive because we all have the same problems. The National Private Hire and Taxi Association, NPHTA, has met many Members of Parliament in recent times and we have made presentations, including in the audiovisual room, to try to get the extension of vehicle age limits. We are here today to highlight these ongoing issues within our industry, which are impacting on the high professional standards set over previous years.</p>
          <p eId="para_32"> A total of 5,000 drivers are facing hardship and stress and the possibility of being forced out of our industry because of vehicle age limits. This would mean longer wait times for the public if even a small percentage of these people leave the industry. While work volumes have surged over previous months, especially at nighttime, many drivers are not in a position to borrow large sums to invest in a new electric vehicle - that is if they can find one. There are many challenges with the grant scheme and we would like a discussion on how to make it more accessible to drivers. We have had no input to the present process.</p>
          <p eId="para_33"> Used car costs have increased 60% according to car magazines. Fuel costs have reached an all time high. Service costs have risen and use of cashless payments mean less take-home pay for drivers, despite the recent fare increase. Taxi drivers are facing the same cost-of-living challenges that all other sectors face. These conditions are screaming out for a further extension of age limits to allow drivers time to recoup losses and build a financial footing to move forward with a newer vehicle, preferably an electric one. Extension of age limits would not, and should not, lower standards.</p>
          <p eId="para_34"> A driver with terminal illness or maybe a stroke is not allowed transfer his or her licence and must keep it active, meaning he or she must be fully licensed and insured, which obviously incurs costs at a time of no income. The driver is possibly dying and it may happen over a period of days, weeks, months or even years. Why can this licence holder not transfer the licence before death? If a licence goes into inactive status it cannot be inherited. An inherited licence must be availed of within nine months. This is a time of mourning and should be extended to at least 12 months.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"> All taxis have to do a national car test, NCT, once or sometimes twice per year. They then must wait 48 hours before returning to the same test centre to have the taxi-suitability test carried out by the same person in the same place. This should be done at the same time and, therefore, cut down time and expense for drivers. It could all be done in one visit.</p>
          <p eId="para_36"> Security of drivers is a continuous concern. The NPHTA, for years, has requested a garda liaison officer to work with representative bodies. Our requests continue to go unheard. The NTA should also be considering providing drivers with security systems and advice. Assaults on drivers are common in our workplace. When has the NTA ever taken a case on behalf of a taxi driver? Generally drivers just have to suck it up.</p>
          <p eId="para_37"> Passenger security should remain a priority of law makers. Strict vetting of entrants, while this could be quicker, should not be overlooked and possibly even be strengthened. Some legislative changes are being considered at present, but it would help if there were marshalled, better-located and properly-lit taxi ranks with CCTV monitoring. This could be considered.</p>
          <p eId="para_38">An example is College Green, which is right beside the Temple Bar area. Rideshare, Uber-style, by unlicensed drivers should not be entertained. The safety record for this type of service shows thousands of sexual assaults by unvetted drivers who provided this service. Passenger demands must be discussed in the context of what passenger expectations are, how overall transport policy needs to be adapted and that pub opening and closing times also need to be adapted. Free access to the Dublin Port tunnel should be considered as a benefit to passengers and the environment.</p>
          <p eId="para_39"> We recently heard about arrangements for the Garth Brooks concert. We contacted the NTA to ask what provision had been made for taxis and the response was that the coach parking and pick-up points were outside the Garda cordon and located approximately 25 minutes' walk from the stadium. We were told taxis would not be allowed inside the Garda cordon and that we could operate as normal. This highlights the lack of consideration planners have given to our sector. Taxis continue to be overlooked. No major events should be allowed to take place unless SPSVs are considered as part of the transport planning.</p>
          <p eId="para_40"> In recent years, thousands of drivers have protested against the Taxi Advisory Committee, TAC, which continues to fail drivers. Throughout Covid it was never proactive only reactive. It took our appearance before the Covid committee to get some supports. Despite the fact that minutes are now being published, the committee is far from transparent. Lots of the matters I outlined - those that truly affect taxi drivers - should have been discussed and presented to the Minister for future support. It is as if nothing happened in the past two years. Our association believes representatives of taxi drivers should regularly meet the Minister and the NTA to promote better public transport services. Transport providers should have a forum in which to present to policymakers.</p>
          <p eId="para_41"> I read in <i>The</i>
						<i>Sunday Times</i> newspaper that the Government is to help with the challenges of the cost of living and is considering financial subsidies, grants and loans to small businesses. Taxi drivers have been overlooked in the past. Our major operating costs are insurance and purchasing a vehicle, which includes VRT and VAT. The NPHTA has partnered with Zego to keep insurance costs down for our members. Along with the vehicle age change, this is the area in which a financial intervention would be most beneficial. I ask members not to overlook us again. I would welcome questions from members.</p>

          <p eId="para_43">We will all try not to rehash statements about the importance of taxi drivers. That is accepted. They are necessary from the point of view of education, hospitals, work and trips, as we heard. We all know what work taxi drivers have done over many years and the issues that arose with supports, in particular during the Covid period. Some of the issues mentioned are long running and still have not been addressed.</p>
          <p eId="para_44"> The problem for the outside world is that there are not enough taxi drivers when people want a taxi. Mr. Waldron spoke about the issues drivers face, including high costs and the ten-year rule. Safety and security seem to be a major issue, in particular for the small number of drivers who are wiling to work after 12 midnight. What would a fit-for-purpose EV grant scheme look like? We all thought there would be some leeway, in particular during Covid, on the age-of-car rule, but there has not been a huge amount of give in regard to that. What would be a fair ask in that regard to put into the public domain?</p>

          <p eId="para_55">At the beginning of the pandemic, we sought an extension for all vehicles because of the cost, and we do so again now. Our costs were not taken away during the pandemic. They were consistent. We still had to pay loans and insurance on vehicles that were not working. Between the four groups sitting in the room, we proposed that a five-year extension would be added to the ten-year rule so as to allow us to come out the other side of the pandemic. The issues faced by taxi drivers were not resolved the day the country opened up again. The issues that we faced over the previous three years are still there. It is hard for drivers to get loans to accompany the grants because most of us received the pandemic unemployment payment, PUP, which banks, credit unions and financial organisations do not consider as earned income. Even securing a loan over the next two years until we rebuild our personal finances will be hard. The NTA and the Department of Transport should make a decision quickly on the extension of the ten-year rule.</p>

          <p eId="para_63">That is very much appreciated as well. I might add that drivers have to borrow the total amount of the cost of the car because they have to wait up to three months to receive the grant. That is a barrier in itself. A driver who wants to buy a car costing €50,000 must borrow €50,000 to buy it. That probably excludes drivers from qualifying for a loan, for example, with their local credit union. They could borrow €30,000 if the grant was more accessible or if there was a way for the NTA to guarantee the credit union that the money could be paid directly to it.</p>

          <p eId="para_64">Some means of bridging the gap is necessary. That makes sense, leaving out the supply chain issue. Let us accept the extension of the ten-year rule by an extra five years. In fairness, the three-year rule is a bit mad if someone is doing what he or she has been forced to do. The question is whether we can bridge that gap. Outside of that, is the grant scheme fit for purpose?</p>

          <p eId="para_65">As Mr McGuinness touched upon, the other point is that a person's licence could go inactive while he or she is waiting on the electric vehicle, EV, and that would exclude him or her from the grant. Basically, if I put a deposit on a car, I could be waiting six months. The National Transport Authority, NTA, is telling me I have the grant up until December but my licence might run out in November. What I am basically saying is that it should be allowed to be used on a licence that has expired as well so that a guy who wants to come back into the business can use an expired licence or someone who has been forced out of the business can come back in with an expired licence.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">We have an issue in our local area, for example. We probably have at least 15 illegal operators in a region with a radius of approximately 30 miles. We have had four prosecutions in the past six months and those four people who were prosecuted were back out operating the night after. They are prosecuted in court. A big factor we need to cure the situation is that insurance companies need to be notified. When people are convicted in court, the insurance companies need to be notified. That is a big factor. People are taken to court and then also being given fines of €200 and €300. They are back out the night after working and earning that again. There has to be something. The courts have to be changed and the fine system has to be changed. Put a minimum fine of €3,000 or €4,000 in place. That certainly hits them in the pocket.</p>
          <p eId="para_105"> As for the biggest factor we have, while we have enforcement officers coming down from Dublin to do a job on these illegal operators, it is impossible to get the enforcement officers here constantly. Going back 15 or 20 years ago, we had the local public service vehicle, PSV, officer who dealt with these issues. He called to these illegal operators and gave them ultimatums to stop, or else. Something has to be done. We need transport police who can deal with these issues and have the powers to deal with these issues. The enforcement officers only have so much power. There are many ways to try to improve it. If these illegal operators can be taken out then it entices other guys to get into the industry and provides more taxis. Nobody is going to get into the industry when all these illegal operators are working and taking the bread and butter from the guys who are working. More and more guys are leaving the industry.</p>

          <p eId="para_107">As someone who travels in taxis around Dublin all the time, I believe we are in serious danger of losing the service, or at least the quality and volume of service one would expect. The costs involved in running taxis, between fuel and insurance, seem to have gone through the ceiling. There are companies that lease the cars to drivers but I am not sure how that works. Is that in danger of also being shelved now because of the costs of running those cars? I am not sure whether it is a set figure that drivers pay every month to use the car. With running costs and everything else, are we going to start losing those drivers as well? Where will that leave us?</p>

          <p eId="para_109">The rental sector would not be my area of expertise but I believe drivers pay an amount of money per week to rent the vehicle. It could be up to €250 per week to rent the vehicle. I think the rental sector represents approximately 30% of the industry in total, and 70% of licences are owned by individuals within the sector. The rental sector is on average approximately 30%. I do not know whether they will be affected by the higher costs involved because they operate on a bigger scale and the price is passed on to the individual who is renting the vehicle. As I said at the beginning, our organisation represents single licenceholders. I would not, therefore, know too much regarding the rental sector.</p>

          <p eId="para_111">The worrying thing is that during the pandemic, through no fault of their own, approximately 2,000 drivers left the industry. The most worrying thing about that is that not too many of them have come back. That gives an indication of the confidence, or lack thereof, in the industry by drivers who have operated within the sector, many of them for 20 or 30 years. They have chosen a different career path rather than come back to the industry that they have put finance into and served for 30 years. That would be the worrying aspect, that not many of these 2,000 driver who left the industry are willing to come back into it, due to the issues that the Senator mentioned, such as the high costs, lack of security and the vulnerability of the industry in general.</p>

          <p eId="para_112">The Senator is right that there are many of the multi-plate owners, as we call them, or multi-licence holders, who are affected by this. They are affected by the ten-year age rule as well. Some of them might have to lay out hundreds of thousands of euro to keep the cars on the road. They are facing the same problems that single-plate licence holders are facing. However, they can pass on much of the cost to the driver who is driving the vehicle. The driver ultimately feels the pain. It will have an effect on the future numbers in the taxi industry. This is why we keep emphasising the age rule. While it affects the single-plate licence holder, it also affects the multi-licence holder and the drivers of those vehicles, because they are being charged more to cover the running costs of the car as well.</p>

          <p eId="para_114">The rental market has the same overheads as the ordinary guy. However, the driver will pay more money for it at the end of the day. I know of one operator that went out of business and left all of the cars there. There is a disaster coming up at the moment. If the nine-year rule is not extended to 15 years, more than 3,000 cars could be lost in January if drivers cannot get finance. A second-hand car could now cost between €26,000 and €30,000. If this not addressed, it will be a total disaster. The National Transport Authority, NTA, does not seem to want to listen to the plea. This should have been sorted out months ago. Give the lads that were out there having a bad time during Covid a bit of a break so they can get a few quid to build up a sort of a rapport with a credit union or a bank. One cannot force people to go out in January when their licence is gone to borrow that type of money, unless they have a record.</p>

          <p eId="para_116">I am telling the committee what will happen. About 3,500 taxis will be lost throughout the country. That is what will happen. It will put so much pressure on the industry. We do not get any help from anyone now through the night. We should have the DART and buses running through the night. If that does not happen, and 3,500 taxis are lost, there will be a big problem. Members are not being told the truth and I am telling the truth.</p>
          <p eId="para_117"> I am 44 years driving a taxi in Dublin. I have seen the way it has come and gone. I was lucky enough to get a grant and buy an electric vehicle because the electric vehicles were not there. At the moment - take this on board - there are 22 vehicles lying in driveways because they cannot get suitability to get on the road. It is a crazy scenario. They sent SGS over to Ballymount to seal meters instead of bringing SGS to where they were. It has taken perhaps six or seven hours to get through to the suitability and one cannot get it for two or three weeks or something like that. This is already a disaster and it will get worse. We will be back in repeatedly. Unless somebody listens in the NTA, the country is in for a bad time with taxis.</p>

          <p eId="para_144">Many of the issues were covered, so I will just make a couple of comments. I know most of the lads from over the years, having been a transport spokesperson in this House for a good number of years. It is that perennial issue. They are back year after year with problems as they arise. It seems, rightly or wrongly, that there is not a proper structure in place to assist the industry. It is seen from a regulatory perspective. If the NTA, which is looking at the drivers as licence holders, it is all about making sure they reached the standards and do not do what they should not do. However, to hell with the rest of it and they should get on and do it themselves. That may have worked at a time. We have to treat the industry differently. We have to recognise that the taxi industry, to use the term across the board, is an integral part of our public transport system. If we took the same approach to trains, trams and the Luas, we would not have a decent public transport system. We have to integrate taxis, to use the term across small public sector vehicles, and find a way to ensure there is an agency or agent within the State apparatus.</p>
          <p eId="para_145">I am not talking about setting up another quango. I am talking about establishing an office for taxi development or public service vehicle development. It seems ludicrous to me that taxi drivers are being messed around. I mean grants sound great and people may think they can benefit from them but one cannot get a car so there is no joined-up thinking. I am sure the Chairman will be familiar with the carbon reduction efforts by the State to meet our targets and we have various energy agencies. I am familiar with the Tipperary Energy Agency and I know that Mr. Barrett is from Tipperary but I am not. That agency was very good at figuring how all of these different things came together and could create a concrete project. We are going to have to find a way, whether it is within the NTA or somewhere else. With the best will in the world, the NTA has a job to do but that is one of regulation. I suggest that the committee invites the NTA to go through the issues that have arisen.</p>

          <p eId="para_149">Assisting the transition to electric vehicles is a good idea and other countries have done so as it is good for the environment. The initiative should be good for taxi drivers but it sounds to me that it is not. There are many issues that we must examine and Mr. Cooley is right that it is an advisory committee. Any time that I hear of an advisory committee on anything, I know that it is a sop. An advisory committee helps to get some information across but is not action-oriented or about deliverables. The taxi organisations talk about the problem among themselves but they have no way of making it happen.</p>

          <p eId="para_153">However, what we say at the committee gets amplified and commented on. We can also make recommendations to the Department. We can bring others in and challenge them on issues so at least we take things further. As I have seen over the years, there is nothing to help and promote the taxi industry. Taxi drivers are individual licenceholders. There must be competition although there is not really when all of the limits are set. How can we ensure that the industry is around in ten or 15 years' time if the Government policy is to reduce the number of cars on the roads?</p>
          <p eId="para_154"> A modal shift has been sought for decades in terms of the amount of public transport, of which the taxi industry is an integral part. We are reducing public transport fees on buses and we have to increase taxi fares because otherwise the industry is not sustainable. I have a different approach because I believe that we should make it easier and cheaper for taxis to operate but with State support and not making things more expensive, so that we keep the price of taxi fares down for punters. We have talked about this issue elsewhere and the delegation mentioned that the hotel industry is part of the talking shop. The hotels are pricing themselves out of the market with what they are at and only very wealthy people can now afford them. At present Garth Books has a series of concerts and people want to attend them in Dublin. The taxi drivers help concert goers to get to the venue after people have travelled by train or parked their cars somewhere. People are deciding to return home after the concerts because it is cheaper for four or five people to get someone to drive them up from County Clare, for example, than stay in a hotel but such a situation is crazy. We have got to look at the future sustainability and viability of the taxi business, and everything should be on the table. </p>

          <p eId="para_159">Under the Taxi Regulation Act 2013, there is supposed to be four members of representative groups from the taxi sector involved in the TAC. There is currently one and Mr. Cooley represents the federation. The other two people are individual taxi drivers so they are not part of any representative group. I refer to the other three representative groups and Mr. Cooley's group at the time. During the pandemic I resigned my position from the TAC because of its total inactivity, it took too long to get everything that we wanted to get to support the industry and I would have been embarrassed by some of the decisions that the TAC was coming forward with to support taxi drivers during the onset of the pandemic. We are the largest four groups of representatives in Ireland. We wrote to the NTA with a list of proposals to reform the TAC to help the taxi industry have more direct negotiations with the Department of Transport. I think we supplied the initial email to the committee.</p>

The first thing that I always ask a taxi driver is how he or she feels about his or her electric vehicle and I receive a positive response in general. The grant is a positive grant and the problem lies with the mechanisms to reach a certain point. Ironically, many people say that the problem lies with the level of the grant. That does not appear to be the primary issue here. The delegations present are the experts on this industry. As I am an accountant by training, I normally go through the figures with representatives so I have a pretty good idea of the figures. They work and they will work into the future when you seek to change a car.</p>

          <p eId="para_168">The grant was oversubscribed last year. A sum of €15 million was allocated but it was not spent as people could not get electric cars. I think €5 million remained in the fund because people could not get the electric cars and they are the people we are thinking of now. These are the people who are willing and want to go electric but they are not in a position to do so. Earlier, as we discussed, people have encountered problems when trying to get grants and the vehicles are not available.</p>

          <p eId="para_172">I do not know whether any recommendation will be successful but we must make it in the context of public transport. We are reducing the cost of going on a bus. Nobody is expected to pay a fare on a bus commensurate with the cost of running the bus which is what we must consider. If one did then it would cost a lot more to travel even short distances and I presume it would cost €20 to travel the short distance from here to Donnybrook.</p>
          <p eId="para_173"> The taxi industry works and provides a fantastic service. My town of Ennis does not have a bus service but there are good Local Link services in the rural areas. Every week, taxi men bring elderly people, who are on a low income, to the shop and back. These drivers do a tremendous job. Nobody gets rich by doing such work and the challenges they face increase every year because of regulation. I am not saying that we do not need regulation; we do but alongside regulation, we need an element of the State agencies to be examining how to protect and preserve the sector. For a long time we depended on people from outside of the State who worked for very little money because of where they had come from themselves and they got us through a period.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">Many of them have now left. They have moved on with their lives and are not prepared to do that anymore. We are now back to the same situation again where there is not a viable opportunity for people to come into the industry. No one needs a lecture on this committee about the cost of property, rents and so on. One would not have a hope of making a living as a taxi driver. I can understand it when Mr. Cooley says that his will be the last generation in his family to drive a taxi.</p>

          <p eId="para_175">I would like to give an example of the inflexibility built into the system. There are two licences in the taxi industry - the PSV driver's licence and the taxi plate licence. The PSV driver's licence is renewed every five years. We have a number of members whose five-year licence expired during the pandemic. Once a year has passed following expiry, applicants must resit the test. Drivers are being told they have to resit the test even though some of them have been driving taxis for up to 30 years. Through no fault of their own, their licences expired. They may not have been able to come out, they may not have worked during the pandemic and may have been housebound but they are now being told that they must resit their test. Many of them have years of experience driving taxis. That is just one example of the inflexibility that we face from the TAC and the NTA.</p>

          <p eId="para_179">Yes. It is important to have the opportunity to air the issues. It is very clear from the contributions we have heard that there are fundamental problems with the voice of taxi drivers being heard in the industry and being central to the development of the industry. That is something that has been repeated and it will be central to a lot of what we raise with the NTA and on which we need to see reform in the time ahead. I encourage the witnesses to develop their own thinking and proposals on what an alternative to the TAC would look like. In the context of a number of comments, a long-standing proposal is included in the programme for Government for a public transport forum. Is that something that the witnesses would like to see and what might that look like?</p>
          <p eId="para_180"> The bigger issue I want to raise relates to the viability of the sector. I see an incredible contradiction within the system relating to the EV grants. On the one hand, the Government is saying that it wants a green transition, it wants the taxi industry to go green and it is putting €15 million per year into this. Problems have been identified with that, as outlined by the witnesses. At the same time, there will be a cliff edge in 2023 whereby thousands of vehicles are going to be hit by the nine-year rule and, as a consequence, individual drivers will be left to decide whether to get another petrol or diesel vehicle to tide them over in the meantime or to exit the industry all together. That scenario has been spelled out to the NTA and the Minister by myself and others. We have outlined that scenario to them and what they say in response is, "Don't panic". They say they are looking at it, a fare increase was introduced recently, a recruitment campaign is ongoing and that will solve the problem. That is what the NTA will say to us again next week and I want to ask our guests, as industry representatives, what they say to that.</p>

          <p eId="para_181">I will take the first question on the increase in people coming into the market and applying for licences. I asked what age groups were involved and they said students were coming into the market. I asked if they were really telling me that students were going to get a loan to enter the market. They want to push students straight into the rental market. That is their first option. Students are not going to be single licence holders but are going into the rental market, where they are under pressure. In terms of getting new people to take up licences and do tests, even when they do the tests, they are looking at a three- to four-month wait to get their licence. That is just another example of the lack of joined up thinking in the NTA.</p>
          <p eId="para_182"> The transfer of taxi licences is so important. The transfer of licences from people who are exiting the market is crucial. They have a car, a sign, a meter and a licence. It is so simple and is basically down to a question of clerical administration. If someone is leaving our industry, it should be easy for him or her to transfer the vehicle and the meter to somebody else and then it would only be a matter of weeks to have thousands of vehicles on the road. We have people who have had cars in their driveways for years, since the start of the pandemic. We reckon that 3,500 drivers have exited the industry because of the rules and regulations and the fact that licences cannot be transferred. The system is totally inflexible. We are delighted to be here today because the transfer of the licences of those who are exiting the industry is a major issue.</p>

          <p eId="para_213">I probably did. In any event it is called escalation. Escalation means that there is a technical department within the NTA which will have a look and see if that car is suitable. Why is it not suitable if ten more of them have been licensed already? This is all bureaucracy, red tape, where there is the existence of a technical man in the NTA doing this job. It is just impossible to go through all of these things. If the driver is off the road, he or she could be in that position for three weeks or more. We need somebody to appear before the committee to ask the NTA questions, whether it is by taxi drivers or otherwise, because it is a joke.</p>

          <p eId="para_215">Just getting back to Deputy O’Rourke’s point and the statement of the NTA asking us not to worry. This is a very significant worry, first and foremost because of the 3,985 who face being excluded from their job, basically. These are the NTA figures. In a year, it is almost 4,000 drivers and being told not to worry is not the answer to this.</p>

          <p eId="para_217">They could be pushed out of the industry. “Don’t Worry” is not the solution. That is what we saw from the NTA during the pandemic, which said it would be okay. It is always last-minute decisions. Apart from other factors as to why people will not come into the industry, they know that when they come into it, they will be facing the bureaucracy of the NTA in every department of the taxi sector. Getting back to the point raised by Mr. Maguire about the delays to the giving of suitability clearances for those cars, the drivers have been given a €25,000 grant by the NTA to get these cars on the road. Drivers are still waiting for the suitability clearance, even though they have gone through all of the processes. They should be licensed straight away and they should not have to go for an SGS test as they have already been given a substantial grant. The driver should be able to turn up, be given the door sticker, where his or her meter is fine, and away they go.</p>

          <p eId="para_219">Addressing Deputy O’Rourke’s point, the bigger fear for me is that of people being driven out of the industry. There is also the fear of those who hang on in the industry for as long as they can. They will be putting themselves into very significant debt and will be working enormously long hours that will be putting their own lives - I keep emphasising this - and those of their passengers at risk. We have to take this on board. People do not have the opportunity to walk out of a taxi driver’s job into another job. During the Covid-19 period many people did that and found that it was quite good for them and they stayed in these jobs. That is why we are down 2,000 drivers. Those opportunities are beginning to fall away and perhaps people want to be taxi drivers but they are being forced not to be one. I keep emphasising that it is the health and welfare of ourselves and our passengers that we are concerned about.</p>

Deputy O’Rourke has summed up the main points that have been raised. From my own experience, I use taxis a great deal and I always find that the members of the profession are obliging, courteous and very helpful. From speaking with taxi drivers when you get into the car, and have a chat with them, you understand that the system within which they operate is very bureaucratic and full of anomalies and inconsistencies. It is obviously making life difficult for those in the industry. It is difficult to make a living, has very inconvenient hours and is uncertain in terms of the level of income you can rely on.

          <p eId="para_241"> Can our guest speakers clarify one issue for me? I raised this question in the Dáil a month before the recess. I was at Dublin Airport and the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, is also answerable to this committee. I seek clarification about a time I came in on a late-night flight at Dublin Airport and there were no taxis in the rank. Taxis kept passing me by but I could not get anybody to stop. Eventually, I made inquiries the day after and a taxi driver himself told me that once he dropped a fare at Dublin Airport, he had to leave the airport and could not come back to collect somebody. To clarify, what is the situation in that regard? If people arriving at the airport, particularly foreigners coming to our country, need a taxi late at night but see this thing happening whereby the taxi rank is empty because everybody has gone out and all these taxis are spinning through the airport, dropping people off but not being allowed to come around and collect people again, it is ludicrous.</p>

          <p eId="para_248">Can I just say that over the past two and half years or so, the DAA has refused to speak to the representative bodies on various issues throughout the airport. Our meeting with the authority last week was our first time to meet it in two and a half years. We are hoping to have a further meeting in the next two weeks.</p>
          <p eId="para_249">Regarding drivers passing the Deputy by, there is a permit system. There are 1,500 drivers permitted to work at Dublin Airport and they usually park up in a holding area. For the last year or year and a half, the calling system has been faulty. We have highlighted this over and over. There may well have been taxis in a holding area not being provided to the taxi rank while the Deputy was standing there. I do not know for certain but that could be the case.</p>

          <p eId="para_256">My understanding is that several of these taxis have to leave the concourse. They cannot collect a passenger. Mr. Waldron is saying it is illegal for them to stop. If there are not sufficient taxis there, does it make sense for somebody from another country to see taxis floating around and passing through the airport and not be able to get on?</p>

          <p eId="para_257">The Deputy is right. It is in the laws of the DAA that a car without a permit cannot stop at Dublin Airport to do a pick-up. There are only two designated stops, at terminal 1 and terminal 2. If you pick up anywhere else, you are liable for a fine. That is probably why taxi drivers were passing the Deputy by. This is something the representatives have wanted to discuss, about when there is downtime at Dublin Airport and not enough taxis, how we facilitate that. The Deputy must remember that we are competing against the city centre and late night what-have-you. People probably feel it is more profitable to work in the city rather than to go to the airport.</p>

          <p eId="para_258">For taxi drivers who go out to Dublin Airport, the luggage charge and pick-up charge were abolished. We have drivers who drive back from the south side of the city and pay to go through the tunnel to come to Dublin Airport. It is dedication to Dublin Airport. As Mr. Waldron said, when Dublin Airport is busy, Dublin city is busy. Many drivers will not make the trip out to Dublin Airport because it is not cost-efficient, given there is no pick-up charge or luggage charge, when they go into the city centre, get a pick-up charge and not have to use as much fuel.</p>
          <p eId="para_259"> We have to understand we came out of a pandemic. Since March of this year, we have been overwhelmed with people coming out of Dublin Airport because everybody has had vouchers from holidays who have put holidays off and whose family have not been home for years. We are in unprecedented times regarding passenger levels in the last couple of months but we see those numbers levelling off.</p>

If the witnesses were sitting in those seats next week what questions would they ask? I know their issues but what questions do they want us to ask? What are the five, eight, ten or 12 questions they would like to ask? They do not have to tell us now. They can put together their questions on vehicle age, credit cards and licence transfers. Issues have been raised that I was not aware of. We were all familiar with the value of a taxi plate before the regulation. It plummeted and there were various compensation mechanisms.

I happened to listen in to a meeting of an Oireachtas committee at which the NTA stated it was in touch with the industry all the time. I have to say I send emails to the NTA and I get replies to them. I do not have a problem with this. Those emails are to raise individual items. I want to sit down in a room to discuss policy and not individual items. That is why we are here today. There should be a forum for taxi drivers to sit with the decision-makers to discuss where the industry is going.</p>

Before any decision is taken, the NTA decides what is happening and then puts it out to public consultation, without contacting any of the groups sitting here. I doubt it contacts any taxi driver. It goes to public consultation and if the NTA likes the decision of the public consultation then it implements the decision. If it does not it still implements the decision but there is no contact point between the Department of Transport, the NTA and any group that represents any number of taxi drivers.</p>

That is a positive in any job. You hear people talking about how it is a new thing with working from home but we have been doing it for years. We have been deciding our hours for years.

We are coming out of a pandemic and many of the members of the organisations represented here today were not operating for a long period of time. They are not looking for cars to be an infinite age, they want to keep them for 15 years, to allow drivers sufficient time.

That is important.</p>
          <p eId="para_459"> On the issue of EVs, the point has been made to me and the committee that drivers cannot get the vehicles.

          <p eId="para_460">Absolutely. We are competing with the general public for the same cars. I actually feel as though the electric cars are getting an endorsement from the small public service industry. When private motorists see taxi drivers driving EVs, they look at the brands they are driving and they think they must be good cars if taxi drivers are driving them. The Government probably could prioritise us before private business. If it could intervene in some way to prioritise the taxi industry as opposed to the private industry, it would be beneficial.</p>

          <p eId="para_462">From hearing the representatives and from being aware of their grievances over the years, I am aware that one of the fundamental problems is that in the mindset of those who look at public transport, the taxi drivers are just not seen as part of the public transport system in the same way as other parts of the public transport system. There is a sort of seriousness about buses, trains and trams, but there is a sort of disregard for the taxi driver. Is that what the representatives feel?</p>

          <p eId="para_463">That is obvious, with the removal of prime taxi stands around Dublin at the drop of a hat. Prime taxi stands in the city centre can be removed, for whatever purpose. Whether it is to install a bicycle stand, a bus lane or to have a party over a weekend, taxi stands are removed. Going back years, there was talk about integrating the taxi system with the other public transport systems. I think there is one luas stop with a taxi rank attached to it, and that is out in Cabra. It is not even in the city centre. It goes back to not negotiating with the sector. Due to the fact that the sector is funded privately by the drivers, we are not taken into account in the overall transport system. That goes back to the issue of events. A taxi stand should be set up, but that never happens. Yet, other forms of transport are allowed right up to the door of events. I totally believe that Deputy Boyd Barrett is right. We are not considered, even though we carry the Transport for Ireland, TFI, logo. We are not considered as an integral part of the overall system.</p>

          <p eId="para_466">We lost the two best taxi ranks on O'Connell Street. There are no ranks attached to the new hotels they are building in the city. For example, if you go to the Maldron Hotel on Kevin Street, you are parked at a traffic light. That is not just the case with one hotel; it is the same with many hotels. Connolly Station, which is the second busiest train station in the city, only has three parking spaces because of the luas. We are second-class citizens in our own city. We are supposed to be an integral part of the city. Years ago, when all the hotels were built there was always a taxi rank outside. They are virtually all gone. If you are going down O'Connell Street, one of the main thoroughfares, you cannot get a taxi. We need to be an integral part of the system. There are no taxi ranks at DART stations. People might get the train at 11 o'clock or half past 11 at night to Bray or Sutton, and there is no taxi rank outside for them to get a taxi home, because it is private property.</p>

          <p eId="para_470">Following on from that, I agree completely with the points made. It is ironic that complaints are now being made that there are not enough taxis, to which the witnesses have responded. All of a sudden people are asking where the taxi drivers are, when nothing has been done to support the drivers and the industry. Indeed, things have been done that have driven people out of the industry and have made it an unattractive option. Would the witnesses say - because I would - that if it follows that the taxi sector should be taken seriously as an integral part of an integrated public transport system that is vital for all sorts of things, including taking people to hospital, serving those with disabilities, getting people to school in certain situations, tourism and all the other roles that drivers play, it would also follow that there should be subsidies for taxi drivers in a properly regulated and run industry? Every other part of public transport is subsidised to ensure that it is there. Should there not be some sort of subsidies as part of a properly regulated industry? Similarly, the absolutely wrong way to go would be to introduce Uber, which is the opposite of that. That is just creating a cowboy situation where we are imperiling the health and safety of the travelling public and showing utter disregard for the people who are seriously providing a proper industry, such as taxi drivers.</p>

          <p eId="para_471">On the issue of subsidies, last year the NTA said that drivers could re-license their vehicles free of charge. That was appreciated. However, those who got had new EVs had to pay to renew their licences. It does not make sense.</p>
          <p eId="para_472">The NTA is encouraging people to use EVs but then people have to pay for the licence if they did not put it on the existing vehicle. These are classic issues where intervention or subsidy could come in. There has just been a fare increase. It costs about €200 to get a meter programmed and resealed. We have all had to pay that. This has come on the back of the pandemic. There is no doubt that the NTA could subsidise the industry for these.</p>
          <p eId="para_473"> We are probably the only part of the public transport service that is a positive contributor to the NTA. Taxi drivers contribute millions of euro every year in licence fees. Maybe that is why we are not treated very well. Maybe if the NTA was giving us money, it would want to know where it was going and would want to do something about that.</p>

          <p eId="para_475">We touched on the interesting matter of the integrated transport system, where we bring everything together, including buses, trains, taxis, cycling, walking and so on. We know we have to change how we travel because of transport emissions. We know about the challenge that exists across the entire transport sector and that we have to reduce emissions by 50% by 2030. That will be incredibly difficult. Every one of us has a role to play, especially the witnesses.</p>
          <p eId="para_476"> I spoke to a couple of taxi drivers recently. I got different stories from them. I also get different stories from taxi users. It tends to be the case, with everything that one discusses, that people have different views and opinions. Taxi ranks were mentioned. Is the use of apps a good way to say that we do not need a taxi rank on a prime section of road that could be allocated to cycling, walking, on-street dining and so on? Everybody is using new technology. We have just been in with the banking-----</p>

          <p eId="para_477">Generally, the rank is in a high-visibility space. Someone can come out of a train station, hotel or whatever it is, then there is a rank and he or she queues at it.

          <from> Mr. David McGuinness<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_478">I would not agree. One reason is that it would push people to private companies. If there was an NTA app, then it could absolutely be done. One of the apps costs the customer €3 more than walking to a taxi stand. Pushing people only in one direction is not good for the industry or for the customer. Many taxi drivers will not use the app because of the cost of the commission that the app companies charge. Some 15% is a huge commission. Many customers have used the same taxi stands for years because they feel comfortable with the drivers at those stands. If the policy of pushing everybody to use the app is part of the overall strategy for the industry, by removing the taxi stands from the transport hubs, one would inconvenience the public and make it more expensive for them. When people order a taxi on an app, the taxi has to drive to them, so that is environmentally unfriendly too. Taxis driving around waiting for the bell on the app to go is not good for the environment.</p>

          <p eId="para_484">One of the issues with removal from O'Connell Street is finding where to drop off a passenger who wants to go to a hotel on the street. There is nowhere to drop off passengers anymore. They have to be dropped on Cathal Brugha Street. Capel Street and South William Street are the same. Grants are being given to taxi drivers for wheelchair accessible vehicles. Those wheelchair accessible vehicles cannot access some of those areas now. The decision regarding Capel Street at night time used to be a great idea. One cannot pull in anywhere now. If disabled people are at a restaurant on Capel Street, we cannot get to them. The rush to pedestrianise everywhere and get rid of the taxi stands, particularly after the pandemic, was too quick. There were no discussions with the industry as part of that.</p>

          <p eId="para_487">I have one. The vehicle is good. I have a charger at home and in the airport. Fair play to ESB, which is putting chargers all around the place. It costs me around €45 to run it, between the house and other chargers. The problem is that if I looked for an electric vehicle now, it could take until next April or May to get it. If one applies for a grant that runs out, and then the licence runs out, one would be in serious trouble. One would then have to reinvest in another vehicle. The NTA could extend that licence because it knows that the person has the vehicle and everything would be rosy in the garden. There is too much bureaucracy. The NTA does not have people who know about the taxi business. It is as simple as that. I hate to criticise the authority like that, but when I see the mistakes it makes, there does not seem to be anyone in it from a transport background. It is the same as what happened with Aer Lingus. It had a CEO who did not know about it and there was chaos. The taxi business is heading towards chaos. If we do not get the number of years for a car extended from nine years to 15, there will be chaos in the town. Is the NTA going to run and hide or is it accountable? It should be accountable to its peers in the Oireachtas.</p>

          <p eId="para_491">Some of the issues related to the licence and the EV grants could be ironed out. I did not quite catch Mr. Waldron's point. If people are transferring from an internal combustion engine vehicle to an electric vehicle, a licence change is required. Is that correct?</p>

          <from> Mr. Jim Waldron<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T15:30:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_492">The conflict for drivers regarding the grant is that the grant is considered good. Most associations encourage drivers to use EVs. The process is the problem. Buying an all-electric ID4 car could cost between €55,000 and €61,000, depending on where it is bought. A person can get €25,000 in grants for that vehicle. To buy the car, he or she has to borrow the total cost of the car because the grant does not come until three months after the car has been approved. The process can take approximately three weeks. Taxi drivers have to scrap their vehicle, meaning that they could be off the road for three weeks while waiting to collect their EV and get it licensed for the road.</p>
          <p eId="para_493">Various issues need to be addressed. The Department of Transport has referred to microfinance, which only lends up to €25,000. I cannot buy half an ID.4. There are issues as regards process. Nobody is saying the electric vehicle grant is not a good thing. It is a good thing and most associations appreciate it. We would like more, but we are moving positively towards it. As I said, the sight of a taxi driver driving an electric vehicle is an endorsement of a vehicle, generally speaking, that will encourage other people in private enterprise to go electric as well. We need to work together on it. We have never been included in the process. The point we keep coming back to all the time is that the associations do not have a forum to deal directly with the Department of Transport on many of these matters. That is what we need.</p>

          <p eId="para_495">I was able to tune in for parts of the hearing but not all. I am not a member of this committee but I was keen to come in.</p>
          <p eId="para_496"> I am a Cork Deputy and my knowledge of the situation relates primarily to the Cork taxi committee but many of the issues that have come up today are one and the same. The point about taxis being public service vehicles is key, as is the fact that they are not recognised adequately, or sometimes at all, by the NTA as a part of the public transport network. Taxis are also key enablers of other parts of public transport. Three out of every four times I travel to Dublin I do so by train. If a taxi was not available, I would probably drive there. If I did not have a taxi to get me from my home to the train station, that realistically means that I do not get a train at that hour of the morning. Taxis are key enablers. They enable people to get buses, trains and all the rest of it. They are a key connection. Taxis are also a key part of public transport by way of serving hospitals, elderly people and all the things that taxi drivers and, indeed, school transport do during the day. Many people just think of taxis in terms of late hours on a Saturday night. Taxis work 24-7 doing crucial work to support people. It is time the NTA recognised that. Reform and an improved replacement for the taxi advisory committee needs to be a key part of that so that taxi drivers feel they have a real say in it.</p>
          <p eId="para_497"> Many of the questions have already been asked. I missed the part around transferability, which is a big part of the ask at present. The point about the nine- or ten-year rule has been well made. It is illogical. If a car is roadworthy, it is roadworthy and that is all. Of course, it has to be roadworthy. That is essential but, once it is roadworthy, why should there be a higher standard for taxis than anything else?</p>
          <p eId="para_498"> My other question is on school transport. I have spoken to taxi drivers who say that the tendering process to serve school transport routes, typically in respect of children's special educational needs, is too onerous and complex, and is just not worth a taxi driver's while. That is why it is sometimes not possible to get a taxi and needs are not being met. Many taxi drivers do great work in that regard but sometimes the incentives are just not there for taxi drivers to apply for these routes. I ask for comment on that.</p>
          <p eId="para_499"> What is now crucial, and I will try to come in when NTA representatives next appear before the committee, is that there is a far better service. When we talk about public transport generally, one issue is that taxi drivers are not adequately consulted but even when we talk about taxis themselves, very often other interests, whether these are hospitality or some of the big apps, have as much say as taxi drivers, which is not right either. It is vitally important the committee has proper teeth and is fully representative of taxi drivers.</p>
          <p eId="para_500"> My two questions relate to school transport and transferability.</p>

          <p eId="para_501">I will answer on the taxi advisory committee. I joined that committee a month ago. The first observation I made related to two representatives on it. One was from a taxi app group, which I thought was a vested interest that really should not be on the taxi advisory committee, because any decisions would help that group to make money off the back of taxi drivers. The second representative was from what is probably the largest rental vehicle company in Dublin. I again observed at the meeting that new applicants into the industry were kind of being pushed into the rental industry. The committee was ready-made for the taxi rental company and the taxi sharing app company, who are making money off taxi drivers and not helping them, to be there sitting at the table. They will make money on commission obviously, which is extra commission at present. That was my one observation regarding the taxi advisory committee, that is, that it is basically stacked up against the driver.</p>

        <speech by="#" eId="spk_437">
          <from> Mr. Jim Waldron<recordedTime time="2022-09-14T15:40:00+01:00"/></from>
          <p eId="para_502">The process to get on the panel for school transport is very detailed. Bus Éireann falls down in the sense that if it made such transport more accessible, more taxi drivers would be able to help it out. The process is very onerous and there is a lot to it. Maybe if some sort of department was set up to assist drivers to enrol in it, that would be a positive. There are drivers who would like to do that type of work. Many drivers do it presently, but many more could do so.</p>
          <p eId="para_503"> On the issue of transferability the Deputy mentioned, and some of the other driver representatives have also mentioned this, as I said earlier, a driver with terminal illness, or even a stroke, has to keep his or her taxi active during all that time and has to be dead before somebody can take over the ownership of his or her licence. Why should people who are 80 years of age and have spent 20, 30, 40 or 50 years in the business, built up clientele quite well and have a ready-made business they want to hand over, maybe to a son or daughter, or sell to somebody for that matter because that driver has earned it, not be allowed do that? Such drivers are not allowed do that at present. The only way a licence can be taken over is through inheritance. It is unfair that a person who is unable to keep a licence active and wants to transfer his or her business to somebody else is not able to do so. It should be addressed.</p>

          <p eId="para_507">For my own questioning, I want to recap. I will systematically go through what we will bring up with the NTA representatives next week.</p>
          <p eId="para_508"> I will deal first with the issue in respect of when somebody is buying an EV. In essence, we are saying there are a combination of factors. We face a cliff edge on 1 January, when up to almost 4,000 taxis may not continue or, if they do, might do so at a level where it is not sustainable. In effect, what the representatives are looking for, dare I say, is a form of derogation for cars up to 15 years old to allow drivers a transitional period in which to transition to EV cars. That is a fair comment. The clerk will take notes. If the representatives wish to come back to the committee with more formalised contributions in certain areas, that is up to them.</p>
          <p eId="para_509"> I will flesh out the issue of transferability a little more. I am here long enough that I remember the time before deregulation. I am a Deputy for Limerick City. I am an accountant by training and had clients who were taxi drivers so I understand and am reasonably familiar with the sector. Overnight, following deregulation, people who had purchased taxi plates found they were worthless and we had a new system. When Mr. Cooley talks about transferability, is he talking about licences having a value or is he more interested in the process of transferability? </p>

That was a clause to hold that advice until the taxi representatives look at the implications of the advice being sent, explain it to the Department of Transport and hopefully get the issues resolved.</p>

          <p eId="para_567">The problem with the fare is that it took five years. We should probably be getting an increase every year. A committee should not take two and a half years to decide if we are getting an increase. For everyone driving a diesel or petrol car, the diesel or petrol bill has doubled. When it exceeded €2 a litre, we asked for a subvention of €1. We were told that under no circumstances would we get that. App companies are putting on subventions of €1 for technologies. The Government gave truck driver companies subsidies.</p>
          <p eId="para_568"> In a way insurance has stabilised. I am sure all the representatives present will agree with me that new men and women coming into the business are being crucified by car insurance. I believe they will pay a minimum of €6,000.</p>

At the end of the day, for a myriad of reasons, people under pressure for time will take a taxi, be it in a rural area or an urban one. For someone with a son or daughter out late at night, but particularly a daughter, the taxi drivers' service is very good. I was out with two of my daughters recently.

          <p eId="para_623">I thank the witnesses. This meeting has been comprehensive, and they have laid the issues out cleanly. Their point on taxi drivers being good salespeople for vehicles is a definite. I do not have an EV. I bought a Skoda Octavia on the basis of a recommendation by a taxi driver friend of mine who always drives one. I bought it after he told me he saw it for sale. My NCT expiry date was the next day so I had no choice but to buy. In fairness, you notice it. I am not going to repeat what has been said.

          <p eId="para_627"> With regard to the safety of taxi drivers, there are systems that drivers can use to try to help themselves, such as personal attack systems. However, we really need a liaison officer so we can have direct contact with the Garda.</p>
          <p eId="para_628">This is for when incidents happen so they are not just forgotten about. A lot of drivers do not report. They say there is no point in reporting anymore as opposed to them coming into their association and saying "I was attacked last night". It may have been a minor incident or it may have been serious and they say that they may not carry on. We will say: "Hang on a second, we have someone you can talk to." The driver will then get advice professionally from An Garda Síochána. It is vitally important that the Garda be part of the taxi system also.</p>

          <p eId="para_637">They are heavily intoxicated, and we all know that drug taking is very prevalent. It is going on. The way they can take drugs on the street seems to be very free and easy. Again, taxi drivers are getting the first brunt of these people, and especially if the car is full. When they try to get into the car this can cause a commotion. We have all dealt with it in our careers in the taxi industry. It becomes a judgment thing at night.</p>

          <p eId="para_638">I get that. It was brought up earlier, and it has been brought up with me. Sometimes, because everyone is operating their own business, some people may say that we do not have enough taxi drivers that can carry people with disabilities or with mobility issues. I get that this can be a huge outlay of money for an individual taxi driver.</p>

I am aware that the witnesses are on top of the challenges, of which there are many facing the sector. A late uncle of mine was a taxi driver for years. Times were a bit better then and I believe it is a lot tougher on taxi drivers now. I would like to know if there are any opportunities for taxi drivers now. Are there any opportunities in particular? I am a County Clare Deputy and in rural areas do the witnesses see opportunities that the NTA, the Government, or the local authorities are not really allowing in order for drivers to really get into communities or is it the case that a family will not make that €40,000 expenditure in order to get into the industry?</p>

          <p eId="para_678">The NTA has not listened to us in years. Things could be very much streamlined. The committee might have heard me say that, come January, February and March, about 4,000 vehicles will come off the road if their drivers cannot raise the finance because of the age of the vehicle, so we need the age of the vehicle. That has to be stressed when the representation from the NTA comes before the committee. The age rule has to be extended to 15 years. It covers a lot of things. It avoids the complication of the EV grants because if you get an EV grant and your licence is due on 31 December, your licence goes out of date, which disbars you from taking up that grant. It should be remembered that there are buses and coaches from 2004 out there. They all go for DOE tests, and when they pass those tests they are safer. They have seat belts. We have cars with 131 and 121 licence plates. They are lovely Mercedes, Lexus, Avensis - the whole lot. They go through an NCT and a suitability test. That should suffice.</p>
          <p eId="para_679"> We are in different times now. We are only coming out of Covid. This has to be done, and it is very important that the committee stress that to the NTA.</p>

          <p eId="para_681">There are opportunities, and I think the local councils around the country are missing out on them. Usually, a taxi rank will be in a prime spot. There is no reason that taxi ranks should not be electrified in order that electric cars can be charged while their drivers work. Every taxi rank in the country could be electrified for taxi drivers to use. It is a missed opportunity. I mentioned earlier a trip to County Clare. Drivers are turning down such trips because they cannot get a charge to come back up. There is only one charger in Clare, I believe. It is in Lahinch. Drivers are not going to go there on the basis that somebody else may be there. Taxi ranks throughout the country should be electrified-----</p>

          <p eId="para_682">That brings me on to my next question and the very point of local authorities. Everywhere, be it Ennis or Limerick city, where our Chairman is from, we have cycleways and new paving schemes being brought into towns. The taxi rank was always on the main thoroughfare, the square or the main street. At 12.30 a.m. or 1 a.m. you knew exactly where to get your taxi to get safely home. It is harder to find a rank now when you are out. They are up a side street or at a different rank. Are local authorities squeezing taxis out by the way they provide ranks?</p>
          <p eId="para_683"> We always hear about integrated travel. At the railway stations now you come out and Dublinbikes is here and the Luas is operating there, but the taxi system now has to weave its way into the station and back out. To me, it seems very cumbersome. I came through the station at 2.10 p.m. today and it seems all transport forms are very well catered for, but I feel that taxis used to be easier to get at the station, and that is just Heuston Station. Are local authorities, Irish Rail and other Government bodies making it difficult for taxis to operate at ranks?</p>

          <p eId="para_684">I think we made the point to the Chair earlier that all the groups here, and taxi drivers in general, feel that the local county and city councils and the National Transport Authority are making it tougher for taxi drivers to operate. Dublin has had eight to ten prime taxi ranks removed over the past five to six years, and they have been replaced with taxi ranks down back alleys, where nobody wants to go to get a taxi. It looks like it is a deliberate policy to keep the taxis circling, not to give us a proper space and not to give the customers a recognised area, as they always used to have, to pick up a taxi.</p>

          <p eId="para_686"> The next point I will make I made to Bus Éireann some months ago, when I met with its chief executive, and I think the same applies to the witnesses. I might get a bus once or twice a month, but my dad had to get one lately and did not have a clue when he got on the bus what to do. He was fumbling in his pockets for change and wondering if he had to tap a card. It can be confusing for someone who does not use a bus very often. Where is the bus stop? How does the numbering system work? It is almost the same now for people who get taxis because the taxis pass them on the street, the Free Now branding is on some of them and they are not quite sure how to interface with the taxi when they get in. Has the fare already been charged on the phone? Do they need to pay by card or cash? It would be no harm if at taxi ranks the witnesses' representative associations were to have little guidance notices-----</p>

          <p eId="para_689">However, if permanent structures are put up at taxi ranks, like what Mr. Waldron is calling for, with EV charging points, it makes them nearly impossible to move when the NTA wants to move them in two or three months' time. If permanent infrastructure is put up at a taxi rank, it cannot really be ripped back up in six months' time when the NTA wants to put a nice bike rack there. That is one of the overall problems with the NTA and, in our area, Dublin City Council. They want to make it easy to remove taxi ranks whenever they want. That is why you do not see the likes of that information or shelters or electric vehicle charging points at taxi stands. It is because they need to be easily removed.</p>

          <p eId="para_695">It should not be a part of the transport infrastructure that at the drop of a hat is removed without even talking to the taxi drivers who work there or the organisations involved. We got notification that one of the other prime city centre taxi ranks was being removed for BusConnects. This was a couple of months ago. The irony is that, as we were walking in the door of this committee room today, we got an email from Dublin City Council stating that it will consult with us about that. I wonder was it because this meeting was taking place or is it just a coincidence that that message was sent out just as were walking in the door because it is the first time we have had any communication from Dublin City Council in five years regarding-----</p>

          <p eId="para_697">I think some of the cost factors that have been gone through today are for the Minister and the Department to properly look at and to resolve, and there is an upcoming budget, but there are things our committee, I think, could action. I refer to the suggestion that in an urban environment a certain protection is given to the taxi rank, wherever it might be, whether Dublin city, Ennis or Limerick. The whole move over the past three years has been towards cycleways, active travel and so on. It just seems to me that the taxi rank is lost within that equation. E-scooters and rental bikes are fine, but coming out of a pub or nightclub at 1.30 a.m. people are not going to get e-scooters home. On a rainy winter's night it is the taxi we have always gone home in. It is the safest and the quickest way home and keeps you dry until you get to bed. They need to be protected. Maybe our committee could recommend that to the NTA on foot of everything the witnesses have said, and that ranks become permanent structures. Nearly every city centre and town centre now is being overhauled with paving schemes. An accommodation needs to be given more permanently to the taxi drivers.</p>

          <p eId="para_698">It would be remiss of me not to bring this up. Someone referred to it earlier. Since Covid, first, people have left the sector and, second, there does not appear to be as many drivers going out at night and in the early mornings. Whether it is right or wrong, taxis are at this moment in time the public transport vehicle for people after probably 12 midnight - not everywhere but in many cases, at night, coming out of nightclubs and pubs. Many of the witnesses' members appear not to be working late at night. Can they address that for me?</p>

          <p eId="para_699">I go out and work and I will scout around the streets and on the apps right up to around 12 midnight looking for fares. Taxis are queuing up and even illegally parking trying to get some work. Then all the buses and the mainstream transport goes off the road and the whole pressure comes on the taxi system. When that starts happening - it is exactly what Mr. Brennan said earlier - there is mayhem. People come out on the roads. Some are drunk and some have other substances in their systems. It is a jungle out there. Then we lock into a protection mode until 4 a.m. We have to start asking "Where are you going?" and so on just to make sure they will not be troublesome to us.</p>

          <p eId="para_719">There is a cycle in a taxi driver's life. Many of them are new entrants. According to some figures, there are 500 new entrants. People come in to the industry very enthusiastic and work day and night until something happens. When something happens they have to reassess everything and ask if it is worth their while going out to get an extra few quid and possibly be attacked again. It comes down to policing. That is why I keep emphasising liaison with An Garda Síochána. It is about the safety element of the job as well as being rewarded financially for it.</p>
