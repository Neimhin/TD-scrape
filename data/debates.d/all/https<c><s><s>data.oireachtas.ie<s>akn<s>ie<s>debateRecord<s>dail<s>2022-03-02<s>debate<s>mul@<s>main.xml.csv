It has been an important matter over many years, but over the past six days it has become even more important in the context of the geopolitical issues occurring in Ukraine. I wish to take this opportunity to express my complete revulsion and outrage at what has been done by Russian forces to the people of Ukraine over the past six days and express my solidarity with every man, woman and child in Ukraine. I hope that the glorified spy ring on Orwell Road known as the Russian Embassy, which I am sure is listening to what is being said this morning, as it is every day, will very soon get its marching orders out of this country never to come back. I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House and appreciate him for being here. However, it is unfortunate that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Eamon Ryan, is not here to take this matter because our energy security is something of utter importance right now and in the short, medium and long terms. Throughout Europe, countries have in the past six days pivoted in their position on energy security and changed their policies. In Germany, the Green Party is in government and a decision was made in recent days to build liquified natural gas, LNG, terminals. Issues that were not even on the table this time last week are now being considered and decisions are being made to change policy because of the over-reliance on gas coming from Russia and the time it will take to provide alternatives. People are now starting to think realistically and transition to renewable sources of energy that we all know are needed in the future. There is time in the middle and a period during which I am afraid that the lights will go out. I am very concerned that our only policy in this country for that transitional period seems to be one of complete denial and that we are, in effect, going to hope for the best and hope that the lights do not go out. We have had many amber alerts regarding energy supply in recent times, before the appalling situation in eastern Europe kicked off. What do we think is going to happen in the future? This is something that is, as I said, of critical importance to our entire country and everybody on the island, yet our policy of denial is something that I feel will not work in the future. I do not believe that a Joe Jacob-style policy of handing a candle out to every household in case the lights go out, like the iodine tablets years ago - something we might need again - is enough. We need something more concrete. An application is currently up for a decision regarding the building of an LNG terminal on the Shannon estuary. This is an opportunity for Ireland to try to safeguard some of our national energy security, yet we have a stick our head in the sand approach from Government, as far as I can see, regarding what we need do to keep the lights on in this country. We all want to move to renewables, but that is not simple and cannot be done overnight. The misinformation and twist being put on the Shannon LNG application, which involves overlooking the renewable and transitionary elements of the application and its compatibility with future technologies, is concerning. I would appreciate a response from the Minister of State regarding whether those issues can be addressed.

I apologise on behalf of the Minister, Deputy Ryan, who could not be here today. At the outset, I wish to reiterate that the Government continues to stand in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine and our EU partners. Our support for Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity remains unwavering. We stand with the people of Ukraine and will work with the EU to provide continued support. Let me condemn the outrageous actions of Russia and Belarus in their aggression in Ukraine. This crisis has brought into sharp focus the reliance of the EU and Ireland on fossil fuel imports. We must continue to accelerate the clean energy transition, focusing on energy efficiency and renewable energies. The European Commission is working closely with member states to protect the resilience and security of Europe's gas supply. The Commission is also actively engaging with other countries to ensure a sufficient and timely supply of natural gas to the EU from diverse sources across the globe to avoid supply shocks, including those that could result in disruptions.  Natural gas continues to flow and be traded normally, albeit at high prices. Lessons have been learned since the Russian gas crisis of 2006-2009, including the adoption of an improved internal energy market in the European Union. Ireland sources roughly one-quarter of its gas from the Corrib gas field and three quarters via the UK. The UK's gas supply comes mainly from indigenous supplies via pipelines from Norway and through imports of LNG. In addition, the UK also imports via two gas interconnectors connecting the UK to Belgium and the Netherlands. The UK and Ireland have far less reliance on Russian gas than other European countries.  An analysis of the potential impact of a partial or complete curtailment of Russian pipeline gas supplies to Europe indicates that, in the unlikely event of a disruption to Russian supplies, the result would be manageable for Europe. Ireland is a member of the International Energy Agency, IEA, and is in continuous consultation with our European and international partners to ensure energy security. Yesterday, the Minister, Deputy Ryan, and his counterparts agreed to release 60 million barrels from oil reserves to show solidarity with Ukraine and help maintain stability in global oil supplies. This is only the fourth time in the IEA's history that it has agreed to a release of strategic reserves, which demonstrate the international community's commitment to maintaining stability in energy markets and solidarity with Ukraine.  Ireland holds 90 days demand of stock in oil, in line with its international commitments, and intends to participate in the action. Ongoing conflict in the Ukraine region is likely to maintain pressure on European gas prices, with knock-on effects on electricity prices.Like Ireland, both the IEA and the EU have stressed that the current situation only further threatens our collective resolve to accelerate the clean energy transition in line with the European green deal.

I do not know why we have Topical Issue matters if the Ministers responsible do not show up. There is not really much point. I have been in the situation previously where I have had to answer for other Ministers in the Chamber. There is no point in me having a go at the Minister of State today. I would like to have had a decent discussion with the Minister to try to get to the bones of the issue, but unfortunately that has not happened. I do not know why the Minister is not here. I wish to make the point that the cheese has moved. In the last six days, things have changed. It is okay for the Government to change policy when matters of fundamental change occur outside of our control. Yet, from the response the Minister of State has given me, I am convinced that the heads are still very firmly buried in the sand and the sand has gone into the brain at this stage. Europe is so dependent on Russian gas that it is going to impact on this country. We need to have options and we need to be able to look at alternative sources while we get our act together in relation to renewable energy. As long as we continue to deny that and to ignore that reality, we are at risk of the lights going out. I raised the issue three months ago in this Chamber. The Minister, Deputy Ryan, was not available for questions on that occasion either. I told the Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, not to blame the people of County Kerry or the rest of us if the lights go out. We have done everything that we can to try to progress the Shannon LNG proposal, for example. It has been going on for years now. I met the people of Ballylongford on Monday to discuss the issue again. There was hope that the Government would see sense. Now, we are getting the same drivel back from officials in the Department, who seem to be completely wagging the dog in relation to our energy policy. As far as I can see, they are people who are living in a bunker and do not have any cop on in relation to our energy security. I ask that this crazy policy is reviewed before the lights go out and before people are sitting the dark and the cold in this country because of Government inaction and its determination to ignore reality.

I hear the Deputy's considered views and opinions. I will certainly bring them the Minister's attention. The best way to secure our energy needs is to continue to promote energy efficiency and renewable energy. The Climate Action Plan 2021 sets us on a pathway to reduce our reliance on imported fossil fuels dramatically by 2030. Measures include the following: aiming for up to 80% of our electricity to come from renewable sources by 2030, including an increased target of up to 5 GW of offshore wind, 8 GW from onshore wind and 1.5 GW to 2.5 GW from solar PV; 500,000 extra walking, cycling and public transport journeys per day by 2030; and an increase in the proportion of kilometres driven by passenger electric cars to between 40% and 45% by 2030, in addition to a reduction of 10% in kilometres driven by the remaining internal combustion engine cars. IEA members hold emergency stockpiles of 1.5 billion barrels of oil. Yesterday's IEA announcement of an initial release of 60 million barrels, or 4% of that stockpile, is equivalent to 2 million barrels a day for 30 days. This sends a unified and strong message to global markets that there will be no shortfall in supplies as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Any disruption of Russian gas supplies would maintain upward pressure on European gas prices with knock-on effects on electricity prices. In the unlikely event of any gas supply emergency, there is excellent co-operation between Irish and UK gas system operators. Gas Networks Ireland, GNI, is the designated national gas emergency manager appointed by the Commission for Regulation of Utilities. GNI prepares a natural gas emergency plan which sets out a detailed procedure for managing a network gas emergency and provides details on the role of GNI as the national gas emergency manager. In the medium to long term, the Department of the Environment, Climate and Communications is carrying out a review of the security of energy supply of Ireland's electricity and natural gas systems, focusing on the period through to 2030 in the context of ensuring a sustainable pathway to net zero emissions by 2050.

I appreciate the Minister of State being here to respond to the debate. For the record, I submitted the matter for the attention of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. I appreciate that the Government appears to operate on a silo basis. As a result of the problems that that gives rise to, we have a situation where after a very protracted and sometimes acrimonious issue with community employment, CE, supervisors who resorted to the intervention of the Labour Court, ultimately, a settlement was reached in respect of a financial arrangement on the retirement of CE supervisors, which is most welcome. What I am really asking for, in the context of this debate, is that Government joins the dots. There is no difference on the ground, in all practical reality, between the work that CE supervisors, Tús supervisors and rural social scheme supervisors do. I am sure the Minister of State will appreciate that. There is not a community in urban or rural Ireland that is not benefiting significantly from these interventions. I fail to see why we insist on differentiating between the arrangements for CE supervisors and Tús and rural social scheme supervisors when they retire. That is the problem. Ultimately, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform controls the purse strings. I appreciate that the Department of Social Protection is hands-on in terms of the day-to-day administration of these issues. However, as I said at the outset, we need to join the dots here. Otherwise, we will be dragged, kicking and screaming, to a resolution of this issue. It would be better to resolve the issue without resorting to that form of acrimony, that level of unnecessary engagement and a repetition of visitations to the Labour Court, which I am absolutely certain, because the circumstances are entirely the same, would result in the same judgment. I would appreciate it if the Minister of State could consider the matter in detail. The amounts of money in the context of the overall budget of the Department are very small. As I said, there is no difference, in practice, between the work these people do in rural social schemes, Tús and CE schemes. It is the logical thing to do. I regret that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform has done everything to duck, weave and avoid addressing this issue. I have attempted to submit several parliamentary questions on the issue to that Department on the basis that it ultimately controls the purse strings. I suspect the Minister may well tell me that notwithstanding his good intentions and wish to resolve this issue, he cannot do so. That is why I appeal to Government collectively to address this issue and join the dots. It will be solved and the dots will be connected, ultimately. Let us do it before we are dragged, kicking and screaming to do it.

At the outset, I want to acknowledge the excellent work that is done on the full range of schemes, including the community employment, Tús and rural social schemes, supported by my Department, and the contribution that these schemes and their workers make to communities across the country. Work schemes, such as Tús and the community employment scheme, are positive initiatives that enable the long-term unemployed to make a significant contribution to their communities while upskilling themselves for prospective future employment. The rural social scheme, RSS, provides farmers and fishers with income support while continuing to work in the area of farming or fishing and also make a contribution to their community. At present, there are more than 10,000 places available on Tús and the RSS, with a budget of over €160 million available to support the schemes in 2022. As the Deputy will be aware, the Department of Social Protection sponsors and funds these schemes that are delivered by independent bodies. While the Department funds participant and supervisor wages, the Department is not the employer of any scheme participants, their supervisors or team leaders. Furthermore, the State is not responsible for funding pension arrangements for employees of private companies, even where the companies in question are reliant on State funding. Pension arrangements are a matter to be agreed between employees and their employers.All employers, including the rural social scheme and Tús implementing bodies, are legally obliged to offer access to at least one standard personal retirement savings account under the Pensions (Amendment) Act 2002. Community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors have been seeking the implementation of a 2008 Labour Court recommendation relating to the provision of a pension scheme for a number of years. Discussion had been ongoing for several years through their union representatives to reach an agreement and to have Exchequer funding allocated for this purpose. The discussions that led to the agreement were held in the clear knowledge and agreement of all involved that they related solely to those parties who were the subject of the 2008 Labour Court recommendation, namely, community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors, and that any agreement reached arising from these discussions would apply only to those parties. The Deputy will be aware that a settlement was recently reached on this issue when the unions involved confirmed acceptance on 23 December 2021 of the ex gratia payment. That settlement will now benefit more than 2,200 people who employed by community employment schemes since 2008. The settlement is estimated to have a total cost of over €24 million. Under the terms of this settlement, upon reaching retirement age, community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors will receive a once off ex gratia payment for time employed by community employment schemes since 2008. People who have retired since 2008 will be able to apply for payments immediately when the scheme is in place. The Department is now working to put in place the administrative arrangements to implement the agreed settlement so that payments will issue to qualified community employment workers this year. The discussions leading to this agreement were held in the context of a specific Labour Court recommendation, dating back to 2008. This was acknowledged by all participants in the discussions and so the specific agreement referred to by the Deputy is framed in that context and cannot extend to any other workers.

Of course, the deal was confined to those in the room, which included the Department of Social Protection, the community employment supervisors and their representatives. We are talking about the people who were locked out of the room, including the Tús supervisors and the rural social scheme supervisors. I am sure the Minister of State acknowledges that those people do the exact same work as community employment scheme supervisors. Notwithstanding the fact that the 2008 Labour Court recommendation was specifically about community employment scheme supervisors, does the Minister of State accept that the people to whom that Labour Court recommendation applies do the exact same work as employees or supervisors of the Tús and rural social schemes? For God's sake, will the Minister of State avoid this circuitous journey to a resolution? This issue will be resolved because it is the right thing to do. It is €24 million out of multiple billions of overall expenditure in the Minister of State's Department, which is not a lot of money. These people do invaluable work. I know the Minister of State accepts that and that his Department would like to resolve this issue. Can we end the silo mentality in the Government that states we cannot sit around the table, join the dots, accept the logic of the settlement and extend it to those Tús and rural social scheme supervisors? It is the right thing to do. I know the Minister of State and the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, know it is the right thing to do. Can we have proper engagement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and have this sanctioned?

It does not have a training element, to make a slight distinction. It may look as if they are identical from the outside, but they are not. They are all of equal and high value. The Deputy knows I place a huge emphasis on the importance of such schemes. I have visited many community employment, Tús and rural social schemes over the past number of months, speaking with participants, supervisors and implementing bodies. I am fully aware of the important work that they carry out in the community. I have seen first hand the great work that is being carried out, providing valuable services to the vulnerable members of our communities, in keeping our towns and villages looking so well, and in helping to protect the environment. The agreement that the Deputy refers to was entered into in the knowledge that it would pertain only to community employment supervisors and assistant supervisors. The focus for the Department at present remains on putting the administrative processes in place that will ensure that payments issue to those supervisors identified by the Labour Court as being entitled to receive them. Both the Minister, Deputy Humphreys, and I are fully aware that all schemes make a valuable contribution to communities through the provision of services and my Department will continue to support them to do this.

The news last night that the early intervention class in Kilbrittain National School will not close is very welcome. I cannot emphasise that enough. It is down to the dedicated parents and staff who understand the value of early intervention autism spectrum disorder classes. They are essential classes for children aged three to five. However, this case also reveals a worrying dimension to special needs education. First, the entire situation in Kilbrittain was of the National Council for Special Education's making. It closed the class, leading to additional stress for parents and disruption to school life, as well as taking up time that the principal and staff could otherwise have spent with students. It is now clear that the NCSE can, without engagement, just remove a vital service. The need for the class in Kilbrittain was never in doubt. The school had the staff, space and students enrolled. Nonetheless, a vital service for children with additional needs can be removed just like that. If the NCSE had engaged with the school in the first place, all of this would have been avoided. Second, and most worryingly, it appears that Kilbrittain is not an isolated case. Indications from the NCSE reveal an agenda to potentially phase out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model, AIM. AIM is a welcome development, but it cannot in any way replace early intervention classes. The NCSE has repeatedly refused to clarify whether or not this is its policy. It has mostly ignored the question, but when it was pressed in a public meeting, it stated it did not want to comment and that it is waiting for the finding of an AIM report, which would lead us to worry or believe that this is being seriously considered or, worryingly, it has already been decided, and that it is potentially pre-judging the findings of that report, with Kilbrittain being the first casualty. Will the Minister assure us that they will not be phased out and replaced with AIM and explain why the NCSE does not liaise with schools before making decisions?

This is unbelievably important for this community. My colleague is right to thank and acknowledge the incredibly hard work of the principal, staff, parents and the entire community of Kilbrittain who fought for this. I also acknowledge the intervention of the Minister's Department. I was delighted to receive correspondence from the Minister's office last night confirming that the class would reopen. That intervention is appreciated. Parents and children should not have to fight for these incredibly important services. The early intervention pre-school class is an effective model that should be expanded and rolled out nationally. I would like the Minister's Department, and the NCSE, which the Minister of State, Deputy Madigan, has responsibility for, to take that on. The issue with Kilbrittain has certainly been resolved for next year, but I have to take this opportunity to raise another school's special needs education where children with autism are involved. I never thought I would be saying this in 2022.Ballydehob national school is undertaking its own fundraising drive in order to pay for an extra special needs assistant, SNA. It should not happen that it falls to a community and a gentleman - Mr. Barry O'Brien in this case, who is probably best known for arranging the famous turnip racing festival in Ballydehob - to organise a tractor and vintage run in order to fund an SNA allocation for children who need it. The school has been through two appeals and the request has been turned down twice. I would love it if the Minister could consider the matter and intervene.

Enabling children with special educational needs to receive an education appropriate to their needs is an ongoing priority for this Government. This year the Department of Education will invest in excess of €2 billion, or over 25% of the Department's budget, in the area of special educational needs support. As a result, the number of special education teachers, special needs assistants and special classes and school places are at unprecedented levels. Since 2011, the number of special classes in mainstream schools has increased from 548 to a current total of 2,148 for the 2021-22 school year. Of these, almost 1,900 special classes cater for students with autism. Recognising some of the difficulties experienced by parents in securing appropriate school placements throughout 2020 and 2021, my Department and the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, have worked closely on a more streamlined and joined-up planning process that has ensured a targeted approach to meet demand for special needs placements ahead of each new school year. I am satisfied this approach is delivering and this intensive intervention has seen the addition of 300 special classes, providing 1,800 new places that have already been opened nationwide for the 2021-22 school year. The Department recognises that where parents have difficulties in securing an appropriate school placement for their child, particularly a child with additional needs, it can most certainly be a stressful experience. The Department is working hard to ensure there are sufficient school places appropriate to the needs of all children available on a timely basis nationwide. On Cork specifically, there is currently a network of 357 special classes, of which 309 are special classes for children with autism. Of those 309 special classes for children with autism, 228 are at primary level, including 21 early intervention classes, with 81 at post-primary level. A total of 45 new special classes have been established in Cork for the 2021-22 school year. It is important to point out that the early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme provides up to two years of preschool within the eligible age range without charge. The access and inclusion model, AIM, introduced in 2016, enables the full inclusion and meaningful participation of children with disabilities and additional needs in the ECCE programme. The goal is to create a more inclusive environment in preschool so all children, regardless of ability, may benefit from quality early learning and care. The model achieves this by providing universal supports to preschool settings and targeted supports focusing on the needs of the individual child. A diagnosis of autism is not required to access AIM support but preschool children with a diagnosis are generally supported in mainstream preschools, with additional supports provided through AIM where required. The NCSE sanctions the establishment of special classes, including autism spectrum disorder early intervention classes, where there is an identified need. I understand that, on occasion, early intervention classes are redesigned as school-age special classes to reflect the changing age profile of students. Kilbrittain National School currently has an enrolment of 205 students and the school, in conjunction with the NCSE, agreed that whereas an early intervention class could be opened, it would be redesignated as a primary school special class in September 2022 to meet the projected demand for places in the area. It was further noted the class would cater for the children enrolled in the early intervention class should they continue to require a special class place for primary education. On 10 February the school engaged with the NCSE on the emerging need for the retention of the early intervention class in the school and requested that the class be retained. The NCSE has now reviewed the matter and approval has been given to the school for the retention of the early intervention class for the 2022-23 school year. In addition, a new special class is being opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. This decision was taken following consideration of the needs in the area and the capacity of the school to make the additional provision.

The larger point remains that decisions are being made by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, on behalf of schools and not with them. We all know staff and parents are the experts on local conditions and the needs of children and they should be at the centre of the process, or at least part of it, and currently they are not. I will ask the questions again if that is okay. Will the Minister commit to changing that process? Is there a move from the NCSE and the Department of Education to phase out early intervention classes in favour of the access and inclusion model, AIM? Is that the report that is currently under way? The question has not been answered. I put in questions to the Department and the NCSE but I do not get a reply. The disability committee has asked the question but still has not received a reply. The only time we see a response is when the media put in the question but the answer is avoided in this case and Kilbrittain school is referenced on its own. That is very important but people need to know if this is a national policy. Was there prejudgment of the AIM report in deciding to close the resource at Kilbrittain? The Minister has stated this is based on need in an area but how could that happen in Kilbrittain when students were enrolled, staff were in place and accommodation was there for the following year? It does not make sense. This is the reality that parents are experiencing.

There is also the extra special needs class allocation, which means the pupils in the current preschool early intervention class have a special needs provision. This has shed light, I suppose, on the overall matter of a lack of SNA provision in particular in the west Cork area, particularly in and around Skibbereen. I do not expect the Minister to know each of these cases individually but I have written to the Minister of State, Deputy Josepha Madigan, about them. I speak about some schools in the Skibbereen area, including Coronea National School and Dreeny National School, which only has 0.5 of an allocation for four children with high needs. There is also Schull National School, which has seven children with very high needs, and St. Joseph's National School in Skibbereen, which has a class with pupils with profound needs. The NCSE is getting this wrong time and again and its approach must change.

It is important to put on record the commitment of this Government to special education. It is worth noting that 25% of our budget, as I outlined earlier, is dedicated to special education, which is correct. That is a budget of €2 billion. It is also important to note that considerable progress has been made in the past number of years in the provision of special education classes. We can very clearly say that budget 2022 provided for the creation of 287 additional special classes for the 2022-23 school year, which will provide over 1,700 new places. This means for the 2022-23 school year, there will be a provision of 2,435 special classes, which is significant progress in a short period. I acknowledge most sincerely that further work must be done. On the provision of early intervention, I want to be very clear that the request from the school was received by the Department on 10 February; the acknowledgement from the school that its view was that there was an appropriate opportunity for the early intervention class to continue. On 1 March it was communicated that the early intervention class would continue in the school, that it would be retained, and that provision would be made for a new special class to be opened by the school to cater for children transitioning from this year's early intervention class. That speaks volumes about the proactive nature of the process, the determination and the recognition of where there is a need, early intervention classes will be put in place. Where there is a need for children to progress from the early intervention class, that will also be catered for. That is important and we must have a focus on children not just being put into classes but having a facility to progress to meet their future needs. That is being provided for.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Butler, for being here. In many HSE documents we see the mantra the "right care", the "right place", the "right time". In County Meath it does not happen. We are aware that there is an intent in acute services to close the ICU and emergency department at Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. We are at the bottom of the list or very close to it for primary care and disability services, GP services or the head of population services, children's services, occupational therapy, physiotherapy, psychology services and on the topic we are to discuss today, namely, mental health services. I draw the Minister of State's attention to the vacancy for a suicide resource officer, for example. This post has been vacant for longer than other vacancies in any other part of the country, since February 2020. Also in this context, with day services we have a failure by the HSE to deliver appropriate physical space to deliver services. As a result, we do not have the services delivered. For those small number of people who are receiving services, they are stressed and anxious that the service will be cancelled at short notice. A huge swathe of people who otherwise would have received services are not getting those services. Active day hospital services are not happening, there is no group work, therapy or assessments. These services would have been dealing with 70 people a day, and it is not happening. We want to hear from the Minister of State what the plan is for the physical space and for the services.

We are talking about the day hospital services for mental health in Navan, which as Deputy O'Rourke has said, provided group therapy, individual therapy, assessments, and a clozapine clinic. Unfortunately, only part of this is happening at this point in time. Before March 2020, this was happening properly and was fully functional. The fact is that we did not have the same pressure then in Meath as those on the services at the department of psychiatry in Crosslanes, which is under severe pressure. Louth and Meath have very low provision of beds. I am led to believe that it is around 14.2 beds per 100,000 people. The State average is in the 20s and the EUROSTAT average in 2018 was 34 beds per hundred thousand. It is very far from the number in Germany which is 128 beds per 100,000 or in Belgium at 135 beds per 100,000 people. We do not have the service that is required. I have particular issues around the protocols and resources for the Drogheda department of psychiatry at Crosslanes. We had a service that was working and, to a degree, was replacing the need for people to possibly go into hospital. This is not the case. We have had a building that was handed over for Covid around March 2020. It was sought back around August and a promise was made of a modular build. That modular build later became a block build and it was delivered late in 2021. There was a fire in the old part of the hospital and the two parts that have been given to mental health services are not fit for purpose. Electricity is not working and there is no heating. The clozapine clinic for people who are treatment resistant is operating as a clinic in the cold and they are incredibly worried.

On Deputy O'Rourke's comments, I will check out the situation with the suicide resource officer post vacancy since 2020, and I will revert back to the Deputy on that. I do not have any detail on that today. In relation to Meath mental health services, the HSE provides a wide range of services for adults, children and adolescents, and older people. These services are provided in various locations and settings and include community outpatient services provided by community mental health multidisciplinary teams, and approved centres and day centres, including Navan mental health day centre. In 2020, use of the Navan mental health day hospital was required by Navan general hospital for Covid-19 purposes. This requirement continued longer than expected, as the pandemic wore on, leaving Meath mental health services without a day hospital. A longer-term solution was identified, which saw the day hospital move into a block-build construction extension to Our Lady's Hospital, Navan. This opened in October 2021 in line with Covid-19 restrictions and was gradually returning to full capacity with face-to-face therapies and assessments being carried out. Unfortunately, on 27 December, a fire broke out in an adjoining area to the day hospital, which rendered the building unsafe for use. Remedial works for the fire damage have taken considerable time to address and full safety clearance remains outstanding, though I am assured by the HSE that the clearance is imminent and the day hospital will reopen as soon as possible. I note that patients of Meath mental health services continue to receive support and intervention from their local community mental health team. Also available are our online and telehealth services, many of which are available 24-7. Yourmentalhealth.ie provides an excellent information service and signposts to numerous NGO partners who provide specialist help on behalf of the HSE. It is very disappointing that the centre has been closed, obviously because of Covid, and when it did manage to relocate and the service was up and running that this fire could have happened. There is more detail in the remainder of the script but as I understand that the Leas-Cheann Comhairle is under pressure for time, I will not read it into the record. On bed capacity, we are currently carrying out a review of bed capacity throughout the whole country. Some 25% of our bed capacity is sourced from the private sector. This is never included in the figures that are used, which only show the public bed capacity. When this review is finalised it will provide great data for me to be able to see all over the country where there are issues.

I will point to one line that the Minister of State did read into the record which is "I am assured by the HSE that the clearance is imminent and the day hospital will reopen as soon as possible". I ask the Minister of State to take a personal interest in that to ensure that it happens as quickly as possible and that the services returned to full capacity.

We will all be very interested in the review around the bed capacity and where those weaknesses are that need to be addressed. As Deputy O'Rourke has said, there is a need for the Minister of State to take a look to ensure that the plan is for the day hospital to be provided with a sufficient amount of space to offer the services that are required, and so it means that we deal with the community care piece. We are also looking for day hospital services in Dundalk and Drogheda. This would mean we could have community capacity and it can alleviate the pressure on the acute hospitals, which we all accept are under pressure. Will the Minister of State give us an assurance that she is going to do the devil and all to make sure this happens?

I know exactly where the two Deputies are coming from. Sharing the Vision, our new mental health policy, is all about support in the community including day hospitals, peer support, crisis cafes, which all play a hugely important role to allow people with mental health issues to live at home. It was unfortunate, which is the only word I can use, that having been closed for so long due to Covid, when the service did reopen, a fire broke out in the adjoining area of the day hospital. This meant that the building was unsafe for use. Obviously, we were not in a position to put people into the day hospital then. I have visited day hospitals all over the country. They are very important and hugely supportive for people have mental health illness and challenges. I give both Deputies a commitment here today that I will keep a special eye on this to look at the time frame. All I want to do is have all of these facilities open to support people with their mental health. The temporary closure of the Navan day hospital due to a fire outbreak is very unfortunate. It has impacted on our ability to provide the level of service we aspire to uphold. The Deputies will appreciate it was completely out of my control. The reduction in service has been difficult for individuals using the day hospital, but I assure the Deputies that every effort is being made. I am confident that services will resume fully in the near future. Go raibh maith agaibh. I will revert to the Deputies when I have more information.

I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, for coming in to take this debate. At the outset, has it been indicated that the Government is putting forward an amendment to this motion? I hope it will be accepted. I will believe that if and when a vote is called. In regard to the current national driver licence, to start at the beginning, until 2013 people obtained their driver licences in the same way as they obtained their motor tax, that is, at their local authority offices. In 2013 the local authorities, which were the issuing authorities for driver licences were replaced with a sole issuing authority, that being the Road Safety Authority. The Road Safety Authority in its wisdom decided to tender for three contracts, one of which was the front office service where people went in to give their information and hope that they would obtain the licence. The other two contracts were for the back office to go through the data etc. and the third was for physically printing or making the driver licence.  At the time, the Road Safety Authority awarded the contract to the Swiss service company, SGS, to be the front office provider. One Minister who sat around Cabinet at the time had a certain crisis of conscience thereafter. We are not aware that he had any at the time when he subsequently announced that that was a contract that should have been given to An Post. However, it was not given to An Post, but to this Swiss company which set up 33 offices at the time. It has very recently announced a 34th office.  There is now a difficulty, according to information the Minister of State confirmed to me in the Dáil at the end of the week before last when I brought to her attention the difficulties in obtaining appointments at the Ennis office. She confirmed that the walk-in service, which previously had been discontinued during Covid-19 based on health and safety advice to ensure there was as little contact as possible between people, was completely discontinued when a new contract was awarded in 2021. I have worries about that on a variety of levels. The first is that it appears to me, and I do not think it is unfair to suggest, that Covid-19 was used as a cover for the downgrading of a public service. The second is the lack of a walk-in service per se. People are still able to go to an National Driver Licence Service, NDLS, office, of which there are now 34 in the country although some of them, including some in the Minister of State's own constituency, operate on a part-time basis, but they have to make an appointment in advance. To make an appointment, you have either to go online, or ring a number. I have previously highlighted the difficulties that my constituents in Clare had in booking that ten-minute slot. One woman in her 80s spent 90 minutes on the phone and people in my office spent 45 minutes on the phone. I thought this might be unique to Ennis but since I raised this issue with the Minister of State it has come to my attention that this is a widespread problem throughout the country.  In the space of less than ten years we have gone from a situation where anybody was able to walk into his or her local authority office and get his or her driver licence, to people not being even able to book an appointment in a public service. What ought to be a public service is no longer public because it is being provided by a Swiss logistics company, SGS, and it is no longer really a service. If you cannot book your appointment, and I do not think it unfair to say that if you have to spend almost an hour, or in excess of an hour, on the telephone trying to book a ten-minute appointment, it is inadequate. I note the Minister of State is agreeing with me on at least that much, this morning.  The other thing is you can renew your licence online completely but to do that, you need a public services card. The Minister of State will be aware that during the previous Government's term of office the Data Protection Commissioner carried out an investigation into the legality of the public services card and in particular using it as a basis or requiring it to provide services other than social welfare services, and found that there was no lawful basis for that. There was a big brouhaha about it. The Government took a case against the Data Protection Commissioner which was subsequently compromised or settled between the parties. To the best of my knowledge, that Data Protection Commissioner finding that it is unlawful to request a public services card for anything other than social welfare services, stands. Regardless of her view on whether it stands or not, I ask the Minister of State to point to me somewhere in legislation which says that a public services card is required in order to renew a driver licence. The public services card is not mentioned anywhere in the Road Traffic Acts and they are what govern the granting of driver licences. Why are we making it so difficult to renew driver licences? That is what I would like to know. Why are we moving State services in this direction which is essentially to trim them, to privatise them and make them less accessible to the citizens that we are supposed to be serving? Those are my concerns. When the contract was being renewed in 2021, I was not aware of it at the time and it probably slipped under the radar for many people because of what was going on at the time, but An Post again sought the tender. An Post has several hundred offices throughout the country, with 950 post offices. I accept that it might not be able to provide a driver licence renewal service in all of them, but I expect it could provide the service in many of them. Yet it was passed over again in favour of this Swiss logistics company which has 34 offices. We are talking about saving An Post and about moving as many services as possible into An Post. We criticise the banks for taking services away from our main streets and the difficulties that entails for sections of our population who may not be good with computers or who live in an area where there is not a good broadband service or who simply want to have a service provided face-to-face and yet, we seem to be doing exactly the same thing.  The last issue I wish to bring to the Minister of State's attention is one that I brought up before, which is that SGS is now refusing to accept cash, at least in Ennis and I do not know if this is nationwide. Again, is there any lawful basis for that? I can accept it, if it was a temporary measure during Covid-19 not to accept cash, but why on earth can it not accept cash now? What is the problem? It has a limited number of offices, it can lodge the cash at the end of the day. The office in Ennis is in a shopping centre. We are not talking about huge amounts of cash whereby the office would become a target. We are seeing a complete downgrading of the service and it concerns me.Another thing that irks me about driving licences is the countries from which one can have their driving licence recognised. It is countries that one might expect: Australia, Isle of Man, Jersey, South Africa, New Zealand, the UK and Northern Ireland, of course, as well as some provinces of Canada, leaving out Quebec, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.  What concerns me slightly more is the 50 states of the United States. We have much interaction with the United States. We have many people moving over and back. It is not in the motion and I accept that, but can the Minister of State explain the rationale in her summing up as to why we do not recognise driving licences from the United States? The UK recognises driving licences from some countries but not from others and if it does not recognise the licence, then a person has to do the practical and theory tests before getting a licence. That is all quite rational. However, in respect of the countries from where Ireland does not recognise driving licences, on top of that, even if you have been driving ten or 20 years in another country and you come to Ireland, you also have to do all the lessons. That is a racket. People who have been driving for 20 years and had a licence in another country should be able to sit the test and then they will either pass or fail the test. The idea that they would have to do all of the lessons, even if they had been driving for most of their adult lives in another jurisdiction, makes very little sense. I would like to know what the rationale to that is.  I urge the Minister to accept this motion because of the diminution of services in the driving licences renewal area.

While Covid-19 has brought many problems for people, it seems to be a cover for many things at present in taking services away. We see things changing in agriculture day in, day out. Some changes are for the better and I will never be against prosperity or moving things on. However, we also have to remember in this country that there is a generation of people who gave to this country but never had the opportunities that every one of us have had, such as being able to work a computer, being able to go online and being able to bank online or fill out forms. We seem to have become a generation that wants to nearly cast those people aside. I think a nation is viewed by how it looks after its elders. We seem to have this thing in our head of basically leaving them with difficulty, to say the least, in trying to access services. As Deputy McNamara pointed out, one could spend 90 minutes on a phone call. Does an 85-year-old deserve that? Even for Deputies, who to be frank should have a direct line such as we have in some services, in fairness it is pretty good but it takes 45 or 50 minutes to get through. Then someone will come on and say about 40 times that you can do it online. In the first instance, you might not have the broadband for it. That is the biggest problem for many people in rural areas. Sometimes we think we are doing good. The councils were looking after licences at one time and then we decided to set up a new system. If we are going to protect or help the post office network in this country, I have always said that doing many little things will make it sustainable and make it work. However, we decided, of course, that, because of EU rules and procurement, a foreign company would get the tender. Sometimes we do things and we think are going forward, but in actual fact we are going backwards. I ask the Minister of State to listen to the Deputy. I hope that she will not table an amendment and call a division on it. This needs to be revisited. This needs to be made accommodating for people, especially those in the rural areas, those who do not have the broadband and those who will not be hanging on the end of a phone for 90 minutes. This is a solution that needs to be put in place. However, a better solution down the road would be the likes of the post office network doing this, where there is one 5 km or 10 km away from people and where someone might talk to them, because not having that in-person interaction is the worst part in much of this. A person's problem could be worked out if someone actually talked to him or her and if he or she saw someone, not a screen. Also, it appears as though this card, which started off in social protection, is being pushed despite the legal question. I urge the Minister of State to produce the document that was given to the Government on the legal standing of this card because sooner or later, if the Government does not make the move, someone in this country will push the button and go to the courts. If legal advice to a Government is to not use this card other than in respect of social protection, then it should be adhered to, at the very least. I envisage that if the Government keeps trying to drive this the way it is at present, someone in this country will be obligated to basically prove that it cannot do what it is trying to do.  On the whole licence issue, I have talked to people who, thankfully, have come back from Australia and different countries from where you do not have problems getting a driving licence here. As Deputy McNamara pointed out, a person has to go around the rigamarole for I do not know how long trying to get licences sorted. We should nearly have a one-stop shop and it would be a good idea for the likes of the post offices. Imagine that there are now companies setting up in Ireland that try to get people coming back to this country set up here. The person who is coming back to work in Ireland is actually paying people basically to get his or her life in line for licences, a bank account – another thing for which you now could be waiting for three months – and all the simple things that are necessary to make sure that you can live a normal life and fit into a community. We are crying out for people at the moment in different sectors, yet we are putting every block we can in their way. Another thing on licences is that in 1992, much of the paperwork was basically eliminated. Then, a few years later, we decided to bring in a requirement whereby a person needs a trailer licence. At that time, there was no paperwork to show what one had. This trailer licence has caused huge problems, especially in the farming community, and a resolution should have been brought to the issue.  There is another thing I urge the Minister of State to do. Day in, day out I meet elderly people in particular who got their provisional licence years ago. They never bought a car and had a tractor and were tipping around with the tractor on the rural roads. We have gone to being a society now where we look at someone and say, "That is illegal." These people at one time were used to going into the back of a van but as time progressed, we got offices in which to do the theory test. We have pushed a certain amount and we all see it as public representatives, day in and day out. Some elderly farmer who might have had a provisional licence years ago does not have a licence now and is caught between the devil and the deep blue sea. Many of them never had the privilege of getting secondary education or college education, through no fault of their own. They have lived the best education of all, which is a thing called life. However, they are being pushed out and left, and they cannot even feed a few cattle with their own bale because they have no licence. I have urged for change before, and I am just blue in the face from talking about it. We talk about road safety and all the great things we are doing. As I have said, why do we not get a place such as Mondello Park? Why do we not get a place in the west of Ireland or four places in Ireland? There will not be an enormous number of them. Rather than putting people with a difficulty through this paperwork, they could go around some place that has all the signs up and do it in a simple way.If it is done in a simple way then people who might have learning or other difficulties can be brought inside the law. We have to stop pushing people outside the law. We have to show a bit of heart and find ways to solve things. The way things have gone in this country now, you look at a screen, answer 35 out of 40 questions or else they are a failure. That is it. Everything now is about referring to a computer or to this, that and the other. If we keep going down that road, we will push more and more people out. I see it, day in and day out. Through no fault of their own, there is a lot of these people around the country but the people who are supposed to be promoting road safety do not appear to want to listen. They are not interested in putting a simple thing in place in areas that are safe. I have suggested Mondello Park as one example but there are three or four places around the country where this could be done, rather than telling people to go into an office and press a button on 40 questions which some of them might have difficulty in reading. They are told that they can get a reader but it is just not as simple as that. These people would be the finest in the world at driving. They are driving all their lives but now they are outside the system. I urge the Minister of State to accept the motion. I also ask her to make a statement on the card and confirm that it is going to be scrapped for once and for all.

The Government will not be opposing the motion. At the outset I would like to clarify that the NDLS front offices across the nation are open to the public. The only change since the new contract came into effect in June 2021 is that there is no longer an option to attend at an office without a prior appointment. Appointments can be may online or by telephone. A public services card, PSC, is not required to book an appointment. The NDLS, which processes applications for and issues driving licences and learner permits, is the statutory responsibility of the Road Safety Authority, RSA. The service is provided to the RSA under contract. The NDLS front office service commenced in 2013 as a non-appointment service. An appointment service was subsequently provided to manage queues. Under this, people with an appointment had preference and attendance without an appointment was facilitated if time permitted. The contracted service in place since 2013 ended in 2021 and a replacement NDLS front office service contract was procured. The procurement process for the new contract began in January 2020. It was not intended that the new contract, which took effect in June 2021, would offer a non-appointment option. This decision was made based on experience with the previous contract that managing a non-appointment element was difficult. RSA market analysis, ahead of procurement of the current service contract, showed that more bids and better value for money would be attainable for an appointment-only service. Such a service gives certainty to customers and prevents overcrowding, queueing and long waits. The non­appointment service had generated complaints from members of the public due to waiting times and delays. It also allows the provider to manage resourcing of the service because demand is predictable rather than having peaks and troughs during the day. It should be noted that the procurement process did not prohibit tenderers from offering a non­appointment service. Four bids were received, each of a high standard. Following assessment under the published assessment criteria, the tender was awarded to the incumbent, SGS Ireland Limited, a Swiss company that has been active in Ireland for over 40 years, operates over 34 offices nationwide, and provides extensive services across a range of sectors. The contract has a term of two operational years from June 2021 to June 2023, with possible extensions to June 2025. An Post tendered for the contract but was unsuccessful. The procurement process and contract were totally compliant with EU and national law. The requirements for the new contract differ from the predecessor as demand for the front office service is declining with the growth in the NDLS online service. The ability of companies to manage and adapt staffing requirements was an important element of the current contract. The decision to move to an appointment-only service was supported by the online licence renewal and application service, which accounts for over 40% of total applications, and the option for older customers to apply by post. The change was communicated to the public on the NDLS website and in renewal reminder notices. The existing service had moved to an appointment-only system from June 2020 because of Covid-19 restrictions before the new service began in June 2021. Therefore, an appointment-only service was in place one year before the new NDLS front office contract commenced. The current contract has virtually the same capacity and opening hours as the previous contract. It was expected that the NDLS front office capacity would be reducing in the lifetime of the new contract as the take up of the online service increases. In practice, the centres are now catering for more applications than originally forecasted for this time due to the effect of the licence and learner permit extensions. The effects of the extensions will apply until September of this year. The same network of 34 permanent offices has been retained from the old to the new contract. The only reductions are two satellite centres which were open one day per week in Belmullet and Clifden. Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between both of these centres. These have not been retained due to the provision of an online service. Any significant change to the current contract would involve a contractual change and have commercial implications for the service. It is the RSA's opinion that the introduction of a non-appointment service would in fact diminish the quality of the service to the public. An applicant is required to present photographic ID and evidence of Personal Public Service, PPS, number, address and residency entitlement when applying for a licence. Applications may be made in person at a NDLS office, where the required documents are examined and a face-to-face verification is made. A PSC is not required for an NDLS application made in an NDLS office. It may be used to establish identity but it is not mandatory and an applicant may use one of several options. For online applications, the same information is required but verifying a person's identity is more difficult online. A MyGovlD account, which requires a PSC, satisfies this requirement. Legal proceedings, in which the Department of Social Protection appealed an enforcement notice from the Data Protection Commission, DPC, on processing of personal data for PSCs, were resolved in December 2021. The agreement reached acknowledged that other public bodies listed in social welfare legislation, that is "specified bodies", may use the PSC as a means of verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity. The agreement also acknowledges and accepts that the Department of Social Protection and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovlD as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service channel is made available. The Road Safety Authority is a specified body for the use of a PSC under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act 2005, as amended by the Social Welfare and Pensions (No. 2) Act 2009. Applicants who do not have a PSC may apply for or renew a licence in person at an NDLS office. Payment at the NDLS offices can be made by credit card, debit card, Google Pay, Apple Pay or Payzone vouchers. Payzone vouchers can be purchased from retailers in towns and villages nationwide. Card payment is significantly the most predominant means of payment. The NDLS allows an accompanying person make card payments for customers who do not have cards themselves. The decision was made not to accept cash after a market sounding exercise where only one potential bidder advocated accepting cash payments. The decision was made after evaluating security, administration and value for money factors. As I mentioned earlier, appointments to attend at a NDLS front office can be made by telephone as well as online. Currently, 29,000 appointment slots are free out of 77,000 slots available for booking across a six week period. There is currently a high renewal demand for driving licences and learner permits due to the extensions put in place during the Covid-19 pandemic coming to an end. The RSA acknowledges the service provided to customers in the phone booking service in this period has been less than adequate. I have heard the concerns of Deputies in that regard today. At a minimum, three full­time agents are necessary to provide the required level of service on the booking line. The service provider is working to ensure that these resources are available daily and are committing extra personnel to training to ensure that the three full-time staff members are assisted and supported through busy periods. The RSA has been assured that once training is completed this week, the service to the public will be greatly improved. It should be noted that where people are late for an appointment, they cannot always be accommodated.Where possible, however, every effort is made to accommodate them. No permanent NDLS offices have been closed. The services provided in Belmullet and Clifden were temporary and were set up to operate in hotels in those towns one day a week. Approximately 20 to 30 appointments per week were catered for between the two. The feedback from the market analysis conducted was that these two centres were not required in order to provide a strong service to the public. The provision of these temporary services was not included within the successful SGS proposal in response to the tender process. Some NDLS front offices have had to close on some days or to offer a reduced service in the past few months because of absences due to Covid-19 pressures. The RSA is working to restore the service, with all centres open for the full contracted hours as soon as possible.

At face value, that may appear to be true but we must realise that these are just two examples of a steady creep of the incessant rolling back of public service provision brought in by successive Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil Governments. Moreover, we need to recognise that these are symptoms of a disease, not the disease itself. The symptoms are the obliteration of State-provided universal public service and its direct replacement with for-profit privatisation where buzzwords such as "efficiency" and "streamlining" serve only to mask the reduction of services or the removal of universal service obligation as a core tenet. Any doctor knows full well that treating the symptoms only goes so far and that the disease must be cured. The identification of the disease is not difficult. It is unfettered capitalism. It is the kind espoused and perfected in America by zealots such as Milton Friedman of the University of Chicago. Actions such as using the cover of the pandemic to remove the walk-in service at the likes of the NLDS are well-documented moves straight from Friedman playbook. Naomi Klein, in the opening pages of her seminal work, The Shock Doctrine: The Rise of Disaster Capitalism describes this well, saying of Friedman, "[In the aftermath of Hurricane Katrina] One of those who saw opportunity in the floodwaters of New Orleans was Milton Friedman, grand guru of the movement for unfettered capitalism". He proposed the privatisation of the school system, and backed by the Bush administration, Klein describes what happened next:In sharp contrast to the glacial pace with which levees were repaired and the electricity grid brought back online, the auctioning off of the New Orleans' school system took place with military speed and precision.[...]Before Hurricane Katrina, the school board had run 123 public schools; now it ran just 4.This perverse ideology was championed by Friedman and then found its natural home within the regimes of Reagan and Thatcher, but driven by a vast cohort of lobbyists and their money. Where did the ideology in question take hold in this country? We must look back to the first act of a Romeo and Juliet-type story that continues to play out before us in this Chamber today. I refer to the unfinished saga of the merging of Fianna Fáil and Fine Gael, and the unfortunate genes that appear to have become dominant in the offspring. It begins with the convergence of right-wing elements of both parties into the Progressive Democrats in the mid-1980s. What we saw emerge was a small cabal that exerted an undue influence over Irish economic policy that was far beyond their representation in the Dáil or the appeal of those policies to the people. However, propped up by their wilful enablers in Fianna Fáil, they did damage that has continued to the present day, with the contagion now having spread and taken control within Fine Gael. Sadly, when I look across the floor, I see only a small group of fundamentalists but they are in control of strategic Ministries of Government despite not leading it at present. This gang of four or five in Fine Gael appear destined to continue leading the party into the future according to media speculation, as the rest play bit-part roles as mere cheerleaders who attend openings, make local announcements and cut and paste their names into head office press releases for the local media. They are the golden scissors brigade. I am not sure whether this is due to the apathy or ineptitude of those on the Opposition benches who appear to function almost exclusively on the basis of a mentality of “I'm just happy to be here” . I am sure of one thing, however. The days when backbench Deputies could vote in here to privatise public services or dubiously auction State assets, such as mobile phone licences, or close post offices and Garda stations and then scurry back to their constituencies and claim to be against the very same decisions, are coming to an end. You are being caught out and called out. The people are better informed and see through this. It is the death by a 1,000 cuts nature of the privatisation of services and the inevitable reduction of that service that follows which most gets to people. It is also the nature of who ends up worse off. It is easy for ourselves in here or younger citizens to navigate new online systems so the burden falls on the older generations or those without broadband, who tend to live in rural areas, or those who simply cannot afford a broadband service. These are the people targeted by such moves. They are the very people that this Government is willing to discard and sweep aside in pursuit of its privatisation agenda, which is often miscategorised as being in the name of progress. This is why the motion to restore the NLDS walk-in service is important. It is important to my constituents in Donegal because most of us will wait until 2025 for the Government to roll out broadband to us. It is important for my constituents in Donegal because we have a higher proportion of older people than is the case nationally. It is important to my constituents in Donegal because we have lower disposable incomes and higher deprivation rates than most of the country. These issues are common to most of us who live in rural constituencies right across the western seaboard. It is vitally important that these services remain in public ownership and remain available to the public as walk-in services, which is the least that we can expect the Government to provide to citizens.

The motion reads, "the current National Driver Licence Service (NDLS) contract, which was put in place in 2021 while the attention of the body politic was diverted by the Covid-19 pandemic, no longer offers a walk-in service, the walk-in service having originally ceased temporarily in March 2020 to ensure the safety of the service's staff and of the public using the service during the Covid-19 pandemic". That is an important point because I do not think that there was a need to divert completely from the walk-in service after that temporary situation of a walk-in service. The motion continues, "the Road Safety Authority (RSA) awarded the contract to the Swiss company SGS, which operates 34 offices, some of them on a part-time basis, over An Post which has a network of 950 post offices". If the RSA was concerned about long queues and waiting times for people applying for the national driver licence then I would have thought that access to 950 post offices would be a more accessible way for people to get their driving licences. As has been said by my colleague, the outsourcing of public services for profit is in the DNA of Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil. The same policy has been adopted by the Department of Social Protection, with the local employment service, LES, throughout the country and new contracts. I have read a paper on the matter, and it is very clear that private companies are literally licking their lips with the opening of the welfare market. Can one imagine? Public services being declared a welfare market and private companies are waiting to pounce on them. The motion continues also states, "a verified MyGovlD account, which requires a Public Services Card (PSC), is needed to avail of the online service despite a previous Data Protection Commission investigation into the legality of the PSC", which the Minister of State referred to in her response. Can passports or other forms of ID be used to avail of the online service? Not many people would oppose an online service once it is easy to use, accessible and there is an alternative walk-in service in terms of getting one's ID. The motion states that cash payments are not accepted. That is ridiculous. My next door neighbour does not have a bank card. She uses cash all of the time and she has a car and drives. Loads of people still make cash payments yet we have a move towards the whole of concept of card payments only because that suits the banks and the State. There is mention in the motion of insufficient staffing. The Minister of State indicated that there will be more training. I would have thought that staff to service the NDLS would have featured in the initial tender. I see that the contract will last up to 2023. I demand that the Minister put the contract for NDLS back out to tender in order that there will be greater facilitation of direct access, walk-ins, cash payments, etc.I am sure the tendering process always depends on what is sought and the requirements put into the tender. I call on the Minister of State to consider changing that tender process and to allow people to access it more directly.

Sinn Féin supports the motion, which raises some very important issues, particularly as they relate to inclusivity, State procurement and State priorities. Two weeks ago, in a response to a parliamentary question I tabled, and again today, the Minister has confirmed that the current NDLS contract, which was put in place with the front-office service provider in June 2021, no longer offers a walk-in service. Appointments must be booked to attend an NDLS centre and are made available through the online booking system or by telephone. The fact is that the current system is failing people. I will share with the House the experience of one constituent of mine who went to his local NDLS centre on 8 February. He arrived for an appointment only to realise that he had not received an email - he does not have email - or a text confirmation so had no appointment. The centre was empty, however, so he immediately rang 0818 919 090. He received no response. He dialled 1 - no response. He dialled 9 - no response. The official behind the desk told him he was wasting his time. He went home. He tried to reach the service on that number for 20 minutes on each of the next four days. He received no response. On day five he waited 101 minutes before his call was answered. To add insult to injury, this service has been outsourced to a private company with a limited footprint, 34 offices, at a time when this Government and that which preceded it have known full well that An Post and the Irish Postmasters Union are crying out for this type of contract to ensure their future viability. If they were before us today, they would say that they want more Government services and footfall, particularly any work that requires ID verification. They already do that work for the Department of Social Protection. In hundreds of post offices they already have ID verification equipment and systems and, at the drop of a hat, they could have such equipment in every single office if that was what was required. The truth, however, is that the post office network is hanging in the balance, and successive Governments have continued to turn their backs on the network. This is despite the fact that the 2016 Kerr report on the future of the post office network, on page 41, highlighted specifically that the provision of driver licences should be considered as part of an increase in the range of Government services available through the post office network. In March of last year, the Government set up an offline services group to identify suitable services based on the recommendations of the offline services report and to examine the feasibility of directing more Government business to post offices. We were told that this group, in conducting its work, was considering the increased use of the post office network for the delivery of Government services. On 7 July of last year, during a Dáil debate on the post office network, the Minister of State said: "The Government's objectives for An Post include harnessing the opportunities presented by e-commerce and the digital economy, capturing and retaining market share in parcels and delivering a sustainable nationwide post office network offering a range of e-commerce, financial and Government services." I stress the phrase "and Government services". What has come of all that? What Government services have been or will be transferred to An Post since these groups and objectives were identified? What has come of the Government's explorations and examinations? Following report after report, nothing has come of this from the perspective of An Post. There are comforting words from the Government but, when it comes to it, when there are clear options on the table, An Post loses out. There might be some small defence if the Government said it was delivering a better service at a cheaper rate, but the exact opposite is true in the case of the driver licence service. To add further insult to further injury, as for the online service, the Government looks set to throw good money after bad in defence of the PSC. That is what I expect the Government will do, as other Deputies have said, if it does not remove the PSC requirement. To be clear, the objective is to drive people online, and it is 100% mandatory to have a PSC to avail of services online. That is belligerence. The Government needs to act on this and remove that element.

The outsourcing of the issuing and renewal of driver licences has been a farce from the start. Hardly a week goes by without some form of complaint made to my office about the standard of the quality of the service provided by the NDLS. This has nothing to do with the staff members; it is a matter of understaffing, under-resourcing and pointless procedures. The Minister of State will be aware of the issues; they have already been outlined to her. All are by-products of outsourcing, and anyone watching this debate will be able to see that. Among the complaints are staff shortages, a lack of timely service, limited opening hours for centres and the need for a public services card to avail of the online service. Is it mandatory but not compulsory? Is it compulsory but not mandatory? Who knows? Other complaints are the non-acceptance of cash payments when, as has been outlined, there are still people who use cash only as well as the recent cessation of the walk-in service. The vast majority of these issues have at their root the outsourcing of the service, which has caused it to be run on a shoestring budget to ensure that the operating company can make as much profit as possible. As is ever the case, it is the public, in particular older people, who will suffer because of this. Receiving or renewing one's driver licence should be straightforward, simple and stress-free. Instead it has become complicated and very stressful for people. It has also become very complicated for professional drivers such as HGV drivers who wish to exchange a foreign driving licence for an Irish one. I have been told that some drivers who are qualified to work here are left in limbo for up the three months due to delays in issuing PPS numbers in the first instance and then delays in NDLS appointments, which compounds the issue. While the operating company of the NDLS may point to issues due to Covid, the reality is that the delays and difficulties existed pre Covid, as the Minister of State will be aware. There must be a way to resolve these difficulties. The NDLS operates 34 offices, some of them only part-time. By comparison, An Post has a network of over 950 post offices with decades of experience in dealing with customers and delivering Government services. There is no NDLS office in my constituency, but we do have plenty of post offices.

Not a week goes by without at least one person in my offices, be that in Mullingar, Longford or Athlone, at their wits' end over broadband not being able to access a decent connection. Yet again we see this drive, if the Acting Chairman will pardon the pun, towards being able to access services only online and this smoke-and-mirrors attitude to there being an in-person option when we know that, in reality, that does not exist. This disenfranchises and angers people because they feel victimised because of where they live. More concerningly, a point that has not been made is that it also makes this very difficult for people who struggle with literacy. This is a reflection of the for-profit model of outsourcing. The Government may wish to do away with walk-in services, and that may be applicable and acceptable in some areas, but the public purse pays for this service and, as such, it should suit the entirety of the public. To echo what my colleague, Deputy O'Rourke, has said, this is a real missed opportunity for the An Post network. We see this consistently throughout the NDLS. People are notifiable only by text or email. At present there are no weekend appointments in Mullingar or Athlone until 2 April. Longford fares a little better but not by much. Responses I received to parliamentary questions last week state that the driver test list in Longford now numbers 944. In Westmeath, the corresponding figure is 2,689. The Government appears to have conveniently forgotten the debacle surrounding the public services card. The public have not, nor have they forgotten the statement by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, at the time that it was not a mess despite costing €60 million. Obviously, the definition of a mess does not include costing a small fortune. At local level, the quality of political gymnastics by Government representatives is now truly an act to behold as they try to distance themselves from this Government decision. If this were an Olympic event, the Minister of State's Government colleagues would take gold.

Ó dúnadh é sin, bhí go leor de mhuintir Chonamara i dteagmháil liom mar gheall nach raibh siad in ann fáil ar sheirbhísí ceadúnais chomh héasca agus a bhíodh. Bíonn siad ag rá go bhfuil orthu dul isteach sa chathair, rud a thógann uair go leith. Dúirt bean amháin liom i ríomhphost go bhfuil timpeall 50 ríomhphost seolta aici chuig an NDLS le bliain anuas ag iarraidh an dáta ar a mbeidh an t-ionad NDLS a bhí i dTeach an Stáisiún ag athoscailt. Tuigeann sí go bhfuil ionad i nGaillimh ach tá sé uair go leith ó bhaile agus ceapann sí go bhfuil sé de cheart ag muintir Chonamara an tseirbhís a bhí á cur ar fáil dóibh sa Chlochán a fháil ar ais. In our constituency, the Clifden NDLS part-time centre has remained closed since the start of the pandemic. This makes it very difficult for people in Connemara to renew their driving licences. Many of our constituents have been badly affected by this. I raised the matter in June 2021 and was told by the RSA that everyone can now renew their driving licence using the online system. That is not always the case, however. In order to avail of the online system, a PSC is required. Not everyone has that, nor is it a requirement to have one. Moreover, a PSC cannot be requested by any public or private body or person not included as a specified body in Schedule 5 of the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. It is ridiculous that those in Connemara who are looking to get to an NDLS centre have to travel over an hour to Ballybrit to renew their driving licence. It is a major inconvenience. Although it was a part-time operation, the centre in Clifden was of massive benefit. It made it easier. We all know these administrative things can take a lot of time out of the day anyway. For those who are living in more rural, isolated areas it is essential to have a centre like the one in Clifden to make it easier for them to renew their licence rather than having to travel into the city.

It is nice to have a commonsense approach. It is the Irish way here to try to fix something that is not broken. It beggars belief that we could have a private company doing this because 99% of the time privatisation equals profit; it is not about providing proper service. As previous speakers have mentioned, there are 950 post offices in the country. It beggars belief that we are in here talking about this and trying to reverse something that could possibly have grown better. The PSC was also mentioned. In the last Dáil term I had a good few arguments with the then Minister, Senator Regina Doherty on this. I could see it was going to cause problems. I cannot figure out why they cannot simplify it. We all have a PPS number that is registered to the database. That should be good enough. We are having similar issues with medical cards at the moment but that is a different situation.  I welcome the motion's common-sense approach to going back to the way we used to do it, which worked. People forget that those with disabilities struggle even more to access these services. One-to-one interaction makes a difference as does walking in to a service where we can actually deal with a real human being. Other speakers have also said that this is public money. It beggars belief how we can privatise a system. It seems to be just systemic for successive Governments to take everything away, privatise it and come back in a few years scratching their heads and wondering why it has gone so wrong. We should be investing in our own people and our own services. It is madness that the centres cannot take cash. They are making it so difficult for people. Others mentioned online services. How many debates have we had here about broadband? Some people are not computer literate. Someone might have the old provisional licence, might have been working on a farm the past 40 years and might never have turned on a computer. How are they going to manage? It is ludicrous that we have private companies running this when we have a national post office network that is crying out for public services and that should be supported.

It is a really important service. Various issues with the issuing and renewing of permits and driving licences have had a severe impact on the lives of workers and their families over the past two years. We heard from numerous front-line workers about the difficulties they faced in renewing their driving licences and the impact on their work. It is disappointing that the NDLS no longer offers a walk-in service and that it refuses to accept cash payments. On the PSC, it sounds in theory like people will not need one but in practice they do need it. This is in spite of a previous investigation by the Data Protection Commission which found there is no lawful basis for this requirement. The whole process is a prime example of the downgrading of public services due to Government services being privatised. An Post operates a network of some 950 post offices around the State. It is a devastating indictment of the Government's view of An Post that it will not engage with or involve the postal service in this process. The awarding of this contract to the Swiss company, SGS, reflects a missed opportunity to use the post office network and bring the NDLS into every community, ensuring ease of access to all. Removing the walk-in and cash services shows the level of disconnect between the Government and ordinary people. There are many people who need that bit of extra assistance, including the elderly and those from minority backgrounds. Many of those people might not have a PSC. They may have literacy barriers. Sinn Féin has previously called for the PSC to be scrapped following the report from the UN on the disproportionate impact it has on marginalised communities. I welcome and support the motion because it highlights the serious issues currently with the NDLS.

It is a very appropriate time for it given the end of Covid restrictions which can no longer be used as an excuse for providing such a poor service to so many people. Deputy O'Rourke's example has really shown how poor that service is. Constituents are desperately getting in touch with all our offices to try to get a licence sorted out for work or some other important reason. We oppose the privatisation of public services. This is clearly a service that has profit as its only goal. Fine Gael, along with some in various Departments, is slowly but surely dismantling our public services. "Commissioning" is a buzzword for the delivery of many health and social services. What commissioning really means is the provision of private services. Many are not-for-profit now but we know from the experience of local employment services that this can change very quickly. If we are serious about the post office network, the provision of driving licences would help secure many post offices, particularly those in rural areas. In a world where we are being told we have never been as connected, people engaging with people seems to be anathema to the bean counters and the profiteers. Many are deeply concerned at the creeping of the PSC into areas that make no sense whatsoever. The Government should be honest with people and put it out there in its manifesto for a national identity card. It should put the matter to the people and ask if they want to be forced to provide their private details to a private company. I was doing a bit of research on this. The Minister of State, Deputy Fleming, previously stated that he believed the card was an attempt to introduce a national ID card and that the Department had offered pathetic excuses for the measure while trying to expand it dishonestly through the back door. I hope he and his colleagues still stand by those words.

It is the second Wednesday morning Private Member's motion in a row which makes eminent sense and is speaking to a real need felt by thousands of people who have been going through heartache in renewing their driving licences.The Minister of State, Deputy Hildegarde Naughton, has left and the Minister of State, Deputy Browne, has joined us. The Government has said it is not opposing this motion. What does that actually mean? Will we see any changes called for in this motion, which has the support of this side of the House, implemented, specifically regarding the offices accepting cash, which they should, and the use of the PSC, which is not and should not be required in this situation? Since the pandemic, the new operation of the NDLS has resulted in a reduction in the level and quality of service received by users and the NDLS no longer provides users with a walk-in service. We all accepted that certain services were going to be impacted by Covid and that it would take a while for certain services to return to a level of normality or catch up on backlogs. Passports being one with which we have all dealt in the past number of months. There has been a point of real crisis here but the passport service does seem to be getting back to some level of normality and turning things around in a relatively quick manner - touch wood. What is different about the NDLS is that it is not even trying to get back to normal. It has used Covid as an opportunity to copper-fasten an entire change in how it operates. This is not trying to get back to a face-to-face, proper public service. As Deputy McNamara said, this is no longer a public service. It is operated by a private operator, SGS, but it is not operated according to public need. It is operated for profit and the public is having to jump through needless hoops, which is having a real impact not just on waiting lists and call-backs. It is having an impact on people starting new jobs because they need driving licences and they cannot get them because they need a PSC, which is ridiculous, and cannot get appointments to obtain the latter. We all deal with constituents. I spent just under four weeks trying to get somebody over the line with the NDLS because of the PSC obstacle. It is fundamental. People say "Don't bring ideology into this, don't bring ideology into that" but this is the outworking of a right-wing ideology played out in terms of a public service. We talk about the time when people could go into their local authority and renew their licences. Maybe that was not the best model but it was a model whereby people were face to face and knew where they could go, and it actually worked. We have replaced something that worked with something that is not working. It may be working for SGS and the Department as it does not have to actually manage the delivery of this and does not have any real responsibility for it - like everything. I cannot wait for the reply we will get to a parliamentary question soon telling us that this is a service matter for SGS and that if it does not reply within ten days, to get back to the Minister because that is what we get with HSE inquiries and an awful lot of financial inquiries when they relate to banks - banks we own. Regarding moving everything to phone services, look at what happened with the banks. Look at what the Central Bank found regarding banking services. It crucified all our banks for offering deplorable customer service over the phone. This is a quality-of-life issue for many people. Regarding the days of having to do your household messages, going down to the village and nipping into the post office, the bank, shops or the building society, that actually worked for people all over the country. Our 950-branch post office network is crying out for business, is trusted by the people and is skilled in the provision of public services and here we have instead part-time offices scattered all over the country in some population centres instead of in every community and not accepting cash and walk-in appointments. It is turning into a pathetic service for something that is vital. A driving licence is vital for work, caring, families and commuting. It is a statutory document to which we are entitled It is a rite of passage for many - driving lessons, getting a provisional licence and moving on to do a full test. It is a rite of passage, a right and a need and the State is failing. This is a succinct and to-the-point motion that speaks to a real deficiency in what the Government is doing in this area. If the Government is not going to implement the asks in the motion, it may as well vote against it because otherwise when it does this as a Government, it is just being dishonest. I commend the Independent group on this motion and look forward to the rest of the debate.

We have been debating the use of the PSC in this House for years. We have been arguing about when it can be used, how it can be used and what kind of data it can contain. I again make the same point I have made repeatedly over the past number of years. If the Government wants a national identification card, it should admit it, produce legislation, get legal advice, come into this Chamber and let us debate it, but it should not do it by stealth, which is exactly what is happening at the moment. If anyone wants to access public services online, in so many cases, the PSC appears to be required. Of course, this is not legal in most cases. Last December, the Data Protection Commissioner agreed that the PSC could be used as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services provided that an alternative service channel is available. Of course that spirit of that ruling obviously means that service users should be given the freedom of choice and that in-person services should be freely available without the need for a PSC. The Department of Transport's decision to close down walk-in services for the NDLS is completely against the spirit of that ruling. Let us be honest: it was done in order to drive people to the online service by reducing the quality of in-person services and consequently nudging people into getting a PSC. Then it is lauded and the Government says "Oh so many people have got it; it is really successful." This is because people are given no choice. The Government cannot keep throwing up obstacles and reducing the standard of in-person services while claiming that there are genuine alternatives to those provided online. When I checked the NDLS website yesterday, the next available appointment in Kildare outside of the nine-to five work day was 26 March. A total of 222,000 people live in Kildare. Its population surpassed that of Limerick city and county in the census before last so it is a very large county. The NDLS centre is in an industrial estate in Naas and there is no public transport to it so it is not as if it is particularly convenient. However, there is essentially a purpose in driving people to get access services online because it is made less accessible. Consider first time drivers, who have to get a fully licensed driver to drive them to these centres because no public transport is available. The reality is that the future generations of drivers and public service users will be pushed towards the PSC with little alternative. Not everyone has access to a computer or a bank account. Currently, all driving licence services, either in-person or online, do not accept cash. Bank accounts obviously are not available to everyone in society. I refer primarily to those who do not have a fixed address. Many people for reasons of their own do not have bank accounts. We have a habit sometimes of thinking that we are constantly playing catch-up with other countries when it comes to technology and rushing forward but in reality, anyone who visits other countries can see that we are often quite advanced when it comes to introducing technological advancements. This is positive but it cannot be abused.The reality of a society that has rapidly become more online is that people are being left behind. They are the people who always get the short end of the stick, such as migrants, for example, and, in particular, older people, who are provided with driving licences of a shorter duration and need to renew them more often. Welcome legislation was brought in by the Department of Transport recently to allow asylum seekers access to driving licences. That move will provide an incredible amount of freedom and independence to people who we in this country have treated very poorly through the years. The measure introduced was that temporary residency permits will be accepted as proof of normal residency. Can asylum seekers access the online services or are they required to obtain in-person appointments? There was never any legal underpinning for the public services card, PSC. It has been an absolute disaster in that respect from the onset. There are serious concerns regarding how it has been imposed on citizens and the range of data embedded in the card. The two successive Governments responsible simply have not been up front about any of it. The previous Minister for Employment Affairs and Social Protection, Senator Regina Doherty, insisted on multiple occasions that the Department did not hold biometric data, but it does. The Department has since admitted it was using biometric data on the PSC to identify cases of welfare fraud. There is a national database of facial recognition data and that database has no safeguards written in law. There is no legislation and no clear legal basis for it. Decisions of the Data Protection Commission on the PSC are still pending. There is an investigation into the use of biometric data, as well as a mass complaint mandated to Digital Rights Ireland by hundreds of citizens about the illegality of the use of the card by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. It is genuinely incredible that the Government is still pushing forward with the PSC in the exact same manner it has always done despite seemingly falling at every single legal hurdle it encounters. When it comes to these databases, it is important for everyone to realise it is not just the Irish State that has access to them. Under the Prüm II law, the Council of the European Union is discussing plans to add driving licence data to an EU network of police facial recognition systems. Will the Government be supporting this measure? If it intends to do so, it is saying that a person who owns a car, needs to drive or has a driving licence must submit a photo and information that could be used for that kind of purpose. People need to know that. We know very little about these systems. We do not know what impact they will have on privacy and civil liberties. We do not know how they address accuracy problems or how they will impact on ethnic minorities, for example. This is the essence of turning citizens into customers. We have been talking about this since 2011. It is just another erosion of a public service and we really need to have an alternative. We cannot allow the PSC to be used as an identity card by stealth.

The new contract is in place but the problem is that walk-in services are now not available. I live in Galway East, a rural constituency. Some of the people I represent do not have a smartphone or a credit card and may not have broadband, which is very relevant. They may not have any of the tools they need to do their business online. This is the kernel of the matter. As we fast-track ourselves into the digital age, we are doing something very wrong: we are beginning to leave people behind. It is a significant trauma in the lives of people who may not be computer literate to have to try to figure out a way through the morass of systems they have to use. We have to recalibrate how we are actually preparing society for the digital age. The digital age is taking over but it will not take over everybody if it is going to leave people behind. We need to ensure services are available to people on a walk-in basis and that public services are available to people who wish to pay cash. All of that needs to be recalibrated. There is no point saying this is a workable and more efficient system and whatever else because that is not what people are finding. I have come across an issue that I am sure other rural Deputies have heard about. To go to a GAA match, one now has to download one's ticket onto a smartphone. There is no cash being taken at the gate and there is no way of scanning the ticket one has; one has to have it on one's phone. There are many followers of Gaelic games. It is time for the GAA to consider this and make sure these people are also facilitated. It is one thing for me to criticise what has been done, but the question is how we can rectify this and put systems in place that actually deal with people and provide them with a public service. It has been stated previously that there are 940 post offices in the countrywide network. The Government has not yet engaged to fully provide a system for the delivery of offline services. An Post has the mechanism, wherewithal and network to do that but it is not being done for reasons I keep hearing about which relate to procurement and making sure everything is right. It is time to recalibrate and decide to get things right for people rather than for systems, rules and regulations that are brought in but are unworkable. I go back to the basic point that we need to ensure we are putting people first, not systems. I acknowledge that any time I contacted the RSA in the past two years on any issue relating to driving licences, it was able to help me in a prompt fashion. I want to put that on record.

It allows us to ask the Minister to account for what I believe is an underhand and discriminatory reduction in the services of the NDLS. Decisions made in the context of Covid-19 were supposed to be temporary measures, supposedly made in the public interest to protect customers and staff in a variety of State bodies. It is an abuse of the Covid-19 measures for the NDLS to fail to return to the level of service that existed prior to Covid. It is also an underhand way of discriminating against those who find online literacy difficult. Many of us can put our hand in our pocket, whip out a phone and do almost anything we want, but there are a significant number of people who are unable to perform these tasks. To add insult to injury, in adopting its online-only policy for services, the NDLS is insisting that people use a public services card, as has been mentioned many times today. There are three main problems with this. First, a vast number of people do not have sufficient Internet service to operate any website. Second, a large number of people do not have a public services card. As for the third problem, I will quote directly from an agreement between the Department and the Data Protection Commission in respect of the use of public services cards other than by the Department of Social Protection.The Agreement acknowledges that other public bodies listed in social welfare legislation (“specified bodies”) may use the PSC as a means of verifying the identity of the people they deal with, provided that they also accept other methods of authenticating identity. The Agreement also acknowledges and accepts that the Department and other specified bodies can continue to use MyGovID as the sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services, provided that an alternative service channel is made available.It is very clear that requiring the use of the public services card or a MyGovID account clearly goes against this agreement and goes against the legal judgment made in 2019. Despite this, if I go to the NDLS website to apply online for a licence, the only option outlined involves the use of a public services card. To quote directly from the NDLS website:Applying online is a simple, straightforward process, no need to book an appointment or attend an NDLS centre. Save time and do it the smart way. Apply Online today.All you need is your Public Services Card and your verified MyGovID for safe, secure access to your online application.Already have a verified MyGovID account? Apply NowIf you haven’t got a verified MyGovID account but have a Public Services Card? You’re almost there. You can set up your verified MyGovID account using your public services card at www.mygovid.ie.Don’t yet have a Public Services Card? You can book a Public Service Card (PSC) appointment by phoning your local Intreo office. Unfortunately, due to COVID-19 pandemic online PSC appointments are not available at www.mywelfare.ie. There is no alternative option mentioned and it seems that Covid is still being used as an excuse for online PSC appointments not being available, which makes very little sense with regard to the conversation we are having today. The whole situation is a mess. It has been badly handled and badly communicated and bad decisions have been made. Many citizens do not have debit cards. This is just another impediment the Department is responsible for. With this in mind, I hope the Minister of State will outline for us today the answer to the following questions. Who was responsible for making this decision to curtail in-person services? Who was consulted before the decision was made? What assessments were made about the impact of this decision on those with poor digital literacy or poor access to the necessary equipment or Internet services? Why have the NDLS and the Department of Transport broken the agreement with the Data Protection Commission by requiring the use of a public services card? I concur with all of the speakers and I want to point out that when it comes to the NDLS engaging with the RSA on identifying compatible licences of foreign nationals it is a very slow process. Many people who come here with work permits spend as long as six to nine months trying to get their licence verified so they may undertake the work they are here on a permit to take up. This is something that has to be addressed. It may not be the Department of the Minister of State but it certainly involves both agencies mentioned, namely, the NDLS and the RSA. It is an impediment to how we get on and progress as a country.

The Government and agencies with which people must interact are going out of their way to make life more difficult than it needs to be. There seems to be no sense of pragmatism or common sense at times. Where is the common sense in the NDLS? Ever since it was rolled out in 2013 it has been beset with difficulties. The new requirement for a public services card before being able to access the NDLS is ridiculous. It needs to be looked at urgently. As I understand it, the Data Protection Commission ruled after a two year investigation that the card is illegal in terms of being required to access public services other than those of the Department of Social Protection. The Data Protection Commission has also ruled the State must destroy the 3.2 million personal records held on cardholders. Yet here we are with the NDLS overruling the Data Protection Commission. What is really going on? In this respect the NDLS has acted without any apparent regard for the difficulties its decisions will create for thousands of motorists and those wishing to access an updated licence. I wholeheartedly agree with the call in the motion to set up an open competitive tendering process in accordance with national and European Union procurement rules to provide a walk-in service at multiple centres throughout the State. I also agree the NDLS must allow cash payments to be accepted. It is absurd this is not the case already. The motion refers to insufficient staffing that has led to further problems. This needs to be looked at. It is not good enough that people are trying to get through by telephone. It is just not happening and there are serious delays. This is an issue many of my constituents have raised with me. I would appreciate if these concerns can be addressed.

The fact that local NDLS centres are not accessible to many people who need to get a licence if they do not have a public services card is nothing short of our joke. Many Deputies have said the same thing. If it was not broken, why fix it? The Government has a habit of doing such things. It tampers with something that is good and that delivers and ends up making a mess of it. It was the same with the reverse last night by the Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael and the Green Party Government on early intervention units. It had removed funding for the unit in Kilbrittain. It reversed the decision last night after I had raised it three times in the Dáil. This is embarrassing. The same goes for people trying to obtain licences. Many Deputies have rightly asked why post offices cannot be used for people to get their driving licences. It is easy to know why. The Government's agenda is to get rid of post offices by starving them of work and giving them no chance to keep their doors open. Vehicle licensing in this country needs a complete overhaul. Look at people who come back to this country and have to sit a theory test and a driving test. It is a farce beyond belief. One man told me he could drive through New York one week but cannot drive through Goleen when he comes to Ireland the following week. The wait of months that many Irish drivers have had to endure over the past two years ahead of a driving test looks likely to continue for quite some time. During the height of the pandemic driving lessons and testing services were put hold. As a result, Ireland's driving licence backlog reached astronomical heights. Although everything has been done to clear waiting lists it will be quite some time before normal timing resumes. The RSA states that at this point, having hired testers and with restrictions easing, 60 centres throughout the country have reduced their waiting times down to the ten-week mark. However, other centres still have a backlog of between 12 and 18 weeks. This is not for the physical test alone.

It is a scandal to God that a walk-in service is no longer offered to renew licences in Tralee. People must book an appointment online. People who do not use the Internet have long waits to get through on the phone line to make an appointment. This is something I have to say. To get these people on the phone is absolutely impossible. To those who have phones but will not answer them and will not ring back I say throw them away. These people should be got rid of because they are useless. If I do not answer my phone today or if I do not ring someone back I can expect I will not be in my place after the next election. I will answer my phone and that is what people are supposed to do. It takes forever to get a theory test or a driving test. The RSA will not answer. Old people cannot go over to the office. We are practically the smallest country in the world and we do not have a system whereby we can renew driving licences. People need to have a public services card. This was found to be illegal. Why is the Government allowing this to continue? Is it in power? Applying online is simply not an option for many people, particularly elderly people or those not used to the Internet. There are no drivers for buses, lorries or any other work vehicles. People cannot get licences to go on the road legally. I ask the Government to do something before the country grinds completely to a halt. It is not fair on workers. It is not fair on ordinary people, old people or young people who cannot get a driving licence when they need it.

It is ridiculous to think that at the start of the pandemic there was a six-week waiting list. During the worst of the pandemic it increased to six months. Now we are back to approximately ten weeks. This is a ridiculous length of time for people who desperately need to get their licence and to get on the road. At present 104,398 learners are waiting to take the driving test.The system we had in the county I represent, County Kerry, was absolutely perfect. You could visit the office, take a ticket and queue to be dealt with by a person. It was a perfect system that we were very happy with. You had to wait but you were quite willing and glad to do so because you knew you would be served. The current system is unworkable, unfriendly and unfair to the person who is important, namely, the customer or person waiting for the service. Unfortunately, in all departments there seems to be a massive desire to disconnect from the people. They do not want to engage on a telephone or the Internet; they do not want to engage at all. They definitely do not want to meet a person face to face. I have news: offices and businesses are open, and hiding behind the pandemic will not be accepted by the public anymore. When people want a service, whether it concerns a driving licence, medical card or the processing of an application for a grant, they want to deal with staff on a personal basis. I thank the staff who work in the service in Kerry. I am aware that they are working under pressure. It is the system that is wrong, not the individuals. I am not going to be critical of the individuals working in County Kerry because, regardless of whether they are in the housing or planning department of Kerry County Council or any other section, they are good. So, too, are the others but we need a better service for our customers.

We are just dehumanising people. That is what is going on under the Government. I have been up here for 14 years now and note that is the case in respect of everything we have done. When the NDLS was first established, I could not believe that three private companies would have a part to play before a driver got a licence. One of them could not get the materials to make the licences and there were delays as a consequence. It is a shambles. I thank the county council staff who help people above and beyond the call of duty. At the time when you could take a ticket and queue, at least you saw movement and people’s smiling faces. You did not have to ring up and get no answers. The people in the offices are under pressure. We decommissioned the IRA. We have the RSA and the NRA, which is now TII. These are unelected, unaccountable quangos that the Government has set up. They are like mushrooms, growing and expanding, and they have no respect for the public interest or this House. All those concerned want is a big office with a brass plate on the door. There are chief executives, chairmen and everything else, including a board, of course. It is all a matter of jobs for the boys and saying to hell with daoine na tíre, especially the people of rural Ireland. What if a person does not have broadband? Many of us do not. What if a person cannot use broadband? People are dehumanised in these circumstances. It is making life hell for them. I do not know how we get multinationals into this country because their staff, when they come here from all over the world, cannot drive here. They have to do a theory test. What an ungracious insult to people who can drive in Manhattan and all over the world. I thank Geraldine in my office, who deals with this. I thank the voluntary organisation in Clonmel that helps young people with learning difficulties to do the theory test. All these tests did not exist when we were applying for licences; they are in place now. Mol an óige agus tiocfaidh sí. We are not praising the young; we are denying them. We are killing our elderly population and allowing them to perish. Bus drivers cannot be got. People over 70 are not allowed to drive school buses. They can drive private buses to matches but cannot drive to school. We are crying out for drivers. Now we are told the unfortunate drivers coming here from the war will not be allowed to drive in Ireland. They can drive in every other European country. What is wrong with this little quango Republic? It is shameful.

It is not acceptable that service provision is not up to standard. I have been assured by the RSA that the additional training by the service provider, to be completed this week, will improve the service provided to the public. During the tender process, it was not intended that the new contract would have a mandatory non-appointment option. Experience has shown that managing a non-appointment service was difficult. Each office was staffed to take a certain amount of activity but, where a non-appointment service was permitted, there were peaks and troughs during the day, with early mornings and lunchtimes putting the offices under pressure. This generated complaints from members of the public due to the waiting times and delays. The RSA was aware that over the lifetime of the contract, there would be a service with increasingly fewer customers because of the increased uptake of the online option. To make an attractive offering to the market, it was important to pitch the service in a way that would attract several bidders and ensure value for money. The ability of companies to manage and adapt staffing requirements was an important element of this. Accessing the online service to apply for a driving licence or learner permit requires a verified mygov.ie account to validate identity. This is consistent with Government policy. A public services card is not mandatory. It is not needed to book an appointment at an NDLS office. Other documents, such as a passport, are accepted to verify identity in person. Under the terms of the agreement between the Department of Social Protection and the Data Protection Commission, it was acknowledged and accepted that the Department and other specified bodies, such as the RSA, could continue to use mygov.ie as a sole means of authenticating identity for the purpose of accessing online services provided that an alternative service channel was available.

For many people, including those with poor or no broadband, those who want to use cash and those who expect the State to provide a quality public service for the issuing of driving licenses, the service is not fit for purpose. Covid-19 saw the temporary cessation of walk-in services for driving licence applications. Now most public offices have reopened and services are returning to normal as much as possible. We are all learning to live with Covid. Why is the NDLS not learning to live with it? We cannot stand over the diminution of the service under the pretext that Covid is somehow responsible. What we are considering here is the wider issue of the privatisation of services, on foot of which the quality of service is not factored in and the lowest bidder that can provide the most basic service is the one that is chosen. Time and again, I have heard about the EU public procurement directive. Two things need to be said about it. First, it gives member states the opportunity to include social clauses, but that is up to their governments. Second, and most crucially, who in the Department or RSA is responsible for writing the tender specifications? That is what matters. That is why I expect that An Post was not awarded the tender. I do not know the details but believe that if a requirement for a network of 75 officers were stipulated, perhaps with two per county and a few extra in the larger counties, An Post would then be in a much better position to tender for the contract. That would have helped to sustain the network. I understand a procurement process must be open and fair, but it must be drafted to ensure a quality service. When a local post office is closing, every Government Deputy and councillor goes to the public meeting calling for a reversal of the decision; yet, because the Government outsources the process to the RSA, which outsources it to a private company, the Government representatives and the rest of us are wasting our time. The Government and RSA hide behind public procurement regulations. If there were a proactive Government policy to ensure the sustainability of the An Post network, the tender documents would be written in a way that would ensure a quality walk-in service for Irish drivers. Then, at least, An Post would be on a level playing field when applying. The Minister is not present, which I am sorry about, but I listened carefully to her when she spoke about the public services card. She said a public services card is not necessary to make an appointment, and she is right. Before I came into the Chamber, I looked at the NDLS website and checked out exactly what it states.It states:Applying online is a simple, straightforward process...All you need is your Public Services Card and your verified MyGovID for safe, secure access to your online application.Already have a verified MyGovID account? Apply Now.If you haven’t got a verified MyGovID account but have a Public Services Card? You’re almost there. You can set up your verified MyGovID account using your public services card at www.mygovid.ie.Then comes the final kicker:Don’t yet have a Public Services Card? You can book a Public Service Card (PSC) appointment by phoning your local Intreo office. I wish the Minister were here because this is a three-card trick. Who decided that a public services card was needed to apply online? Was it the Swiss company providing the service? Was it written into the tender documents? Was it the RSA? Was it the Government? This is a simple question and I would appreciate an answer.

I thank all my colleagues in the Independent Group and all the Opposition Members, including Deputy O'Rourke, for their support. I also thank the Government for accepting the motion. I note that no Government backbenchers are speaking in the debate, which I take to indicate that they also accept the necessity for the motion. I want to be clear on what the motion calls for. It calls for the Government to instruct the RSA to set up an open tendering process for a walk-in service. The move to tender only for an appointment service was explained by the Minister of State in her statement. She said:The procurement process for the new contract began in January 2020. It was not intended that the new contract, which took effect in June 2021, would offer a non-appointment option. This decision was made based on experience with the previous contract that managing a non-appointment element was difficult.Therefore, a procurement process had begun and the goalposts shifted as a result of the consultation between the RSA, which was going to provide the contract, and a company which had previously provided it. That sounds very strange to me, especially given that one of the companies seeking to obtain the tender, An Post, was in a position to provide a walk-in service throughout the State. While it is no longer in every village, still every town in the country has a post office. That is really strange chicanery to occur in the middle of a pandemic. I am not saying that the tender is invalid or anything but it is a really unusual admission, almost as unusual as the admission the Minister made last Thursday week to me that this contract had been provided on a walk-in basis only. That came as news to me and to most people in this House. The motion also states that we should ensure that all NDLS offices accept cash payments. That was repeatedly emphasised by my colleague Deputy Fitzmaurice. During this, we were actually discussing whether it is legal to refuse cash. I am afraid I do not know, but the Central Bank's website states it is legal tender. Businesses such as shops and restaurants cannot refuse cash unless both they and the customer have already agreed on another way of paying. People who walk into an NDLS office have not agreed on another way to pay. A constituent of mine walked in to an NDLS office, did everything right, went to pay and was told it would not take cash. He rang his wife who gave him details of a bank card. He was told that because she was not there, it could not accept that either. He then had to go and make another appointment through this farcical system of making appointments in order to get a driving licence. It has been made inordinately difficult to get a driving licence. Does the Government envisage the day when someone will be required to make an appointment online or by telephone in order to buy a stamp? I fear that this is the thin end of the wedge. Not much was wrong with the system whereby people went to the local authority office to renew a driving licence in the same way that they renewed their motor tax. Of course, people can also renew motor tax online and many people do, which is a good thing. However, someone renewing motor tax does not require a public services card. I accept, as the Minister of State said, that the RSA is specified body for the use of a public services card under the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. However, the RSA contracts out all its services. Is the company that it contracts out to, which is effectively the company with which people are interacting online when renewing a driver licence, a specified body? If it is not, the entirely unlawful use of State data is being facilitated by this regime. Deputy Harkin said that everything is now contracted out and an obvious question follows from that. I welcome that the Government is accepting the motion, but I hope it will act on it. Deputy Verona Murphy among others raised the delay in getting a foreign driving licence recognised with people waiting eight to nine months. Of course, Ukraine is not a country whose driving licences we recognise. I have no problem with people from Ukraine or any other country having to do a theory test and a practical test if they come from a country whose driving licence we do not recognise; we need to be sure that people can drive if they say they can drive. However, not alone will they have to do that, but they will have to do all the driving lessons over 12 months and I certainly have a problem with that. I have no doubt that Ukrainian refugees will arrive here and some of them will hold driving licences. I have no doubt that the State does not recognise those driving licences. I have no problem with any of that. However, it will take them years to get a driving licence here and that will affect their employment prospects. The same is true of people who come from any state of the United States of America, some provinces of Canada and many other states. Nobody could possibly have a problem with requiring people to show they can drive and understand the rules of the road. However, it is inexplicable that they are required to do all the driving lessons and tests that somebody who cannot drive must do. I raised that point with the Minister of State, Deputy Naughton, at the start of this debate. I recognise that it is not mentioned in the motion, but it needs to be addressed and I hope the Government will come back to us on that. I greatly appreciate the support from all colleagues across the Opposition and the fact that the Government accepts the motion. However, I question what accepting it actually means. The motion requests that a new tender process be set up for a walk-in service, that cash be accepted in NDLS offices and that the requirement for online applicants to provide a public services card be discontinued in circumstances where that service is contracted out by the RSA. People are not providing their public services card to the RSA, but are providing it to a private company that may not be covered by the Social Welfare Consolidation Act. I would welcome clarification on that point.

We have seen the bewildered faces of children and civilian populations fleeing for their safety and lives, spending night after night huddled in air raid shelters in scenes that we never dreamed we would live to witness on our Continent again. Our thoughts are with the people of Ukraine - those who have fled and those who have travelled to Ukraine, including from Ireland. We have heard their harrowing testimonies. Ní féidir le héinne a bhfuil a meas aige nó aici ar an tsaoirse agus ar an bhféinchinneadh ach breathnú le huafás ar ghníomhartha na Rúise. Seasaimid leis an Úcráin agus tugaimid ár dtacaíocht di arís. The ongoing violation of Ukrainian sovereignty and Ukraine's internationally recognised borders is an affront to the principles that we hold dear as members of the international community. I wish to take this opportunity to commend the work of Irish diplomatic staff and NGO personnel who are on the ground in Ukraine and elsewhere in eastern Europe carrying out very important work assisting those caught up in this nightmarish conflict and distributing humanitarian support and aid. This is vital work. I equally commend everyone engaged in collecting aid in Ireland to assist the humanitarian response. The Taoiseach has set out the initial contribution of the Irish Government to the humanitarian effort. We all agree that this is a time when we need to stretch ourselves. Will the Taoiseach set out what else the Government proposes to do and how Ireland might step up our efforts and supports for these humanitarian endeavours? Later this afternoon, I will meet the Ukrainian ambassador to assure her of our continued support and our unwavering commitment to seeing peace in her homeland. I welcome the overwhelming support of the European Parliament yesterday for a resolution condemning Russia's actions. I hope that, in the Dáil this evening, we will equally support the motion before us on a cross-party basis. Our diplomatic response to Russia's actions must be firm, sure-footed and consistent. Our objective is to end the war and we need to play our full part in that. Our military neutrality, our history of conflict resolution and our seat on the UN Security Council mean that we are strongly placed to advance these efforts for a peaceful pathway forwards. Diplomacy must prevail. Every diplomatic avenue must be used to end the war. All diplomatic leverage must be employed. It is clear that the actions of Russia in Ukraine are abhorrent. To that end, I wish to ask about the expulsion of the Russian ambassador to Ireland. Thus far, this is an action that the Government has not taken. It has advanced the case of working in concert with our European partners. I happen to believe that now is the time for our Government and the Taoiseach as Head of Government to take the lead on this issue. Has he raised this matter with his fellow EU leaders? Has he put a proposal to them? Does he agree that it is now time to pursue this course of action?

Is uafásach an scéal é gan amhras. Is ionsaí mídhleathach gan réasún atá faoi chaibidil ag an Rúis. Is olc an scéal ar fad é agus tá muintir na tíre seo go hiomlán i gcoinne an ionsaithe seo. We are less than a week into this horrific war against the Ukrainian people and I think President Putin has not achieved the rapid victory over them that he anticipated. More importantly, what is very clear from the resistance of the Ukrainian people is "how dare they value their freedom, their sovereignty, their territorial integrity?" There is not a scintilla of evidence that there is any response from Ukrainian citizens that embraces the Russian invasion as President Putin would have advocated with his troops and so forth. The courage and resilience of the Ukrainian people is resonating across the globe. I spoke last evening to the Ukrainian Prime Minister, Mr. Denys Shmyhal. He thanked Ireland for our support - our political support, our economic support, our humanitarian support - along with our European Union colleagues. He said that the situation was extremely difficult on the ground in terms of the indiscriminate killing of children and women. It is shocking what is going on with the levelling of cities. It is very clear now that President Putin is moving into a new phase where we are witnessing extreme forms of barbarity in terms of barbaric attacks on cities and civilian targets and in levelling cities. It is quite horrific and an extraordinary trauma is now being visited upon the people of Ukraine, and we have to do everything we possibly can to support them. For example, cluster munitions - this is something that we as a country took a leading role in by creating an international treaty to ban the use of cluster munitions in conflicts - are being used in Ukraine. It is estimated that approximately 700,000 people have already left Ukraine and the numbers could grow dramatically and very significantly. We should expect those numbers to increase. That will create huge challenges across the European Continent because the repercussions of this war, which is being waged by Putin, are going to be felt across the length and breadth of our Continent. The human trauma will be enormous. I am working on the basis that that trauma will be on a scale that we have never experienced before. We as a country now have to get our heads around that and start preparing the humanitarian responses that will potentially be required to deal with the scale of migration caused by the war itself, but I think that the Irish people will do the right thing. We will not be found wanting in relation to our humanitarian response. In relation to diplomacy, we are absolutely working with our European Union colleagues in respect of that, and first of all in terms of seeking a peaceful resolution of the issues. To be fair to all the European leaders, particularly the French Presidency, Emmanuel Macron did everything he possibly could to avert this war, and Chancellor Scholz likewise. I met Chancellor Scholz last week in respect of his engagements with President Putin and his endeavours to resolve this. In terms of diplomatic channels and expulsions, that is the easy bit. It is our view that, across Europe, we work in concert with our European Union colleagues. I have been absolutely passionate about this, in that our unity is our strength. It is easy to say "I will lead ahead of others." I actually think that the most effective route-----

The European Union, working together as a unified body with the United States and Canada, packs a powerful punch. We have seen that in terms of the sanctions that have been agreed. We were very clear at the EU Council meeting - we wanted the widest set of sanctions. We want to protect Irish citizens and we want to maintain diplomatic channels to protect Irish citizens in Ukraine, in Russia and elsewhere. It is important that we bear that in mind before taking precipitative action on the expulsions front. That could be done in a day; it is very easy, but the repercussions could be much longer felt by Irish citizens. That is the challenge.

No one underestimates for a moment the barbarity of Vladimir Putin's regime and the illegality of this invasion of Ukraine. Neither should any of us doubt the absolute necessity to reassert the primacy of international law, rules-based international relationships and, above all else, the need to restore good order, a full withdrawal of Russian troopers and peace such that this war ends.It is in that spirit I invite the Taoiseach as Head of the Irish Government to lead again, to lead together with our partners in Europe and to leverage this crucial diplomatic tool. It is essential as shells rain down on Kyiv and people flee for their lives that we demonstrate in every way to the Russian Federation that Ireland means business and that we will not offer any shelter, any excuse or any cover in any form to them.
 In that spirit, I again invite the Taoiseach to lead our European partners in this endeavour. As regards keeping diplomatic channels open, and that is a legitimate point the Taoiseach made, there are ways in which that can be achieved such as, for example, the appointment of a chargé d'affaires to ensure that our citizens in Russia or elsewhere are catered for. I invite the Taoiseach not to break ranks with Europe but to lead on this matter.

We have expelled diplomats in the past. The Deputy did not find favour with that in the past, as she knows. She took the view that it was contrary to military neutrality at the time, in the teeth of Russian aggression. I readily acknowledge that when that happens there is a reciprocal response and one ends up with nobody on the ground, particularly in Moscow, where we have Irish citizens. I do not know how this war is going to unfold or what implications it will have for Irish citizens. I do know that right now in Ukraine we are working extremely hard to help Irish citizens to get out, in particular very vulnerable young babies and so on in hospitals in Ukraine. I am not going to cut off channels that potentially can help us to get Irish citizens who are in difficulty out of Ukraine or anywhere else for that matter. We have discussed everything with our European colleagues, including diplomatic issues. The Minister, Deputy Coveney, has discussed it at Foreign Ministers level and we discussed it at COREPER level and at Heads of State level. I really believe that the centrality of the importance of us working in unison trumps any domestic political consideration of me being able to say that I am leading ahead of the rest. I have no interest in doing that. In the teeth of the worst war on our Continent the best response is a unified response from the European Union working with the United States. That is the best response. I say that genuinely. It is not about one taking a lead over the other. I do not think that is the right way to go. It might play well domestically in the short-term, but it is not in the best interests of the Irish citizens.

I have listened to the Taoiseach and there is validity in what he says but there comes a point when there is indiscriminate killing of civilians, where children are being murdered and when we know we have a dictator who is pursuing a scorched-earth policy. We have always shown leadership in this country. The Russian ambassador is a liar. He lied to the Irish people on multiple occasions. We are in unprecedented territory with a regime that is acting in an absolutely horrendous way. There is no way on this Earth, not just domestically, the Russian ambassador should stay in Ireland. What is the point in having diplomatic channels with somebody who lies? We cannot trust him. If he had said nothing, it would have been better. President Zelenskyy has thrown down the gauntlet to the world. The Taoiseach is correct that collectively at EU level with our partners we have to do everything we can, but we also have to lead. I am asking the Taoiseach formally to withdraw our ambassador from Russia. I believe we have to do that. I also believe that we have to expel the Russian ambassador. We must also condemn the actions of some of our own elected representatives in the European Parliament. Clare Daly and Mick Wallace do not speak for the Irish people. As far as I am concerned, and the Labour Party is concerned, they have disgraced their mandate. There are a number of others who also have not covered themselves in glory either. On the humanitarian crisis, the Taoiseach needs to give guidance to the Irish people as to how best they can help. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, has asked the Taoiseach to accelerate the passage of the Magnitsky Bill. The Taoiseach knows what it does regarding the proceeds of crime. It gives the Criminal Assets Bureau the power to seize the assets of oligarchs, officials and anyone involved in human rights abuses. If we did that, it would send a message to the world. We need to park the party politics. It is a Labour Party Bill but we will work with the Government. The Labour Party has two hours of Private Members' time next week. We will give it over if the Government is willing to add to it to take Committee and Report Stages. That would send a message to the world. This legislation is ready to go. I hope we all support it. We can make changes if needed. Will the Taoiseach please work with us to set aside time so that we can implement it? I have key questions. On behalf of the Irish people and taking everything into account, will the Taoiseach act and expel the Russian ambassador who is a liar? Will he work with us to implement the Magnitsky Bill? I am organising and attending a protest in my home county on Friday. I am giving guidance. Will the Taoiseach please give clear guidance to the Irish people as to how they can help our Ukrainian neighbours?

I have made that very clear in this House. I understand fully people's anger towards Russia, the leadership and the Russian ambassador. My primary concern is with Irish citizens and vulnerable Irish citizens. Earlier, Deputy McDonald made the point about diplomacy and so forth. A chargé d'affaires located here or somewhere else will not do a whole lot. Let us be very honest with people about that. If you cut off diplomatic relations, you cut them off. That is something that at European level, along with all of the other measures that have been taken, has been discussed. Far greater things have been already decided upon. Bigger impact decisions have been taken by the European Union, with Ireland participating, in terms of unprecedented economic sanctions against Russia, denying the Russian Central Bank access to its foreign reserves and excluding the majority of its critical banks from the SWIFT mechanism. There is also the decision in terms of trade and the undermining of the industrial base. These are unprecedented sanctions that have real teeth and real impact on the ground in terms of Russia's economic and industrial capacity into the future. The issue will be to continue with them because they will have impacts. We have got to hold the line in terms of those sanctions for the longer haul. President Putin has crossed the line here in terms of his appalling, barbaric attack on the Ukrainian people. In my view, the European Union has surprised international opinion generally in terms of its remarkable solidarity among 27 member states, the unity of purpose, the speed with which it has worked with the US, Canada and others to apply unprecedented sanctions against Russia, which are already having an immediate impact in terms of the Russian economy.Russia's currency has crashed to record lows on foreign exchange markets. Its purchasing power on international markets has been significantly reduced. Inflation in Russia has risen significantly. The Russian Central Bank has hiked interest rates from 9% to 20% to prop up the currency. The Russian stock market has shut. That is the real meat of what Europe and America are doing. We will to do more, if necessary. I do not accept the basic premise that has been articulated to the effect that Europe should split in different directions. Europe should stay solidly united in its response to this issue. In the discussion I had with the Ukrainian Prime Minister yesterday, he expressed a genuine desire for European Union membership on behalf of the Ukrainian Government and for Ukraine's application to be accelerated, which we support, as I have said. I did not get to all the Deputy's questions but I might get to them in my next contribution. I have already indicated to Deputy Howlin that I am positively disposed to the Bill. I have to talk to other Ministers about what can be done in that regard.

He has lied to the Irish people. His interview on RTÉ with David McCullagh will go down in history, as will the way he performed when he was before the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence. We need to get rid of him. I accept what the Taoiseach is saying. It is a valid argument. However, I do not agree with him. There have been times when we have been of a different view to our European colleagues when it comes to how we have used funding. This is another issue on which I believe we should lead. The Irish people want us to lead. They do not want that man in this country. They do not want his colleagues in the country. They do not want a military attaché in this country. We should also ask Irish citizens to leave Russia. On behalf of the Labour Party and, I hope, on behalf of everybody, I want to ask the Taoiseach sincerely about the Proceeds of Crime (Gross Human Rights Abuses) Bill, drafted by my colleague, Deputy Howlin. It would probably take two hours or a little more to pass through the House next week. We will give over our Private Members' time over to the passage of the Bill and we will ask members of the Opposition and the Government to support it. We can include any amendments the Government wants to add. This proposed legislation would take the money from the oligarchs. It will facilitate the seizing of assets. It is only expanding on legislation that is already there. I ask the Taoiseach to help us, give time to the issue, work with us and have a conversation. This is not a matter of party politics. We should have a discussion outside the Chamber in order that we can deal with the Bill next week. I beg that of the Taoiseach because it is important.

#PeterFitzpatrick	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-party	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-dob	unknown-#PeterFitzpatrick-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	107	I raise the issue of the ever-increasing cost of living that the Irish people are enduring. We are now, thankfully, starting to emerge from the Covid-19 pandemic and society and workplaces are reopening. The past two years have been very tough for everybody. Many people lost their jobs. Others saw their businesses close. Many also lost friends and family members to the dreadful pandemic. Now, just as we are starting to emerge from lockdown, the people are faced with new challenges. The cost of living, as the Taoiseach knows, is rising at an alarming rate. The rising costs are affecting all businesses in the country, large and small. I have spoken to many business owners about these challenges. A local joinery company explained to me that this time last year, its core product, a sheet material, was costing approximately €28 per sheet. Today, the cost is over €70 for the same sheet. To put that in context, the company would purchase an average of 50 of those sheets per week. This means that the cost has risen by more than €100,000 in one year. On top of that, the company's diesel bill has increased by more than €250 per week. The core costs for that business have increased by over €120,000 in the past year. Another business owner explained to me that their electricity bill has risen from €25,000 per month to €45,000 per month. These two examples are just the tip of the iceberg. Every business in the country is faced with these challenges. In the Border region, particularly around my home town of Dundalk, local businesses are facing even greater challenges. It is becoming clear that the introduction of minimum alcohol pricing is going to have a devastating effect on local businesses in towns such as Dundalk. I support minimum unit pricing for alcohol. However, I stated all along that we must introduce it at the same time it is introduced in the North. People are travelling in their thousands to buy cheap alcohol in the North. This is going to be a massive drain on the local economy because, as the Taoiseach knows, when such people travel to the North to purchase cheap alcohol, they also buy other items, such as groceries, coffee or clothes. The same is happening with regard to heating fuels such as coal. Coal is nearly half the price in the North that it is here so people are travelling there to buy it. Businesses along the Border can no longer compete with their Northern counterparts. The introduction of the carbon tax at this stage is not helping. I will also speak to the cost of utility bills. People in Ireland like to do budgets but some utility companies are only billing people twice a year. People have arranged for a standing order of €130 per month, or whatever it is, and all of a sudden, four or five months down the road, they are getting bills of €1,000, €1,500 or €2,000. This has to stop. We must start pushing the utility companies to do a minimum of six meter readings per year. People in the Border area are looking for help. I appreciate the €200 payment towards the cost of electricity bills. However, that is only a small item. I would appreciate a reply.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	108	I thank the Deputy for raising the topical issue of the cost of living. In the earlier part of his contribution, the Deputy referred to the impact that rising costs have had on a particular company in his county. I acknowledge that. Inflation has risen significantly around the world in recent months, mainly driven by higher energy prices. Because of the Ukraine-Russia war, costs are likely to go up even more in the short term. Inflation in Ireland was 5.5% in December and eased to 5% in January. The cost of electricity, gas, home-heating oil, petrol, diesel, motor cars and rents were the main contributors to inflation. Some food products, including bread, pasta, soft drinks and coffee, have also risen markedly in price. In 2021, the country spent €6.2 billion on imported fuels compared with €3.4 billion in 2020. That illustrates the scale of the increase.It was an increase of €2.8 billion, which reflects the higher prices on the international market. We spent an additional €1.5 billion on imported oil and €1 billion on imported gas last year. A year ago, a barrel of oil was $64 on the international market; today, it costs $110. Oil prices have risen by $14 a barrel over the past week alone. Natural gas costs 400p a therm today on international markets, compared with 40p a therm last March. Gas prices have soared by 220p a therm over the past week. These are enormous increases in a very short period. The most recent Central Statistics Office, CSO, data on wages show average hourly earnings in quarter 4 of 2021 were up by about 2.6% from a year earlier and up 8.2% from quarter 4 of 2019. As I said earlier, if we look at the United Kingdom and the US, inflation has been at multi-decade highs recently. Euro area inflation has gone up again, with the figures today showing it is at about 5.8%, if I am not mistaken. We are in a very difficult situation regarding the costs of living. The Government has responded. Since coming into office, we have raised the fuel allowance from approximately €630 to €1,039. We have been in office for approximately one year and seven months. If we include the €200 electricity payment, support for those on low incomes has now almost doubled to €1,239. That will help to cushion the blow for people on low incomes. In addition, we have taken measures, as the Deputy acknowledged, in respect of the drug payment schemes, the front-loading of the working family payment and the reduction in public transport fares from the end of April, which will benefit 800,000 people. The minimum unit pricing of alcohol came into effect on 4 January. I know the Deputy's heart is in the right place in respect of this matter and I know the point he is making. The policy is designed to reduce alcohol consumption.

That is what is annoying me and it is why I use the word "profiteering". Every time we open the newspapers, we see that the banks and companies like the ESB are making many millions in profits. Some businesses are even saying they are making profits of 40% or 50%. We need these businesses to help us and we must find some kind of incentive in this regard. I repeat that many people will really welcome the €200. However, I reiterate that many companies are engaged in profiteering. I worked in an electrical wholesale business for 25 years and I cannot understand how a sheet of timber could cost €28 this time last year and now, all of a sudden, the price has increased to €70. There is something seriously wrong with that. We have a culture in Ireland whereby people want to pay their bills. However, utility companies are raising prices twice a year. A widow came to me last week whose electricity bill had gone up from €130 a month to €400 or €500. The simple reason for this was that the company had made a mistake in its reading. When she telephoned the company, the response was, "Oh, sorry, we made a mistake." We must help people at this time. The €200 is good but we must give some kind of incentive to the companies to help the people who need it.

There are various mechanisms in place whereby households that are in arrears or are in difficulty in respect of paying bills and so forth can be switched off. The utility companies have developed policies in that respect. Likewise, in terms of the utility companies the Deputy identified, meaningful and flexible approaches and responses should be developed by them in the current situation where, as I have outlined, international market prices for oil and gas have rocketed in the past 12 months and are set to go up again in the short term. In the context of the broader issues of supply and demand, there has been an issue as economies were recovering from the Covid-19 pandemic that demand far outstripped supply and costs went up accordingly for many products. There was some evidence that was evening out in the past while, but it was a significant factor.

However, there is also a real crisis nationally in the community and voluntary sector, which provides services for children and families. While I will refer to the situation in Sligo-Leitrim this morning, this is a nationwide issue. The community and voluntary boards in Sligo-Leitrim provide and run services funded by Tusla but they are not in a position to pay their staff decent wages commensurate with their experience and qualifications. These boards are not in a position financially to pay increments to their staff, ensure that they have pension contributions or fund paid maternity and paternity leave. Many staff have no comprehensive sick pay arrangements. The boards provide supports and services for children, young people and families. They include home-based, targeted family supports to which clients are referred by the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, disability services, local GPs and schools. The services provide supports to early school leavers, asylum seekers, refugees and Travellers and also provide parenting programmes. The voluntary and community boards provide an extensive range of quality, professional caring services. The different services and their staff are held in high esteem because of the conscientious, caring and responsive nature of the services they provide. At one level, you might say money could not buy this service and that is, on another level, true. The services are run by voluntary boards, thereby saving the State huge sums of money. Critically, however, and this is why I refer to a crisis, many of the staff who provide these invaluable services are stuck on the bottom rung of pay structures. Many of them are ten or 15 years in the service but have received just one or, in some cases, no increments. There is no salary scale for staff and no financial credit for training and experience. Yes, there has been a core funding increase for family resource services, which is good. That core funding has gone to provide extra services and that is excellent. However, none of it is for family support workers, counsellors, youth workers, play therapists and the other staff who deliver the services. In Sligo-Leitrim alone, these services interact with several thousand families and children. I know the Taoiseach will not disagree about the value of the services but, in order for them to provide a quality, nationwide service, including to the people of Sligo and Leitrim, they must be adequately funded. This requires not just a block grant but the ring fencing of a proportion of that money to ensure the staff who provide the service are paid a decent wage.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	118	I thank the Deputy for raising this issue. I share her admiration for all who work in the community and voluntary sector, particularly those working under the aegis of Tusla, which provides a range of services, as the Deputy said, right across the board, including family resource centres, home-based supports, supporting early school leavers and much more. The fundamental point is that in the Child and Family Agency Act 2013, under which Tusla was established, it is stipulated very clearly that the funding arrangement for such community and voluntary bodies does not give rise to an employment relationship between a service provider, its employees or agents on the one hand and the agency on the other.In the last while there have been significant funding increases to the bodies that work with or are funded by Tusla. As the Deputy knows, Tusla is not the employer itself. There are about 121 family resource centres with a core annual budget of €18 million and that has been raised in the context of the national employers group and by trade unions such as SIPTU in numerous representations to the Minister for Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Tusla provides funding to those bodies and to more than 600 community and voluntary sector bodies to deliver services on its behalf under sections 56 to 59 of the Child and Family Agency Act 2013. About €130 million in Tusla funding has gone to such bodies for a broad range of family supports. Increased sustainability funding of about 4% to those services as part of the Tusla budget comes to an extra €40 million in 2022’s budget for these bodies, which is a significant enough increase. It has been the way since the inception and establishment of Tusla to provide core budgets to these organisations. The annual allocations from Tusla for these budgets have been increased, particularly during the Covid period and in the 2022 budget a significant increase was allocated to Tusla for these community and voluntary bodies that are associated with its agreement for family supports.

I welcome that and I stated that but those services are delivered by staff; by the workers who man those services. The Taoiseach said himself that this has been the way since it started but I would put it to him that it is time to change or at least review that. The average salary in these organisations is €33,000 per annum, yet the average wage in Ireland in 2019, based on CSO information, is between €40,000 and €49,000. Most of these staff have level 9 qualifications or master’s degrees and they provide the services that are invaluable to families and young people. It is not good enough to stand back and say that Tusla has increased the funding. Part of that money should be written into the tender or the public procurement and set aside. Do not ask me how to do it as there are enough experts to figure that out but part of that money must go to ensure that the staff who provide those services have decent jobs and wages and want to remain in the service because staff retention is a huge issue which we need to act on.

Funding has been significantly increased and in the most recent budget, apart from the additional funding that was provided to Tusla by the Minister following the discussion on the Estimates, further funding of about €650,000 was provided from the dormant accounts programme to family resource centres in 2021. A further €1 million in dormant accounts funding also went to the family resource centres to progress minor maintenance works, the purchase of the central office and so on. The Deputy is talking about salaries and pay and conditions for those who work in the various bodies or for those who work providing services that would receive grants and core funding from Tusla. There are various mechanisms by which these issues are pursued such as the Workplace Relations Commission and so forth.

This has led to shocking waiting lists across the State and also to the denial of services to countless people. There are more than 10,000 people on orthodontics lists waiting longer than a year and half of those people are waiting longer than three years. That is not acceptable for any patient or for any condition anywhere. Can the Taoiseach explain to me why there has not been an intervention from the Department of Health to deal with this growing crisis? Why are there no serious talks between the Department and the dentists to fix the dental treatment contract and to prioritise preventative oral healthcare? How will the Government ensure that older people, including workers and families on the lowest incomes, can access the good dental treatment they require?

An extra €10 million was allocated in the budget, which is available to provide for dental services on an interim basis to medical card holders. There have been discussions between the Irish Dental Association, private contractors and the State, which represents the people and which wants to do the best for the people. It is time an interim solution was found based on the money that has already been allocated, and I would appeal to the Irish Dental Association to engage constructively on the utilisation of that funding.

Would the Taoiseach commit to helping those associations if they make that decision to come together?

After a local campaign this decision was rightly reversed, which is welcome news. However, it is still of huge concern that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, plans to phase out early intervention classes nationwide in favour of the access and inclusion model. Needless to say, that would be a disaster. Since then I have been doing my best to try to get answers. At a committee meeting last week the NCSE had a worrying and evasive response. Where we would expect it to say that is absolutely not the case, it said it is waiting on the findings of an access and inclusion model, AIM, report and did not want to comment. Since then it and the Department have just ignored my questions so today thanks to the Ceann Comhairle I raised it with the Minister for Education at the Topical Issue debate and she also did not answer the question. I do not expect him to know the answer in this exact moment but I have tried every other avenue to try to get an answer to this question, so will the Taoiseach please look into it?

I am a passionate believer in early intervention. I will discuss this with the Minister for Education. The National Council for Special Education has statutory remit and freedom to commission reviews and to put forward policies. We have to acknowledge that. Of course, that does not take away our right to interrogate that policy. I believe in early intervention on the ground. We should not take away resources that are there already.

In the most recent result in the past few days, 85% of the workers voted against this shocking attempt to cut their pay. These workers are faced with inflation which is now, according to the Department of Finance, looking as though it will go up to 7% because of events in Ukraine and Aer Lingus expects them to take effective pay cuts.

The equine sector comes under the remit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, but has not benefited from any capital investment grants or direct support from CAP. There are currently 27,000 farmers registered on the Department's database with equine premises. These farmers in Tipperary and throughout rural Ireland would greatly benefit from the inclusion of their sector in target agriculture modernisation schemes, TAMS, to be funded under the new CAP regime from January 2023. Essential infrastructure, such as stabling, arenas, horse fencing, outwintering paddocks and horse handling facilities should be incorporated and eligible for funding under the scheme. Will the Taoiseach request that the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine examine inclusion of this integral part of Irish agriculture in such a scheme and engage directly with representatives of the thoroughbred and sports sector?

Mr. Thomas Kennedy has written to the Taoiseach, the Minister for Justice, An Garda Síochána, the land services regulatory authority and the Property Services Regulatory Authority to try to obtain justice. Mr. Kennedy bought and paid for land but believes a wrong has been committed and he has been wrongly imprisoned and put off his lands, which he has farmed for 30 years. I have also reported these issues to all these agencies on Mr. Kennedy's behalf. He has been fighting for 20 years. He has written to the Taoiseach. Will the Taoiseach set up an independent inquiry into this? There are rogue elements within An Garda Síochána, the Department, solicitors and all involved in this. It is a murky business and it is not fair that a citizen of our country should be treated like this. The Taoiseach knows about it because he has written to him and handed letters to him. The Minister for Justice knows as well.

I have heard many positive announcements by the Minister, Deputy Foley, in my constituency. There is one outlier, though. Tubber national school dates back to the 1870s and is absolutely hemmed in and crowded. It is on a triangular site with two very busy roads straddling it. It has no space to expand. On certain days of the week, the teachers ask the pupils to leave their schoolbags at home because they cannot fit in the classroom. I was a teacher for 16 years. I am alarmed by the conditions in the school. The Department of Education urgently needs to come out to inspect it. This needs to be green lighted for a new build on a new site that the school and diocese have acquired.

It has been 224 days since the Affordable Housing Bill 2021 was passed and the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy O'Brien, have said they are serious about building houses.

I raise with the Taoiseach the damaging impact social media is having on the self-esteem and mental health of our young people, in particular when it comes to eating disorders. Only a few months ago, the Facebook whistleblower, Ms Frances Haugen, reported that Instagram targets pro-anorexia content towards young girls who show a vulnerability of low self-esteem and negative body image.The Instagram algorithm is basically selling these young people an eating disorder. Ireland is the European hub for almost all of our social media companies. We have responsibility to address these issues adequately in the Online Safety and Media Regulation Bill 2022. What is the Government doing to protect our young people from the dangerous manipulation of social media companies?

In parallel with that are the ongoing programmes in education in terms of building up self-esteem and self-respect among children at the earliest ages.

I made it very clear that in respect of diplomatic channels, our primary concern is not the ambassador but rather Irish citizens who will need our assistance both in Ukraine and potentially Russia as well. We should not understate the seriousness of that in terms of helping people who right now are very vulnerable and need our assistance. We are getting representations from Deputies and Senators in respect of individuals who need our help right now. That is why it is important that we work in concert with our European Union colleagues on that front and work together in unity. What has been done so far by the European Union has been very strong. I understand people's anger at the Russian ambassador. The more fundamental point, however, is the importance of the well-being of our citizens and enabling them to be supported.

If a landlord decides to retrofit his or her property, he or she can ask the tenant to move out. One might ask where the tenant will go. When that work is done and the BER rating has improved in the property, however, the landlord is then exempt from the limits in the rent pressure zone, RPZ, and can hike up the rents. Although by law the landlord can invite the tenant to move back into property, if he or she has hiked up the rents, the tenant can no longer remain in that property because the rents have been hiked up. At the minute, property websites are advertising this loophole as a selling point for properties. Threshold and the Residential Tenancies Board, RTB, have said this could potentially be a big problem with this scheme. What is the Government going to do to afford protections to renters in private rental accommodation under this scheme and address the problems it may pose for them?

It will provide very significant resources to households generally across the country in terms of insulation and reducing energy costs for ordinary people over time. It will take time to get to critical mass. A raft of protections have been introduced legislatively by the Minister, whom I will alert to this issue.

As the Taoiseach may be aware, the turnaround time for applications and renewals for passports at the moment is totally unacceptable. When I came into the Oireachtas 20 years ago, we had a drop box in Leinster House that empowered Deputies and Senators to facilitate urgent passports for members of the public. Some 20 years later, that box is long gone. It can take months, never mind weeks, particularly for young children and new applications. Indeed, anecdotal evidence suggests that depending on who you know or what mobile telephone numbers you have, the turnaround time can be a little bit better but for the vast majority of us, it is disgraceful in the extreme. The process to become a UN envoy seems clearer to the public than managing to get a passport for a child, to visit a sick relative or to go on a modest holiday.

An extra €10 million was allocated for the passport service in the budget, which was an unprecedented investment in the service. Passport service staff numbers have increased by more than 300 since June of 2021 and additional staff will continue to be recruited, which will bring the staff numbers to more than 900.

In south County Wexford, hundreds of acres of cereals were destroyed. At the time, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine committed to look into this issue and seek the names of the farmers and lands involved. To date, absolutely nothing has happened. There has been a wall of silence from the Minister and the Department. Can the Taoiseach bring some clarification to this issue?

There seems to be an attempt to overestimate the number of spaces available at neighbouring schools. I want to talk about Sacred Heart Primary School in Roscrea, which had an exceptional review of its mainstream special needs assistant, SNA, allocation in October of last year. The school made this request because in summer 2020, it knew the allocated SNA resources for its mainstream classes were not adequate. Despite numerous emails to the visiting special educational needs organiser, SENO, who carried out the review, the school has heard nothing back since. That has been going on six months into the school year. As a consequence, the school has had no SENO in place since 24 September 2021. As the Taoiseach will appreciate, this is a huge loss locally for the parents and children within the school community. To keep a school in the dark in this way is unacceptable. I am hopeful something can be done to address this immediately. I certainly hope this is not the trend being experienced by other schools and parents around the country.

As I said, I raised this several times last year. I even got the Deputy Chief Whip, Deputy Griffin, interested in the scheme as well. We have had a new list since 2018, which includes applicants since 2007. We got 19 roads done last year. At this rate, it will take 34 or 35 years to complete or to exhaust this list. These are public roads, not private roads like the Department of Finance has said. There is no gate on any one of them. People on these roads pay for everything, from motor tax, to property tax, to income tax. They are ordinary working-class people, people who are going to work, farmers and elderly people who require carers and home help to visit them. Other counties have been allocated funding in proportion to what is on the local improvement scheme list.

I want a timeline on when the duty of care legislation will go through. I also want to know if there have been any successes in the office for increasing competition in insurance, particularly in relation to public liability. This is because there are just not enough players in the industry. We are now at a disaster situation. I know that majority of leisure, entertainment and children's entertainment companies, particularly people who are operating bouncy castles, are operating without insurance at present. This is because they cannot get insurance. I am engaging with Insurance Ireland myself. I am also engaging with the Government. We really need to deal with this because it is an absolute disaster. This is the case for community centres, community groups and for businesses. Local authorities will not be able to carry out events. This is a huge issue.

I will not go through all the details here. In fact, an update and progress report will soon be published by the Minister of State, Deputy Fleming. Motor insurance has come down by 10% but the bulk of other insurance costs have not yet come down. This is notwithstanding the changes that have been made in the legal system around awards and other measures that have been introduced. Legislation is under consideration. Some legislation about occupier's liability and so on is before the House at the moment. A range of legislative measures is being taken and of course, the PIAB legislation is being piloted by the Minister of State, Deputy Troy.

This is fitting, perhaps, because Aramark also makes money by running for-profit prisons in the US. They have treated those who are in direct provision here appallingly over the years, by serving up terrible food, by intimidating those who speak out and, in one case, by locking the common room on Christmas to prevent families from having a celebration for their kids. The National Gallery has awarded Aramark a €7.5 million catering contract. Staff, artists and the community have protested against this. Will the Taoiseach join me in expressing solidarity with those who are opposing this? Will he act to ensure that the contract is withdrawn?

It is not for the Oireachtas to decide every individual contract. There is a broader issue, if people wish to reform the procurement process itself. I think we are entering into a new situation if individual Deputies are to decide who will win individual contracts from State agencies. That is the road on which I am not clear that we should be going down, quite frankly. It is not open to the State. For example, local authorities have to go by EU procurement rules. The State has to go by EU procurement rules in respect of all of these issues across the board, from construction, right across.

He said: "Even if it was not for the climate crisis, for economic and security reasons, we need to wean ourselves off our dependence on fossil fuels." The position outlined last week in this House is meaningful and it is hopeful, because for once and at last, it places our communities, our children and our grandchildren at the forefront of policymaking in energy in this country. It sets out our plan for energy security. The LNG free Bill, which I have tabled today, was developed by the grassroots organisation Not Here Not Anywhere - who are here today and to which I am incredibly thankful - and it is sponsored by me. It seeks to support the Government's agreed position, as outlined in the programme for Government. This Bill is also supported by 30 national and international organisations. It is to keep Ireland free of liquefied natural gas and to strike out towards a future based on energy sustainability and security, a future that will deliver us from the clutches of profiteers and despots who would happily allow this world to burn for the sake of a few more dollars. This Government will not and cannot allow that to happen. These have been a challenging two years for all of us. Just when we began to emerge from the Covid-19 crisis, inflation has skyrocketed, particularly in energy costs. This is placing households in Ireland under terrible and sustained pressure. No one should have to decide between heat or food. It is our generation that will decide the pathway forward. The pathway for which I advocate, and which this Bill serves, is one where communities can produce their own energy. They own it. They benefit from it. It provides jobs to their communities. It uses local natural resources, without destroying those resources or the landscape around them. That is an attainable vision for energy in this country. It includes wind, solar and perhaps wave energy. It must include an integrated European grid. Given our geographical riches and demographics in Ireland, Ireland has a better chance than almost any country on this planet of being entirely energy independent. That will be mostly due to renewables. We are the country that could achieve this.  The other path to take would be the LNG path. The impacts of that were outlined in detail this week by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, IPCC, report, which issued a stark warning on just how close we are to devastation as a result of climate change. Building large-scale LNG infrastructure in Ireland at this point will lock us into fossil fuel-use for decades to come. It is an even worse path than that, because it is a polluted path. It is a dangerous and dirty industry. It is huge in the space that it requires but it is minuscule in the provision of employment.  The oppressive threat of environmental degradation and safety issues looms not just for those who suffer as their communities are ravaged by fracking and shale gas extraction in places like the US and Qatar, but for communities here in Ireland, where LNG terminals are to be built, as huge polluting tankers hover on the horizon and a meagre cohort of workers tend to often-empty storage facilities. LNG did not protect France or Germany from price surges this year. It did not protect their communities from inflation. It did not protect communities in other countries from fuel poverty, even when it polluted them. LNG is a plaything of private investors, and for this we will turn away from a truly fossil-free future. We will give up our opportunity over the coming decades for an energy security that is genuinely ours. The past two weeks has shown us how truly powerful the reliance on gas can be and how it can shape geopolitics. If we are committed to peace and to standing for democracy, we can no longer blindly bind ourselves through energy dependence to other nations, especially when we now have options. We can no longer place the future of our communities, their employment, their prosperity, their very environment and their water and air quality in the hands of other nations or, in particular, in the hands of private investors and interests. The future should belong to us, to Irish communities, and it is for us to safeguard it for those who come after us. There is no place for LNG in Ireland. We do not need it. I commend the Bill to the House.

Tonight in the Dáil, we will discuss the Amnesty International report entitled, Israel's Apartheid Against Palestinians: A Cruel System of Domination and a Crime Against Humanity. The report asks European governments, including the Taoiseach's Government, to condemn Israel for ongoing, systematic crimes against humanity. Is the Taoiseach going to endorse that report and its recommendations regarding the referral of Israel to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity, a total arms embargo against the state of Israel, and targeted sanctions against Israeli officials who perpetuate the system of apartheid, very similar to the sanctions the Government has just agreed to against members of the Kremlin and Putin's coterie for crimes against humanity? If the Government does not do those things, it will be guilty, as will the European Union, of gross double standards in supposedly opposing crimes against humanity and breaches of international law.

We desperately need laws ensuring corporate accountability throughout the supply chain, regarding human rights, labour rights and environmental rights, but it appears the Commission has gone for the lowest common denominator position, with loopholes to carve out the vast majority of corporations in this country and across the EU. For example, 99% of Irish businesses would be excluded because the proposed legislation will apply only to companies with an annual turnover of more than €150 million and with more than 500 employees. That would exclude, for example, the Dublin-based Coal Marketing Company, which sells coal from the infamous Cerrejón mine in Colombia, from where communities nearby face pollution of their air and water. Another loophole would allow companies to offload responsibility through a contract onto their suppliers. Will the Taoiseach work to strengthen this proposal?

Two people in my town, Tanya, who runs Tanya's Kitchen, and her mam, both of them Ukrainian, will run a fundraiser tomorrow, while Ollie, who runs The Snug, is collecting money as well. So much work is being done and we have much to be proud of. I hope yesterday's Dáil statements demonstrated our collective support for Ukraine and our deep opposition to Russia's morally bankrupt and illegal war. In light of Ireland's military neutrality, our seat on the UN Security Council and our position as an EU member state not aligned with NATO, we have a unique and important role in supporting Ukraine, making the case for peace and holding Russia to account for its war crimes. As for sanctions and, specifically, the targeting of Russian oligarchs and their financial entities located in Ireland, just three of the 34 of these special purpose entities will be impacted by the current round of sanctions. I am concerned there appears to be no intention to pursue the remaining 31 entities. Will the Taoiseach clarify the position? Over the past two years, my party colleague Deputy Mairéad Farrell has raised a special purpose vehicle provision in section 110 in Ireland's tax code that is used by these Russian entities and others to avoid regulation and tax. Does the Taoiseach accept it is finally time to reform how the International Financial Services Centre, IFSC, and our tax code are used, how our financial regulation performs and how our rules on transparency of company ownership work?

The Irish Times has stated that about €34 billion is held in opaque Russian-linked shell companies registered in the IFSC. Colm Keena published a report in 2020 that showed a network of bank accounts allowing Russia to funnel money into the West. Cillian Doyle and Jim Stewart have carried out research that shows that €118 billion has been moved by Russian companies through section 110 trusts based in the IFSC over a 12-year period. All the rhetoric we use in this House will come to nothing if we do not show Ukraine that we mean business by ensuring these sanctions are not circumvented through the IFSC. What will the Taoiseach do to make sure that is the case?

In his reply, he stated, "we neither support nor have any evidence ... of any racist approach to facilitating migration into Poland". There is plenty of evidence now. Ignorance was not really an excuse yesterday, given a Government Deputy, Deputy Higgins, raised the matter in the Dáil yesterday evening, but it is certainly no excuse today. This has been reported by the BBC, CNN, Reuters, France 24, The Guardian and others. I give the Taoiseach a second opportunity to join with me in voicing opposition to a racist border policy at the Polish border with Ukraine and to call for equal treatment for everyone fleeing this humanitarian crisis.

We all agree we need to hurt the Russian and oligarchs' war machine financially. We need to deal with the section 110 companies and the various means by which money can be filtered that have enabled these people. There has been great success regarding people who have contacted us about medical supplies, particularly insulin. This was facilitated, but many people are still talking about the community response.The EU Commission is talking about this becoming a major part of dealing with migration into the future. People have approached me in Dundalk and I would appreciate it if the Taoiseach could lay out for us what the process will be for people who are willing to take those who are fleeing war-torn Ukraine.

It is obviously doing important work. As we all will be aware, international affairs are dominated just now by the horrific Russian war on Ukraine. The Taoiseach has engaged with a number of Heads of Government in this regard in recent days. Can the Taoiseach give me a sense of where world leaders are at on this? I think, in particular, of the Taoiseach's formal visit to Germany last week and his meeting with the German Chancellor, Mr. Olaf Scholz, just prior to the invasion. It seems, after some initial apparent hesitation by the German Chancellor, he has now become one of the strongest supporters for harsh sanctions on Russia. For example, he has cancelled the Nord Stream 2 pipeline project. Is the Taoiseach aware of any new initiatives by EU leaders as we witness the horrific scenes taking place in Ukraine? Finally, in his exchanges with President Biden for St. Patrick's Day, what will the Taoiseach be saying to him in this regard? Have the Taoiseach's plans for his visit to Washington been finalised at this stage?

In respect of Deputy Boyd Barrett's question in terms of the Amnesty report, Amnesty International is a respected NGO. I value the role it has played and the role other civil society organisations have played in relation to the Palestinian question. The Department of Foreign Affairs is currently examining the Amnesty report in respect of the plight of the Palestinian people. I have consistently opposed the policy of successive Israeli Governments in relation to Palestine. It is my view that a two-state solution is the optimal solution to what has been a very long-running conflict. It is unacceptable how Palestinians have been and are being treated and the discriminatory practices that have been deployed towards them on a regular basis by the Israeli authorities.

Through the various layers of both legal and judicial agencies within the European Union, that has been seen on an ongoing basis in terms of companies being brought before European courts or the Commission and being tackled in relation to a range of issues.

In response to Deputy O'Reilly in relation to Ukraine, I have been raising this issue since the invasion of Crimea.

I merely want to say that. In relation to section 110 entities, I made my position clear on that. With regard to authorised investment funds, the Central Bank has advised that total Russian assets held on 31 December 2021 is estimated at €11.4 billion or 0.3% of the total Irish fund assets of €3.8 trillion, and this is evenly split between equities and bonds. In terms of the special purpose entities, there were 3,000 Irish domiciled special purpose entities. The Central Bank has undertaken an initial review of those and any links with Russian counterparts. Some 34 of these entities have a Russian sponsor, meaning that they were established on behalf of a Russian company. By the way, it does not mean they are all illegal. Of these 34 entities, three have been identified as being directly linked to individuals or financial institutions covered in the 23 February round of EU sanctions. Work is ongoing in respect of the subsequent sanction rounds. I have given the figure in terms of the €11.4 billion, which is 0.3% of the €3.8 trillion. I would make the point that a breach of a financial sanction, and this is in response to Deputy Tóibín as well, is a criminal offence. Accounts, funds or other assets must be frozen without delay in order that they cannot be made available, directly or indirectly, to the sanctioned person, entity or body, and all natural and legal persons in the State are obliged to comply with European Union sanctions.

It relates to the fact that services delivered to people with Down's syndrome have radically fallen over the past couple of years. Of those surveyed by DSI, 65% have received no speech and language therapy sessions in the past year, while 44% have received no therapy of any kind in the past year. Some parents responded that they have received no therapy sessions at all over the past three years. Moreover, 40% stated they received no communication from the HSE in the past 12 months and nearly 25% of children with Down's syndrome under the age of five have received no therapy services in their whole lives. Of young children, only 49% have had a speech and language therapist, while 22% have had access to occupational therapy.This is an abandonment of a whole section of Irish society. This country flies the flag of inclusion but, unfortunately, in real terms, too many people with disabilities are being excluded.

It also represents the individual member states' priority rail and road transport corridors, ports and airports. The latest 2021 CEF transport call under the 2013 TEN-T map is for proposals to make €7 billion available to support infrastructure projects across the EU. Why is the west and the Atlantic economic corridor excluded from the TEN-T core status when it is critical to provide investment certainty and to match EU and State investment in the infrastructure there? People in the west need to know why they are being excluded and why they do not have the vital infrastructure that would create the opportunities that are presented by renewable energy and related industries in the west.

It is 5.8%. The Taoiseach may have said it this morning, but it is breaking in the past hour. There are big cost-of-living increases on the way that are not included in those figures. The Russian invasion of Ukraine moves the cost-of-living crisis to another level. The price of bread, groceries, heating and fuel will rise. The Minister for Foreign Affairs has already warned of a massive spike in heating costs. The Taoiseach is on the record as saying that there will be no new cost-of-living compensation measures for households this side of the budget in October. I put it to him that this is no longer a tenable position. I am for price controls on gas and electricity prices. I am also for an increase in the national minimum wage to €15 and for inflation-busting wage increases across the board. What new measures is the Taoiseach prepared to consider? What is his position, for example, on the idea that a €200 credit be introduced to offset rising gas bills?

As a result, we are potentially looking at an inflation rate of more than 9%. Against that background, and because I did not make this point earlier, could I ask the Taoiseach to condemn what Aer Lingus and International Airlines Group, IAG, are doing in terms of demanding pay cuts? This from an entity that we subsidised during Covid. I commend the workers on voting overwhelmingly against those pay cuts, particularly - I did not make this point earlier - because IAG, simultaneously gave British Airways workers, the same staff, a 10% pay increase as a reward for what they had done during Covid. That is shocking. What is the Taoiseach going to do to increase the minimum wage for low-paid workers? I met this week with private security workers who are on less than €12 an hour. Do they not deserve a decent pay increase?

They very decisively rejected a proposal to impose a pay freeze and cuts to allowances on them today, voting 85% against. Fair play to them. These are workers who have not had a pay rise since 2019, and the Labour Court was pushing to continue with the pay freeze for almost three more years when the cost of living is through the roof, as the himself has now pointed out. At the same time, IAG is now granting 10% pay increases at other airlines. Does the Taoiseach agree that a pay freeze is simply not fair during this cost-of-living crisis? Will he support these workers and oppose the attempts right across the aviation industry to use the pandemic to reshape labour relations in the interests of the bosses against the workers, for example, as we have seen at the Dublin Airport Authority, DAA, where it got a significant number of workers to sign up for severance and has rehired people on substantially worse terms and conditions?

As he will be aware, Sinn Féin tabled legislation that was supported by his party in opposition in the previous Dáil and which we will be reintroducing in the coming weeks. This legislation, when passed, will give workers a choice to retire at 65 or to work on. Forcing workers to retire at 65, as his Government partners are finding out, when they are fit and able and may want to work on, especially where they cannot access the State pension rate of pay, is deeply unfair. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on any discussions that have taken place and any work done on this important worker's rights issue by the economic division of his Department? This morning, Ms Patricia King, the general secretary of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, outlined deep concerns that she and ICTU affiliates have in relation to a complete lack of consultation on the right to request remote working. The matter is being referred to in industrial relations circles as the right for employers to say no to remote working. The lack of consultation led to deeply flawed legislation. We do not want to see that mistake replicated. What consultation and discussions have taken place on the abolition of mandatory retirement?

His question related to the economic division in my Department. Suffice to say that throughout the Covid period there was, unfortunately, a retrenchment in services. We have provided additional resources to the HSE in respect of the hiring of occupational therapists, physiotherapists and speech and language therapists. I will discuss this further with the HSE and the Minister of State with responsibility for disability regarding the report on Down's syndrome and we will follow through on it. There is a need to provide far greater therapeutic services to children with special needs more generally. Additional funding has been allocated in successive years. I am not clear whether the allocation has been provided specifically to services on the ground. We need to interrogate a bit further the money that has been allocated. Record funding has been allocated to the HSE in respect of therapeutic services, in particular in terms of the progressing disability model it has been pursuing for some years. Deputy Conway-Walsh referred to the west.

It was about TEN-T funding, but that is not the core funding. The core funding is in the national development plan in respect of roads and public transport. A sum of €165 billion is being provided over the next ten years for investment in infrastructure in the west. The Deputy referred to the development of renewable energy in particular. The western seaboard will receive considerable investment for renewable energy. The first phase is on the east coast and the west and south west will follow through. There is great potential in particular for offshore wind on the western seaboard. The potential is very exciting in terms of jobs and the economy in the future. The ring road around Galway, for example, is a major piece of infrastructure that has been bogged down in planning due to objections right through the process. I understand it is currently subject to a judicial review.

There has been very significant investment in the urban regeneration and development fund, URDF, programme by the Minister for Housing, Local Government and Heritage, Deputy Darragh O'Brien, in respect of many towns across the west. There is a whole range of investment vehicles from the State and the vast bulk of the investment is now generated by taxpayers and allocated through the various national strategies in terms of investment in the west. In response to Deputy Barry, as I referenced this morning, there is a significant issue facing the country in the context of inflation. It is a global phenomenon. There are no easy answers. The invasion of Ukraine by Russia, an illegal war, is going to add to inflation, in particular in respect of energy prices.I said earlier that in 2020, the country spent approximately €3.4 billion on imported fuels. In 2021, it spent €6.2 billion. That gives an illustration. There was a €2.8 billion increase in the bill for imported fuels and that reflects the higher prices on the international markets. A year ago, a barrel of oil cost $64 on international markets. Today, it costs $110. Oil prices have risen by $14 a barrel over the past week. This is not the Government's fault. It is just the reality of the international situation in regard to energy.

The same applies to natural gas, which costs 400p per therm today on international markets compared with 40p per therm last March. Gas prices have soared 220p per therm over the past week. We are going to face a very difficult situation. I gave the figures on wages, which have increased over the past while. In terms of the Government's response, we have increased the fuel allowance from €630 to €1,039 since we came into office a little over a year and a half ago. If we add on the €200 electricity payment, that is €1,239 we are giving to low-income families. Basically, it is a doubling of support to low-income families in the context of fuel supports. We have also taken other measures to support families, either with medical costs or in respect of reducing transport fees from the end of April, which will benefit approximately 800,000 users, and by reducing school transport fees. The budget contained in the region of €1 billion in measures to support people on social protection and tax relief for workers of about €630 million. We are and will be working with the European Commission in respect of the energy situation and energy prices. The European Commission will be coming forward with a further publication in that regard in the next ten days following the Russian invasion of Ukraine. We are facing a very difficult situation because of the war and because of President Putin's behaviour and activity. There is no question about that. There are no easy answers. It is pointless coming in and making ideological points or whatever. That is the point I would make.

Many people in the House were calling for that and we did it. The workers should be treated fairly and, in my view, on a par with UK employees in the same overall company.

I participated in the One Ocean Summit in Brest, France, on Friday, 11 February. Around 20 international leaders attended in person for Friday's high-level segment hosted by President Macron. This event was held in the context of the French Presidency of the Council of the European Union, with the support of the UN and in co-operation with the World Bank and other public, private and civil society partners. It feeds into a sequence of major international events on the oceans and seas in the first half of 2022, including a meeting of the United Nations Environment Assembly, the second phase of the COP15 UN biodiversity conference and a UN conference to support the implementation of sustainable development Goal 14, which is to conserve and sustainably use the oceans, seas and marine resources for sustainable development. My contribution to the One Ocean Summit was on the theme of "an ocean of solutions to climate change". I took the opportunity to highlight the following: the vast potential of Ireland's renewable energy resources, including for export, and associated commitments in our climate action plan and programme for government; the new licensing and regulatory regime being established by the Maritime Area Planning Act, including establishment of the maritime area regulatory authority; and the launch this year of Ireland's new state-of-the-art marine research vessel, RV Tom Crean, which will make an important contribution to the Horizon Europe mission to restore our ocean, seas and waters by 2030. The oceans comprise the largest component of the Earth's system that stabilises climate and supports life and human well-being. Given that our maritime area is seven times the size of our landmass, it also has particular significance for Ireland. I was happy to lend my firm support for this excellent initiative from President Macron to raise the collective level of ambition of the international community on marine issues. I pay tribute to President Macron for the enormous individual effort that he put into this conference, staying there for the entirety of it and contributing very significantly to it.

Is the Taoiseach confident that Ireland can achieve the 5 GW of installed offshore wind generation by 2030, which is the Government's own target? Is he confident that upon the establishment of the maritime agency, the marine area consents that would give effect to the potential for offshore wind will be realised? There is a massive opportunity in our native Cork for sites like the Verolme dockyard to be staging posts to service that industry, particularly on the south and south-west coast.

As the Taoiseach will be aware, Ireland has no legal tool with which to define, identify, designate or manage marine protected areas. As a result, many species, habitats and processes occurring in our extensive marine area have fallen outside the scope of area-based conservation, with consequent risks to marine biodiversity and ecosystem services that benefit people and nature. These are not my words. This is the advice of a senior Department official to a recent meeting of an Oireachtas committee. It is also worth noting that under the directive, Ireland's marine protected area should have been identified and underpinned in legislation two years ago. Nearly three years have passed since the Dáil declared a climate and biodiversity emergency, yet numerous targets set out in the national biodiversity action plan have not been met. Again, the Taoiseach will know from his keen interest in biodiversity that international best practice dictates that the marine planning framework should have been delivered in tandem with the marine protected areas legislation. In addition to the marine biodiversity protection targets that Ireland has missed and has yet to meet, there are seven renewable energy legacy projects, as well as new planning applications, that will be dealt with in the absence of the marine protected areas legislation.

Fishing ports such as Burtonport, An Daingean, Schull, Baltimore, Kilmore Quay and Killybegs will be hit massively. The Irish fishing quota has been slashed from 20% to 15% and the remaining 85% of fish caught in Irish waters will go to countries in the European Union. That is incredible. I would challenge the Taoiseach to name another Government anywhere in the world that has done such a wrong to an indigenous sector as has been done to the Irish fishing sector. Aontú’s Becky Kealy will host a meeting in Bandon this Friday night to fight for the rights of fishing families and Patrick Murphy from the Irish South and West Fish Producers’ Organisation will be there. The Taoiseach may not be too far away from the event and I would ask him, if he can, to go along to that event, listen to the needs of fishing families in this country and guarantee that their livelihoods will not be destroyed.

It might be worth considering that more than 50% of our gas, for example, comes from Corrib and that we can produce up to 80% or 85% of our own electricity, yet the prices are going through the roof. That is because we privatised it and we gave it away to for-profit companies. There are now developers and multinational companies literally queueing up to grab sites all around the country. They have identified the sites because the Government did not protect the marine areas as it should have, or only 2% of them when it was supposed to protect 30%. They are queueing up to grab our wind energy potential and our oceans. Will he acknowledge that when they develop that renewable energy, they will charge market prices for the use of those resources to the people of this country?

The latest report talks of a "rapidly closing window of opportunity to secure a livable and sustainable future for all". It says that up to three quarters of the world's population faces life-threatening climatic conditions this century due to extreme heat if we do not act to stop climate change. The IPCC chair, Dr. Hoesung Lee, warned that half measures are no longer an option. The report calls for 30% to 50% of our land, rivers and oceans to be conserved in order to maintain biodiversity, yet Ireland only has 2.4% of its seas covered by MPAs, MPAs. Will the Taoiseach act on the science when it comes to the devastation facing us. Will he act and agree to have 30% of our sea areas designated as MPAs?

Our oceans are the greatest habitat of all. Anja Murray writes in the Irish Examiner today that "The world’s oceans contain the last great wilderness on Earth". That is pretty powerful. It is true and we want it to remain true. I have often spoken of the abundance of whales, dolphins and marine wildlife off our coast. We need to introduce steps to protect that wildlife. There are two simple steps we can take immediately. First, is to support the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine in his push to increase the six-to-12 nautical mile fishing zone exclusively for the Irish fleet to 20 nautical miles. That would be an incredibly positive step both for wildlife and the fishing sector. Second, as other Deputies have noted, we need to urgently introduce legislation around MPAs and get to that target of 30% of MPAs.

The Government has been in office for about a year and a half or a bit more. In that time, the marine planning framework has been published. The Maritime Area Planning Act has been enacted. There have been very significant developments, particularly in respect of the development of wind energy to give certainty to investors. Unlike Deputy Boyd Barrett, I welcome investment in wind energy off our coast. I do not think that the State on its own will be able to develop wind energy. We will have to agree to disagree on that. There is tremendous potential. The sea is seven times the size of our land mass.

That is Ireland's goal in the climate action plan. That depends on harnessing offshore wind in particular. It is at approximately 43% of electricity generated now. In that context, the development of a new regulatory consenting regime for the offshore renewable sector in Ireland, including the introduction of maritime area consents provided for through the Maritime Area Planning Act, a route to market for future offshore wind projects through offshore renewable electricity support options. The Department of the Environment is working on all of this and has a very extensive work programme involving the development of a framework for offshore electricity transmission systems, updating the offshore renewable energy development plan and a cross-departmental offshore renewable energy delivery task force has been established to capture wider economic and business opportunities for offshore renewable energy, particularly in coastal areas. We are very concerned with regard to the issue raised by Deputies Christopher O'Sullivan and O'Reilly in respect of the need to protect ocean eco systems for sustainability purposes, to protect fisheries as a natural resource and to ensure fishing opportunities for future generations. That matter is constantly under review and is being developed in the context of fisheries policy. Deputy Tóibín's points are not valid because it is not the Government that did what he outlined; Brexit did it. That is the bottom line. Had we had a no-deal Brexit, it would have been far worse. The Deputy just made a presentation that was a classic of spin and distortion. He said that the Government is doing this. The Government wants to do nothing of the sort. Brexit caused this. It is a good idea and important to develop maritime protected areas. We have to consult with all of the stakeholders because otherwise Deputies will be back in with me saying not to do it here or there for various reasons. It is extremely important. Ireland was one of the first countries to become a whale and dolphin sanctuary, for example. It was the former Taoiseach, Charles J. Haughey, did that. He was ahead of his time in the context of marine biodiversity. However, we need to do more - and we need to do it faster - to protect our ecosystems because the IPCC report is very worrying indeed.

I am pleased to bring the Institutional Burials Bill 2022 before the House. This legislation will provide us with a legal basis to finally exhume the remains of children so tragically interred at the site in Tuam, reunite them with their loved ones and afford them a dignified burial. What happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience. Since coming into this role I have met with many of the families affected. In those meetings I have heard that sense of urgency and frustration around why exhumation has not yet happened and I share that frustration. These families want to give their loved ones the respect and dignity they were so grievously denied in their short lives. The uniquely tragic nature of the site at Tuam means legislation is required to undertake this work. This will be one of the most complex forensic excavation and recovery efforts ever undertaken, not only in Ireland but anywhere in the world. While Tuam will be the first such excavation and exhumation, I am conscious there are concerns about other sites, like Sean Ross Abbey and Bessborough. Since the general scheme was published it has been scrutinised by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth chaired by Deputy Funchion, as well as other stakeholders. I thank the Chair and all members of the committee for the detailed pre-legislative scrutiny, PLS, report they produced. I also thank those who engaged with the committee and those who have spoken with me directly for their constructive engagement on this legislation. In response to the PLS report and the wider feedback I have made significant changes to this legislation. Among these, I want to briefly draw attention to three key improvements, namely, we have removed the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, the legislation now requires that the forensic investigation must be done to international standards and we have increased the transparency and accountability by increasing involvement for stakeholders like family members and former residents of institutions. I will now outline the key parts of the Bill as initiated. Part 1 contains the standard Short Title, commencement and interpretation provisions. Section 2 provides definitions of key terms used in the Bill. A central term is "forensic excavation and recovery". This means the excavation of the land and the recovery and treatment of human remains in a manner sufficient to satisfy legal requirements regarding the use and storage of evidence in connection with the identification of human remains, including in criminal proceedings. Part 1 sets out the procedures for the service of documents and provides that it will be an offence to interfere with, or obstruct, the work of the director of an intervention or to use samples or DNA profiles generated in connection with an identification programme for unauthorised purposes. Part 2 provides that the Government can consider a proposal by a relevant Minister to intervene at a site where manifestly inappropriate burials have taken place of persons who died while ordinarily resident in that institution. Where the Government is satisfied an intervention is necessary for the purposes of safeguarding important objectives of public interest, it can direct that Minister to establish an office of a director of authorised interventions. The Minister will appoint a director to oversee the intervention and an advisory board to support and guide the director in the role. The director will be required to conduct a forensic-standard excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of human remains. He or she will be empowered to employ or contract the range of expertise and disciplines needed to discharge these functions to international best practice standard at a particular site. The director will also provide updates on the work of the office to relatives of persons believed to be buried at the site, other stakeholders and the general public. The director may also be required to undertake a DNA programme of identification. This is intended in the case of Tuam. The advisory board will provide advice and guidance to the director. The board will be chaired by a former coroner or someone with coronial expertise and will include scientific experts and - this is important - former residents, family members connected with a particular institution, or both. Consultation with the advisory board will be required at regular intervals, including at key decision points during the intervention. The addition of an advisory board responds to a number of recommendations made during the PLS process to enhance transparency and accountability, as well as to ensure meaningful engagement with families and with survivors. Part 2 also provides that a director can obtain information and documents from publicly-funded bodies and other persons to assist in the performance of his or her functions. Importantly, a director can also obtain information from Tusla that is contained in the database and related records of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes. It is an offence for persons to disclose confidential information obtained while performing their functions under the legislation. This provision has been enhanced in response to PLS recommendations to give the director the power to compel, rather than simply request, the production of the information or documents concerned. Part 3 of the Bill provides for the forensic excavation, recovery and post-recovery analysis of human remains to be carried out by appropriately-qualified persons in accordance with international standards and best practice. It provides that remains that are recovered will be sorted into individual sets in as far as is possible, that forensic testing will be carried out to establish as much information about the individuals as possible, including the circumstances and causes of their death, and that the director of an intervention will publish a general report on the findings. This Part is another significant new addition to the general scheme that was published in December 2019. This change responds directly to issues raised during PLS about the need the need to address how people died. A director of an intervention will be required to inform An Garda Síochána and the relevant coroner where evidence emerges of a violent or unnatural death or where remains are not those of a person who died while ordinarily resident in an institution. Part 4 provides the legal basis for a DNA-based programme of identification to be carried out in respect of remains recovered from an intervention site. The aim of an identification programme is to establish the likelihood that there is a familial link between people who believe they have family members buried at a site and the human remains that are recovered from that site and, where a familial link is established, to identify those remains. In response to concerns raised by family members and other stakeholders, the provision for a pilot identification programme, which was contained in the general scheme, has been removed. Instead the Bill provides that an identification programme will proceed where there are living family members of persons believed to be buried at the site who wish to participate in a programme and where DNA of sufficient quality is available from the remains to enable DNA profile comparisons. The Bill also provides for a review mechanism, whereby a director can make a decision in relation to continuation of a programme based on the advice of Forensic Science Ireland and consultation with the advisory board. DNA testing is, as we know, a very powerful tool which may reveal information about familial relationships to persons other than to the deceased relative that a person believes may be buried at a site. The legislation, therefore, has to balance the public interest of identifying remains buried in a manifestly inappropriate manner with the privacy rights of close living relatives. The general scheme sought to do this by limiting participation in an identification programme to parents, children, siblings and half-siblings of deceased persons and also by providing that the highest-ranking of those relatives had to provide consent or a person would be blocked from participating in the programme. The PLS recommended expanding participation and removing the hierarchy in the general scheme. I have responded to these recommendations by providing a much more inclusive and flexible approach to the balancing of the rights involved. In summary, this Bill now expands the family members who are eligible to participate to grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nieces and nephews of deceased persons. There remains a provision for the closest living relative, that is, a parent, child or sibling, to object to the participation of another less closely-related person. However, it is important to note an objection does not automatically mean a second order relative cannot participate in an identification programme. Any objection will be considered by a director. The director must balance the closeness of the genetic relationship of the person who wishes to participate and, importantly, the public interest of identifying human remains. The Bill provides that before an identification programme begins a director will hold a public information campaign to raise awareness about the programme and how eligible family members and spouses or civil partners of a deceased person can register an interest in participating; an objection to another person's participation; and also that they are interested in receiving remains if they are identified as family remains. They may also state their wishes in respect of the final arrangements for those remains. Again, this information campaign is newly-added into this draft. The director will create and maintain a register to capture all of these notifications from eligible family members. The benefits of this register are that it should allow eligible family members to express their wishes at a very early stage in the intervention process and assist in supporting wide-ranging participation, while providing a mechanism to recognise the rights of close family members.Importantly, in expressing an interest in participating in an identification programme, eligible family members can include a letter of support from relatives who would otherwise be able to object to their participation. The intention of these upfront letters of support is to help accelerate the process of approving an application to participate in an identification programme. In circumstances where neither an objection nor a letter of support has been received from a closer living relative who would be entitled to object to a person's participation, the director may make reasonable efforts to contact that closer living relative to establish whether she or he wishes to register an objection to the person's participation in the identification programme. Given the significant privacy and data protection rights involved, the director is required to take these steps. Where a person applies to take part in an identification programme, the director will first establish that the person is an eligible family member and has provided the required evidence of her or his relationship to the deceased person. The director must be satisfied that the person is fully aware of what is involved in the programme and is happy to participate. The director must give consideration to any objection from a closer living relative who may be entitled to object to a person's participation. The director will notify an applicant in writing of his or her decision as to whether that person may participate. Where the director notifies a person that she or he may not participate in the programme, the director will set out reasons for this decision. Importantly, a person whose participation has been rejected by the director can appeal the decision to an adjudicator established by the relevant Minister. Where a person is notified that he or she may participate in the programme, that person is therefore known as a "relevant person" for the purposes of this Bill. The Bill provides for participants in an identification programme to nominate up to two people to be notified of the outcome of a familial matching process in the event that they die or become incapacitated before the outcome of the DNA identification programme is complete and where there is no other relevant person in respect of the deceased person. Those people can receive remains where they have been identified. The DNA identification programme will involve taking samples from the human remains recovered from the site and relevant persons. My understanding is that this will entail an oral swab. Forensic Science Ireland, FSI, will generate DNA profiles from those samples and, at the request of the director, conduct DNA profile comparisons in respect of a relevant person to establish the likelihood of a familial link. The results will be notified to the director by FSI and the director will consider the results and any other relevant information and inform a participant as to whether, on the balance of probability, a familial link has been established. A finding that the data are not sufficient to suggest a familial link can be appealed to the adjudicator appointed by the relevant Minister. The final arrangements for recovered human remains are considered in Part 4. The provisions in the Bill have been amended from those in the general scheme as a response to a number of the recommendations of the pre-legislative scrutiny report. The Bill now provides that, once identified, remains will be returned to family members or final arrangements will be made in line with their wishes. This is clearly stated in the Bill. Where identification of remains is not possible, final arrangements are similarly undertaken in line with the wishes of all those who consider they are family relatives of those interred at the site. A director will make arrangements as soon as practicable after a familial link has been established or where an identification programme has concluded. In response to a pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation, and in order to facilitate potential developments in forensic testing, the Bill provides for the Minister to make regulations for further forensic testing of samples, subject to the consent of relatives, after an identification programme has been completed. In this regard, a prohibition on the cremation of remains that have not been identified has been included in the Bill so that they may subsequently be tested if scientific advances allow for such. Part 5 provides for a director to acquire temporary rights of access to land required in order to undertake an intervention, with an obligation to provide reasonable compensation and to restore land to its original condition and use upon completion. The compensation amount will be calculated by a relevant professional and will take account of a number of relevant factors, including the period for which access is required, the extent of the works and the disturbance to a trade or a person's peaceful enjoyment of land. It is open to an landowner or occupier to challenge access to the land or the amount of compensation being offered. A challenge to the level of compensation does not affect the work and the director can carry out the intervention while the case is before the court. However, a challenge to access has the potential to delay the work of the director. The primary access provided for in this Bill is to a principal burial site described as "principal burial land". Where the principal burial land is on residential land, access can extend up to the curtilage or 20 m, whichever is the lesser, of any dwelling on the land. The Bill also provides for access to residential land adjacent to the principal burial land where burials associated with burials on the principal burial site have taken place, described as "ancillary burial land". In this case, access does not extend further than 2 m from the boundary of the land or encroach on any dwelling on the land. Access can also be obtained to ancillary land where burials have not taken place but where access is required in order to facilitate works. Part 6 contains provisions related to the dissolution of an office of a director. On dissolution day, all functions, assets, liabilities and records shall be transferred to the relevant Minister. It also provides that a director will prepare and submit a final report of the director prior to dissolution day. Following submission of this report, the relevant Minister shall, within 12 months, undertake a review of the implementation of the legislation in regard to that particular intervention. A report on the review will be published. The review mechanism is included in the Bill as a response to a pre-legislative scrutiny recommendation. Before I conclude, it is important that I pay tribute to the work of all those who have worked to bring us to this point, in particular Catherine Corless. She became a voice for these children and the State owes her a great debt. What happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience. We can never erase the immense tragedy of what happened there, but this Bill will allow us, at long last, to afford the children interred at that site a respectful burial. It is long past time that we afford these children that basic dignity, which has been denied them for such a long time. I urge Deputies on all sides of the House to work constructively with me to see this legislation passed promptly so that we can finally begin the vital work of honouring these children by exhuming their remains, identifying them, allowing the return of their remains to their loved ones and affording them a dignified burial. Everyone in the House is in agreement that this is the very least that we can do. I commend the Bill to the House.

We welcome this legislation. I wish to acknowledge all of the babies and children about whom we are speaking. Sometimes, there are no words to describe a tragic situation. As the Minister stated, we owe Catherine Corless a great debt of gratitude. She was actually in the Chamber for the pre-legislative scrutiny discussions. It was during Covid and, thankfully, we were able to open the Chamber up to a number of people. It was fitting that she had the opportunity to address our committee. I pay tribute to her and all of the advocacy groups. There was an expectation during the general election. People had been invited to the pre-legislative scrutiny stage during that Dáil term and they had hoped that this legislation would be passed. As such, I am conscious of how much time has passed and how anxious everyone is to see this situation resolved. I wish to acknowledge the considerable work that was done by the committee during our pre-legislative scrutiny.Deputies Ward and Cairns who are here are also members of the committee along with others. This was the committee's first pre-legislative scrutiny. It took a long time. I sometimes wondered if we would ever get it all together, but we did. It is refreshing that some of the committee's recommendations have been taken on board. I hope I do not regret saying this but it is the first time I have engaged in a process where one can see the work being reflected back. This shows that when that process is done correctly and respected in the way it should be it can result in good and strong legislation. In all legislation, we should be listening to those who are affected by it or those who work in the area. Consultation is always key. I acknowledge the role of the coroner and that jurisdiction is going to be maintained. That is really important. That came up time and again. It was a key concern for people. They were worried around potentially disallowing the powers of the coroner. We all know that that was really important so I welcome that. I would welcome some more information in regard to the 20 m rule. The Minister might provide more detail on that in his closing remarks. It is one of the issues about which since publication of the Bill we have been contacted by people. They are concerned that this might mean that there cannot be an excavation in certain areas. If may not mean that, but I would welcome more information on it. Given how near the Tuam site is many residential areas, will there be any negative affect arising in that regard? I would welcome more clarity and information on that. Another concern brought to our attention was the criteria for an intervention. Some people are concerned that the criteria are still a little too rigid or strict. As with all aspects to do with mother and baby institutions and as has been acknowledged by the Minister in the past, there is a fear and a distrust among people. They are always thinking worst case scenario. I do not blame them for thinking that way because that has been their treatment at the hands of the State for decades. I would welcome some clarity in regard to the criteria and the 20 m rule. I noted in the Minister's speech a reference to the family members and the hierarchy, which also arose in the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill. The Minister mentioned that there will be an appeals mechanism. I would welcome more information on how the Minister sees that playing out. On the chair of the board being a former coroner or having coronial experience, that is vital. It is really important that we have people who know all of the ins and outs and various pieces of this, that there is stakeholder engagement and that involved in that would be survivors and other people who are relevant to that process and the consultation with the family members. I welcome the Bill and I am glad to note that many of the committee's recommendations from the PLS have been taken on board. I ask the Minister to address my concerns in regard to the criteria, the 20 m rule and, in particular, the criteria piece for other potential sites. People are afraid that if they come forward with real information on a particular site they will be told they do not fit the criteria. They are some of the fears. It is important to relay them to the Minister. We welcome the Bill and we look forward to Committee Stage.

We support the introduction of this Bill primarily around that statutory basis and framework to authorise interventions at Tuam where manifestly inappropriate burials took place. I have some concerns. The Minister touched on some of them, but some more information would definitely be welcome, particularly in regard to other sites, the role and function of the agency director, the 20 m distance mentioned by my colleague, Deputy Funchion, and the definition of what constitutes a relative. We know that children died in greater numbers in these homes at a much higher rate than was normal at the time. We know that they died of malnutrition, neglect and severe mistreatment and that they were cruelly discarded in unconsecrated grounds, septic tanks and mass graves. It is because we know this that the role of the coroner will be crucial in any and all investigations. There can be very little doubt that what happened in Tuam could most likely have happened in other institutions throughout the country. I have some reservations as to whether this legislation will sufficiently address those other sites. They too also deserve to be thoroughly investigated. I would like to read into the record a quote from email that I am sure the Minister also received this afternoon from Breda Murphy, the PRO of Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance. She says: The proposed legislation will outlive us to impact and dictate how we as a society/country treat our deceased who have not been afforded due rights at the time of death and subsequent burial or as in the case of Tuam, disposal of remains. The report to State by Dr. Geoffrey Shannon focused on the rights of the deceased continuing after death; the rights to a dignified burial and the rights of family to know of how their deceased loved one lost their lives.As legislators, we have a responsibility to those who seek answers and pursue what is right that as technology and science advances we remain open to, when necessary, amend legislation to ensure it delivers that truth for those who seek it. Fundamentally, people want to know the detail and the context in which their loved ones died and to ensure they have a proper and dignified burial.

The incarceration of girls and women and the forceable removal of their children is something we as a society carry to this day. This generation must undo the wrong done to them and so not pass this loss and trauma to another generation. We support the introduction of this Bill. There are some good provisions within it. It shows what can be achieved when we work together in pre-legislative scrutiny. My colleagues put a great deal of work into this under the chairmanship of Deputy Funchion. It is really encouraging to see that so much of that work has been taken on board. It is important to acknowledge that. I listened to the Minister's speech. There is still a bit too much vagueness in regard to the threshold sites will have to meet for thorough investigation, the precise role of the agency director, the distance requirement, the definition of what exactly constitutes a relative and the functions of the coroner. Coroners have a vital role to play in our society, not least when it comes to institutional burial. In north Kildare, we are blessed to have an outstanding coroner in Professor Denis Cusack. His compassion and tenacity when advocating for the people who died during Covid-19 was to be admired. I am concerned that in this Bill there is still a lack of clarity on the division of labour between the director and the coroner. There is equally a lack of clarity on the circumstances in which the director will involve the coroner. The coroner's involvement not being automatic or a given might be problematic not only for the families and relatives but for wider society given the weight and sensitivity and injustice of what is involved, what is being examined and what is supposedly being addressed in this Bill. Irish children died in these places at a rate higher than in the rest of society. They died of neglect and hunger in their stomachs. They also died of skin hunger, a condition that affects babies who are not held, cuddled or touched. They died from lack of human affection. Hungry in body and soul they were then, in the case of Tuam, abandoned in a septic tank. This Bill must facilitate proper examination of all sites. If it does not, it adds insult to the injury of the death of innocents. I acknowledge the work that has gone into this Bill and I welcome the Minister's acknowledgement of the work of Catherine Corless.She has been a voice for those children and other groups. What happened in Tuam is a stain on our national conscience. This Bill is welcome and important.
#MarkWard	unknown-#MarkWard-party	unknown-#MarkWard-dob	unknown-#MarkWard-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	303	As the Minister was delivering his opening statement, I was thinking of some of the interactions I have had with him on other Bills in the past when my knuckles turned white with anger - not directed at the Minister but for the sake of the women and children who suffered in these mother and baby homes. It is refreshing to see some movement on this Bill. It is welcome. The Minister and Deputy Funchion acknowledged the work that was done by the Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth. Deputies Bacik and Cairns, who are members of the committee, are also present. The role the committee played was collegial and we were all pushing in the same direction. It is good that the Minister took many of the recommendations of the committee on board in the process of preparing the legislation. I wish to particularly mention the Chair of the committee, Deputy Funchion, who steered us through a difficult and emotive journey. That said, I have a few concerns about the legislation, one of which relates to the role of the coroner. That was one of the key issues in the discussions of the committee and for the advocate groups. I welcome that the role of the coroner is now back in the process. I recognise that the Minister has restored the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner. That is important. However, there is still some uncertainty around the role of the coroner. This has already been said but I will say it again. We know that children died in large numbers in these homes. We know they died of malnutrition, neglect and severe mistreatment. We know that babies were cruelly discarded in unconsecrated ground, septic tanks and mass graves. However, we do not know if the role of the coroner in this Bill will be central to all investigations. That is something we need to know. The test for interventions remains effectively the same as it was in the heads of the Bill. While I accept that the legislation as currently drafted may adequately address the circumstances around Tuam, I have serious misgivings about whether the legislation will, in fact, sufficiently address other mother and baby home sites. The criteria for intervention remain effectively the same as they were prior to pre-legislative scrutiny. Despite positive reports in the media, particularly relating to Tuam, survivors who have contacted me and advocates, and no doubt the Minister too, are apprehensive that the make-up of this legislation suggests that the director of authorised intervention will only investigate or exhume bodies if they are accessible and not within 20 m of a dwelling. That could be hugely problematic. We need to be genuine about pursuing a programme of restorative justice. We need more information on how the Minister thinks the 20 m rule and the role of the agency, in conjunction with the coroner, will work. Have all possible scenarios been worked out and legislated for? The role and purpose of memorials at certain sites is still unclear. There is an indication that the new director could choose the memorialisation of certain sites over thorough investigation or exhumation. Will the new director be able to choose the option of memorialisation for certain sites? If the director can do that, what is the justification and what are the criteria set down for such a decision? I thank all the witnesses and groups who sat before the committee and engaged with the process. I also thank every individual who has contacted me on a personal basis for informing me and telling me their very personal stories about this emotive issue.

This is a fairly in-depth Bill. I thank everyone who was involved in this process. I have spoken in the Chamber many times. Sometimes we can work together and achieve great things. We are going in the right direction but, unfortunately, what happened in the past has brought us to where we are now. Nearly 30 years ago, I worked with my dad. We worked on headstones, dug graves and whatever else. I remember exhuming 92 people from a convent graveyard a number of years ago. I know how sensitive it is for the relatives of those being exhumed. I know how strict it is. I also know how the county manager, county council, coroners and An Garda Síochána get involved. It is an in-depth process. I am not here to knock the Bill. I genuinely believe we are going in the right direction. There is a sense of fear among the public but to be honest, who could blame them? That fear factor dates back generations, which is why we are having this discussion. I am familiar with the situation in Tuam and, especially, the situation in Bessborough in Cork. Every year, we go down there to meet survivors and listen to their stories. Unfortunately, the numbers are getting smaller each year. It is harrowing to hear those stories. All Deputies have heard personal stories. I welcome the removal of the pilot programme because many concerns were raised about it. Balancing privacy rights and the public interest is very difficult. I am sure the legislation can be tweaked again in that regard. The information campaign could be an asset. As can happen in any Department, if the public is left without proper information, the truth can get lost, the process can be broken and the fear factor can return. That fear then turns to suspicion and we are left in a position where nobody works with anybody else because of fear and suspicion. We do not want that. We need to push forward. I am conscious of the survivors and family members watching this debate. Sometimes politics can be left at the door and we can work together collectively. As I have said before, we are legislators. We are servers of the people and we are supposed to work for them and their betterment. Sometimes we have to put down the hatchet and sit around the table to work together collectively to do the right thing. I thank everybody who was involved in this process. This has been going on for a very long time. I congratulate all parties because we have done the right thing. Working together, it is possible at times to get things right. I will be watching the progress of the Bill. As I said, this is a happy day but also a sad day. We are discussing the past and what happened but, on the other hand, it is nice to be able to say that while the legislation might not be perfect yet, we are moving in the right direction. It is going to give solace and closure to the people affected. I hope this country will learn from the mistakes of the past and we will never have to see these things again.

We are seeing the deaths of children and civilians. That makes us all reflect on the importance and privilege of being able to debate legislation in a debating chamber in a parliament in a peaceful democratic republic. We must all reassert the true value of democracy. The war in Ukraine reminds us all not to take that for granted. I wanted to preface my remarks with that. I know that feeling is shared across the House. I did not get to speak in the debate on Ukraine last night but I will be speaking later in the debate on Palestine with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and will express that view again. My colleague, Deputy Howlin, spoke passionately in support of, and in solidarity with, the people of Ukraine in the debate last night, as did many others in a genuinely cross-party manner. I acknowledge that. I welcome the opportunity to speak for the Labour Party on this important Bill and to express our support for it. I express the sincere sympathies of the Labour Party and my colleagues to the survivors of Tuam and other mother and baby homes, and their families. I also pay tribute to the tireless work of Ms Catherine Corless who did so much to uncover the fact and true extent of the burials at Tuam. Her work has been crucial to the development of our knowledge on this issue. Like other speakers, I have had immense levels of correspondence from constituents and survivors, who have been so courageous as to get in touch with us to share their personal stories and those of their families. I thank them for this because it really does enrich our knowledge and understanding as legislators when we come to look at Bills in this area. We legislators must, therefore, do right by survivors by ensuring the swift passage of legislation to address the outstanding issues that remain following the scandalous treatment of women and children in mother and baby homes throughout the 20th century, until as recently as the late 1990s. I recognise the Minister's commitment to bringing this legislation forward swiftly. I also acknowledge the immense work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth, led by Deputy Funchion. I have been fortunate to work with her and colleagues on the committee in recent months. Indeed, we are engaging later this evening on amendments to the Birth Information and Tracing Bill. A great deal of work has been done by committee members, including Deputy Cairns and others, on the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill before us today. I thank my Labour Party colleague, Deputy Sherlock, who was our representative on the committee for that process. I acknowledge that the Minister, as he said, has made changes to the Bill in the light of some of the recommendations made by the committee. That is very important and welcome. The purpose of the Bill is to provide a legal basis to enable some closure, finally, for survivors and the families of the children and babies who are buried at Tuam. Much of the Bill is technical, the aim being to create the statutory framework to enable exhumation and excavation to take place. The need for legislation was made clear upon publication of the report of the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes and certain related matters. On Tuam, we might reflect that the commission found there were 978 child deaths, 80% of them of children under a year old and 67% involving infants aged between one and six months. These are horrendous figures. We know the worst years were 1943 to 1947, when many of those deaths took place. It is very difficult to fathom the scale of what happened when we read the figures in the report but it becomes clearer when we think of each of those human stories and the impact on the mothers and families. When the report was published, there was unity in this House in calling for its recommendations to be given effect as quickly as possible. I am conscious that many of those who have contacted us are older persons who are worried they may not be alive to see the culmination of the legislative process. It is important that we deal swiftly not only with this Bill but also the Birth Information and Tracing Bill, which, as I said, we are debating in committee later, and with establishing the new redress scheme. I look forward to working constructively with the Minister and on a cross-party basis to ensure this key package of legislative measures is brought into place as swiftly as possible, albeit that we need to ensure the proposals are given adequate legislative scrutiny. I welcome the Minister's response to the report of the children's committee and the changes made as a result, including the removal of restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner and the alignment of the forensic investigative process with international standards. There are still some concerns being expressed to us by survivors that the language of the Bill may mean there are unnecessary limits placed on the coroner. It would be good to hear more about how that is being addressed in the Bill. Another positive development is the expansion of the survivor engagement provisions. I very much welcome the expansion of family participation in DNA identification in particular. We need to ensure such engagement is not just expanded through legislative provision but also through the processes that are put in place. The Minister has spoken about the public information campaign, which is very welcome, but we need more detail about it and about mechanisms for the involvement and engagement of survivors and families. As we all would acknowledge, there have been some unfortunate breaches of trust with survivors, such as the manner in which details of the commission's report were leaked, for example, and the initial inadequacy of communications with survivors who did not or do not have access to IT. There also were issues around misrepresentations of testimony in the report. All of these issues can and should be addressed. The public information campaign is a very welcome measure in the Bill because it will provide a better framework for consultation and involvement of stakeholders and survivors. We know a large number of people are affected by the issues dealt with in the Bill. A total of 56,000 mothers and 57,000 children passed through the mother and baby homes under investigation by the commission. Thousands more were resident in other institutions outside its terms of reference. We have spoken before in this Chamber about the shocking mortality rate for babies, not just at Tuam but also in the other institutions. It is shocking indeed that one in seven, or 15%, of babies, numbering 9,000, died before their first birthday in the homes covered by the report. Within the confidential committee section of the report, we learned of the true extent of abuse suffered by survivors, the widespread practice of forced labour and the extensive practice of coerced or forced adoption. We will be debating some of those issues at the committee this evening. In this regard, I note the powerful contribution of Carmel Cantwell, who spoke to Brian O'Connell on the "Today with Claire Byrne" show yesterday about her experience. They discussed a map dating from the early 1950s that labelled a site in the Bessborough home as a children's burial site. That is worth mentioning because this Bill, as the Minister said, has import beyond Tuam, albeit the latter is the main focus. We are all very conscious of some of the revelations about Bessborough as well. This map labelled a particular site as a burial site but, listening to those who appeared on the show, it appears there was no physical or documentary evidence of burials at the site. This sort of discrepancy is very upsetting and concerning for families, who naturally will wonder what it means when there is a burial site marked on a map. It is the sort of issue that was taken up so powerfully by Catherine Corless. In her appearance on the programme, Ms Cantwell spoke about her brother, William, who died and was labelled as an unclaimed baby, despite this not reflecting the reality of their experience. This very powerful interview gave a name to, and identifying details about, just one of the babies who apparently died at Bessborough. As I said, when we look at figures, we can sometimes forget the individual, human stories behind them. On the survivor engagement point, we are hearing from survivors and those affected, such as Ms Cantwell, that the voices of the mothers who went through the homes must be at the forefront and that all facets of the State response must be survivor-led. Is it possible to broaden the parameters of qualifying family members in the legislation to ensure they are as inclusive as possible, in recognition of the complexities of families, particularly in the context of how much time has elapsed since many of these deaths took place? I am conscious that we are all being contacted not only by people who were residents in homes but also those who may be cousins of babies buried there, for instance, or who know, through family folklore or history, that this happened. They should be brought within the scope of the legislation. It is sensible that the Bill reflects the period examined by the commission but we are all conscious that there are concerns remaining about the exclusion of some survivors from the proposed redress scheme because they were incarcerated in institutions outside the remit of the commission institutions, such as Temple Hill, Westbank, St. Anne's, Cork, Mount St. Joseph's and others. We also know there are issues around qualifying criteria in the redress scheme, which we will debate in due course when the legislation is brought forward Again, I ask the Minister to consider broadening the scope of persons covered by that legislation. Indeed, I wrote to him last month to ask that he revisit the matter. I am very glad to hear this Bill will not prevent future inquests or investigations into deaths at Tuam. While it is important that the primary focus of the Bill should be to give closure to families and reunite them, it is also important that we are careful not to repeat mistakes of the past, whereby survivors and families have felt re-traumatised when legislation has had the consequence of preventing them from seeking further justice or speaking out about the awful abuse they faced. I have in mind the residential institutions redress scheme, for instance, where that sort of gagging clause became very contentious and difficult for many survivors. There are a number of other concerns about the legislation, which we may address further on Committee Stage. Advocates have lamented the retention of the controversial provision empowering Ministers unilaterally to decide whether a site is to be exhumed and investigated or if it will be subject solely to a process of memorialisation. There are differing views among families and survivors about different sites and which is the most appropriate process. The key issue is to ensure adequate communication with the families affected to avoid further distress to the many people who may be seeking different outcomes from legislative interventions on these sites. I would like to hear from the Minister about that difference between those who might prefer simply to see a site memorialised and those who wish to see it fully exhumed and excavated. These are difficult questions to address. I would like to raise a specific question brought to me by the Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative, which notes that the redrafted Bill refers to institutional burial grounds and the definition of "institution" within section 2 relates to premises occupied by women or children or both. The Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative is asking whether this will cover illegal exhumations and reburials of women from institutions, which is another key point because we know that there may be scenarios that have, as yet, remained uncovered and that may need to be covered by this legislation. We are all conscious that Catherine Corless's tireless work uncovered so much that had been unknown or only guessed at previously and that there may still be further revelations to come. Without the key role that she played and that other historians and archaeologists have played, we would not know, for example, about reported burials in Bessborough or the horrendous mass grave uncovered at Tuam. I want to again acknowledge Catherine Corless’s work and the work of other historians. In particular, I want to acknowledge Catherine Corless. Her work in taking out the death certificates of each of the 796 children who died at the Tuam mother and baby home gave rise to such a powerful sense of outrage at this evidence beyond doubt of a culture in which institutional and structural abuse of women and children was widespread throughout the country. The State owes her a great debt of gratitude. The Minister rightly said that what happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience and people like Catherine Corless have been so important in uncovering those stains. Throughout the past decades there are those who have shown incredible strength, resilience and determination in telling their stories. They have faced up to a powerful State and church that have been happy to maintain the status quo and culture of silence that we have often spoken about. I reiterate my gratitude and that of my Labour Party colleagues to those activists. I look forward to further debate on this Bill on Committee Stage.

I do not want to make this religious but I am acutely aware of the suffering that the families of the victims of those who have been buried have endured over the decades and that they still endure. The Minister acknowledged that and he understands it and we need to put that to an end as quickly as possible, while also recognising the suffering of the babies who were neglected and the babies who suffered at the hands of the State and the religious institutions. It must never happen again. Above anything else, I want to acknowledge Catherine Corless and to express my deep gratitude to her for doing what she has done, for being Catherine Corless and for being the tenacious person she is. She is dedicated to justice and to getting justice for victims and families and without her, none of us would be standing here today. I also want to acknowledge all those who have contacted me and other Deputies individually and I acknowledge the families who have shared their stories with me. It is probably one of the most humbling experiences I have had as a politician. I want to acknowledge Sheila outside the gate, who many of us will know here from speaking to here every time she is here. She was out there in the rain today and she has suffered and tried to get the stories of victims across. I welcome this Bill and we have an opportunity here to do the right thing. There are lots of good things in this Bill and I thank the Minister for that. I thank my colleague, Deputy Funchion, for the work she has done on behalf of Sinn Féin in the committee. Everybody has worked together to make this legislation what it needs to be. The families need to be front and centre of it and some of them have concerns. Some of those concerns have been addressed in the Minister’s contribution earlier on and I thank him for that but there are still some things outstanding such as the 20 m rule that was acknowledged. The Minister will understand that Bills can be legalistic and that they have to be written in a certain way. We need to make every effort to explain every line of the Bill. Some will be concerned at the number of times the word "may" is used in the Bill. Trust needs to be built up again and we need to listen to families at this point and whatever amendments need to be put in must be put in. One person who contacted me said that as this is the legislation that will be there for generations to come, we need to make sure that the families, victims and survivors are front and centre of all of that.
#HollyCairns	unknown-#HollyCairns-party	unknown-#HollyCairns-dob	unknown-#HollyCairns-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	307	I want to acknowledge that today will be another difficult day for the survivors of mother and baby homes and other institutional systems. This is an extremely sensitive topic, which unfortunately is compounded by the timing of this session on the same day the Committee on Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth will discuss the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022. Chrissie Tully, now 90 years old, recently described how as an 18-year-old, she was incarcerated in the Tuam mother and baby home and her son, Michael was stillborn. He was immediately taken away from her in the Central Hospital in Galway and Chrissie believes he is in the Tuam site. She is rightly angry and confused as to why this law is necessary. She said:Legislation? For what? To open a grave full of dead babies? I never heard such nonsense. They don’t want to open the grave, that’s the truth. ... Where are the children? Where is my son? We’ve looked and looked. It’s like he never existed. ... What did they think the babies were? Would they like that done to their own? My son could be in the tank, he could be but we don’t know because they won’t open the thing. What’s the delay?I have to agree with her and with her son, who I spoke to this week. I still cannot understand why we need this legislation. Why has the coroner not investigated known mass graves? Why has the Garda not investigated the thousands of recorded unnatural deaths in mother and baby homes and other institutions? This Bill comes after years of inaction and the refusal of the State and successive Governments to acknowledge existing laws and to provide justice. For example, we have the Coroners Act 1962, in which coroners are obliged to act if remains are found in their district or if somebody dies in State care or custody. This Bill goes some way to addressing these issues but it is still not aligned with transitional justice and international human rights standards. The legacy of the Irish State's institutional past impacts individuals and families every day. Abuse, violations, and crimes continue to have real effects on people. Trauma, unrecognised injustice and stolen identities are living issues for thousands of people. This legacy is also embedded in the landscape in places where some of the worst crimes perpetrated by or facilitated by the State, often in conjunction with religious orders, occurred. Former mother and baby homes, county homes, industrial schools, psychiatric hospitals and other institutions have a deeply troubled past which we must come to terms with. Not only were these sites of incarceration, abuse and violence but they are also where people died in suspicious and unlawful circumstances. The scale and horror of Tuam forced action on this issue. The callous and criminal disposal of the remains of babies and children is still overwhelming. Even more disturbing is the reality that Tuam was not an isolated case. It is most likely the most severe example but we know of similar practices in other institutions. The State is compelled to act and Irish society needs a transitional justice approach to respond to the scale of this issue. Part of the process will be the challenging and painful excavation of known and suspected burial sites. We have a social and emotional aversion to disturbing burial grounds. However, the babies, children and adults who died in these institutions deserve graves, justice and to truly rest in peace. There is an obligation to investigate any and all deaths or inappropriate burials. Although it is hard to understand why we need this legislation in the first place as I said, I welcome this Bill as hopefully and finally presenting a mechanism to respectfully respond to our cruel past. I also want to recognise the work of the committee and its Chair, Deputy Funchion, and I recognise the work of the Minister in taking on board some recommendations from the pre-legislative scrutiny. Some of the issues identified then have been addressed and the entire membership of the committee is grateful for that. I was especially relieved to see the removal of the restriction on the jurisdiction of the coroner, the strengthening of the role of the director and the expansion of the identification programme.The care and attention given to this Bill by the committee contrasts with the Birth Information and Tracing Bill 2022, which we will discuss in committee later. Similarly, there still are several significant deficiencies in the Bill which the Minister needs to fix.  It must offer a robust and determined framework to provide justice without political or official interference. The State needs to ensure we effectively investigate unlawful or suspicious deaths, as well as allegations of torture or ill-treatment. The "Director of Authorised Intervention", as the new office is referred to in the Bill, must have the capacity and certainty to be able to intervene for all victims and survivors. It also must be able to support survivors and families in providing information about the disappearance, the fate of the disappeared person and the progress and results of any investigation. My first and major concern is about the requirement to establish a separate director and office to intervene in each site, rather than establishing a standing body which has the capacity to examine any known or potential site. On one level, this is a nonsensical approach. It is like setting up a separate police force for each individual crime, instead of a one for all crimes. A well-resourced office could build up knowledge and expertise in dealing with these highly sensitive matters. It could foster relationships with all stakeholders, especially survivors and family members. This would be more effective and reassuring for those affected. However, even more worrying is that this is a bureaucratic barrier. The Bill permits the Government, if a location meets a set of criteria, to set up an investigation of the site. This means that survivors, families, and campaigners will now be forced to advocate for interventions at known or suspected sites. Once again, the responsibility is being put back on survivors to ask for and seek justice. It is safe to say there is no doubt that the Tuam site will be examined. It has to be. The national outrage and international headlines that forced the Government to act in 2014 have guaranteed that. What about the many other sites throughout the country? How many of those will be deemed eligible? To quote from the Bill, "the Government may, from time to time, having considered a proposal made by a relevant Minister with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, by order" and in this context, "may" is the crucial word, as "shall" is the legislative language for something that will happen whereas "may" means it might happen. With everything we know about the horrors and abuse that happened in these institutions, the public outcries and the glaring need for truth and justice for survivors, the best the Government can say is that we might, in the future, do something about these mass infant graves. We might. Perhaps even more restrictive is the line, "with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform". Here is the cold, cruel reality of this Bill. It is about money, not justice. Any intervention at a site must legally get the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform. This hurdle is deeply troubling, given the Department’s position on the mother and baby homes redress scheme. One of the major defects of the Government's proposed scheme is the highly insulting requirement for individuals to have spent at least six months as a child in a mother and baby home. Recent revelations show that officials in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform were central to this cruel stipulation. They were concerned with this precedent having "far-reaching policy and financial consequences", that is, giving redress to the survivors of the worst forms of human rights abuses may see other survivors seeking redress. That is not to mention the fact that they also think somebody should potentially get €5,000 for something like a forced family separation, when we all know one could get more for slipping on a pavement. Money is their main concern, not justice. Then, they delayed the progress of the scheme. This is the Department that will now be given a veto on interventions at each and every site. Transitional justice or an obligation for truth are clearly not priorities for them. Survivors and campaigners have been scarred enough through interactions with the Department of Children, Equality, Disability, Integration and Youth and other Departments and bodies and now they will be obliged to jump through hoops for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform as well. Given all we know about mother and baby homes, illegal adoptions, other institutions and the treatment of survivors, the need for a separate office for each site is an intentional barrier that is contrary to transitional justice and human rights standards. Unfortunately, the Minister, so far, seems unwilling to acknowledge this point. The need to act on Tuam is pressing and highly necessary but this Bill will result in very few other sites being examined and it is hard to believe that is not its intention. I ask the Minister to give all survivors and their relatives the certainty of a standing independent office which has the capacity and commitment to intervene. There are still too many conditions and restrictions. This is another barrier. The committee’s report focused strongly on enabling as many sites as possible to be included in the legislation and for the capacity of a State agency to examine these sites. We warned that a high volume of conditions and restrictions may prohibit the Government from acting to facilitate exhumations, examinations, identification and investigation. Unfortunately, this is very much the case with the current Bill. At all stages, the Bill should be orientated to facilitate survivors and their relatives. It should work in their favour to address historical and living injustices. Whether the people affected want an intervention at a site is a separate issue, but they should all be entitled to that option. The most obvious restriction is that the register of manifestly inappropriate burials is still the primary criterion, while there is not the same emphasis on suspicious or unlawful deaths. The committee recommended that interventions at sites should give due consideration to suspicious or unlawful deaths, as well as the existence of inappropriate burials. We also recommended that the Bill include any burial site where the circumstances surrounding the death or body disposal method or both warrant an investigation as to their lawfulness. These elements are not properly present in the Bill. Human rights experts and those advocating a transitional justice model pushed strongly for these criteria. The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has strongly highlighted the State’s obligation to effectively investigate unlawful or suspicious deaths, as well as allegations of torture or ill-treatment. There needs to be a clear prioritisation of action because of suspicious or unlawful deaths, alongside what the Bill calls, "manifestly inappropriate burials". Section 8 also contains restrictions on when an intervention can apply. The inclusion of the need to respect the views of the relatives of persons buried in the land is an important aspect which featured prominently in the committee discussion. It gives recognition of their role in the process. However, other restrictions are too vague and unnecessary, to the extent that they seem like intentional barriers. The provision regarding the "social and economic interests of the State" is the clearest example. What does it mean and what possible measure could be used to objectively measure that? Economic interest means money, again. An intervention could be refused because of potential cost or the budget situation in any given year. This is an ambiguous and relational standard; one that is not compliant with human rights and transitional justice and has no place in law. The history of injustice surrounding this issue, and the refusal of state bodies to engage with survivors, give them basic information or recognise their rights at all combine to indicate that these criteria can and will be used to refuse interventions. It is also worth noting that this would be the State’s social and economic interest, not the people’s, and certainly not the survivors. The inclusion of "public health" is another ambiguous criterion and is ironic given our chronic underinvestment in that area. Similarly, archaeological features, which are regularly paved over for infrastructure projects, are being elevated in significance to prevent examinations of sites. Are we serious with these restrictions? An investigation and evacuation of a mass grave may be refused because it is near a standing stone. If this was not such a serious topic, it would be comical. The Minister has to recognise these features for what they are; barriers. Outside of providing for the views of relatives and the dignity of the deceased, section 8(3) has to go. This Bill has to be about facilitating interventions, not putting more barriers in place for a group of people who have suffered oppression and injustice for all of their lives. The committee’s first recommendation is very clear. It states:The focus of the Bill should be on victims and survivors and their rights. The Bill should not limit the extent to which the various sites can be investigated.Currently, the Bill does not do this. There are multiple interconnected and reinforcing limitations. The next point concerns a contradictory element in the Bill concerning justice for people who died in violent or unnatural circumstances. The Bill requires the director to inform An Garda Síochána and the coroner if a body is discovered with evidence of death in violent or unnatural circumstances.This evidence can be assessed only if an intervention occurs, however. I outlined multiple obstacles in the Bill that will vastly restrict the number of examinations There is documentary evidence of thousands of deaths in State-run or State-funded institutions. However, because the Bill does not allow for interventions based on unlawful or suspicious deaths, the majority of these crimes, of which we are all aware, may never be investigated. State and religious bodies are being protected by this contradiction while survivors and their relatives continue to live with uncertainty about the fate of their loved ones. While I welcome the changes that remove the exclusion of the coroner in this process, we need a more proactive approach to include An Garda Síochána and coroners in examining known mass graves. The committee found that there was enough evidence from the Commission of Investigation into Mother and Baby Homes to trigger coronial investigations into how individuals in institutions died. I have no sense that this is happening or that this Bill will encourage this action on the scale required to deal with the volume of sites around the country. I am deeply concerned this Bill will fail to provide justice for so many families. The complex issue of contested intervention is highly sensitive. Survivors, relatives and the wider community will have mixed feelings about disturbing burial grounds or even inappropriate ones; the resting places of victims of Ireland's cruel institutional past. We have a responsibility to be respectful and precise in discussing this. At the committee, fears were being whipped up around forcible excavations of angel plots, which is untrue and unhelpful. The specific mention of respecting relatives’ views is important. The mechanisms to achieve this will, however, need to be very finely tuned to engage affected people respectfully to balance and weigh up different perspectives and ensure justice for the deceased. It is a deeply complicated issue that was the subject of extensive discussion at committee and, to be fair, we passed on responsibility to the Minister. It is important to acknowledge that. It is morally dense and emotionally fraught but the Minister has responsibility in this area. We have sites where some survivors and relatives want memorialisation rather than intervention. Simultaneously, other survivors want examination to know if their loved one is buried there and larger principles of transitional justice must be considered. There is no perfect outcome in these situations. Nonetheless, we need transparent and accessible mechanisms, which are as equitable as possible, to accommodate deeply held but potentially conflicting views. The Bill needs a stronger articulation of the principles underlying this process. While the Bill recognises these decisions, there is no architecture for it to occur. How will these decisions be reached? Who will make them? What systems will be available to people? Whose voice counts? How will a relative be defined in this context? This is an incredibly important point and there are still too many uncertainties. The Bill needs to include these elements to avoid potential upset, conflict and even litigation. Finally, I acknowledge the progress made in improving the Bill. There is clear evidence of the Minister listening to the submissions from different witnesses who shared their experiences with the committee. There is still more work to be done, however. This Bill currently has too many restrictions on survivors and relatives being able to seek interventions. It has ambiguous terms and ill-defined processes to engage with affected people and balance differences. It does not have a basis in transitional justice. Mother and baby homes, industrial schools and other institutions are the most horrific parts of Ireland’s recent past. They mark some of the worst crimes committed by agents of the State and religious orders. The buried remains of victims are one of the most tangible and raw aspects of this history. Across the country, there is a dark geography of mass unmarked graves. It is essential to respond to that awful past. It is part of the process of acknowledging abuse and violations of girls, women, victims of rape, disabled people, people who were illegally adopted and so many more. There is a clear and crucial focus on Tuam. That cannot detract from the many other sites and survivors. Every one of them deserves justice and needs this Bill to guarantee that justice.

Before I continue, I acknowledge how engaged the Minister and his staff have been. He listened to families, survivors and the wider community and made changes in this legislation that were recommended to him. We had a very lengthy process at committee but it was good that we did so. The Chairman, Deputy Funchion, and committee members from all parties worked extremely hard. We were honoured to listen to the stories we heard and we were all affected by them . There is no question about it. I know that when we left that particular committee, we went home and thought back on what happened, and it was very hard. It is important today that we have really listened to the voices of the survivors. We have waited a long time for this legislation and now it is vital that we see it pass. Relatives are ageing. That is putting it bluntly, but they are. The babies in Tuam particularly have already been left too long. The site at Tuam is complicated; probably one of the most complicated in Europe. The Minister’s introduction into this Bill of intervention to be carried out by professionals, in line with international standards and best practice so as to maximise what is scientifically achievable with regard to the identification and return of remains, gives us the best chance of reunification. We must see this Bill pass quickly and enacted so we can begin the process. We need this lawful basis for a forensic excavation, recovery and analysis of remains at the site of the former mother and baby institution in Tuam, undertaken to international standards. We will need this at other sites too and this Bill will allow that. A number of changes have been made to the legislation since the general scheme was published to ensure it does not restrict any further investigations elsewhere. This is so important. I raised my concerns regarding the restrictions on the jurisdiction of the coroner in the general scheme. I am glad to have seen it removed entirely. That is important. The Bill will now require forensic excavation, recovery and analysis of remains to support, where possible, establishing circumstances and cause of death. This was a chief concern for many witnesses who appeared before committee. This Bill will allow DNA-based identification to be undertaken to reunite families with the remains of their loved ones. While this is complicated, broadening the contributors who can actually come forward to grandparents and aunts is really welcome. A parent or a sibling can still request that only first-order relatives can be considered but the director can assess these requests now and make a decision so that the children have the best possible chance of having a dignified burial, service and resting place with the family that was denied to them when they died. That is so important. We all know the excavation, recovery and identification process will be extremely complex because of the numbers, the ages of the children, the manner in which the remains lay and, of course, the passage of time. This legislation allows that to happen for those babies, however. I will support this wholeheartedly for the families, the communities who mourned them and this country to begin making amends. Again, I am honoured to have been part of that committee. This has to happen really quickly. As I said, people are ageing and they need to know. It is important now that they know we have been listening to them. I thank the Minister. This has been very hard for all of us. We are moving to a good place where we can now give people the answers for which they have been looking.

I will quote the Minister, who said, "What happened at Tuam is a stain on our national conscience." That is what happened at Tuam and in all the various mother and baby homes with the incarceration and treatment of women and children. At Bessborough, Sean Ross Abbey and in all the various institutions, the State failed to look after its citizens, from the youngest to the oldest. We all welcome this legislation, which is not before its time. It must be accepted that a huge amount of due diligence has been done by the committee and Deputy Funchion. We need to make sure in the future that if any difficulties or anomalies arise, we get over them. It is vital that we would not in any way put through legislation that could impede. We want to exhume the remains of the children who were tragically lost in Tuam and elsewhere. That is necessary for them and for their families. We have all met with people who have been directly impacted. There is a time constraint on us because many of these people are very old. We need not only to be seen to do justice; we have to offer them the justice that they have not received for a significant part of their lives. I acknowledge the work that has been done by Catherine Corless and others in highlighting this issue. We might not be in the place that we are if it was not for their efforts. I welcome the interaction with the Minister, particularly in terms of the key recommendation not to remove the jurisdiction of the Coroners Act. All of these things are vital. There is still work to be done around the 20 m criteria. We need to ensure like that this does not become an obstacle. Therefore, I hope that the Minister will personally ensure that whatever piece of due diligence needs to be done is done. This will ensure that this legislation is fit for purpose and that we can have justice for those people who have been failed so badly by this State. I have no doubt that there will be full support across this House in doing this. Justice is better served late than never.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	310	I was all ears in listening to the concerns that Deputy Cairns raised. They were very detailed. I look forward to the Minister’s response to them. On their way in here, I am sure most Deputies will have noticed that, yet again, Sheila is outside the gates with her display on the mother and baby homes and the suffering that went on. In that, she mentions the 9,000 children who are alleged to have died across the 18 homes. Sean Ross Abbey is mentioned, as are Bessborough, Castlepollard, Dunboyne and more. This reminded me of what happened about year ago when I watched a very interesting documentary on Al Jazeera. It showed aerial archaeology of Castlepollard and, around it, what are suspected to be graves. Whatever comes out of all of this, as well as from the legislation and the complications around it, we cannot just stop at Tuam. I want to begin by acknowledging that the Minister listened to the campaigners and the relatives in respect of the Tuam case. Catherine Corless has said that the Minister has taken on board issues that she and the campaigners had with the original draft of the Bill. I welcome that. I specifically refer to issues around the disapplication of the Coroners Act to those sites. To listen to and involve relatives in the process of the exhumation of remains and the identification of those remains has been hugely important. I also want to quickly raise a couple of issues that were brought to my attention today from the Separation, Appropriation and Loss Initiative. They have concerns regarding the Bill. They say that the Minister has retained a highly controversial provision that empowers Ministers to unilaterally decide whether a site is to be exhumed and investigated or subject to a process of memorialisation. It also says the proposal regarding an advisory panel is unambitious and it severely limits the input and guidance for so many survivors and their representative groups. Notwithstanding these concerns, it is important to acknowledge that the Bill is much changed from the original version. Legislation that continues to ignore the wishes and views of those who were directly involved in this terrible travesty in our history cannot proceed. It is good that the Minister has listened to survivors and their campaigners on this. However, I hope this also shows that if there is a political will to respond to witnesses and to those who are affected, we can also bring it into other aspects of legislation around the mother and baby homes and their legacy. This is because we have acknowledged, in relation to this specific Bill, that there are serious questions on the wider issues connected with Tuam and other sites in the context of the loss of all these children, and their mothers and what happened to them. The first issue I want to mention is the redress scheme and the attempt to place a time limit on it to those who can access it. There is an idea that those who spent less than six months in mother and baby homes should not be able to access the scheme. The Minister should listen to campaigners on this issue, as he has done in respect of the specifics of the Bill. It is certain that trauma and lifelong effects follow all of those who were in these homes for less than six months. That choice is an arbitrary and unscientific limit without any justification, either morally, ethically or legally. The second issue is the predicted cost of the redress scheme. According to a report, a redress scheme covering all 58,000 survivors of mother and baby homes would cost €1.6 billion - civil servants are alleged to have warned the Government that this will be the case - and could derail attempts to support the survivors who are most in need. Let us be clear about this. I really want to emphasise what I am about to say. Many of the institutions and orders that operated these homes possess enormous assets and lands. Others have built medical and hospital facilities - empires, really - on the graves of those infants. Again, if we have the political will, we can and should seize the assets of those orders and whatever remains of the legal entities that they have evolved into. We cannot repeat the disaster of the Woods deal whereby a subservient State and political class allowed the church and its institutions to put a figure on what it agreed to donate to the redress scheme relating to the torture and abuse of children in this country over decades. Those in the church were allowed to manipulate and drag their heels for years. They are still allowed to do so. I ask the Minister to show the political will to deal with the gaping wound that the commission's report has inflicted on the people who have been affected by this entire episode of our history. Let us be clear that the findings detailed in the commission report are not acceptable to many victims and survivors, full stop. This is not even to speak of a political level by Deputies and Senators, but of the people who are mostly affected. Several witnesses who testified to the commission found that excerpts from their evidence were taken out of the report. The report also contains inaccuracies, misrepresentations, etc. We all know how seriously damaging it was. We know that 9,000 children died in the homes that are under investigation. It is stated in the report that the commission found little evidence relating to issues such as forced adoptions, abuse and involuntary detention. Survivors have told us that the commission's findings flatly ignored and contradicted their personal testimonies. That cannot be allowed to stand. Moreover, it is not acceptable that a State-appointed commission should leave on the record the findings that institutions and religious orders were no more culpable for the torture and deaths in these homes than general society was. The attempt to lessen the responsibility of those directly responsible by referencing societal views is and remains the most egregious aspect of the report. We need to see a political will in this House to address and correct that. The attempt to absolve the sins of religious orders by blaming us all is further abuse of the victims. I will conclude by asking the Minister to show the same political will in addressing those issues as he has done in addressing the Tuam issue in the details of the Bill before us.

I was about to say that this a painful part of our past but it is not. For many people, this is a painful part of their present. It is likely to be a painful part of their future too. I hope that this Bill can help to ease that pain. Perhaps it will not be a painful part of their future, because this Bill will enable us to get truth. From truth we can get justice. From justice we can hopefully bring some healing. Ultimately, it is essential that we do that in order to help heal the scars and the wounds that have been caused by the horrific actions and the horrible things that happened to mothers and their children in these homes. I thank the Minister for bringing forward the Bill. I will return to specific aspects of it. I thank also Deputy Funchion, as Chair of the committee, for leading our pre-legislative scrutiny. The Bill was one of the first big items of pre-legislative scrutiny we took on as a committee. We found a way to work together and I thank her for herding the cats on the committee and making it work. When we started the pre-legislative scrutiny, there was a sense that the Bill was simply about providing dignified burials, which had been denied, for the children who were lost and had been buried in sites such as that in Tuam. Survivors wanted and needed more, however, and they came before our committee and said that. We started looking for this in our pre-legislative scrutiny, as is detailed in the committee's report, and I am glad to say much of that has made it into the Bill. That has made the Bill stronger and it makes our hope for truth, justice and, ultimately, healing more likely to be achieved. I note the involvement with the Minister of Dr. Niamh McCullagh. Dr. McCullagh possesses particular expertise. It is important that any exhumation be conducted in accordance with international best practice, that is, the high forensic standard that allows us to understand the truth of what happened, from which we can foster justice and healing. Including in the Bill assurances regarding international best practice and that high standard is very important. There was a promise from some in the Department that that would happen, so I am glad to see that standard has made it in because it needs to be provided for in the Bill to ensure it will happen. Equally, the post-recovery analysis and identification is very important in that quest for truth and justice. It will allow those who have lost relatives or family members or those who have questions about themselves, their past and their family to get answers. It is important that provision has been beefed up and improved and that it is included in the Bill in black and white. That is a very welcome addition. I echo the words of other Deputies regarding the role of the coroner. It is important we keep that aspect of the Bill. I will save my remarks on the need to reform the office of the coroner for a more appropriate time, but keeping that jurisdiction in there and alive is an essential part of the apparatus of the State to lead, again, to truth, justice and healing. We talk often in the Chamber about matters such as truth, justice and healing. We talk about them in the context of Northern Ireland, the collusion reports and other issues relating to the Troubles, but they are very real in this context too. With the Bill, we have something that will facilitate that and enable us to take a site that has nothing but questions and, in a respectful manner and in accordance with international best practice, find out who is buried there and where their relatives are, and from that be able to piece together truth. From that truth, we will bring justice. I am grateful the Bill will do that, and I thank the Minister for bringing forward this legislation to enable us to do it.
#PatriciaRyan	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-party	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-dob	unknown-#PatriciaRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	312	I commend Galway woman Catherine Corless, whose tireless and painstaking work uncovered that 796 children had died in the Bon Secours mother and baby institution. I will not call it a home. She identified that there were death certificates but no burial records. The manner in which children's remains were discarded at this site was absolutely outrageous, and but for the work of Catherine Corless, we would probably not even know about it. She shone a light into the darkest part of our history and forced us to confront the legacy of 100 years of conservative Governments that abrogated their responsibility to the churches and left children at the mercy of people who did not have those children’s best interests at heart. The Bill will provide a statutory basis and framework to allow for interventions at sites such as that in Tuam, where inappropriate burials took place. At long last, the children interred at the Tuam site and other sites can have a dignified and respectful burial. While the Government's efforts to finally address this issue are to be welcomed, they fall short in a number of areas. There are some concerns about the threshold that sites will have to meet in order to be thoroughly investigated. Further clarity is needed on the role and function of the agency and director, the new 20 m distance requirement and the definition of what constitutes a relative. The definition of eligible family members must include all family relatives. The role of the coroner is unclear and further distinctions are required between the roles of the coroner and the director. It is clear our current coronial laws are inadequate to deal with the scope and nature of burial sites at former mother and baby institutions. The legislation, as drafted, may adequately address the specific circumstances of the Tuam site, but there are serious reservations as to whether it will sufficiently address those of other sites. These too deserve to be thoroughly investigated. I recently read Dr. Marie Cassidy's book, in which she writes about her work excavating mass graves in the former Yugoslavia. We may require international assistance given the possible scale of burials throughout the country. Finally, on the issues of memorials and their funding, Kildare County Council unanimously passed a motion last year proposing to erect a memorial at St. Mary's cemetery, Athy, to remember all those who had died in the so-called county home. The Government should fund these memorials. The people of Kildare do not begrudge the money, but Kildare County Council is poorly funded and it is time to do the right thing.

It came about as a result of the discovery of the mass grave in my local town, Tuam, County Galway. Last weekend, I met some members of the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance and I have taken on board their concerns relating to the legislation, which, they advised, demands amendments that will be submitted by them and others. Many experts have written about the recovery and the importance of exhumation to restore the identity, the physical location and the care that were denied to victims who were buried in unknown circumstances or in mass graves. It is envisaged in the draft legislation that a director will be appointed as head of the office following enactment. It appears the director's role is intended to replace that previously suggested as that of the agency. Many human rights experts, including among the people I have spoken to, are adamant that the role of the coroner is central and that he or she must take primary responsibility for any site under investigation where human remains are located or where the cause of death, or the medical certification of death, is not clear. In the case of Tuam, as the Minister will be aware, the death records were not medically certified. Rather, the vast majority were signed by a domestic worker from the former institution. It is proposed the advisory board that will be set up will include one survivor of the institution and one family relative of a lost child. The Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance suggests that is too narrow to accommodate contributions from the groups of both relatives and survivors who are involved, and has argued the board should include at least three people from each category. It is proposed that DNA samples from certain relatives will be safely stored for matching. It has been stressed on a number of occasions that primary relatives, particularly in the case of the Tuam site, are often elderly or in ill health. As a result, every effort should be made to obtain DNA in a timely fashion to allow for the best opportunities for matching when the infants' human remains have been recovered from the site. While the category of those eligible to participate as relatives has been extended beyond mother and father and sibling and half-sibling to include grandparent and grandchild, aunt and uncle and niece and nephew, the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance has stressed the requirement to extend those categories to include cousins. We spoke about this yesterday but I reiterate it now. The reason for this demand relates to the fact the Tuam site operated between 1925 and 1961, and those searching for loved ones may include cousins of the deceased. Individuals who are first cousins have contacted me and, I understand, other members of the Oireachtas committee. The committee will hear representations when the Bill moves to Committee Stage. Another concern expressed by the Tuam Mother and Baby Home Alliance relates to the extraordinary powers afforded to the Minister of the day to opt for memorialisation instead of site excavation and recovery of human remains. In recent times, and included in the bulletin received from the Minister this week, the focus leans further towards memorialisation, with funds available and accessible. It is premature for memorialisation at this stage, certainly in the context of Tuam and also the sites to which due consideration has not yet been afforded. Survivors living in my constituency and elsewhere and connected to the Tuam home have waited a considerable time for closure. Some have waited decades. We must ensure that the wishes of surviving relatives and our commitment to and respect for the relevant human rights treaties are afforded the highest priority. This legislation is not a once-off. It will remain on the Statute Book and will facilitate the overseeing of excavation works, including those relating to exhumation, at other sites in the future. As a result, every effort should be made to get it right. I am sure the Minister will do that. The effect of the excavation on residents living in proximity to the site and whose properties will be excavated needs to be part of the process from the start. Open engagement is important. A full-time, dedicated liaison person should be appointed to deal with residents' concerns. There are concerns that people's properties will be excavated. This would represent an enormous intrusion on their lives. I hope that those living there will be afforded the respect and dignity they deserve. I appreciate the work the Minister has done on this matter and what he has undertaken to do to date. It is important to say that in order to ensure that his efforts are recognised. I commend the former Minister, Dr. Zappone, on her work in this regard as well. Before I finish, I would like to also acknowledge Ms Catherine Corless's work in unearthing this terrible issue and bringing forward the research that has brought us to where we are right now. It is important that we acknowledge all of that. I look forward to working with the Minister right throughout the process to secure the passage of this Bill in order to ensure that we get it right for everybody involved.

I commend the Minister on getting the Bill to the floor of the Dáil and seeking to progress it. Much work has been done in developing the legislation. Much discussion has gone into it as well. Nonetheless, as Opposition Deputies, it is our job to critique the Bill, identify failings in it and suggests improvements that might be made. There are some difficulties with the Bill as it stands. In the region of 800 babies died in the home in Tuam. I can find burial records for only two of them - Vincent Hanon, who died aged one month in 1936, and Mary Margaret Jordan, who died at the age of one in 1932. Vincent and Mary Margaret were buried in the graveyard on Athenry Road in Tuam. Other than that, I can only presume that the remains of the other 800 babies are at the site in Tuam. The Minister's press release on the topic from last week talks about the identification programme that has been expanded to include the participation of grandparents, grandchildren, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces. I understand that it is complex and confusing, but there is a difficulty with this in that the Minister may be out of touch with the situation as it stands. Does he really believe that babies who died in the mother and baby home between 1925 and 1961 will have grandparents who are still alive? The remains that will be exhumed will be those of babies and young children. The commission identified the presence of remains at the site and was clear that these are infant remains, yet the Minister has included in the Bill a reference to grandchildren. It is confusing. How would someone who died when he or she was a baby or a young child have grandchildren alive today? If these are grandchildren of the parents of those young children, they are uncles or aunts of those children or siblings. I would be grateful if the Minister could explain this. The Minister does not seem to have identified the likelihood that there will be many unidentified babies' remains in the grave in Tuam. In my view, the proportion of the 800 babies' remains that may not be identified under the current scheme could be as high as half. Any one of us in this Chamber could have had an aunt or uncle who died in a mother and baby home as a child and who we will never know existed. It is my understanding that the people of Tuam will not be able to come forward to provide DNA samples unless they know or suspect that they had relatives who died in the home. If that is the case, it will be impossible to identify the remains of every child at that site. What plans does the Minister have for the remains of the many children who may be unidentified? I would take the lead from survivors on this, but it may be appropriate for Galway County Council, which owned and controlled the mother and baby home, to provide respectful graves for these unidentified babies. I am not sure whether the Minister comprehends fully the culture that surrounds this matter. There is certainly a culture of secrecy in relation to it-----

I have been talking to my Dáil assistant, Mr. Luke Silke, who has also been in contact with the Minister's office. Mr. Silke comes from Tuam, and he thinks we would have a much better chance of successfully identifying the babies' remains if the invitation to provide DNA samples was extended everyone in the area and not just to those who already know or suspect that they have relations there. Outside of the 800 babies who died in the home, I have found burial records for 11 unidentified babies who died in Tuam between 1885 and 1939. I want to make sure that these babies are also mentioned here in this debate today. Seven of them died in the workhouse in Tuam, three of them were shockingly found discarded and one record refers to an "unknown infant who died in May 1936 and was found near the Tuam train station". Before the mother and baby home opened in Tuam in 1925, for three years a mother and baby home operated in Glenamaddy. It was operated by the same organisation. Aontú has found records for more than 50 babies who died in that home between 1922 and 1925. The commission of investigation stated in its report that it regarded the Tuam and Glenamaddy institutions as one and the same. Therefore, we should be talking about 850 babies, not 800. Nobody seems to know where those 50-plus babies who died in Glenamaddy are buried. This is something the Government must also look into. I want to mention Kate Lynskey and Christopher King in particular who died 100 years ago this month in the Glenamaddy mother and baby home. Kate was ten months old and died of pneumonia on 12 March 1922. Christopher was a year old when he died from congestion of the lungs on 29 March 1922. After the exhumation has taken place in Tuam, we need a memorial garden. We need a place where all names of these babies are gathered together to ensure that none of them will be forgotten. Aontú is calling for the expansion of participation - to allow anyone in Tuam who wants to find out if he or she is related to anyone at the site to come forward and provide DNA. I agree with the provisions for mothers to object to more distant relatives receiving information. That is a good provision. Notwithstanding this, we need to allow an open invitation to everyone to come forward. Otherwise, we will run into serious difficulty and see a situation where maybe up to half of those babies remains will simply not be identified by this scheme. I also want to pay tribute to Sheila. I am sure many people will know Sheila. She is outside the Dáil again today. She cycled through the rain to get here. Sheila will never give up in her campaign for justice and I hope that the other Deputies will engage with her as they pass through the gates of Leinster House at Kildare Street. Is ábhar uafásach deacair é seo agus ábhar truamhéalach gan dabht. Tá cúpla fadhb fós leis an mBille seo. Ba cheart go mbeadh sé leathnaithe amach go dtí go mbeidh gach duine atá ina gcónaí i dTuaim ag an mbomaite seo in ann a ainm a chur isteach le haghaidh teastais DNA a fháil.Tá contúirt ollmhór ann mura ndéanfadh an Rialtas é seo mar nach mbeimid in ann aitheantas a chur ar gach uile pháiste reilig atá ansin anois. B’fhéidir go mbeidh suas go dtí leath an 800 páiste gan aitheantas a bheith acu nuair a bheidh an jab seo déanta. Bheadh sé sin uafásach má tharlaíonn sé sin. Ní fheicim go bhfuil plean ag an Rialtas déileáil leis na páistí sin, páistí gan aitheantas. Caithfimid éisteacht leis na survivors atá tar éis teacht amach agus a scéalta a insint dúinne ach ba chóir go mbeadh ról ag Comhairle Chontae na Gaillimhe, an t-údarás a bhí i mbun an bhaile sin fadó, agus go mbeadh an chomhairle sásta reilig le meas a chur ar fáil do na páistí nach bhfuil aitheantas acu. Tá an Bille seo casta. Cuireann sé mearbhall ar dhaoine mar gheall ar mhamó agus daideo agus mar gheall ar pháistí grandchildren, agus araile, agus ba cheart go mbeimid in ann é seo a phlé níos mó. B’fhéidir go bhfuilim mícheart mar gheall ar an aitheantas agus ar an tuiscint atá agamsa ar an mBille agus ba mhaith liom éisteacht leis an Aire le go mbeidh sé in ann níos mó eolais a thabhairt dúinne faoi sin.

I pay tribute to all of those who may be watching proceedings today, who have fought so hard to shine a light on Ireland's deeply dark past. I have no doubt these proceedings are difficult for many to watch and listen to for a range of reasons and I respect them for their continued courage. Tribute must also be deservedly paid to Catherine Corless, without whom it is likely we would not even be discussing this legislation today. In a recent interview Ms Corless said her work would not be finished until all the babies wrongfully buried in Tuam had been exhumed. She said: "There are babies and young children down in the chambers of a sewage facility, they were discarded, frowned on, treated like dirt, there's no getting away from that and the only way to rectify the past is to give them a bit of dignity and exhume them." I hope this Bill will bring that closure not just to Ms Corless but to the many families affected. What this Bill seeks to accomplish is unprecedented: a reflection of Ireland's uniquely shameful history and repugnant attitudes towards unwed mothers and their children. I have said on many occasions in this House that I do not believe there are enough actions this Government could ever take to right the wrongs of the past, such was the nature of the crimes committed against these mothers and their babies. At long last, the children interred at Tuam will be afforded the opportunity of a dignified and respectful burial, which is the very least that they deserve. The process to date had been very frustrating for families, a fact which the Minister himself has acknowledged. I ask that we proceed swiftly in establishing the agency to oversee the process and that we begin working to retrieve DNA on site as soon as is practicable. I welcome that this legislation will give the newly established agency the power it needs to access the highest technical services possible, and to have the necessary resources to identify the remains of these babies. The legislation has been broadened to include a wider circle of relatives than anticipated, including grandparents, aunts, uncles, nephews and nieces who may provide DNA to compare with remains. This will provide a greater chance of identification and the dignity of reuniting these families, that were often torn apart, to grieve for lives shown so little dignity in their short time on Earth. I ask that the Minister makes the process of application and identification as straightforward and compassionate as it can possibly be. We cannot right the wrongs of the past. It is an unimaginable shame that these women and their children were born in a time so much less tolerant and more blatantly evil than the Ireland in which we live today. We can honour the babies of Tuam by continuing to fight to make our society a more tolerant one where those in power stand up for and protect the vulnerable and the innocent so that we never return to those very dark days. We cannot right those wrongs, but we should not stop until each of the babies so wrongfully interred in Tuam is afforded the dignity and respect of the final resting place that they so deserve. I welcome the work on this Bill because I know it undertakes to achieve that. I thank the Minister for his compassion and dedication to this extremely important piece of legislation.

Attempts to deal with the legacy of the mother and baby homes that were allowed to operate here have been fraught with attempts to go over the heads of those who should have been consulted properly, and with actions that denied the memories of those who, sadly, are no longer with us. I hope that is changing. The work of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Children, Disability, Equality, Integration and Youth, chaired by Sinn Féin's Deputy Funchion, and the recommendations it published have made a big difference. I acknowledge that the Minister listened to those views. Shortly, I will talk about Sean Ross Abbey, which is in Roscrea, in my constituency of Tipperary, but first I ask the Minister to provide clarity on Part 2 of the Bill that concerns the director giving the go-ahead for excavation works. It states that the Government may refuse to make an order where other substantive reasons exist which cause it to form the view that memorialisation of the burials on the land, without further intervention, is more appropriate. There is a level of vagueness to this that does not set me at ease. I ask the Minister to outline what precisely the director will take into account, and whether there will be a level of discourse between the director and those seeking intervention. Pursuing a programme of restorative justice cannot leave any room for vagueness. I ask this because it is connected with the points I want to make to the Minister on Sean Ross Abbey. First, I acknowledge and thank the Minister for the engagements that he has had with those associated with Sean Ross Abbey and Tipperary County Council for working steadily with them. As the Minister knows, much work is going on in preparations to determine the location and condition of unmarked burials at the site. I would appreciate if the Minister could tell me if he is in a position to issue a set of guidelines and resources for those who are at the stage of preparing to scan an area for this purpose. People with a close association with Sean Ross or any other institution are naturally unfamiliar with a project of this nature. It is also new territory for Tipperary County Council. It would be useful to provide a roadmap featuring the requirements that would be made of those seeking scans and the provisions that would be made available to assist them. I am not talking purely financial assistance here; I am also talking about directing those concerned towards the contractors they may need. If the Department is willing to provide any resources, I ask whether they would be made available directly or through the local authority. What I am suggesting to the Minister here is that there should be a duty of care to assist in the preparations needed to determine the extent of the need or otherwise of excavations on a particular site. I also ask the Minister to expand on the extent to which work at other sites can take place at the same time as Tuam, or if he intends the process at Tuam to inform works at other sites. I would appreciate if he could provide interested parties with updates in relation to his engagements with the Department of Housing, Local Government and Heritage on the issue of memorialisation. I would like the Minister to provide some more detail on intervention at other sites. The 20 m rule is a particular issue here, as are concerns that it could become overly-restrictive, particularly for sites where more information needs to be gathered.

Mar léiriú ar thiomantas an Rialtais chun tacú leis an obair atá ar bun maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge, tá sé tábhachtach dúinn féachaint ar an infheistíocht atá á déanamh againn sa teanga. Léiríonn an chistíocht méadaithe atá curtha ar fáil agam don Ghaeilge agus don Ghaeltacht i mbliana, agus é ar fiú €85.6 milliún, tiomantas an Rialtais do chur chun cinn na teanga agus do phobal na Gaeltachta, tobar na teanga. Seo ardú €7 milliún ar chiste na bliana seo caite. Is le gach duine sa tír an Ghaeilge, óg agus aosta, agus ba mhaith liom a cheapadh go dtugann an t-allúntas breise seo deis dúinn ár ngrá don teanga a roinnt ar níos mó de phobal na tíre. Ba mhaith liom níos mó deiseanna a chruthú do dhaoine óga a thagann ó chúlraí faoi mhíbhuntáiste an Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil, mar shampla. Chloisfidís an teanga á labhairt mar theanga bheo timpeall orthu agus iad ag cur fúthu i measc phobal na Gaeltachta. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil oifigigh mo Roinne ag breathnú ar na féidearthachtaí gníomhaíochtaí nua a fhorbairt sa spás áirithe seo agus cuirim féin agus an tAire Stáit fáilte roimhe sin. Léiríonn Straitéis 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge 2010 – 2030, agus an plean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge in éindí léi, polasaí an Stáit don Ghaeilge agus do na ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá úinéireacht tras-Rialtais ag an straitéis agus an plean gníomhaíochta a thacaíonn léi agus, dá réir sin, tá sé de chúram ar Ranna Rialtais, ar fhorais agus ar eagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta an plean a chur i bhfeidhm. Tá de chúram ar mo Roinn an obair sin a chomhordú chomh maith, dár ndóigh. Foilsíodh an dara tuairisc ar fheidhmiú an phlean gníomhaíochta don Ghaeilge roimh an Nollaig 2021. De thoradh na comhpháirtíochta agus na comhúinéireachta a bhaineann leis seo uile, is údar sásaimh é domsa go bhfuil dul chun cinn suntasach le sonrú sa dara tuairisc seo. Den 185 gníomh sa phlean, atá á bhforbairt ag thart ar 60 páirtí leasmhar, bhí 51 gníomh le cur i bhfeidhm idir 2018 agus deireadh 2020. Bhí 27 gníomh curtha i bhfeidhm ag deireadh 2020 agus 16 eile idir lámha. Bhain moill le hocht gcinn acu. Tá an tAcht teanga nua achtaithe agus deireadh curtha leis an maolú ar úsáid na Gaeilge san Aontas Eorpaigh ó shin, dár ndóigh, péire de na bearta polasaí is mó i saol na Gaeilge a cuireadh i bhfeidhm le fada an lá. Cuimsíodh an tréimhse ó mhí Iúil 2019 go mí na Nollag 2020 sa tuairisc. Gan amhras, bhí sé dúshlánach feidhmiú le linn na paindéime le cúpla bliain anuas, ach mar sin féin, tá dul chun cinn suntasach déanta in ainneoin na ndúshlán a chuir an phaindéim romhainn. I measc na ngníomhaíochtaí eile a cuireadh i gcrích, cuireadh pacáiste tacaíochtaí breise múinteoireachta agus eile ar fáil do scoileanna atá ag glacadh páirt sa scéim aitheantais scoileanna Gaeltachta chun iad a spreagadh. Cuireadh tús le clár baitsiléir san oideachas nua lán-Ghaeilge, oideachais tosaigh do bhunmhúinteoirí in Institiúid Oideachais Marino. Rinneadh dul chun cinn thar na bearta leis an bpróiseas pleanála teanga agus é faoi bhláth anois. Iontaíodh imeachtaí Gaeilge ar líne ar fud an oileáin agus iarrachtaí móra á ndéanamh ag na heagraíochtaí Gaeilge agus Gaeltachta agus ag pobal labhartha na teanga dul i ngleic le tionchar na paindéime ar an saol. Chonaic muid ranganna scoile agus campaí samhraidh ar TG4, mar shampla, Cé a chreidfeadh é? Fuarthas cead pleanála chun lárionad Gaeilge a fhorbairt ag 6 Sráid Fhearchair, i lár chathair Bhaile Átha Cliath, olltogra a bheidh á bhrú chun cinn againn i mbliana. Foilsíodh an foclóir nua Béarla-Gaeilge de chuid Fhoras na Gaeilge. Tá an tuairisc iomlán ar fáil ar www.gov.ie agus molaim do Theachtaí í a léamh. Tá mo Roinn freagrach as na meáin chraoltóireachta chomh maith dár ndóigh. Bhí áthas orm ardú de €4.2 milliún a fhógairt ar bhuiséad TG4 do 2022. Fágann seo buiséad de bheagnach €45 milliún ag TG4. Is é sin an méadú is mó riamh ar mhaoiniú an stáisiúin agus, dár ndóigh, beidh tionchar ag an ardú seo freisin ar rathúlacht na Straitéise 20 Bliain don Ghaeilge. Bíonn comhoibriú leanúnach idir TG4 agus rannóga éagsúla de chuid mo Roinne agus iad i mbun tograí éagsúla a fhorbairt agus a chur chun cinn mar a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge. Gan dabht, ceann de na réimsí is tábhachtaí ó thaobh na teanga de ná réimse na fostaíochta, agus go háirithe fostaíocht sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Tá sé de sprioc ag Údarás na Gaeltachta 9,000 duine a bheith fostaithe i gcliantchomhlachtaí Gaeltachta faoi dheireadh na bliana 2025. Anuraidh, cruthaíodh 825 post nua lánaimseartha i gcomhlachtaí Gaeltachta de chuid an údaráis, an líon is airde poist a cruthaíodh in aon bhliain amháin ó bhí 2008 ann. Nuair a thógtar laghdú post san áireamh, bhí glanmhéadú de 446 sa bhfostaíocht ina iomláine, an glanmhéadú bliantúil is airde le 25 bliain. Bíonn comhoibriú leanúnach idir an Clár Éire Ildánach de chuid mo Roinne agus ár rannán Gaeltachta agus TG4 chomh maith, cur chuige a léiríonn go bhfuil an Ghaeilge fite fuaite in obair gach rannóg de chuid mo Roinne. Anuas air sin, shínigh Tourism Ireland agus Údarás na Gaeltachta comhaontú le déanaí ar mhaithe le tuilleadh comhoibrithe a chur ar bun maidir le forbairt tograí Gaeltachta in earnáil na turasóireachta. Táim féin, an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, ár bhfoirne agus an Rialtas tiomanta geallúintí an Rialtais i leith forbairt agus neartú na Gaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm agus leanfaimid orainn á dhéanamh le linn na bliana atá amach romhainn. Go raibh míle maith agaibh agus bainigí sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge.

Leis an obair a dhéanfar le cúram a dhéanamh d’fheidhmiú an Achta, féachfar chuige go mbeidh seirbhísí feabhsaithe go céimiúil curtha ar fáil do phobal na Gaeilge agus deiseanna suntasacha fostaíochta á gcruthú dóibh siúd a bhfuil inniúlacht sa teanga acu. Is iad príomhspriocanna an Achta 20% d’earcaithe nua don tseirbhís phoiblí a bheith inniúil sa Ghaeilge roimh dheireadh 2030, go gcuirfear na seirbhísí poiblí uile sa Ghaeltacht ar fáil i nGaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoiblí sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú trí mheán na Gaeilge agus go ndéanfar plean náisiúnta do sholáthar sheirbhísí phoiblí i nGaeilge a fhorbairt.Is iad príomhspriocanna an Achta ná 20% d’earcaithe nua don tseirbhís phoiblí a bheith inniúil sa Ghaeilge roimh dheireadh 2030, go gcuirfear na seirbhísí poiblí uile sa Ghaeltacht ar fáil i nGaeilge, go mbeidh gach oifig phoiblí sa Ghaeltacht ag feidhmiú trí mheán na Gaeilge agus go ndéanfar plean náisiúnta do sholáthar sheirbhísí phoiblí i nGaeilge a fhorbairt. Tá scríofa ag mo Roinn cheana féin chuig comhlachtaí poiblí ag meabhrú dóibh faoin Acht nua agus na príomhspriocanna atá san áireamh ann. Forálann Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021 go ndéanfar athchóiriú ar an mbealach a bheartaímid do sholáthar seirbhísí poiblí Ghaeilge ar ardchaighdeán do phobal na Gaeilge. Is tionscadal fadtéarmach é seo a bhfuil taighde cuimsitheach agus forbairt phlean náisiúnta um sholáthar seirbhísí poiblí trí mheán na Gaeilge ina chroílár. I láthair na huaire, táim ag obair i gcomhar le hoifigigh mo Roinne chun éifeacht a thabhairt d'fhorálacha an Achta sa tréimhse amach romhainn. Chuige sin, tá plean oibre forbartha ag oifigigh mo Roinne ina leagtar amach na céimeanna éagsúla atá le glacadh sna míonna amach romhainn chun forálacha an Achta a fheidhmiú. Is í mo phríomhthosaíocht ag an tráth seo ná próiseas a reáchtáil ar mhaithe le beirt chomhalta a earcú a bheidh ionadaíoch ar an gcoiste comhairleach a bhfuil foráil déanta dó san Acht, ar son phobal labhartha na Gaeilge, taobh istigh agus taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht. Tá an réamhobair don phróiseas sin tosaithe ag an tSeirbhís um Cheapacháin Phoiblí i gcomhar le hoifigigh mo Roinne. Leis an Acht nua seo, tá bunsraith láidir leagtha síos dúinn, mar Stát, chun fíorcheannaireacht a léiriú i dtaobh an teanga a chaomhnú do na glúnta atá le teacht. Tagann forálacha an Achta i gcomhréir le huaillmhian bheartais fhoriomlán an Stáit maidir le tacú leis an nGaeilge agus maidir leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn. Níor mhiste a lua gur togra uile-Rialtais é seo agus go mbeidh oibleagáidí orainn go léir trasna an státchórais maidir lena fhorfheidhm.  Tá acmhainní breise faighte agam laistigh de leithdháileadh mo Roinne i mbuiséad 2022 chun dlús a chur le cur i bhfeidhm na reachtaíochta nua, chomh maith le hacmhainní breise a sholáthar d’Oifig an Choimisinéara Teanga i mbliana chun córais mhonatóireachta na hoifige sin a neartú. Tá earcú na n-acmhainní foirne breise seo beagnach críochnaithe ag mo Roinn anois.  Tá beartaithe agam, thar na míonna amach romhainn, sraith seimineár faisnéise a eagrú do chomhlachtaí poiblí maidir le forálacha an Achta nua agus tús a chur le hailt ábhartha den Acht ar bhonn chéimiúil. Tá úsáid na Gaeilge ag leibhéal oifigiúil mar chuid lárnach de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun chun a chinntiú go mbeidh an teanga in úsáid ag na glúnta amach anseo. Tá sé an-tábhachtach do Rialtas na hÉireann go bhfuil an Ghaeilge ina teanga oifigiúil agus ina teanga oibre iomláine in institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh anois mar gur tháinig deireadh leis an maolú ar a húsáid ag deireadh na bliana seo caite. Tá tionscnaimh éagsúla curtha ar bun ag mo Roinn agus ardstiúrthóireacht an aistriúcháin le blianta anuas chun cur leis na hacmhainní Ghaeilge atá ar fáil mar thacaíocht do na seirbhísí teanga san Aontas agus leanfaimid orainn ag obair leis na hinstitiúidí sna blianta amach romhainn. Tá geallta i gclár an Rialtais go ndéanfar athbhreithniú ar phróiseas ceapacháin do bhord Údarás na Gaeltachta. Bhí áthas orm comhairliúchán poiblí a fhógairt le déanaí mar chuid den athbhreithniú sin. Tugann sé seo deis don phobal agus d’eagraíochtaí, gur spéis leo, a dtuairimí agus a gcuid moltaí faoin ábhar a roinnt i scríbhinn le mo Roinn suas go dtí an 25 Márta agus tapaím an deis anseo inniu a mheabhrú don phobal go bhfuil an próiseas seo ar siúl agus tá súil agam go mbeidh siad páirteach san obair seo. Tá sé tábhachtach go mbeidh glór agus ionchur cuí ag pobal na Gaeltachta san obair dhúshlánach a dhéanann an bord ar leas an údaráis agus phobal na Gaeltachta agus tá áthas orm go bhfuil tús curtha leis an athbhreithniú mar atá geallta sa chlár Rialtais. Is ar an mbunús agus ar an tnúthán go mbeidh na coláistí Gaeilge athoscailte sa Ghaeltacht i mbliana atá mo Roinn ag feidhmiú anois. Bhunaigh mo Roinn trí chiste faoi leith anuraidh ar leas na hearnála arbh fhiú €4 milliún ina n-iomlán iad. Cuireadh tacaíochtaí maoinithe ar fáil do na coláistí samhraidh féin, do theaghlaigh a chuireann lóistín ar fáil do scoláirí na gcoláistí agus do hallaí pobail a bhíonn in úsáid ag coláistí samhraidh. Ní bheadh aon amhras orm ach gur chabhraigh sé seo uile leis an earnáil teacht trí na dúshláin arbh éigean dúinn uile mar phobal a iompar le beagnach dhá bhliain anuas de bharr na paindéime. Mar bheart breise le cabhrú tuilleadh le téarnamh na hearnála, d’fhógair mé le déanaí go mbeadh mo Roinn ag aithint gearrchúrsaí Gaeilge nach giorra ná trí lá mar bheart eisceachtúil i mbliana chun cabhrú tuilleadh le téarnamh chóras na gcoláistí Gaeilge agus chun freastal a dhéanamh orthu siúd a chaill amach ar an deis freastal ar chúrsaí trí seachtaine de dheasca na paindéime. Ciallaíonn sé seo go mbeidh mo Roinn in ann deontais scéim na bhfoghlaimeoirí Gaeilge a íoc le teaghlaigh cháilithe Ghaeltachta a chuireann lóistín ar fáil do lucht freastail na ngearrchúrsaí seo. Mar atá ráite ag an Aire, an Teachta Martin, romham, ba mhaith leis an mbeirt againn níos mó deiseanna a chruthú do dhaoine óga a thagann ó chúlraí faoi mhíbhuntáiste an Ghaeltacht a fheiceáil agus tá oifigigh na Roinne ag breathnú ar an gceist faoi láthair, dá bharr. Mar a bhaineann sé leis an nGaeilge agus comhoibriú Thuaidh-Theas, cuireann mo Roinn tacaíocht leanúnach ar fáil d’Fhoras na Gaeilge leis an nGaeilge a chur chun cinn agus a fhorbairt ar fud an oileáin. Cuireann mo Roinn tacaíocht ar fáil freisin faoi scáth chomhaontú Ré Nua, Cur Chuige Nua. Tá an cúnamh seo ar fáil as seo go ceann trí bliana. Is cúnamh é atá ar fáil d’fhorbairt na teanga ag leibhéal an phobail. Maidir le hAcht teanga i dTuaisceart na hÉireann, bhí an beartas reachtaíochta a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus leis an bhféiniúlacht, faoi scáth chomhaontú Ré Nua, Cur Chuige Nua, sonrach agus cothrom i dtuairim an Rialtais seo agus ba chóir é a chur i bhfeidhm gan mhoill. Tá sé ráite ag Rúnaí Stáit an Tuaiscirt go dtabharfar an reachtaíocht seo chun cinn i Westminster a luaithe agus a cheadaíonn an t-uainchlár parlaiminteach seo a dhéanamh. Ag an bpointe seo, ní hacmhainn d’oifig Thuaisceart Éireann aon sonraí breise a sholáthar mar a bhaineann leis an uainchlár sin. Baineann dúshláin leanúnacha fós inniu le cás na Gaeilge agus pobal a labhartha. Mar sin féin, tá mórán bainte amach ag an Rialtas seo maidir le neartú agus buanú na Gaeilge mar theanga phobail agus leanfaimid ag obair agus ag tacú leis an bpobal chun ár spriocanna maidir le cur chun cinn na Gaeilge a bhaint amach.

#MaryLouMcDonald	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-party	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-dob	unknown-#MaryLouMcDonald-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	326	“Ós í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta is í an phríomhtheanga oifigiúil í”. Is é sin atá ráite i mBunreacht an Stáit seo ach, seachas an díospóireacht inniu, is annamh a tharlaíonn díospóireachtaí lán-Ghaeilge anseo sa Dáil. Níl cead fiú ag Teachtaí Dála leasuithe a mholadh i nGaeilge. Tá cearta níos fearr ag feisirí i bParlaimint na hEorpa anois, toisc an tsárobair a rinne pobal na Gaeilge, Conradh na Gaeilge agus daoine ar nós Liadh Ní Riada a rinne stailc teanga ar son na gceart sin. Is é cearta teanga atá uainn. Faoi dheireadh, tá Acht teanga nua againn sa Stát seo agus tá dul chun cinn mór déanta ansin toisc leasuithe mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, ach caithfidh an Rialtas gníomhú de réir a bhriathair. Ó Thuaidh, táimid fós ag fanacht ar Acht teanga. Rinne Sinn Féin gach iarracht é sin a bhaint amach agus lorgaíomar cúnamh ón Rialtas anseo, ach níor tháinig an cúnamh sin. Táimid ag fanacht le gluaiseacht air seo ó Rialtas na Breataine. Caithfidh sé sin tarlú anois. Tá géarchéim teanga sa Ghaeltacht. Tá brú ollmhór ar theaghlaigh Ghaeltachta iompú ar an mBéarla agus an Ghaeltacht a fhágáil. Teastaíonn tithe uathu ina gceantair féin agus seirbhísí Stáit ina dteanga féin. Teastaíonn daonlathas uathu maidir le toghcháin d’Údarás na Gaeltachta. Tá gá le scéim labhairt na Gaeilge a bhunú arís, chun daoine a mhealladh chun páistí a thógáil le Gaeilge sa Ghaeltacht, chun an Ghaeltacht a choimeád beo agus bríomhar sna glúnta amach romhainn. Caithfimid tacú le hiarrachtaí an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Ghaeltacht agus lasmuigh di freisin. I mo cheantar féin, tá obair na gcapall ar bun ag tuismitheoirí agus pobal scoile i gColáiste Mhuire agus i Scoil Chaitríona sa Chabrach chun an Ghaeilge a spreagadh i measc na hóige agus tréaslaím leo as sin. Tá dea-thoil i leith na Gaeilge le sonrú i measc an phobail ar fad na tíre, ó Bhóthar Seoighe i mBéal Feirste go lár Bhaile Átha Cliath. Teastaíonn an fuinneamh agus an spiorad sin uainn chun an teanga a shlánú. Is ar scáth a chéile a mhaireann na daoine agus is ar scáth an chosmhuintir a mhairfidh an Ghaeilge. I measc cearta teanga, tá cearta oideachais. Ba chóir dúinn borradh a chur le líon na bpáistí atá ag freastal ar naíonraí lán-Ghaeilge agus ar Ghaelscoileanna ach ba chóir freisin cosaint a thabhairt don cheart atá ann leanúint ar aghaidh san oideachas dara leibhéal agus ardleibhéal trí Ghaeilge.Ní cóir go mbeadh an Ghaeilge srianta don scoil nó do lá amháin sa Dáil in aghaidh na bliana. Is í an Ghaeilge an teanga náisiúnta agus tacaíonn Sinn Féin le ról na Gaeilge i ngach gné den saol.

Níl ann ach sraith ráitis. D'fhéadfaí féachaint air mar tokenism. …Ach, má táimid dáiríre faoin nGaeilge ba chóir dúinn díriú isteach ar an ábhar agus díospóireacht substaintiúil a bheith againn. Cén fáth nach mbeadh díospóireacht trí Ghaeilge ar an mBille Airgeadais, mar shampla? Léireodh sé sin don domhain go bhfuilimid dáiríre faoin nGaeilge a chuir chun cinn ins an Teach seo.Is é sin an méid a bhí le rá agamsa sa tsraith ráitis chéanna in 2004. Táimid fós sa rut ceannann céanna ina lán bealaí. Tá cúlú tar éis tarlú. Tá roinnt céimeanna beaga tógtha. Aithním é sin. Bhí mé páirteach i roinnt céimeanna beaga sna Tithe seo le tamall anuas ó thaobh na Gaeilge. Fós, is truamhéalach an líon Gaeilge atá á labhairt sa Teach seo. Tá coiste againn nach raibh ann in 2004 atá ag déileáil le ceist na Gaeilge, phobal labhartha na Gaeilge agus na Gaeltachta agus tá sé sin go maith mar táimid ag díriú isteach ar na hábhair sin. Den chuid is mó, ní chloistear an Ghaeilge ach go fíorannamh istigh anseo. Caithfimid obair chun a dhéanamh cinnte nach dtarlaíonn sé sin agus nach gcruthaímid an íomhá seo don domhan mór atá ag féachaint isteach orainn, go háirithe má táimid ag triail ár bpáistí a mhealladh chun an Ghaeilge a labhairt. Muna bhfuil na polaiteoirí, muidne atá ag déanamh an dlí, ag socrú an dlí agus ag déanamh díospóireachta ar nithe móra an tsaoil, ag labhairt na Gaeilge istigh anseo chomh rialta agus is féidir linn, nó fiú ag labhairt beagáinín di chuile sheachtain, conas is féidir linn a mholadh do dhaoine atá uaireanta trodach i gcoinne na Gaeilge gur fiú í? Tá jab mór le déanamh againn.  Agus é sin ráite agam, déanaim comhghairdeas leis na heagrais agus leis na feachtasóirí ar fad timpeall na tíre. Luaigh an Teachta McDonald Gaeltacht Bhóthar Seoighe atá 50 bliain ar an bhfód i mbliana agus éacht déanta aici. Tá a lán grúpaí eile ann freisin, coistí pobail atá ag streachailt lá i ndiaidh lae ar son na Gaeilge ina measc. Tá Conradh na Gaeilge agus a lán grúpaí eile ann nach é. Tá Gaelscoileanna agus grúpaí Stáit san áireamh. Níl gach rud chomh dona agus a shíltear ach, i roinnt cásanna, tá an scéal níos measa. Tá ceisteanna móra ann ar caithfimid iad a phlé. Caithfimid réiteach a fháil orthu. Is sampla de na ceisteanna seo ceist a bhí muid ag plé ní rófhada ó shin, ceist na gcoláistí samhraidh agus na mná tí a mhealladh ar ais chun cinnte a dhéanamh de go mbeidh na coláistí samhraidh ag obair i gceart. Tá breis airgid, breis maoinithe agus breis tacaíochta ag teastáil ó na hoifigigh phleanála teanga. Tá an obair sin ann. Caithfimid déanamh cinnte de go bhfuil an tacaíocht sin ann.  Chomh maith leis sin, caithfimid déanamh cinnte de ní hamháin go bhfuilimid ag cur na Gaelscolaíochta chun cinn agus ag sásamh an éilimh, ach go bhfuilimid ag dul amach agus éileamh a chruthú. Is ról an Stáit é sin. Tá ról lárnach ag an Stát maidir leis sin agus caithfidh sé déanamh cinnte de ní hamháin go bhfuil an Ghaeilge chun cinn, ach go bhfuil daoine á mealladh chuici freisin. Níl sé sin ag tarlú. Sa chathair seo, tá a lán páistí ann a chríochnaíonn a gcuid bunscolaíochta lán-Ghaeilge nach féidir leo dul ar aghaidh chuig meánscoil lán-Ghaeilge. Nuair atá páistí críochnaithe leis an meánscoil, níl institiúid nó ollscoil ar fáil do Ghaeilgeoirí ina bhfuil na hábhair uilig, nó fiú réimse dóibh lasmuigh den Ghaeilge féin, ar fáil i nGaeilge. Tá roinnt samplaí ann ach níl siad ar fáil. Ar nóta eile, le déanaí, chaith an Rialtas go dona leo siúd a bhí tar éis cás cúirte a bhuachan maidir le lipéadú ar tháirgí leighis d'ainmhithe. Rinne sé achomharc a lorg. Ba chóir go mbeifí ag déanamh cinnte go bhfuil lipéadú ar tháirgí sa Stát seo dátheangach. Tréaslaím le comhlacht ó Loch Garman, Poachers, atá ag déanamh ginger ale, tonic water agus a leithéid. Tá na comhábhair ar fad liostáilte i nGaeilge agus i mBéarla aige. Is dea-shampla é an comhlacht sin agus b'fhiú tacú le comhlachtaí atá ag déanamh iarrachta an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tá a fhios agam go n-ardóidh an Teachta Daly ceist na gcomharthaí bóithre. Táthar fós ag caitheamh leis an nGaeilge go dona ó thaobh comharthaí bóithre timpeall na tíre. Tá na logainmneacha Gaeilge fós i gcló iodálach atá níos lú ná an cló a úsáidtear don leagan Béarla. Níl aon straitéis ann chun déanamh cinnte de go mbeadh siad dátheangach nó i nGaeilge amháin. Sa Seanad, dúirt an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, go raibh scéim phíolótach ag tarlú. Níl a fhios ag aon duine cá bhfuil an scéim phíolótach seo. Dúirt an tAire Iompair, an Teachta Eamon Ryan, nach ann di. Caithfidh an tAire Stáit labhairt leis an Aire agus a fháil amach cá bhfuil an scéim phíolótach seo maidir le comharthaí dátheangacha chun déileáil leis an gceist toisc go bhfuil an Ghaeilge in ísle brí. B'fhéidir go mbeidh sé in ann díriú isteach air sin agus é ag cur críoch leis an díospóireacht seo agus a rá linn conas is féidir scéim phíolótach a chur ar bun chun go mbeadh an Ghaeilge feiceálach agus chun cinn ar an mBéarla sa tír seo.

Tá ceithre nóiméad ag mo chomhghleacaí. Ar an gcéad dul síos, tá an díospóireacht seo tábhachtach ach níor mhaith liom go gceapfadh daoine go bhfuil a gcuid déanta don bhliain agus nach gá an Ghaeilge a labhairt go ceann bliana arís. Tá cuid den dearcadh sin le feiceáil ar RTÉ. Déanann sé rudaí beaga simplí i nGaeilge an tseachtain seo gur féidir leis iad a dhéanamh ar fud na bliana. Níl a fhios agam cén fáth nach leanann sé ar aghaidh leis. Ní bhíonn éinne ag tabhairt amach i rith seachtain Lá Fhéile Phádraig ach téann sé ar ais ar na sean-nósanna arís. Ba oscailt súile é do go leor daoine a bhí ag breathnú ar TG4 nó ag éisteacht le Raidió na Gaeltachta le seachtain anuas, agus an cogadh uafásach tragóideach sin ar bun san Úcráin, an méid daoine a rabhadar in ann teacht orthu ón Úcráin agus ón Rúis a bhfuil Gaeilge líofa acu agus a bhí in ann labhairt go stuama agus go heolasach ar an ábhar seo. Ansin, deireann daoine sa tír seo nach bhfuil siad in ann an teanga a fhoghlaim. Tá roinnt guíonna agam. Chuala mé an chaint ar fad faoi lúireach Phádraig. Bhuel, is é sin lúireach Éamon, rudaí gur mhaith liom iad a fheiceáil déanta as seo go ceann bliana. Is rud simplí an chéad rud a bhí muid ag plé leis um thráthnóna. Ba mhaith liom go gcloífeadh eagrais Stáit agus Ranna Stáit leis an dlí teanga agus nach mbeadh muid i gcónaí ag tathant orthu cloí leis. Tá dualgas ar chuile eagraíocht Stáit cloí leis an dlí. I gcás go bhfuil rialú ón gCoimisinéir Teanga, ba chóir go bhfaighidís comhairle dlí an bhfuil an ceart aige. Má tá, is cóir go ndéanfaidís rud éigin faoi agus, mura bhfuil, is scéal difriúil é sin. Ba mhaith liom tréaslú leis an Aire Stáit as an méid oibre a rinne sé ar an Acht teanga agus na leasuithe a ghlactar leis ach tá faitíos orm ó na freagraí a fuair mé ar go leor ceisteanna parlaiminte a chuir mé síos nach bhfuil na Ranna Stáit agus na heagrais Stáit trí chéile ag tógáil na ndualgas nua atá orthu dáiríre. Mar shampla, ní léir dom go bhfuil aon réamhréiteach á dhéanamh ag an Roinn Caiteachais Phoiblí agus Athchóirithe maidir le daoine a earcú a mbeidh Gaeilge acu agus nach bhfuil aon réamhréiteach á dhéanamh ag an Roinn Breisoideachais agus Ardoideachais, Taighde, Nuálaíochta agus Eolaíochta le déanamh cinnte go mbeidh daoine oilte ann leis na poist seo ar fad a ghlacadh sa bhliain 2030.Má smaoinítear air tógann sé ar an meán trí nó ceithre bliana chun céim a dhéanamh. Scaití tógann sé níos mó ama. Níl anois 2030 ach ocht mbliana uainn.  Is é an chéad rud eile a insím don Aire Stáit ná go bhfuil go leor daoine a bhfuil Gaeilge mhaith acu taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht agus is sna coláistí Gaeilge a d’fhoghlaim siad a gcuid Gaeilge. Táim ag ceapadh go raibh an tAire Stáit féin ina measc mar bhí mé ina measc. Tá súil agam go dtiocfaidh fás orthu sin, go gcuideofar leo sin agus ní dhéarfaidh mé níos mó faoi sin inniu.  Bá bhreá liom dá bhfeicfimid pacastaíocht dhátheangach agus lipéid dhátheangacha agus aontaím leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh faoi sin. D’fhéadfaí é sin a dhéanamh go deonach ach b’fhéidir in imeacht ama go gcaithfimid breathnú, mura bhfuil comhlachtaí príobháideacha sásta dul sa treo sin, a rogha rud eile a dhéanamh. I dtíortha eile, mar shampla sa Bheilg, táim cinnte go bhfuil an pacastaíocht dhátheangach de réir dlí agus má táthar in ann é a dhéanamh faoi dhlí na hEorpa ansin, beimid in ann é a dhéanamh anseo. Níl a fhios agam cé mhéad airgid atá tarraingthe nó cé mhéad iarratas atá ann faoin Shared Ireland fund Thuaidh agus Theas maidir le tograí a bhaineann leis an nGaeilge agus feictear domsa gur ciste ollmhór é sin a bhféadfaí muintir an Tuaiscirt agus an Deiscirt tarraingt as ach teacht aníos le tograí maithe móra a bhféadfaí a chur isteach ar an gciste sin. Tá súil agam go bhfeicfimid faoi dheireadh an Bille teanga ó Thuaidh. Caithfidh mé a rá, agus bhí sé seo mo dhearcadh riamh, nach bhfuil fadhb dá laghad ann. Má tá Bille teanga láidir Gaeilge ann, bheadh soláthar i gcodanna eile den Bhille sin don Ultais agus do chultúir eile atá, mar a déarfá, de bhunadh an taoibh sin tíre. Níor bhraith mé riamh gur bhain sé de mo chumas Gaeilge a labhairt má bhí mise mar Aire, mar a bhí, ag cur na hUltaise chun cinn ag an am céanna.  Aontaím faoi na comharthaí bóthair. Is rud é seo a bhfuilimid ag streachailt leis le fada an lá agus, go deimhin féin, b’fhéidir go bhféadfaí Specsavers a fháil do na Gaeilgeoirí agus a bheith urraithe mar caithfidh go bhfuil radharc na súl níos fearr ag Gaeilgeoirí ná go gceapann na húdaráis, le gur féidir leo na comharthaí a léamh. Tá go leor rudaí eile ach fágfaidh mé an t-urlár do mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Cathal Crowe.

Molaim an tAire agus an tAire Stáit as an sárobair a bhfuil siad ag déanamh chun tacú leis an teanga. Roimh an toghchán bhí mé ag obair mar mhúinteoir bunscoile i Scoil Náisiúnta an Phairtín i gContae an Chláir. Bhí blas agus grá mór ag na páistí óga i leith na Gaeilge ach caithfimid go léir a admháil go bhfuil fadhb láidir sa tír seo le blianta beaga anuas mar níl caighdeán ard ag an gcuid is mó de dhaoine fásta in Éirinn anois. I mí Mheán Fómhair tháinig an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, go dtí baile na hInse chun líonra nua Gaeilge a sheoladh go hoifigiúil, Líonra na hInse. Tá sárobair déanta ag Dónal Ó Loinsigh, Dónal Ó hAiniféin, an Comhairleoir Marc Mac an Adhastair, Síle Concannon agus go leor daoine eile. Chun éifeacht agus stiúradh a thabhairt don líonra, bhí post nua le cead ón Roinn fógartha sa The Clare Champion cúpla mí ó shin. Níl an post seo líonta faoin am seo mar tá stad curtha maidir leis ag an Rialtas. Impím ar an Aire agus ar an Aire Stáit idirghabháil a dhéanamh sa chás sin. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach do mhuintir bhaile na hInse agus do mhuintir an Chláir go mbeadh éifeacht ag an líonra na Gaeilge nua seo i mbaile na hInse ach caithfimid an post sin a líonadh agus duine a chur isteach chun éifeacht a chur leis an straitéis agus chun dul ar aghaidh leis an teanga. Tá roinnt ama fágtha agam agus táim lánsásta é a thabhairt ar ais do mo chomhghleacaí.

Níl aon rud níos bunúsaí agus is cinneadh é a gcaithfidh tuismitheoirí a dhéanamh. Ní féidir leis an Stát an cinneadh sin a dhéanamh. Níl aon bhealach níos éasca an teanga a fhoghlaim ná í a fhoghlaim ó na tuismitheoirí sa bhaile. Níl aon bhaol ann níos mó go bhfásfaidh gasúr suas gan Bhéarla, rud a rinne imní do mhuintir na Gaeltachta fadó. Tá sé thar a bheith tábhachtach go n-éireoidh linn an soiscéal sin a scaipeadh. Cinnte dearfa tá tacaíochtaí ag teastáil ó thuismitheoirí chun é sin a dhéanamh.  Meabhraím don Aire Stáit go raibh soláthar ann in Acht na Gaeltachta, 2012 do na gréasáin Ghalltachta cathrach seo ach níor leagadh amach é sin riamh de réir mar a bhí i gceist sa staidéar teangeolaíochta. Níl aon leagan amach céard a chiallaíonn sé seo agus céard iad na háiseanna cearta ba chóir a bheith ar fáil. Le go mbeadh líonra den chineál sin, chaithfí naíolann, naíonra, bunscoil agus meánscoil, chomh maith le club an óige, clubanna do thuismitheoirí, go mbeadh a leithéid, mar shampla, agus go mbeidís in ann a theacht le chéile in ionad pobail agus go mbeadh clubanna spóirt ag feidhmiú trí Ghaeilge. Is é sin le rá, theastófaí plean cuimsitheach do na háiteanna seo atá ainmnithe agus nach bhfaighfí siad an stádas sin mura mbeadh na háiseanna seo ar fáil agus theastófaí maoiniú nach beag ón Stát. Má tá an Ghaeilge le bheith beo faoi cheann 100 bliain, caithfidh sí a bheith beo sna cathracha chomh láidir is a bheidh sí sa Ghaeltacht. Mura ndéanfar é sin ní mhairfidh an Ghaeltacht agus is míthuiscint ar dhaoine a cheapadh go mairfidh an Ghaeltacht scun scan ar an nGaeilge taobh amuigh den Ghaeltacht ar fud na tíre.

Bíodh is gurbh í an Ghaeilge an chéad teanga oifigiúil de chuid an Stáit seo is teanga mhionlaigh fós í agus táim den bharúil go bhfuil sé in am ag an Stát breathnú an athuair ar na spriocanna móra agus an fhís atá ann i leith na Gaeilge. Tá go leor cainte faoi láthair, mar shampla, maidir le traslitriú ainm phríomhchathair na hÚcráine, Kyiv, agus céard é an leagan is dílse don Úcráinis sa chaoi is gur féidir náisiún agus cultúr na hÚcráine a dhlisteanú. Is maith ann an díospóireacht sin agus tugann sé téamaí éagsúla chun cinn i dtaobh an impiriúlachais agus an gá atá ann le díchoilíniú iomlán a dhéanamh i náisiún a bhí faoi chois ag náisiún eile. I ndáiríre, shílfí gur cheart go mbeimid ag breathnú níos giorra don bhaile. Tá glacadh fós leis na logainmneacha gallda a bhaisteadh ar chathracha, bhailte agus sráidbhailte na tíre seo le teann fornirt cúpla céad bliain ó shin. Cén fáth nach leanaimid sampla mhuintir na hÚcráine san fheachtas dá cuid le Kyiv seachas Kiev, agus tosú ag caint faoi Bhaile Átha Cliath seachas Dublin, faoi Bhéal Feirste seachas Belfast, faoi Ghaillimh seachas Galway agus tuilleadh nach iad? Níl ciall na réasún le formhór na logainmneacha Béarla sin ar an gcéad dul síos.  Níor mhiste liom an deis a thapú freisin athaontú na hÉireann a phlé i gcomhthéacs na Gaeilge. Tá sé tábhachtach agus an cheist mhór seo faoi chaibidil againn na snáitheanna sin a cheanglaímid ar fad le cheile sa tír seo, Thuas is Theas, a aithint agus a cheiliúradh. Tá an Ghaeilge ar cheann de na snáitheanna sin. Tá baint ag an nGaeilge ar bhealach amháin nó eile le gach uile dhuine agus phobal de bhunadh an oileáin seo, mar aon le duine ar bith nua a chuireann faoi nó fúithi in éineacht linn. Is linn uile í.  Aithnímid, cuirim i gcás, an taighde ceannródaíoch a rinneadh le gairid ar shaighdiúirí de chuid airm na Breataine as oirthear Bhéal Feirste a throid sa Chéad Chogadh Domhanda a léirigh go raibh Gaeilge ag go leor acu. Ba iad seo Protastúnaigh as pobal ina raibh an tacaíocht is láidre don Bhreatain thar aon áit eile in Éirinn agus bhí siad sásta a rá in 1911 go raibh an Ghaeilge ar a dtoil acu. Níl aon dabht ach go dtugann Éire aontaithe deis nua dúinn tarraingt ar an oidhreacht chomónta seo atá againn in Éirinn, tógáil ar bhuntáistí an dátheangachais agus pobal a nascadh lena n-oidhreacht agus lena gcultúr. Is féidir linn an Ghaeilge a úsáid mar sheoid chultúrtha atá againn ní hamháin sa lá atá inniu ann, ach ar feadh blianta fada.  Má táimid chun athmhuintearas agus dlúthpháirtíocht a chothú, níor mór dúinn a thuiscint gur den phobal céanna muid inniu agus inné. Tá sé de sheans againn anois tír agus náisiún nua forásach a shamhlú don oileán seo a chuireann fáilte roimh an uile dhuine agus a thugann aird i gcónaí ar na nithe sin a nascann muid le chéile thar na rudaí a scarann óna chéile muid.Is ceart go mbeadh an teanga lárnach sa phróiseas sin. Rinneadh an pointe go bhfuil sé fíorthábhachtach dúinn ar fad a labhraíonn Gaeilge, má tá páistí againn agus má táimid in ann, Gaeilge a labhairt leis na páistí sin. Má smaoiníonn muid siar ar an stair atá againn, bhí gaolta againn ar fad le fada in Éirinn agus ag pointe amháin shocraigh na gaolta sin labhairt i mBéarla seachas i nGaeilge, cé nach raibh an Béarla fiú ar a dtoil acu ag an bpointe sin. Shocraigh siad an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh agus ba chóir dúinne ar fad an t-athrú sin a dhéanamh arís chun cinntiú go labhraítear Gaeilge amach anseo. Sin rud go gcaithfimid ar fad smaoineamh air.

Tacaíonn na Daonlathaithe Sóisialta le stádas na Gaeilge sa tír seo. Tá leagan Gaeilge againn dár suíomh Idirlín agus tá polasaí againn chun stádas na Gaeilge a threisiú. Tá na Daonlathaithe Sóisialta thar a bheith sásta tacaíocht a thabhairt d’fhorbairt na Gaeilge mar theanga bheo agus mar acmhainn don chultúr, lámh le lámh leis na Gaeltachtaí. Tá sé ar intinn againn fuinneamh nua a insileadh sa Ghaeilge agus feabhsú a dhéanamh. This is an historical occasion for us, celebrating the first Seachtain na Gaeilge since the Official Languages (Amendment) Act 2021 was enacted last year. This is a very important part in our history in terms of the development, protection and support for our language. It is particularly important for the Gaeltacht community and it is long overdue but it is also important in terms of encouraging the everyday use of Irish when interacting with the State. This is important for the rest of the population in terms of signalling the importance of the language to us all. There are very ambitious targets within this Act, which is very welcome, but we need to see progress in terms of reaching those targets. That is very important. Another area that needs a great deal of attention at the moment in terms of supporting our language is education. We have 45,000 pupils attending Irish primary schools nationwide yet there is capacity for only 13,900 students at second level. To put it another way, we have 8% of our primary school children in Gaelscoileanna around the country but only 4% of our second level students in Gaelcholáistí. This means there is an access issue for those second level students who want to access second level education through the Irish language. The Gaelcholáistí have been incredibly successful. There is a large amount of work that needs to be done to remove the barriers to second level education through Irish for those students who want to do it. That is very important in terms of the support that we can give for the language. In terms of the Gaeltacht areas, in the past couple of years, due to the pandemic, we have seen the closure of Irish-language summer courses in particular and the significant economic impact that has had on Irish language-Gaeltacht community areas. My colleague in Galway, Councillor Owen Hanley, estimates that has had a €50 million impact on the local economy. The survival of Gaeltacht communities and the thriving of Gaeltacht communities is very important to us overall on this island. There are issues that need to be addressed there on the housing front in particular and around planning. With the increase in short-term rentals and holiday rentals, there has been an impact on housing needs for people in Gaeltacht communities where people have not been able to afford homes in their local Gaeltacht areas. This is putting their contribution to the Gaeltacht areas and the existence of the Gaeltacht areas under threat and in jeopardy. That needs to be addressed at Government level.  I want to mention two other issues, the first of which is the importance of making progress in terms of a national policy on bilingual packaging. That would be very welcome. It would give people, in particular Irish language speakers, the ability to access products through the language but it would also provide opportunities in terms of employment in translation in product and service marketing. There is also the issue around communications, especially from the Government. In terms of social media posts from the Government, as previously pointed out by my colleague, Deputy Cairns, last year less than 4% of all social media posts by various Departments were in Irish. By comparison, in Wales, approximately 50% of posts were either in Welsh or bilingual. There is a lot of progress that could be made there. Tá an Ghaeilge á labhairt ar an oileán seo for the last 2,500 bliain. Caithfear gach tacaíocht a thabhairt chun í a choinneáil beo. Dúirt Antonio Gramsci gur doras í teanga do chultúr na ndaoine. Tír gan teanga, tír gan anam. Bainigí sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge.

Gach bliain feicimid go léir na físeanna ar líne, a bhíonn á dhéanamh ag polaiteoirí go háirithe, ag moladh do dhaoine an Ghaolainn atá acu a úsáid. Níl sé difriúil an bhliain seo. Tá na polaiteoirí go léir amuigh arís an tseachtain seo ag moladh do dhaoine an teanga atá acu a úsáid ach, mar a dúirt na cainteoirí níos luaithe, caithfimid déanamh níos fearr ó thaobh ár n-úsáid féin. Gach maidin éirím agus tógaim mo leanbh féin go dtí an réamhscoil thíos i nGaelscoil Uí Drisceoil i nGleann Maghair. Gach lá ar scoil úsáideann sé píosa Gaolainne agus nuair a thagann sé abhaile bím ag cleachtadh as Gaeilge leis freisin. Is rud beag é sin ach is rud é gur féidir leis an chuid is mó de mhuintir na tíre a dhéanamh lena leanaí féin. Molaim do gach duine an méid sin a dhéanamh más féidir leo. I láthair na huaire, úsáideann thart ar 8% de mhuintir bhunscoile na tíre Gaolainn ar scoil gach lá agus tá méadú beag tagtha ar líon na gcainteoirí Gaolainne ar fud na tíre le deich mbliana anuas. Nuair a bhíos ag féachaint ar an nuacht agus ar Twitter aréir, chonaic mé fís ghearr de chailín a bhí gafa i lár na trioblóide thall san Úcráin. Bhí sé go deas an Ghaolainn a fheiscint thall san Úcráin, cé gur géarchéim atá ann faoi láthair. Feicim an Ghaolainn á úsáid freisin in institiúidí na hEorpa. Tá Billy Kelleher, go háirithe, tar éis iarracht mhór a dhéanamh le bliain anuas an Ghaolainn a úsáid thall ann. Is duine praiticiúil mé. Bhíos i mo mhúinteoir freisin agus ó thaobh rudaí praiticiúla gur féidir linn a dhéanamh, ní dóigh liom go bhfuil ag éirí rómhaith linn ó thaobh na teanga de. Tá an iomarca béime curtha ar eagraíochtaí agus institiúidí éagsúla, seachas rudaí bunúsacha a dhéanamh le daltaí agus páistí go háirithe. Déanann eagraíochtaí cosúil le Foras na Gaeilge, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Conradh na Gaeilge sárobair ó thaobh dul chun cinn na teanga ach ba cheart dúinn an fócas i leith na teanga a dhíriú isteach ar na scoileanna. An t-aon rud a mholfaidh mé anocht ná go gcaithfimid infheistíocht cheart a dhéanamh i TG4 agus Raidió na Gaeltachta mar sin an t-aon slí gur féidir linn dul chun cinn na teanga a chothú ó thaobh an aos óg. Tá buairt amháin agam i leith na Gaeilge sa teastas sóisearach, agus go háirithe san ardteistiméireacht. Táimid ag labhairt faoi stádas na teanga don ardteistiméireacht. Tá seans ann nach dtabharfaimid an t-aitheantas ceart don teanga ó thaobh rás na bpointí de. Is oth liom a rá, má tharlaíonn sé sin, nach ndéanfaidh sé aon mhaitheas don teanga. Tá daoine ag labhairt freisin mar gheall ar an mbonnleibhéal a bheith curtha ar ceal. Dá ndéanfaimis é sin, bheadh sé sin go hainnis don teanga.

Chun an fhírinne a rá, is tamall fada é a bhfuil Seachtain na Gaeilge ann. Deirtear go bhfuil sí ann le 150 bliain. Tá a lán rudaí maithe déanta ag Rialtais ón tamall sin agus is rud maith é muid a bheith anseo ag caint anseo trí Ghaelainn. Tháinig m’athair ó Ghaeltacht Chorca Dhuibhne, an áit is sia siar in Éirinn, mar a ghlaoitear ar an áit sin. Nuair a fhéachtar ar an daonáireamh ó 1901, my great grandfather at that time lived there on a small farm and he could only speak Gaeilge. Ní raibh aon Bhéarla aige, ar chor ar bith, ag an am sin. Tá an Ghaelainn sa dúiche sin láidir go fóill. Like I say, my first cousin’s children are á dtógáil trí Ghaelainn. Níl a fhios agam cén tslí ina bhfuil siad ag vótáil ach tá súil agam go mbeidh suim acu i bhFine Gael ach go háirithe. Tá mé ag féachaint ar an Teachta Daly ansin. Chuala mé a ainm ann le déanaí. Tá rudaí an-mhaith déanta ag an tír maidir le cúrsaí teanga. Tá an teanga curtha san áit cheart. Bhí mé ar Apple TV ar maidin. I was on my Apple TV to see what movies I could watch if I was bored in the Dáil, with all these long debates that we have, even though this is not one such debate, agus tá an scannán "Arracht" ann. Is féidir é a cheannach ar thimpeall €13 agus is rud an-mhaith é sin. On Apple TV right around the world, it is possible to buy and watch the Irish-language movie "Arracht". Molaim go mór, ó thaobh an chultúir agus an scannáin de, airgead a thabhairt do dhaoine a bheidh ag déanamh scannáin trí Ghaelainn nó fiú amháin má bhíonn siad dátheangach. Má tá an caighdeán chomh maith agus atá an scannán sin, tá rudaí an-mhaith ag titim amach ar son na Gaelainne agus daoine i ngach tír ar domhan ag féachaint ar scannán as Gaelainn. Nach rud maith é sin? Molaim Conradh na Gaeilge i nDroichead Átha. Tá siad ag seoladh imeachtaí Sheachtain na Gaeilge i gCúige Laighean anocht. Ní féidir liom a bheith ann anocht ach tá súil agam go mbeidh slua breá ann. Ag caint faoin nGaeltacht ach go háirithe, tá sé an-tábhachtach go mbeidh cead ag muintir na Gaeltachta tithe a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht dá gclanna féin. Tá sé ráite ag daoine cheana féin. Níl sé sin ag titim amach. Ba chóir go mbeadh cearta bunúsacha ag daoine ón Ghaeltacht maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht más féidir é sin a dhéanamh agus go mbeidh cead pleanála speisialta acu sna ceantair Ghaeltachta. Ní haon mhaitheas ceadanna pleanála a thabhairt do dhaoine nach bhfuil ón dúiche agus nach bhfuil an Ghaelainn acu, nuair atá ganntanas tithíochta do mhuintir na Gaeltachta iad féin. Tá rudaí nua ag titim amach áfach. Tá daoine óga ann. Tá na páirtithe go léir amhail Fianna Fáil, Fine Gael, Sinn Féin agus gach duine acu ag caint faoi phacáiste dátheangach. Cén fáth nach féidir linn pacáistíocht dhátheangach a bheith againn sa tír seo? Tá gach ceann de na páirtithe polaitiúla agus aon duine a raibh mé ag caint leo go mór i bhfabhar é sin.  Molaim an méid atá déanta. San am nua atá againn, áfach, ba mhaith liom dá mbeifí ag féachaint ar an gcultúr agus an litríocht Gaelainne ach go háirithe. D’fhéadfaí an Béarla agus an Ghaelainn a bheith taobh le taobh agus daoine a bheith in ann an saibhreas agus na focail nach bhfuil ar eolas acu a thuiscint. Molaim foclóir beag a bheith ar gach leathanach.

I would like to be able to speak Irish and probably should have done more when I was younger to allow me to do so. Despite that, I feel strongly about how important Irish is in protecting our culture and identity. There is significant growing demand across Dublin Bay South for access to secondary school education through the medium of Irish. This creates a serious issue. There are a number of primary Gaelscoileanna in the area, such as Gaelscoil Lios na nÓg, Scoil Bhríde in Ranelagh, Scoil Mológa in Harold's Cross and Bunscoil Synge Street, which is a new school. Students who wish to continue their education through Irish have no access to a Gaelcholáiste locally. They must either travel significant distances to get that education through Irish or switch to the English medium. Parents in the community have done Trojan work in highlighting the urgent need for a Gaelcholáiste. The time has come to listen to parents and common sense and establish a Gaelcholáiste in Dublin 6 and Dublin 6W.

Shíl mé go raibh níos mó ama agam chun rudaí a ullmhú ach is é sin mar a tharlaíonn cúrsaí anseo i dTeach Laighean. Tá fonn orm caint ar oideachas. Tá fadhb ann maidir le scoileanna. Tá thart ar 50,000 dalta ar na bunscoileanna Gaeilge ach níl ach 16,000 ag freastal ar Ghaelcholáistí. Is í an fhadhb atá ann ná nach bhfuil go leor spásanna i gceist. Tá cuid mhór tacaíochta de dhíth ag tuismitheoirí. Tá cuid mhór tacaíochta de dhíth ag na daoine atá ag iarraidh scoileanna lán-Ghaeilge a chur i bhfeidhm. Bhí fadhb againn i nDún Dealgan agus tá cuid mhór oibre déanta faoin am seo maidir le Coláiste Ghlór na Mara. Táimid ag iarraidh scoil satailíte a chur i bhfeidhm i nDún Dealgan. Tá sé sin de dhíth. Tá cuid mhór obair a gcaithfimid a dhéanamh maidir le naíonraí, bunscoileanna agus meánscoileanna. Caithfimid níos mó oibre a dhéanamh arís maidir le coláistí ina dhiaidh sin. Caithfimid an córas oideachas a chur i bhfeidhm ó thús go deireadh agus níl sé sin againn faoin am seo agus caithfimid cuid mhaith oibre a dhéanamh air.

Is é Café Glic an t-ainm atá air. Ba chóir do na Teachtaí dul ann am éigin. Bíonn Gaeilge á labhairt ann agus imeachtaí cultúrtha ag dul chun cinn. Is togra é sin ó na gnáthdhaoine, go mór mór na daoine óga agus muintir na háite atá compordach leis an nGaeilge agus a bhfuil a lán grá acu don Ghaeilge. Briseann siad na bacainní atá ann. Is é an dúshlán atá roimh an Oireachtas ná an bealach is fearr chun an teanga a thapú agus a chur chun cinn. I will say the next bit in English.It is important that everybody hears that, in my view, the Oireachtas underfunds the Irish language, the Gaeltacht and those who live in the remote Gaeltacht areas of western Ireland and are trying to work and remain there. We need to learn lessons from the Covid crisis, during which remote working and learning became a feature of our lives and look to encourage that in areas where the population is dropping and the use of the language, as a consequence, is also falling. We must put the proper supports in place. Each year, when it comes to budget time, those who support and try to promote the Irish language come to us begging for more funding for those areas of the west where the language is falling off. However, it is not all bad news. The desire among urban populations to learn and speak Irish is growing quite rapidly, especially among young people. Ba mhaith liom focal a rá mar gheall ar bhunscoileanna agus mheánscoileanna. Tá éileamh mór ar na scoileanna seo agus ba chóir go mbeadh i bhfad níos mó déanta ag an Roinn Oideachais. I mo cheantar féin, Baile Formaid, i mBaile Átha Cliath 10, nó go deimhin i mBaile Átha Cliath 12, níl Gaelscoil amháin ann agus tá a lán daoine ina gcónaí sna ceantair sin. Níl Gaelscoil amháin - meánscoil nó bunscoil - sna háiteanna sin. Bhíomar ag caint leis an Aire roimhe mar gheall air seo agus táimid ag lorg go gcuirfí scoil ar bun i mBaile Formaid, i gCromghlinn nó i nDroimneach chomh luaith agus is féidir. An rud deireanach atá le rá agam ná go n-aontaím le moladh an Tí faoi Raidió na Gaeltachta agus TG4, go háirithe, a dhéanann jab iontach ag cur na teanga agus an chultúir chun cinn le cláir faisnéise a chruthaíonn sé. Is rud tábhachtach é go bhfuil gnáthdhaoine agus na daoine óga inár gceantair a bhfuil grá acu don Ghaeilge ag labhairt agus ag foghlaim na Gaeilge. Bíonn pop-up Gaeltachts á dtógáil acu i spásanna áitiúla agus tá sé sin an-tábhachtach. Ba mhaith liom a rá leo leanúint ar aghaidh, gur nuacht an-bhreá é sa bhliain seo, agus ar aghaidh leo go deo.

Ní don Nollaig amháin é coileán agus ní do Sheachtain na Gaeilge amháin í úsáid na Gaeilge san Oireachtas. Tá rudaí ag éirí níos fearr agus caithfidh mé buíochas a ghabháil leis na daoine i Rannóg an Aistriúcháin a thugann an-chuidiú do dhaoine an Ghaeilge a úsáid, le haistriúcháin agus le frásaí gach seachtain. Gabhaim buíochas leis na hiriseoirí a bhfuil Gaeilge acu agus a dhéanann an-iarracht cuidiú le Teachtaí agus Seanadóirí an Ghaeilge a úsáid sna meáin chumarsáide. Tá cathaoirleach an choiste Gaeilge anseo. Gabhaim buíochas leis as an obair a dhéanann sé féin, an cléireach agus foireann an choiste chun cúrsaí Gaeilge a chur os comhair Thithe an Oireachtais agus chun seasamh ar son na Gaeltachta. I gcomhthéacs obair an choiste sin, tá sé suimiúil a fheiceáil cé mhéad feidhmeannach sinsearach Stáit nach bhfuil Gaeilge acu chun teacht os comhair an choiste Gaeilge, chun spreagadh a thabhairt as Gaeilge. Tháinig go leor príomhfheidhmeannaigh na comhairle contae os ár gcomhair i gcomhthéacs cheist na pleanála teanga Gaeilge. Ní raibh Gaeilge acu le teacht os ár gcomhair. Ba léir freisin nach raibh Gaeilge ag go leor oifigeach pleanála tithíochta sa tír. Mar sin, caithfimid i bhfad níos mó oibre a dhéanamh. Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an Aire Stáit agus lena chuid oifigeach maidir leis an obair a rinne siad ar an mBille teanga, ach caithfimid é a chur ag obair anois. Tá an Bille achtaithe. Níl aon mhaitheas leis an Acht mura bhfuil sé éifeachtach ar an talamh. Caithfimid oibriú ionas go mbeidh na seirbhísí ann, agus go mbeidh tuiscint ann ag muintir na Gaeltachta agus muintir na Gaeilge go bhfuil siad in ann an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Caithfimid airgead a chur leis an bhfeachtas chun an Acht a chur os comhair na ndaoine. Labhair mé faoin obair atá ar siúl ag an gcoiste faoi chúrsaí pleanála tithíochta sa Ghaeltacht. Tá an tAire tithíochta, an Teachta Darragh O’Brien, agus an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, ag déanamh iarracht an fhadhb seo a réiteach. Caithfimid a bheith i bhfad níos tapúla ag déileáil leis. Níl seans ag daoine nó ag a gclann tithe nua a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht. Tá go leor scéalta léirithe ar TG4. Tá scéalta ag gach Teachta, Seanadóir agus comhairleoir contae ón nGaeltacht go bhfuil daoine ag iarraidh tithe nua a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus nach bhfuil an cead ann. Ba chóir go mbeadh cás speisialta ann do dhaoine le Gaeilge agus a bhfuil ag iarraidh an Ghaeilge a úsáid chun tithe nua a thógáil sa Ghaeltacht agus caithfimid cabhrú leo. Bhí a lán daoine ag caint faoi chúrsaí oideachais. Is léir go bhfuil fadhb ann ach tá deis ann freisin. Tá mórán suime ann i gcúrsaí oideachais, go háirithe sa bhunscoil, ach caithfimid na scoileanna a bhunú don oideachas meánscoile chomh maith leis an tríú leibhéal agus leis an gceathrú leibhéal. Caithfimid é a cheangal le straitéis faoi chúrsaí oideachais. Maidir leis na hÉireannaigh nua, na daoine atá ag teacht go dtí ár dtír, tá mórán suime acu an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Tá stair agus traidisiún iontach ag an nGaeltacht. Tá níos mó suime ag na hÉireannaigh nua, iad siúd a thagann chun na tíre seo, ná mar atá ag a lán daoine a rugadh anseo. Caithfimid cuidiú leo siúd chun an Ghaeilge a úsáid. Mar a dúirt mé, ní do Sheachtain na Gaeilge amháin í an Ghaeilge. Gabhaim buíochas freisin leis an gCeann Comhairle as an obair atá á déanamh aige ar son na Gaeilge sa Teach.

Gabhfaidh mé leithscéal as mo chumas teoranta inár dteanga oifigiúil. Ní féidir liom an milleán a chur ar aon duine ach orm féin. Bhí múinteoirí maithe agam i Scoil JFK agus in Ardscoil Rís i mo chathair dhúchais, Luimneach. Ní go dtí na blianta beaga anuas a tháinig mé ar an tuiscint cé chomh tábhachtach is a bhfuil ár dteanga agus í a choimeád beo i mbéal na ndaoine. Táim ag labhairt inniu mar iarracht cheart a dhéanamh do na blianta caillte agus páirt bhríoch a ghlacadh i Seachtain na Gaeilge. Is ceiliúradh bliantúil ar an nGaeilge agus ar an gcultúr Gaelach í Seachtain na Gaeilge. Ar ndóigh is coicís atá i gceist seachas seachtain amháin, ach b’fhéidir gur cheart go mbeadh 52 seachtain ann. Ba cheart go mbeadh muid go léir ag iarraidh go mbeadh Gaeilge láidir agus faoi bhláth againn agus caithfimid a bheith uaillmhianach agus cruthaitheach sa chaoi a mbainimid é sin amach. Ag an leibhéal is airde is teanga oifigiúil oibre iomlán de chuid an Aontais Eorpaigh í an Ghaeilge anois, ag an leibhéal céanna le teangacha oifigiúla eile an Aontais Eorpaigh. Ach bíonn rath ar an teanga nuair a léitear agus a labhraítear í - beatha teanga í a labhairt - ag páistí sna Gaelscoileanna, ar Raidió na Gaeltachta, TG4, sna Gaeltachtaí agus sna pop-up Gaeltachts ar fud na tíre. Ba mhaith liom níos mó leabhar a léamh as Gaeilge. Tá údair iontach traidisiúnta agus comhaimseartha Gaeilge againn. Ar an ócáid seo ba mhaith liom comhghairdeas a dhéanamh le Tadhg Mac Dhonnagáin atá ainmnithe do dhuais litríochta an Aontais Eorpaigh, an chéad uair d’úrscéal Gaeilge. Caithfimid ár dteanga a chothú ag gach leibhéal. Ní mór dúinn í a chur ar chomhchéim agus ní mór dúinn í a nochtadh i ngníomhaíochtaí laethúla. Mar shampla, uair an chloig ó shin fuair mé glaoch gutháin chuig m’oifig faoi fheachtas a bhfuil sé mar aidhm aige úsáid na Gaeilge ar phacáistiú a chur chun cinn.Sa Chomhaontas Glas ba mhaith linn fáil réidh leis an bpacáistiú oiread agus is féidir, ach má tá sé le bheith againn ba cheart go mbeadh Gaeilge air. Rinne mé mo dhícheall dul tríd an óráid seo agus gabhaim buíochas leis an Teachta Ó Cathasaigh. Tá rún daingean agam déanamh níos fearr an bhliain seo chugainn.
#PaDaly	unknown-#PaDaly-party	unknown-#PaDaly-dob	unknown-#PaDaly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2022-03-02 00:00:00	Ábhair Shaincheisteanna Tráthúla - Topical Issue Matters	343	Ba mhaith liom labhairt ar ábhar a chiallaíonn go leor ach go ndéantar neamhaird air go minic, is é sin an chomharthaíocht agus comharthaí bóithre. Anuraidh, bhí an t-ádh linn i gCoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge cloisteáil ó choimisinéir teanga na Breataine Bige ag an am, Aled Roberts. Fuair sé bás tamall gairid ina dhiaidh sin tar éis a bheith breoite ar feadh ama gairide. Ba mhaith liom m'ómós a thabhairt dá chuid oibre agus déanaim comhbhrón lena chlann, lena ghaolta agus lena chairde uile. Chualamar Aled Roberts, a phaisean agus an saineolas a bhí aige agus a bhí soiléir nuair a bhí sé ag caint linn. D'ardaíomar na comharthaí bóithre leis nuair a bhí sé linn sa choiste. Labhair mé faoin ábhar seo cheana féin. Bheadh sé sách simplí an méid a leanas a dhéanamh: ba chóir go mbeadh na comharthaí bóithre Gaeilge curtha sa phríomháit, seachas in áit na leathphingine. I gContae an Chláir, mar shampla, feicimid "Coillte" agus as Béarla feicimid "Quilty". I gContae na Mí, seachas "An Obair" sa phríomháit feicimid "Nobber". Ba chóir go mbeadh an phríomháit don logainm Gaeilge agus go mbeadh an Béarla sa dara áit. Déantar é sin sa Bhreatain Bheag mar chuid de reachtaíocht tánaisteach. Is féidir agus is ceart é sin a dhéanamh in Éirinn chomh maith agus ba chóir don Rialtas féachaint air seo a thabhairt isteach, b'fhéidir mar ionstraim reachtúil nó statutory instrument. Dúirt an tAire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, roimhe seo go raibh scéim phíolótach ann a d'achtaigh an polasaí seo, a pilot scheme as opposed to a Pontius Pilate scheme as you cannot wash your hands of this. An bhfuil sé sin fíor mar dúirt an tAire Stáit ina dhiaidh sin gur ceist don Roinn Iompair é? Ní dóigh liom gur ceist don Roinn Iompair atá ann. Mar Aire Stáit le freagracht as an nGaeilge agus as pobal na Gaeilge, is cinnte go bhfuil sé seo go daingean fós ina chúram féin. Is féidir leis agus is ceart dó é sin a chur i gcrích. Scríobh mé go dtí an tAire Stáit faoi dhó ag cur in iúl conas a d'fhéadfadh sé sin a dhéanamh. Fiú amháin mholamar foclaíocht dó. B'fhéidir go mb'fhearr cruinniú a bheith againn chun díospóireacht a dhéanamh air sin. Ceist ríthábhachtach eile mar gheall ar neart agus cosaint na Gaeilge is ea an cumas atá ag daoine teacht ar sheirbhísí poiblí trí Ghaeilge. Tá An Garda Síochána ar ceann de na príomhchomhlachtaí Stáit a bhíonn an caidreamh is mó ag daoine leis. Is iomaí uair a rinne an coiste iarracht freagraí a fháil mar gheall ar drochsholáthar seirbhísí i nGaeilge agus le déanaí tháinig finnéithe os comhair na coiste chun labhairt faoi deireadh a chur le ceanglas áirithe a bhaineann le labhairt na teanga. Bhí cruinniú agam le Todhchaí na Tuaithe mar is rud an-tábhachtach é, mar a dúirt cúpla Ball eile, daoine a bheith ag maireachtáil sa Ghaeltacht. Bhuaileas le duine darbh ainm Andrea Palandri as Venezia nó Venice san Iodáil. Tá sé ina chónaí i gCorca Dhuibhne agus tá Gaelainn den scoth aige. Dúirt sé liom go bhfeiceann sé na problems céanna a chonaic sé i Venice. Níl daoine in ann maireachtáil sa chathair in aon chor agus níl siad in ann fanacht ansin. Tá siad ag cailliúint na teanga agus an idiom a bhí acu i Venice chomh maith agus feiceann sé na fadhbanna sin anseo. B'fhéidir go mbeadh an tAire in ann rud a dhéanamh mar gheall air sin.

Tá sí scríofa inár n-ainmneacha agus inár logainmneacha agus is teanga ársa í ach is teanga nua-aimseartha í freisin. Tá daoine ag tógáil clainne léi, tá daoine ag déanamh a gcuid gnó léi agus tá sí mar mheán cumarsáide ar Twitter, ar Facebook, ar Instagram agus ar TikTok. Tá sí fite fuaite inár bhféiniúlacht sa tír seo. Is stór saibhir í le scéalta, ealaín, filíocht, dráma agus amhráin i nGaeilge. Is struchtúr smaointe í an Ghaeilge freisin agus gan í, bhásódh giota den éagsúlacht agus de shaibhris na tíre agus an domhain seo. An tslí is fearr chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn ná í a labhairt agus caithfidh go mbeadh an Rialtas dírithe ar an jab sin go huile is go hiomlán. Is í an Ghaeltacht tobar na Gaeilge. Tá go leor daoine ag caint na Gaeilge timpeall na tíre agus is rud iontach é an teanga a bheith láidir timpeall na tíre ach muna mbeadh an Ghaeilge láidir sa Ghaeltacht, bheadh fadhb ollmhór ann. Caithfidh go mbeadh an teanga mar theanga phobal chun go mbeadh sí láidir agus saibhir. Tá go leor rudaí iontacha ag tarlú timpeall na tíre agus tugann na rudaí sin dóchas dúinne mar gheall ar an nGaeltacht ach caithimid a bheith ionrach freisin mar gheall ar staid na Gaeilge. Tá an Ghaeilge i gcruachás sa Ghaeltacht timpeall na tíre. Sa daonáireamh deireanach bhí titim 11% sa líon cainteoirí Gaeilge laethúla sa Ghaeltacht. Daonáireamh i ndiaidh daonáirimh, tá an figiúr sin ag dul sa treo céanna. Bhíos ag féachaint ar na figiúirí. Ag caint faoi pháistí trí bliana d'aois agus ceithre bliana d'aois sa Ghaeltacht iomlán a labhraíonn an Ghaeilge go laethúil, níl ach 500 díobh fágtha. Tá an Ghaeilge sa Ghaeltacht crochta ar an téad sin. Níl ach 500 páiste idir trí bliana d'aois agus ceithre bliana d'aois sa Ghaeltacht iomlán ag labhairt na Gaeilge go laethúil. Is fíor beag an méid sin. Bíonn go leor páistí sa Ghaeltacht ag freastail ar naíonraí lán-Bhéarla. Bíonn go leor teaghlach ag tógáil a gcuid páistí sa Ghaeltacht i nGaeilge agus níl de rogha acu ach a pháistí a sheoladh chuig naíonra lán-Bhéarla, rud atá dochreidte.  Nuair a bhreathnaítear ar Údarás na Gaeltachta, is é an col ceathrar bocht é i gcomparáid le IDA Ireland nó Enterprise Ireland. Timpeall sé bliana tar éis na ghéarchéime eacnamaíochta, ní bhfuair Údarás na Gaeltachta pingin sa bhreis. Nuair a bhí IDA Ireland agus Enterprise Ireland ag fáil ní ba mhó airgid bhí siadsan ag dul chun cinn ach bhí Údarás na Gaeltachta ag déanamh an rud céanna sa Ghaeltacht, ag tabhairt post do Ghaeilgeoirí agus ní raibh sé ag fáil airgead ar bith sa bhreis. Tá easpa tithíochta le haghaidh Gaeilgeoirí sa Ghaeltacht. Tá mise tar éis a rá leis an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers - b'fhéidir go n-éistfidh sé leis an bpointe seo - go bhfuil go leor daoine i gcruachás mar gheall ar an ngéarchéim tithíochta ag an bomaite. Tá go leor díobh ag tógáil a gclainne le Gaeilge sna cathracha, i mBaile Átha Cliath nó sna bailte móra cosúil le Droichead Átha agus an Uaimh. Tá Gaeltacht ann i gContae na Mí darbh ainm Ráth Chairn agus d'fhéadfadh an Rialtas tithe a thógáil ann. D'fhéadfadh na daoine atá i gcruachás mar gheall ar thithíocht a bheith ina gcónaí i Ráth Chairn ag cur leis an nGaeltacht ansin agus bheadh siad in ann tiomáint chuig Baile Átha Cliath nó cibé baile atá thart timpeall. Rinne Éamon de Valera an éacht sin sna 1930idí ach níl an ambition céanna ag an Rialtas seo an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Tagraím do chúrsaí scolaíochta. Tá 25% de pháistí agus de thuismitheoirí sa tír seo ag iarraidh Gaelscolaíochta. Níl ach 6% ag fáil Gaelscolaíochta. Bímse ag éisteacht le caint ar an raidió agus ar an teilifís ar Ghaeilge éigeantach ach is í an fhírinne ná go bhfuil an Béarla éigeantach sa chóras oideachais sa tír seo.Má tá páiste nó tuismitheoir ag iarraidh Gaeilge a bheith ar fáil, tough luck, mar a déarfá. Níl an rogha ag daoine an chuid is mó den am. Rinne mé camchuairt ar gach Gaeltacht sa tír cúpla bliain ó shin. Bhí mé ag caint leis an gcuid is mó de na príomhoidí sna scoileanna sa Ghaeltacht. Dúirt siad liom nach raibh siad in ann teacht ar mhúinteoirí le Gaeilge sa tír seo. Tá caighdeán na Gaeilge tite i measc na múinteoirí a bhfuil siad in ann teacht orthu. Is fáinne fí é. Nuair a thiteann caighdeán an mhúinteora, titeann caighdeán na bpáistí agus nuair atá na páistí fásta suas chun bheith ina múinteoirí, tá a gcaighdeán tite freisin. Is drochrud é sin. Bhuail mé leis an Roinn Oideachais. Is fíorbheag an méid daltaí ar an ollscoil atá ag fáil a dteagasc múinteoireachta i nGaeilge. Táthar in ann iad a chomhaireamh ar lámh amháin. Mar gheall ar stádas na Gaeilge, má éirítear stádas na Gaeilge, beidh níos mó meas ag daoine ar an nGaeilge. Nuair atá níos mó measa uirthi, beidh sí á labhairt ag níos mó daoine. Is é an tslí ar féidir é a dhéanamh ná comhionannas a thabhairt do chló ainm Ghaeilge ar chomharthaí bóithre. Ní chosnódh sé sin pingin sa bhreis ar chor ar bith. Ba cheart tacaíocht a thabhairt do chlanna atá ag tógáil a gcuid páistí le Gaeilge. Bhí tacaíocht ann fadó. Fuair Aire Fhine Gael réidh leis an tacaíocht sin cúpla bliain ó shin. Ba cheart tacaíocht a thabhairt dóibh mar gurb iadsan an todhchaí.

Dá mbeinn leisciúil agus mé ag ullmhú, d'fhéadfainn an óráid sin a phriontáil amach chun í a úsáid arís. Go deimhin, creideann na Glasaigh san athchúrsáil agus b’fhéidir gur rud dearfach a bheadh ann. Tá pointí tábhachtacha ann ar fiú iad a athlua anseo inniu áfach. Luaigh mé anuraidh nach leor é an Ghaeilge a úsáid uair amháin sa bhliain, nó mar a dúirt mé ag an am:... tá baol ann go bhfuilimid ag caint linn féin, go ligtear do na Gaeilgeoirí cead na coise a bheith againn ar feadh uair nó dhó istigh sa Dáil agus beimid breá sásta ina dhiaidh sin. Má táimid chun an Ghaeilge a léiriú mar theanga bheo oibre inár bParlaimint, ní mór dúinn a bheith réidh í a úsáid agus a bheith ullamh na seirbhísí aistriúcháin a bheidh de dhíth ar Bhaill nach bhfuil Gaeilge ar a dtoil acu a mhaoiniú agus a úsáid, chun tacú leis an idirghníomhú dátheangach sin. Mar a dúirt mé anuraidh, tá dualgas ar ár meáin chumarsáide agus na meáin Bhéarla, go háirithe, clúdach cothrom agus leordhóthanach a thabhairt do ghnó parlaiminte a dhéantar trí mheán na Gaeilge. É sin ráite, is dóigh liom go bhfuil sé tábhachtach Seachtain na Gaeilge a chomóradh agus an phróifíl mhéadaithe a thugann sé dár dteanga dhúchais a cheiliúradh. Tá sé tábhachtach ceiliúradh a dhéanamh freisin ar an dul chun cinn suntasach atá tar éis tarlú i leith na Gaeilge le bliain anuas. Is reachtaíocht thromchúiseach í Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021 a mbeidh impleachtaí suntasacha dearfacha aici. Tá na spriocanna earcaíochta san earnáil phoiblí uaillmhianach agus, go deimhin, beidh sé deacair iad a chomhlíonadh. Tá na dualgais ar chomhlachtaí poiblí uaillmhianach mar an gcéanna. Tá na gealltanais atá ann chun seirbhís phoiblí a sholáthar trí mheán na Gaeilge do mhuintir na Gaeilge an-tábhachtach freisin. Tá fíorthionchar inláimhsithe dearfach ag maoiniú méadaithe do TG4, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus a leithéid ar ár bpobal Gaeltachta. Tugaim aitheantas don obair atá déanta ag an Aire, an Teachta Martin, agus ag an Aire Stáit, an Teachta Chambers, araon as ucht na forbairtí dearfacha seo a bhrú chun cinn. Léirigh siad go soiléir a dtiomantas agus spéis trí ghníomhaíochtaí nithiúla. Úsáidfidh mé an chuid eile de mo chuid ama chun mo thuairim a athdhearbhú go dtugann forbairt na dtáscairí folláine nó well-being indicators i Roinn an Taoisigh deis ar leith dúinn chun cúrsaí teanga agus cultúir a chur i gcroílár ár gcinnteoireachta agus ár gcreat beartais. Go ginearálta, tá ár gcur chuige ag leanúint an OECD Better Life Index a ndéanann measúnú folláine i sochaí thar 11 gné agus tacaím leis an gcur chuige sin. Admhaítear go maith, áfach, nach n-éiríonn go maith leis an gcreat OECD maidir le tábhacht na teanga agus an chultúir d’fholláine daoine a mheas. Is laige é leis an gcreat. Tá samplaí dearfacha againn ar conas is féidir é a dhéanamh. Chuir an Nua-Shéalainn an 12ú hinnéacs lena creat folláine ar an gcúis seo go beacht agus ar bhealach atá infheidhme go díreach i gcomhthéacs na hÉireann. Déanann táscairí folláine na Breataine Bige obair níos fearr arís chun na gnéithe teanga agus cultúrtha seo a insileadh trasna a creat iomlán agus ba cheart féachaint uirthi mar eiseamláir best in class le leanúint. Is é seo an t-am chun é a dhéanamh, chun ár dteanga a bhreithniú inár dtáscairí folláine agus chun a ról inár bhféiniúlacht chultúrtha uathúil a aithint agus luach a chur uirthi. Bealach ciallmhar agus praiticiúil a bheadh ann dúinn Seachtain na Gaeilge a cheiliúradh i gceart.

Tá sé sin tábhachtach. Chomh maith leis sin, gabhaim aitheantas le Cathaoirleach Chomhchoiste na Gaeilge, na Gaeltachta agus Phobal Labhartha na Gaeilge, an Teachta Ó Snodaigh, fá choinne an freagracht, dualgas agus tionchar atá déanta aige mar sa Dáil, níl an beartas Gaeilge ná an polasaí Gaeilge mar chúrsaí polaitiúla. Tá dualgas agus freagracht orainn ar fad ar son na Gaeilge chun í a choimeád agus a bhogadh ar aghaidh. Is é sin an fáth go mbeimid ag labhairt ar an teanga anocht. Is é an dualgas atá orainn fosta ná a bheith ag úsáid na teanga trí na pasáistí agus ag labhairt leis na huiséirí sa bhialann. Dá mbeimis ag úsáid na teanga ó lá go lá sa siopa inár gceantair féin agus ag labhairt leis na daoine trí Ghaeilge, bheadh sé sin ar an mbealach is mó. Tá an t-infreastruchtúr ann sa Roinn Turasóireachta, Cultúir, Ealaíon, Gaeltachta, Spóirt agus Meán agus san obair atá déanta thar na blianta. Tá an plean teanga ann. Tá an dualgas ar Údarás na Gaeltachta agus ar an bhfochoiste Mhuintearas. Rinne daoine feachtais thar na blianta, amhail Conradh na Gaeilge. Tá an t-éacht déanta faoi sin agus is é an teachtaireacht is mó anois ná go bhfuil dualgas orainn an Ghaeilge a úsáid do na daoine atá ag éisteacht leis na díospóireachtaí atá á mbaint amach ón Teach seo ó lá go lá. Maidir leis na daoine atá ag obair sa Roinn Oideachais, agus bhí mise ann ar feadh bliain go leith ag bogadh na Gaeilge chun tosaigh, is í an fhreagracht is mó atá orthu ná maidir leis na daoine óga agus na daltaí réamhscoile. Tá sé le feiceáil sna ceantair Ghaeltachta a bhfuil na naíonraí agus na daoine beaga ag úsáid na teanga ó lá go lá agus na daoine sna bunscoileanna tríd an tumoideachas agus mar sin de. Má bhíonn na daoine níos óige ag úsáid na teanga nuair atá siad níos óige, beimid in áit dhifriúil thar na blianta. Labhróidh mé maidir le rud diúltach, is é sin an bhearna atá ann. Thar Covid, bhíodh na daoine uile ina dtithe féin. Ní bhíodh na comharsana ag labhairt le chéile. Ní bhíodh na daoine ag déanamh airneáin chuig na tithe. Cá raibh siad ag úsáid na teanga thar dhá bhliain? Beidh fadhb leis sin agus beidh aon tacaíocht nó aon chuidiú leis sin de dhíth. Níor mhaith liom a bheith diúltach anocht mar go raibh an díospóireacht seo iontach dearfach. Bhí seoladh inniu leis An nGarda Síochána agus bhí plean ag bogadh amach faoin teanga. Bhí mé ag smaoineamh faoi Leitir Ceanainn atá ainmnithe mar bhaile seirbhíse. Ní raibh Leitir Ceanainn istigh i bplean An Gharda Síochána inniu agus is botún é sin. B'fhéidir go mbeidh deis ann go luath aitheantas a thabhairt do Leitir Ceanainn mar bhaile seirbhíse tríd an stáisiún ann. Tá rudaí dearfacha ag baint leis an teanga ach an dualgas is mó atá ann ná an teanga a úsáid. Aithním an cheannaireacht a léirigh an Ceann Comhairle sa chomhthéacs sin thar na blianta ina ról.

Caithimid ár seacht ndícheall a dhéanamh, Domhnach is dálach, chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn. Táimid ag dul sa treo ceart ach tá i bhfad níos mó ag teastáil. Caithimid níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt do na pop-up Gaeltachtaí, atá ag méadú agus ag fás leis na blianta agus leis na cianta agus is rud an-dearfach é sin. Tá Conradh na Gaeilge ag déanamh sárobair agus dualgas orainn go léir mar Theachtaí Dála níos mó cabhrach agus níos mó tacaíochta a thabhairt dóibh chun an obair atá á déanamh acu a chur chun cinn. Cuirim fáilte roimh an €7 milliún atá sa bhuiséad don earnáil Ghaeltacht agus don teanga Ghaelach. Is é an méid iomlán atá ann chun tacaíocht a thabhairt an bliain seo chugainn ná €85 milliún. Léiríonn sin go bhfuilimid ag déanamh dul chun cinn iontach. Tá €5.8 milliún ar fáil sa bhliain seo chun tacaíocht a thabhairt don phróiseas pleanála teanga chomh maith. Is dul chun cinn iontach é sin chomh maith. Ag leibhéal na hEorpa, tá sé dearfach go bhfuil stádas iomlán oifigiúil bainte amach ag an teanga Ghaelach san Aontas Eorpach anois. Is forbairt an-mhaith í sin, tar éis an fheachtais fada chun stádas oifigiúil a bhaint amach don Ghaeilge. Ó thaobh leanúnachais sa chóras oideachais, caithfidh mé a rá go bhfuil bearnaí ann. Tá i bhfad níos mó Gaelcholáistí agus aonaid ag teastáil. Tá na Gaelscoileanna againn agus tá siad ag déanamh sárobair ach tá bearnaí ann. Níl sé de rogha ag na páistí leanúint sa chóras oideachais trí mheán na Gaeilge toisc nach bhfuil go leor Gaelcholáistí agus aonaid ann.

I want to salute a number of people. I am not fluent in Irish and ní raibh aon Bhéarla ag mo sheanmháthair. Rugadh m'athair in 1899 and bhí mo hometown, an Caisleán Nua, ina bhreac-Ghaeltacht go dtí 1957. Fuair na Gaeilgeoirí go léir bás agus tá siad imithe anois. Thosaigh muid coláiste samhraidh 20 bliain ó shin agus rinne sé go han-mhaith ar fad. Gabhaim buíochas leis an iar-Sheanadóir, Labhrás Ó Murchú, agus lena bhean chéile ó Chontae an Chláir, Úna, as an sárobair a rinne siad ar son na Gaeilge, an rince, an cheoil agus gach rud cultúrtha. Tá naíonra againn sa Chaisleán Nua a thosaigh mé féin agus Helen Mhic Craith and it is flourishing. It is an industry in our village and to see the young people coming from all over speaking in the medium of Irish is wonderful. Rinneadh sárobair leis na cailíní agus na daoine go léir anseo agus rinne an board of management sárobair freisin. Tá naíonra ag Kathleen Ní Loingsigh i gCathair Dhún Iascaigh freisin. Tá daoine óga ó gach cearn den domhan ina gcónaí i gCathair Dhún Iascaigh agus ag foghlaim Gaeilge. Bhí mé ag caint le Kathleen lá amháin and she told me it is easier for the people who do not speak English to learn Irish, which is interesting. It is there and it is within our grasp to nurture it again and to try to do what we can for it. That is important because to quote Pádraig Mac Piarais: "A country without a language is a country without a soul." It is only when we go abroad that we realise this. Tá dlúthchara agam, fear óg ón gCaisleán Nua, Seán Ó Ceallaigh, atá ag obair sa Bhruiséil mar translator sa Ghaeilge. Sin obair chrua ach obair shuimiúil. Tá orainn a lán oibre eile a dhéanamh chun é sin a chur chun cinn. It is our task to keep it alive. The naíonra would give you enthusiasm, as would the meánscoileanna. It is there and it is within our being. We need to nurture, value, enjoy and celebrate it. It will come back. For years I said we should ban it; not that I want to ban it but that banning it would make everyone speak it as we are funny people that way. Nonetheless it is important and I enjoyed this debate.

Tá mé ag freastail ar ranganna Gaeilge le cúpla bliain anuas mar iarracht mo stórfocal a mhéadú le bheith in ann cur le díospóireachtaí sa Teach. De réir a chéile tá sé ag obair. Is breá liom an teanga ach bhí an iomarca eagla orm í a labhairt i gcónaí agus bhí eagla orm go ndéanfainn praiseach di go poiblí. Táim ag tnúth le go mbeidh mé in ann cur le níos mó díospóireachtaí as Gaeilge agus go mbeidh sé níos éasca dom céim ar chéim. Tá a fhios agam go bhfuil turas fada os mo chomhair ach tús maith leath na hoibre agus tá an chéad chéim á togáil agam anois. Tá súil againn go léir nach mbeidh gá le Seachtain na Gaeilge amach anseo ach go dtí sin leanfaimid ar aghaidh ag cur na Gaeilge chun cinn. Tá áthas orm a bheith rannpháirteach inniu agus tá súil agam cur leis amach anseo.

Úsáidfidh mé an frása a d'úsáid mo chomhghleacaí, an Teachta Pringle - táim ag tnúth leis an lá nach mbeidh gá le Sheachtain na Gaeilge nó le coicís na Gaeilge. Tá mearbhall orm; níl a fhios agam an coicís nó seachtain atá ann ach táim ag tnúth leis an lá nach mbeidh aon ghá le Seachtain na Gaeilge agus go mbeidh an Ghaeilge fite fuaite i ngnó na Dála go nádúrtha. Tá tús curtha leis sin; tá coiste bhuan againn anois a bhí ann roimh an toghchán agus atá ann arís leis an Teachta Ó Snodaigh mar Chathaoirleach air. Tá coiste stiúrtha eile le bhunú agus gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle mar is coincheap uaidh a bhí ann é sin a dhéanamh. Beidh sé sin á sheoladh an tseachtain seo chugainn chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn sa Dáil. Tá rudaí maithe déanta. Tá an tAcht againn i ndeireadh na dála agus an dúshlán anois ná é a chur i bhfeidhm. Is rud dearfach é sin agus tá sé dearfach freisin go bhfuil an dá choiste ann. Is rud dearfach é go bhfuil i bhfad níos mó cabhrach againn anois leis an liosta téarmaí, rud atá thar a bheith cabhrach dúinn sa Dáil. Nílimid in ann coinneáil suas leis an éileamh ó thaobh oideachais lán-Ghaeilge de agus sin dúshlán mór dúinn. Tá na téamaí ceannann céanna ag teacht suas arís agus arís ó thaobh na nGaeltachtaí de. Ceann de na téamaí sin ná cursaí tithíochta agus na fadhbanna atá ann. Tá an teanga fite fuaite le cúrsaí tithíochta agus ní mór dúinn an dá rud a réiteach le chéile. Chuala mé drochscéal inniu. Tá Scoil Náisiúnta Bhríde i Leitir Caladh le dúnadh an bhliain seo agus seo an tríú scoil atá le dúnadh sa cheantar - Ceantar na nOileán i gConamara - le blianta beaga anuas. Tá an fhadhb ag dul ar aghaidh le 20 bliain. Tá súil agam go mbeidh réiteach ar an scéal sin agus sa cheantar céanna tá an t-uafás tithe folamh. Tá réitigh ar na fadhbanna seo; sin an rud a chuireann frustrachas orm. Roimh dom a chríochnú ní mór dom a rá go bhfuil na ráitis atá faoi chaibidil againn á ndéanamh againn faoi scamall dorcha an cogaidh atá ar siúl san Úcráin.Ní mór dúinn muintir na hÚcráine a choinneáil inár n-aigne. Tá sé suntasach in am an ghátair, nó am na paindéime mar atá feicthe againn leis an Covid, go dtéimid i dtuilleamaí na teanga chun suaimhneas agus míniú a fháil ar na rudaí uafásacha atá ag tarlú. Tá sé sin suntasach. Ní mór dúinn úsáid a bhaint as sin ó thaobh na Gaeilge de. Tá saibhreas sa Ghaeilge ó thaobh an nádúir de. Ní féidir an duine a dheighilt ón nádúr i dteanga na Gaeilge. Tá an dá phíosa fite fuaite le chéile. Tá cuid den réiteach aici ar athrú aeráide. Maidir le coincheap na meithle, téimid i muinín na meithle i ndomhan na nGael freisin. Is réiteach é ar chuid de na fadhbanna atá againn. Tá na coincheapa go léir sa Ghaeilge. Tá réitigh sa Ghaeilge. Tá buntáiste mór againn le dá theanga. Is buntáiste é a bheith dátheangach agus níos mó teanga a bheith agat, más féidir. Tugann sé súil agus cluas eile dúinn. Tá éacht déanta ag Raidió na Gaeltachta agus ag TG4, le cluas agus súil eile a thabhairt dúinn. Tá dúshlán ag RTÉ tuilleadh Gaeilge a úsáid agus an Ghaeilge a dhéanamh níos feiceálaí ar an stáisiún. Is féidir é a dhéanamh mar tá foireann ann atá dátheangach agus níl úsáid cheart á baint aisti.

Táimid ag ceiliúradh Sheachtain na Gaeilge anseo tráthnóna. Tá ceist dheacair ann. Tá a lán daoine tar éis a bheith ag obair go dian ar chúrsaí ár dteanga, amhail an tAire, an tAire Stáit, an Roinn, an Rialtas, Údarás na Gaeltachta agus Conradh na Gaeilge. An bhfuil dul chun cinn déanta ar ár dteanga tar éis 100 bliain? I mo thuairim, níl mórán dul chun cinn déanta mar bhí níos mó daoine ag caint Gaeilge nuair a rugadh an Stát ná mar atá ag caint Gaeilge inniu. Cén fáth go bhfuil sé sin fíor? Is í sin an cheist dheacair. B'fhéidir nach bhfuil an polasaí ceart againn. Tá a lán daoine ag obair go crua ar an ábhar seo ach b'fhéidir nach bhfuil an polasaí ag teacht anuas ón talamh. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná comhrá agus daoine a bheith ag caint le chéile. Cloisimid, day in day out, daoine ag tabhairt amach nach bhfuil siad ábalta freagra a fháil ón gcomhairle, ón Aire, ón Rialtas, ón údarás ná ó aon duine eile as Gaeilge. Tá sé sin tábhachtach. An é sin an rud is tábhachtaí áfach? Ní hé sin an rud is tábhachtaí. Níl an grá ag na páistí dár dteanga. Is iad na daoine is tábhachtaí ná na múinteoirí agus na tuismitheoirí. Tá siad ag obair go dian gan dabht. An bhfuil an polasaí ceart ag an Roinn Oideachais chun ár dteanga féin a mhúineadh do na páistí áfach? Is é an rud is tábhachtaí ná an comhrá. Maidir leis an tuiseal ginideach, an aimsir chaite agus na rudaí mar sin, tá na paistí ag rith ónár dteanga féin dá bhrí sin. Is é an rud is tábhachtaí dár dteanga ná go mbeidh níos mó daoine á labhairt sa siopa, ar an tsráid, lasmuigh den scoil agus iad ag fanacht leis na paistí a bhailiú agus mar sin de. Tiocfaidh gach aon rud eile nuair atá níos mó daoine ag caint le chéile inár dteanga. Tiocfaidh na freagraí ó na comhairlí, ón Roinn agus ón Rialtas nuair a bheidh níos mó daoine ag caint le chéile. Tar éis 100 bliain dár Stát, is é an freagra deacair é nach bhfuil mórán dul chun cinn déanta ar ár dteanga. B'fhéidir go bhfuil sé in am to change the policy agus polasaí ón talamh anuas a dhéanamh chun go mbeidh níos mó daoine ag labhairt ár dteanga féin. Is í sin an tslí cheart chun dul chun cinn a dhéanamh.

Beidh mé féin ag déanamh gach rud is féidir liom chun cabhrú leis anseo chomh maith. Ón am seo anuraidh, tá céim mhór shuntasach bainte amach ó thaobh an Achta nua a bheith tugtha chun cinn. Cuirfidh sé sin le líon na nGaeilgeoirí sa státchóras. Bhí go leor cainte mar gheall air le fada an lá. Gan dabht, chaitheamar tréimhse mhaith ag caint mar gheall air an bhliain seo caite ach, ar deireadh, tá sé ann. Tá sé tagtha. Tá go leor dúshlán romhainn chun é sin a chur i bhfeidhm ach is cinnte go bhfuil céim shuntasach chun cinn bainte amach. Tugaim aitheantas dó sin. Tá go leor dúshlán eile romhainn i measc An Gharda Síochána, RTÉ agus státeagrais eile. Díreoidh mé ar Uisce Éireann. Tá faillí á dhéanamh aige ansin. Ní thugann sé aird ar riachtanais teanga ná ar mhuintir na Gaeltachta. Bhí sampla an-olc i mBéal Átha an Ghaorthaidh, áit a bhfuil córas séarachais ag teastáil le fada an lá. Ní aithnítear an riachtanas phobal Gaeltachta agus mar sin, níl sé á bhrú ar aghaidh chomh tapa agus a d'fhéadfadh sé. Tá sé ar chomhchéim le a lán áiteanna eile. Tá sé ag cur isteach ar chúrsaí teanga sa dúiche nuair nach bhfuil muintir na háite ábalta tithe a thógáil, fiú sa sráidbhaile. Tá ról an-tábhachtach ag an gcóras oideachais. Díreoidh mé ar an athbhreithniú maidir leis an ardteistiméireacht agus T1 agus T2. D'fhéadfadh sé seo a bheith ina rud an-dearfach chun cúrsaí Gaelainne a chur chun cinn. Tá sé fíorthábhachtach go dtabharfaidh san áireamh aon athbhreithniú ar an teastas sóisearach ar dtús áfach agus go mbeidh an t-eolas sin á úsáid chun na céimeanna ar aghaidh a thabhairt chun cinn. Maidir le Gaelscolaíocht, tá an-chuid éilimh ar chúrsaí teanga. Feicim é i mo cheantar féin leis an dara Gaelscoil i mBaile an Chollaigh, Gaelscoil an Chaisleáin. Tá sí faoi bhrú. Tá sí ar an bhfód ó 2017 agus tá foirgneamh buan ag teastáil go práinneach. Bheadh sé tábhachtach é sin a bhrú ar aghaidh. Beidh fáilte mhór roimh na coláistí samhraidh sa Ghaeltacht sa samhradh romhainn agus roimh an bhfuinneamh, an spiorad agus gach rud a thagann leo. Fáiltím roimhe sin.

Tugann Seachtain na Gaeilge deis do gach duine a gcuid Gaeilge a úsáid, bíodh siad líofa nó fiú mura bhfuil acu ach an cúpla focal. Is féile é do gach uile dhuine ar an oileán. Gabhaim buíochas leis na Teachtaí uile a ghlac páirt sa díospóireacht inniu. Rinneadh go leor pointí maithe a thugann ábhar machnaimh dom. Aithním an t-ionchur a bhí ag an Teachta Ó Snodaigh sa díospóireacht sa Teach seo maidir le Bille na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021. Maidir leis na coláistí samhraidh, ní foláir dom a mheabhrú go bhfuil beagnach €8 milliún curtha isteach san earnáil le linn na paindéime. Tá beagnach €85 milliún á gcur ar fáil ag mo Roinn don teanga i mbliana. Is méadú €7 milliún é ar 2021. Níl an Teachta Ó Cuív anseo anois ach, maidir leis an dualgas atá ag comhlachtaí poiblí i leith na reachtaíochta teanga, táimid ag earcú tuilleadh daoine sinsearacha le monatóireacht a dhéanamh ar chur i bhfeidhm an Achta. Tá mé dóchasach go dtiocfaidh feabhas ar rudaí dá bharr. Tá níos mó infheistíochta curtha isteach sa Ghaeilge, sna bailte agus sna cathracha a luaitear ach go háirithe sna pleananna teanga do na bailte seirbhíse Gaeltachta agus do na líonraí Gaeltachta.  Tagraím don mhéid a dúirt an Teachta Cathal Crowe. Bhain mé sult as an turas a bhí agam go hInis. Chonaic mé an tionchar a bhí ag grúpa daoine in Inis ar obair theanga le daltaí sa Ghaelscoil ansin. Luaigh an Teachta Pádraig O'Sullivan obair an údaráis agus an fhorais. Cuireann na heagraíochtaí sin go leor airgid ar fáil do ghrúpaí pobail, do chomharchumainn Ghaeltachta, do Ghaelscoileanna agus do na coistí pleanála teanga. Déanann mo Roinn an rud céanna. Deanann na grúpaí seo obair den scoth leis na heagrais Stáit chun an t-airgead a fhaigheann siad a úsáid sa bhealach is fearr. Aontaím le go leor den mhéid a dúirt an Teachta O'Dowd. Beidh áthas air a chloisteáil go bhfuilimid ag obair leis an Roinn Tithíochta, Rialtais Áitiúil agus Oidhreachta ar mhaithe leis na fadhbanna pleanála Gaeltachta a réiteach. Luaigh an Teachta Calleary an easpa daoine sinsearacha le Gaeilge sa státchóras. Tiocfaidh feabhas air sin de réir a chéile agus de réir mar a chuirfear an tAcht nua i bhfeidhm. Beidh níos mó daoine le Gaeilge á earcú ansin. Aontaím leis an Teachta gur cheart fáilte a chur amach chuig saoránaigh nua agus ba mhaith liom tuilleadh a dhéanamh chuige sin. Luaigh an Teachta Ó Cathasaigh buiséad na Gaeilge sna Tithe seo agus ba mhór an pléisiúr domsa an 24 uair an chloig a chaith muid i mbun díospóireachta sa Teach seo trí Ghaeilge ag déileáil le hAcht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021. Aontaím leis an Teachta gur chóir níos mó daoine a bheith againn. Molaim an Teachta McHugh as an dea-shampla atá taispeáinte aige do dhaoine atá ag iarraidh na teanga a fhoghlaim. Gabhaim buíochas leis as na dea-bheannachtaí. Tá an ceart ag an Teachta Connolly go dtugann teanga dúchais an duine solas don duine in am an ghátair. Táimid uilig sa Teach ag cuimhneamh ar mhuintir na hÚcráine ag an am deacair seo. Ba mhaith liom buíochas a ghabháil leis an Teachta Aindrias Moynihan as a ionchur sa díospóireacht agus molaim é as an díograis a léirigh sé agus é ag cur na teanga chun cinn sa Teach seo. Aontaím leis an Teachta McDonald go bhfuil obair den scoth ar bun ag lucht na nGaelscoileanna agus ag na Gaelcholáistí. Tá go leor ar siúl ag mo Roinn sna scoileanna céanna agus sna bunscoileanna ar fud na tíre. Aontaím leis an Teachta Mairéad Farrell go bhfuil níos mó cialla ag na logainmneacha Gaeilge. Tá an oiread saibhris teanga sna logainmneacha sin agus beidh deis againn dul i ngleic leis seo agus muid ag aontú caighdeáin teanga leis na húdaráis áitiúla sna míonna amach romhainn. Níl an deis agam gach Ball a fhreagairt ach is bliain stairiúil í don teanga mar tháinig leis an maolú ar úsáid na Gaeilge in institiúidí an Aontais Eorpaigh ar an 31 Nollaig 2021. Tá úsáid na Gaeilge ag leibhéal oifigiúil mar chuid lárnach de na hiarrachtaí atá ar bun chun a chinntiú go mbeidh an teanga in úsáid ag na glúine amach anseo. Tá sé an-tábhachtach do Rialtas na hÉireann go mbeidh an Ghaeilge á húsáid ag leibhéil Eorpach mar is cuid lárnach dár bhféiniúlacht í. Chomh maith leis sin, shínigh Uachtarán na hÉireann Acht na dTeangacha Oifigiúla (Leasú), 2021 ag deireadh na bliana seo caite. Is céim eile chun cinn don teanga atá sa reachtaíocht seo. Leis an obair a dhéanfar le cúram a dhéanamh d’fheidhmiú an Achta, féachfar chuige go mbeidh seirbhísí feabhsaithe curtha ar fáil do phobal na Gaeilge agus deiseanna suntasacha fostaíochta á gcruthú dóibh siúd a bhfuil inniúlacht sa teanga acu. Níl an obair seo ach ina tús mar beidh iarracht ollmhór de dhíth trasna an státchórais uile ar mhaithe leis na spriocanna uaillmhianacha sin a bhaint amach. Táim lán-mhuiníneach gur féidir é a dhéanamh agus go bhfeicfimid feabhas suntasach ar na seirbhísí poiblí a chuirfear ar fáil i nGaeilge sna blianta amach romhainn. Go ginearálta, feicim go bhfuil go leor rudaí dearfacha ag tarlú faoi láthair mar a bhaineann siad leis an teanga. Táimid ar tí dul chun cinn suntasach a dhéanamh, go háirithe leis an stádas nua atá ag an teanga san Aontas Eorpach agus leis na spriocanna uaillmhianacha atá le baint amach againn leis an Acht nua. Gabhaim buíochas leis an gCeann Comhairle as gach rud a dhéanamh chun an teanga a fheabhsú sa Teach. Gabhaim buíochas le hAodhán Mac Cormaic agus leis an bhfoireann sa Roinn freisin. Bainigí sult as Seachtain na Gaeilge.

This is one occasion where we welcome the Government amendments. Sinn Féin had put forward a series of amendments on both Committee Stage and Report Stage in the Dáil that, I firmly believe, would have given the Government greater flexibility regarding the upper limits and would have meant we would not need primary legislation if we were to return to similar circumstances in the near, or even not-so-near, future. I have had a series of meetings in recent days with representatives of energy suppliers. They are very concerned with the current state of affairs and, obviously, everything happening in Ukraine impacts on that. Of course, energy costs are not our primary consideration in that regard, but increases are likely to be a very real consequence. We are, quite possibly, facing into a summer and winter this year that will realise the same types of energy cost increases that we saw last year, and that will put families beyond the pin of their collar. It will drive families into energy and fuel poverty, and into poverty in general, and I expect we will again end up in this position, needing the Government to deliver a significant package of support. At this point, the proposals from the Government do not go far enough, although the provisions in the legislation are welcome. The Government has constrained itself through how it has framed the legislation, and the Sinn Féin amendments would have given the Government more flexibility. Regrettably, I firmly believe we will be back here again, on our part calling on the Government to do more and presenting alternative options to the Government to do more to protect families from the impact of rising fuel and energy costs. I do not say with any degree of satisfaction that what we are facing into in the months ahead is deeply concerning. As I said, I have met stakeholders from across the spectrum. They say they are weeks away from significant price hikes and they are looking towards the back end of the year. The Minister of State, Deputy Ossian Smyth, knows this well and I am sure he has been having similar conversations. He has heard our criticism of the legislation but we will nonetheless support it. I implore the Government to see the writing on the wall, look to the months ahead and the summer and the winter, and get its act together by coming back with a substantial proposal to mitigate the impacts these unfortunate and regrettable increases will have on families.

The Seanad discussed this matter yesterday and the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence did so last week. I welcome those debates and the opportunity to set out Ireland's position. Let me first say that I greatly respect Amnesty International and its important work, especially in terms of the contribution it makes to the promotion and protection of human rights. Ireland values the role Amnesty and other civil society organisations play in this regard. I note the publication of this detailed, substantial and comprehensive report, which paints a stark picture of the situation of the Palestinian people across Israel and in the occupied Palestinian territory. I have directed my officials to review the report in depth. My Department has already met representatives from Amnesty for an initial detailed exchange of views on the report. The assertions in the Amnesty report echo those we have seen in a number of recent similar reports. Undoubtedly, these reports raise difficult questions for the Israeli Administration. I am extremely troubled by the way in which the human rights of Palestinians are impacted by the policies of the Israeli authorities and I look forward to a comprehensive debate on the issue. Our position on these matters will continue to be based on international law, including international human rights law and international humanitarian law, which sets out obligations under the Fourth Geneva Convention for Israel as the occupying power, and on the relevant resolutions of the UN Security Council.Ireland's approach is rooted in the illegality of Israel's occupation and the right of Palestinians to self-determination. Ireland has been consistently clear in that the occupation undermines the right of the Palestinian people to self-determination, a right that is at the heart of a two-state solution. I have been frank and direct in my bilateral engagements with Israel on these issues, with my EU partners and at the UN Security Council in expressing concern regarding the unequal treatment of Palestinians and the application of different standards in the occupied Palestinian territory. It is important that, as a member of the UN Security Council and the EU, Ireland remain a credible and effective actor in international forums in the context of our views on the treatment of Palestinians by the Israeli Government. We are conscious of how the language we use will be interpreted. I have stated that the Irish Government does not use the term "apartheid" because we do not think it is helpful in this context. However, I share Deputies' concerns in this regard. Indeed, I am very concerned by some of the issues highlighted in the Amnesty report, for example, the widespread use of administrative detention for Palestinians, which allows Israel to arrest and detain a person without charge. International humanitarian law is clear that administrative detention should only be used in exceptional circumstances. I renew my call on Israel to comply with its obligations under international law in this regard. Ireland and the EU have repeatedly raised the treatment of Palestinian prisoners with Israel. At the UN Human Rights Council, Ireland has called on Israeli authorities, in accordance with their obligations under Article 9 of the UN International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights, to refrain from conducting arbitrary arrests and to follow the acceptable procedure established by law regarding arrest and detention. The Amnesty report refers to the human rights situation, not only in the occupied Palestinian territory, but also in Israel itself. It is imperative that the rights of non-Jewish citizens of Israel not be infringed and that there is respect and tolerance for the diversity of its population. I am fully committed to raising such issues of equality with Israel. Where Ireland has concerns about laws and practices that undermine equality among citizens and disregard the rights of minorities, particularly the Palestinian minority in Israel, we make our views clearly known to Israel. For example, we have expressed our concern about the nation-state law, in that we have concerns that it might enable discriminatory practices against non-Jewish citizens. Deputies can be assured that I will continue to be frank with Israel on my concerns in this regard. It is important that, as a member of the Security Council and the EU, Ireland remain a strong voice in international forums in respect of our views on the treatment of Palestinians. Ireland will again raise these important issues in its statement on accountability at the Human Rights Council tomorrow. I wish to address the expansion of illegal settlements. Ireland has been consistent and vocal in its opposition to settlements, which are unlawful under international law. This House adopted a resolution last May that declared that the scale, pace and nature of Israel's settlement policy amounted to unlawful de facto annexation. The constant expansion of settlements has a negative impact on the living conditions of Palestinians and undermines prospects for peace by further entrenching division and inequality. I have witnessed this myself, including when I visited the Palestinian community in Nabi Samwil just outside Jerusalem in November where I saw first-hand the impact of settlement expansion in Area C. There are clear differences in how the planning system applies to Palestinians and settlers, which negatively affects Palestinian communities on a daily basis. Settlements degrade adjacent Palestinian agricultural land, severely impacting the olive harvest in particular. They also affect the availability of already scarce water resources and cause pollution. However, settlement expansion continues, along with associated infrastructural projects designed to meet the needs of an ever-increasing settler population. I am seriously concerned by the recent announcement of further settlement expansion in the West Bank, including the Lower Aqueduct plan in East Jerusalem. These plans threaten the contiguity of a future Palestinian state, and the world should take note. Ireland has urged the Israeli Government to cease settlement activity. I raised these issues directly in my meetings in Israel last November with President Herzog and the Minister of Foreign Affairs, Mr. Yair Lapid. This is an issue that we consistently raise at the UN Security Council, including at the monthly briefing on the Middle East on 23 February. Another issue that I wish to highlight in this debate is the intensification of settler-related violence in recent years. According to the UN, the total number of settler attacks across the West Bank that have resulted in injury and-or property damage in 2021 increased by 46% compared with the same period in 2020. The disparity in conviction rates between Israeli settlers and Palestinians who have committed acts of violence is acutely worrying. Those responsible for carrying out violent attacks must be held fully accountable, as victims of such brutal attacks deserve justice regardless of whether they are Israeli or Palestinian. Turning to the broader issue of the space for civil society, I wish to restate my support for the essential role that civil society actors play in scrutinising the actions of governments globally, including in Ireland and Israel. As I have previously stated, I am deeply concerned by Israel's decision last October to designate certain Palestinian civil society organisations as terrorist entities. Ireland will continue to support Palestinian civil society and human rights defenders and their critical role in promoting international law, peace, human rights and democratic values. Ireland has been proactive in ensuring these issues are highlighted in the UN Security Council, including by supporting the call for a debate in November on the NGO designations as well as on announcements regarding planned expansion and the construction of illegal settlements. I raised our concerns directly in my meetings in Israel last November. I am troubled by the ongoing tensions in East Jerusalem and the clashes between Palestinians and Israeli police that took place last Monday. Reports of excessive use of force by police must be investigated. These incidents serve only to inflame an already tense situation. Ahead of the holy month of Ramadan, I would recall the need to respect the status quo of holy sites fully and call for the utmost restraint on the part of police in line with the principles of international law. Peaceful worshippers must be allowed to exercise their right to freedom of religion and worship freely and without threats, violence or provocation in accordance with the status quo. Ireland is firmly committed to a negotiated two-state solution that ends the occupation that began in 1967, with Jerusalem as the capital of both states, on the basis of international law, including relevant UN Security Council resolutions. That has been Ireland's position and it continues to be. We will continue to work with partners to revive a political process in line with international law - in this regard, I have been speaking to a number of international partners about how Ireland may be able to show leadership in the months ahead - that ensures equal rights and is acceptable to both parties. This is something that I state clearly and often, but I know it is not easy to achieve. Nevertheless, it is vital to establish a genuine political horizon. The principles of equality, inclusion and human rights are essential components in the achievement of lasting peace and democracy. Repressive, discriminatory and provocative policies and actions, such as those documented in the Amnesty report, take us further away than ever from the prospect of achieving a just, lasting and comprehensive peace. Ireland has nine months or so left on the Security Council. As I have told some of the Deputies opposite, I intend to try to use the influence and role we have on the Security Council to make some progress through Irish leadership, in partnership with other like-minded countries, in the context of the Middle East peace process. Unfortunately, the peace process between Israelis and Palestinians has gone backwards in recent years.There is an onus on the international community to introduce new thinking and to ensure that there is parity of esteem between both parties to this conflict. I hope that Ireland will be able to use its position and privilege on the United Nations Security Council to be able to create leverage in that space over the next nine months or so. I hope I will be able to work with other parties in this House in that regard.

When Amnesty International or any of the organisations that labelled the actions of Israel as apartheid they are talking about a crime against humanity. The UN Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid states that practices and policies of racial discrimination and segregation such as those employed by the Israeli state against Palestinians are crimes that violate the principles of international law and the Charter of the United Nations. For Palestinians, this means their complete domination and oppression by the state of Israel. It means that no Palestinian is allowed to enjoy the same rights as any Jewish Israeli in the territory between the River Jordan and the Mediterranean Sea. The central tenet of the Israeli approach to the Palestinian people is to seize control of their territory. Israel sets out to achieve this through the erasure of the Palestinian identity through the denial of citizenship and nationality, and to reduce the status of Palestinian people in the eyes of the Israeli state to that of racially inferior subjects. Palestinians are forced to endure the gauntlet of daily raids by Israeli security forces, violent attacks from illegal settlers, of being forcibly displaced from their homes and the destruction of their homes by the Israeli military to allow for the erection of illegal settlements. They are forcibly segregated. The lands fragmented, they are forced to travel separate roads while being subjected to a restrictive system of travel permits designed to reduce the Palestinian foothold on their own territory to a series of Bantustans. Palestinians endure imprisonment under administrative detention, which is detention without trial or evidence. Israel is the only country in the world that tries children in military courts. Today there are more than 200 children in detention in Israel, the majority of whom have not been convicted of any crime. Israel will not end the use of discriminatory legislation designed to exclusively target Palestinians until forced to do so by the actions of the international community.  Sinn Féin has cosigned a motion brought forward by People Before Profit. It is important that motion is acted upon because contained within it are the recommendations from Amnesty International. They touch on the immediate end of the annexation of Palestinian lands, a motion on which was passed by this House last year. Ireland was the first European country to declare that Israel has breached international law by annexing Palestinian lands. To end the destruction of Palestinian homes, the construction of illegal colonial settlements on illegally seized Palestinian lands and to end the collective punishment of the people of Gaza, ending the blockade and other restrictions on the movement of the population in Gaza, Amnesty International has called for the UN Security Council to impose targeted sanctions against Israeli officials implicated in the crime of apartheid. As a member of the UN Security Council, Ireland has a moral responsibility to show leadership on this issue. Ireland's role on the UN Security Council must be made to mean something. The Minister needs to begin to challenge the international mindset that exists in regard to challenging Israel on its human rights record. He needs to call it as it is and to not mince his words. The Minister needs to not be of the mindset that it is not helpful to use the word "apartheid" because that is what is happening under his watch and the watch of the international eye. He needs to state clearly that Israel is guilty of operating a policy of apartheid against Palestinians. Ireland must be seen to be consistent in the defence of international law in all instances and of human rights be that in Ukraine or Palestine. Failure by Ireland and the international community will be judged by history as complicity in the crimes of the Israeli regime.  The UN Special Committee against Apartheid was the driving force in the UN battle against apartheid South Africa. It was the engine that drove the campaign for sanctions. It needs to be re-established. It needs to reignite an international movement against apartheid. The international community also needs to repudiate the designation by Israel of the six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations. This is nothing more than a blatant attempt to suppress human rights organisations who are involved in essential work in highlighting the human rights abuses of the Palestinian people.  History will judge those who sit on the fence. History will shame those who bury their heads in the sand while the Palestinian people continue to suffer at the hands of the oppressive, brutal, occupying apartheid state that is Israel. The Minister must act. He cannot afford to sit on his hands and not act. He must call out Israel for the apartheid policies and apartheid regime it operates against the Palestinian people.

It is devastating in its clarity. It concludes that Israel perpetrates apartheid. It notes that Israel's civilian administration, military authorities, governmental and quasi-governmental institutions are involved in the enforcement of this system of apartheid against Palestinians. It is as frank and as clear as that. It goes on to say that the scale and seriousness of these violations documented in the report make it clear that the international community needs to urgently and drastically change its approach to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict and recognise the full extent of the crimes that Israel perpetrates against the Palestinian people, crimes that it commits daily. Let it be said, Amnesty International is not an outlier. B'Tselem and Human Rights Watch similarly have called out Israeli apartheid, an occupying force implementing a system of apartheid, one that is blatantly and flagrantly in breach of international law. However, the Irish Government claims that the use of the term "apartheid" is not helpful. Calling out apartheid South Africa equally was not helpful to very powerful vested interests back in the day but nonetheless it was done. It was the very act of calling out and naming the apartheid regime that caused the international movement to dismantle that repulsive, criminal regime and, similarly, it must happen in respect of the Israeli state. The Minister is not frank with Israel. He panders to Israel, but he is not on his own because all of the great and good in the international community equally pander to a state that for decades has flouted international law, a regime that has stolen the land of the Palestinian people, bulldozed their homes and terrorised and traumatised their people, including their children. The Minister said he wants to be a strong voice on international fora. We have our seat on the UN Security Council. The Minister should be that strong voice and use that seat and use it wisely. That means heeding Amnesty International. It means accepting that now is the moment that we need sanctions against the Israeli state.We need to ensure this jurisdiction does not allow the importation or sale of products from the occupied territories and any other occupied zone. This State needs to recognise the Palestinian state while there is still something left to recognise. This State needs to be absolutely clear and unequivocal in naming the Israeli regime as an apartheid regime. The Minister talked shockingly about his desire to have what he called parity of esteem between the parties. I am intrigued by that. Can there be parity of esteem between the oppressed and the oppressor or between the criminal and the traumatised? The Minister's job and that of the international community is not to create some phoney parity of esteem between the Israeli occupying apartheid regime and Palestinian refugees. The Minister's job and that of the international system is to bring Israel into line to ensure compliance with international law and respect for human rights. Our job internationally is to deliver freedom, liberation, self-determination and dignity to the Palestinian people. That is the Minister's job. The only question that arises is whether he is fit to take on that challenge. Is he ready and willing to lead in the way that Ireland demands and the international community needs? We have talked and heard a lot about how the international community can move very swiftly and in a determined fashion when it chooses to. It needs to make that choice now for Palestine and for the Palestinian people.

We think of the heroic Dunnes Stores workers who refused to handle the South African goods. They took that stand and inspired the rest of the Irish people and the then Government. Ireland led the way internationally in confronting that regime. How can we stand here in 2022 when there is overwhelming evidence of apartheid, as internationally defined in law, taking place in Israel and Palestine? B'Tselem, Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, which are internationally respected human rights organisations, are rightly being quoted in recent days as trustworthy sources on what is happening with regard to the outrage that is unfolding in Ukraine. We trust those organisations in their accounts of what is happening in Ukraine, and rightly so. However, we allow their findings to be disputed without robust confrontation. For anybody to seriously suggest that what is happening in Israel and Palestine is not apartheid is shocking to me. I have seen it with my own eyes. I have seen the apartheid wall in Jerusalem, I was in Ramallah, and I travelled to Hebron and saw what happened there. That city and community were devastated to protect hundreds of illegal settlers. I saw, on the road to Bethlehem and up to Jerusalem, the reality of Israeli apartheid. I met the families who are being forced out of their own homes in Jerusalem. I saw the settler communities that are illegal under the law, defined as a "war crime" under international law and subject to UN resolution after UN resolution. I saw those things with my own eyes. I saw the reality of how the Palestinian people in those cities were treated compared with the illegal settlers. I saw the infrastructure being provided to the illegal settler communities compared to that provided for the ancient Palestinian community in those cities. It is a damning indictment on our country that in the 1980s we led the way by confronting the South African apartheid regime and yet today we cannot even pass legislation that bans illegal settler goods. These settlements are illegal under international law and yet we engage in commerce with those who are responsible for that repugnant situation. We cannot even pass that law in this country. We cannot recognise the Palestinian state. The two-state solution has been intentionally destroyed by the Israeli state. There is no Palestinian state left because it has been destroyed, dismantled and disconnected. The Minister knows that because he has been there. He must change direction. We must go back to our roots when we stood up to South Africa.

The recent report of Amnesty International that we are debating was unequivocal in its findings as to the extent of land seizures, unlawful killings, restrictions on movement, denial of citizenship of Palestinians and other breaches of international law by the Israeli state. Indeed, the Minister referred to those breaches of international law. The report documents a system of oppression and domination over Palestinians which, in the words of the report, amounts to the international definition of "apartheid". The report documents evidence of policies of segregation, dispossession and exclusion. Will the Minister advocate for approval of the recommendations of the Amnesty International report? He has said he does not want to use the term "apartheid" because he does not think it is helpful but it is important that we look at why the report has made that finding and the evidence base on which Amnesty International is making that judgment. We must remember the serious and ongoing breaches of international law represented in particular by the expansion of the illegal settlements which the Minister has spoken about and, indeed, condemned on behalf of Ireland. I welcome that condemnation. However, given that we have a seat on the UN Security Council and nine months left in that position, as he said, we need to see our Government doing more to express utter condemnation at the systemic discrimination that goes on against the Palestinian people. As he also said, we also need to press further for a genuine dialogue for peace between Israel and Palestine. We need to press Israel to lift the obstacles and address the appalling conditions in which people are living, particularly in Gaza, the West Bank and East Jerusalem. There are dangers to human health in those areas that are, of course, exacerbated by Covid-19. Israeli blockades impede the flow of vital humanitarian aid and medical equipment. There are enormous issues and breaches and abuses of international law going on against the Palestinian people.  In this House and the Seanad, legislators on all sides have called for action. We have called for recognition of the state of Palestine. We have called for passage of the occupied territories Bill about which my colleagues have spoken. That Bill was initiated by Senator Black in the Seanad and the Labour Party was proud to offer unequivocal support for it. The passage of that Bill through both Houses would send an important message and show Irish leadership in banning the importation of goods from occupied territories. I am looking forward to attending the second high-level forum on Palestine with Sadaka later this month. We will hear important messages from Professor Michael Lynk, the UN special rapporteur on the situation of human rights in the Palestinian territories. We, as legislators, need to step forward to support organisations such as Sadaka that are working so hard to advocate for the rights of Palestinians and the need for a peaceful resolution. As we are speaking, we have heard the appalling news that more than 2,000 civilians have been killed in Ukraine. I express my support for the strong words of condemnation the Minister has uttered on behalf of Ireland of the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the brutal bombardment of civilians we are seeing and the brutal destruction of cities such as Kharkiv. I support the condemnation of the Russian onslaught on Kyiv we are now seeing so chillingly with the 50 km convoy. The Labour Party stands in full solidarity with the people of Ukraine at their awful time of need. I have met with the Ukrainian ambassador and expressed that view. I have stood in protest outside the Russian embassy and will do so again this weekend. Many others will also stand there as they are standing tonight in solidarity with the people of Ukraine and we will remind ourselves of how precious democracy is and how all of us in peaceful democracies must stand up and condemn the bullying, brutal tactics of Vladimir Putin and Russia.I was a member of the foreign affairs committee when the war in Syria was going on and we were very conscious of the brutal treatment by Russia of civilians there through the government of Assad. We all have awful memories of the siege of Aleppo and I have a chilling concern that we are seeing the same tactic of brutality being used by Russia in Ukraine. We must ensure a very strong welcome is expressed to Ukrainian refugees fleeing here and that we also take steps to ensure practical measures are advocated for and taken at EU level. One such measure would be the acceptance of national identification cards in lieu of passports for Ukrainians who are fleeing and may not have access to valid travel documentation. I ask that the Minister speak with his colleague, the Minister for Finance, to whom I have written in this regard, requesting that he advocate for the shoring up of the Ukrainian currency in order that those crossing the border have adequate funds to be able to afford basic supplies. That is a practical concern for many. I ask again that the Minister consider the expulsion of the Russian ambassador from Ireland given the appalling comments he has made seeking to justify the brutal invasion. In addition, I ask that he support the speedy accession of Ukraine to the European Union, as its Government and its ambassador in Ireland have requested. I am conscious that Ireland has very limited time left on the UN Security Council but it is a time when we can use our voice internationally, at the most powerful level, to advocate for peace, democracy and peaceful resolution of ongoing conflicts such as that in the Middle East and the dreadful conflict in Yemen, often referred to as the forgotten conflict. We attended a briefing on the latter earlier this week. In particular, we must press hard now to see a ceasefire in Ukraine and a peaceful resolution in order to stop the terrible killing of innocent civilians, including children, that we see going on before our eyes as we watch in appalled horror from across the world.

I accept its conclusions. I said as much in a previous Dáil debate in May 2021. The main conclusion of the report is that "Israel has perpetrated the international wrong of apartheid, as a human rights violation and a violation of public international law". There have been other reports that reached the same conclusion, as mentioned by other speakers. I refer in particular to reports by the Israeli NGO, B'Tselem, and Human Rights Watch. This is happening in the occupied Palestinian territories, in Israel itself and in respect of Palestinian refugees residing abroad. The Amnesty report makes for disturbing reading. It outlines how Palestinians are dealt with as an inferior racial group and how Israel oppresses and segregates them. It shows how Israel is putting in place a regime aiming to dominate and oppress Palestinians. It does so through territorial fragmentation, segregation and control, dispossession of land and property, the denial of economic and social rights, as well as through forceable transfers, administrative detention and torture, unlawful killings, denial of basic human rights and freedoms and persecution. In short, it does so by fragmentation, segregation, discrimination and deprivation. By any standard, this is apartheid, certainly as defined in the International Convention on the Suppression and Punishment of the Crime of Apartheid and the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court, ICC. As we know, apartheid is a crime against humanity. Of particular concern to me are home demolitions and forced evictions, which are happening, as we know, in the occupied West Bank, including Jerusalem. Palestinians are being systematically displaced and illegal settlers being moved in to replace them. This is clearly a violation of international law. Ireland has specifically criticised this policy, as the Minister said. Eleven EU countries have done so. I am pleased that Ireland has consistently outlined its concern in regard to the unequal treatment of Palestinians both in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories, at the EU and UN, including the UN Security Council. We must consider what needs to be done following the publication of this report. There have many proposals brought forward by reputable organisations, including Amnesty International and Sadaka. I received a submission yesterday from the Ireland Palestine Solidarity Campaign, IPSC. These proposals should now be carefully considered by the Minister and the Government. I note that officials in the Department are studying the reports. Some of the recommendations are practical and others less so, but they all need to be given careful consideration. One thing is clear. The international community needs to change its approach in this area. As other speakers mentioned, it took a long time to do so in respect of apartheid in South Africa. Here at home, a start was made when the Dáil passed an all-party motion last May stating that there has an been unlawful de facto annexation of the occupied Palestinian territory. Ireland became the first EU state to do this. It is clear that a two-state solution will become almost impossible if this activity is allowed to continue. The programme for Government includes a commitment to recognise the state of Palestine. The Government is now two years old. It has been said that the circumstances need to be right to do this but I would appreciate an update on the Government's thinking in this regard and whether recognition will or can be forthcoming in the lifetime of this Administration. Palestinians are entitled to be treated as human beings with equal rights and dignity. Everyone in this House should do everything possible to ensure that happens.

I welcome the opportunity for Members to speak on this groundbreaking report by Amnesty International. I commend the team at Amnesty on the years of research that went into it. I understand it took four years to complete and it is a solid piece of research. Ireland has a long and proud tradition of support for and solidarity with the people of Palestine. While many of the crimes of Israel's apartheid have long been raised in the Dáil, the EU's central involvement in the arms trade to Israel has seldom been raised. EU members have profited well from Israeli apartheid over the years. Since 2012, EU member states have sold arms to Israel to the tune of nearly €700 million per year. Between 2014 and 2018, Germany and Italy alone supplied 35% of Israel's arms imports. EU states make large profits selling deadly arms to states like Israel that frequently abuse international law and suppress and murder peaceful protestors. Ireland currently sits on the UN Security Council and is in a prime position to bring forward proposals highlighted in the Amnesty report, such as an arms embargo. The report, along with other recent reports, clearly shows that Israel fails the standards of the EU Council's common position on the arms trade. Criterion two clearly states that there must be "[r]espect for human rights in the country of final destination as well as respect by that country of international humanitarian law".Israel clearly does not comply with criterion two. Last week I spoke in the Chamber of how Israel’s occupation forces shot a 13-year-old child, stripped him naked and let him bleed out on the pavement. There is a long list of these murders and crimes. In June 2018 an Israeli sniper shot Rouzan al-Najjar, a 21-year-old paramedic. She was shot through the chest and through her white coat which clearly marked her as a paramedic. She was tending to two injured protestors when she was murdered. Amnesty International believes that Rouzan was wilfully killed, making her murder a grave breach of the Geneva Convention and a war crime. Let it be clear in the Dáil that EU states are empowering Israel to carry out these war crimes and its apartheid policies. We are facilitating it and we are part of the problem. The Oireachtas needs to officially recognise Israel’s apartheid against Palestinians and there can be embargoes. The UK imposed a 12-year embargo on Israel a number of years ago under Margaret Thatcher. That was one of the few things Margaret Thatcher did well but we are not even willing to step up to the plate and do that. We have to be outspoken and we have to lead but at the moment we are not doing so. We also have to recognise that Israel is an apartheid state.

The Shamrock & Olive Tree Boxing Project is a cultural exchange aimed at the development of the sport of boxing in Ireland and Palestine. The group of boxing clubs from across Ireland, including St. Saviours Crystal Boxing Club in Waterford; St. Paul’s Amateur Boxing Club of Belfast; and Esker Amateur Boxing Club in Lucan in Dublin are co-ordinating this project. They have partnered with boxing clubs in Palestine to create a cultural and boxing exchange programme. Three clubs from Palestine, Bedu Club, Nablus Youth Club and ElBarrio Gym in Ramallah, will come together in Palestine in August 2022 to exchange a boxing programme initiative. The Shamrock & Olive Tree Boxing Project will feature boxing coaches from Ireland taking part in seminars with their Palestinian partners to share their skills and new training methods. The project will include three-star International Boxing Association, IBA, officials from Ireland and a series of workshops and demonstrations. Training sessions between the clubs will benefit referees and judges on a local level in Palestine. The project is a brand new initiative that promotes boxing at a local and international level. The Shamrock & Olive Tree Boxing Project is seeking funds to support participants from Ireland to contribute towards travel expenses and the provision of kits and sporting equipment which they will leave in Palestine. A www.gofundme.com page has been set up for this. This is a brilliant initiative and in future it will hopefully lead to Palestinian boxers coming over to Ireland. It is a good news story that deserves all the support it gets. It will further strengthen the support and solidarity between Ireland and Palestine.

It called for sanctions to ensure that inhumane and inhuman system is dismantled. We called for this debate prior to the barbaric invasion of Ukraine by Vladimir Putin. All of us have rightly condemned the crimes against humanity that are being committed by Vladimir Putin in Ukraine. The Government moved instantly - within five days - to sanction Putin’s regime and take urgent action. The strength of language that was rightly used against Putin denounced him as a barbarian, thug and warmonger, all of which are true. All of those things apply to the state of Israel in its treatment of the Palestinians and yet the Government is concerned about its use of language and does not feel it is appropriate to use the word “apartheid” when Amnesty International, the most respected human rights organisation in the world, and Human Rights Watch, within a short period of time issued these damning reports. Those reports have said that since its foundation Israel has been built on a system of oppression, domination, apartheid and racism, involving the murder of unarmed and innocent civilians on a regular basis. It also features arbitrary detention and imprisonment; land annexation; the displacement of people; and the denial of fundamental rights to 6 million Palestinians who are displaced outside of Israel in the occupied territories, including the right to return to their homes. The illegal blockade of Gaza , as is said in the report, has left Gaza in a permanent state of humanitarian crisis. People are denied access to food and water and the Arab and Palestinian population as a whole is treated as an inferior race. Language does not get stronger than this yet the Minister wants to be careful about his language. The Minister is happy to correctly use the most strong and robust language to describe the crimes against humanity of Vladimir Putin but he will not use the same strength of language when it comes to describing Israel’s treatment of the Palestinians when it is being documented and detailed by two of the most respected human rights organisations in the world. This has been alleged by dozens of NGOs and can be seen by anybody who looks honestly at the decades of brutal and inhumane persecution of the Palestinians, the successive assaults on Gaza, the annexation of the land and territory and the systematic application of apartheid rules. The Minister does not want to even use the word “apartheid”, never mind bring in sanctions. It took five days for sanctions against Putin and his thugs but imposing sanctions for 70 years of oppression of the Palestinians would not be “helpful”. Amnesty International is calling for Israel to be referred to the International Criminal Court for crimes against humanity. Will the Government support that? It is calling for targeted sanctions against Israeli officials who are perpetuating the system of apartheid. These are the exact same type of sanctions the Government has just initiated against Vladimir Putin. Will the Government support this? The clear answer is that the Government will not. Why is that? There is such strength of feeling about this. Fine Gael, Fianna Fáil and Green Party Deputies stood up one after the other saying that the thuggery, warmongering and brutality of Putin are intolerable. They would not stand for it and they demanded that urgent action be taken but we have to be much more careful with the Palestinians and their treatment. I do not even have time to go into the briefing I organised this week on the people of Yemen and how Saudi Arabia, the most despotic regime in the world which has been armed to the teeth by the United States, Britain, France and others, has killed 337,000 people there in the past five years, including 10,000 children. Will there be any action against the United States, Britain or France for arming it or will there be any action against Saudi Arabia itself? No. There will be no action, sanctions or outrage, only words of concern. We will raise it and call on them to do things. If the Government is going to have moral standards then they have to be consistent. Otherwise they are not standards at all; they are just cynicism. We all know the reason the standards are not consistent. It is that to call out the apartheid state of Israel would be to run foul of the concerns of certain states that are presenting themselves as defenders of democracy and so on, such as the United States, the UK, Germany and other powers. Their relationship with and support and backing for Israel mean that the EU’s moral credentials are bankrupt.It is not willing to take the action. We go along with that. That is not acceptable. I appeal to the Minister to uphold the tradition this country has, going back its foundation, of opposing oppression of peoples and standing up against brutal powers that are willing to subjugate people such as the Palestinians or any others. Show some moral backbone. Show some consistency and support the motion we have circulated to every Deputy in this House, which Sinn Féin, a number of the left Independents and People Before Profit have now signed, calling for the adoption of the recommendations of the Amnesty International report and for the sanctions it recommends that must follow. Will the Minister support those things? If he does not, all the words of concern and raising of the issue will mean nothing to the Palestinian people.

The report has detailed a cruel system of control over Palestinians by Israel. Palestinians have been left impoverished and in a constant state of fear and anxiety. The report ultimately concludes that this occupation and control meets the definition of apartheid under the Rome Statute of the International Criminal Court and under the United Nations anti-apartheid convention. While there has been much attempt to discredit this report, it needs to be looked at in context, such as the context of the Human Rights Watch report that talks about the oppression of Palestinians, which the organisation says "has reached a threshold and a permanence that meets the definitions of the crimes of apartheid and persecution". Even before the Human Rights Watch report, we had the report from B'Tselem, the Israeli NGO, which said "One organizing principle lies at the base of a wide array of Israeli policies: advancing and perpetuating the supremacy of one group ... over another". These reports do not come out of nowhere. We have been hearing this for a long time. Many other reports highlight this embedded, entrenched, institutional discrimination. Breaking the Silence has regularly reported the testimony of soldiers who have talked about how they would ignore the crimes of settlers and would arrest Palestinians and how settlers would throw stones and assault Palestinians while the soldiers would ignore them and arrest the Palestinians for doing the same or even for doing nothing. Bimkom, the Israeli NGO of planners for human rights, has regularly spoken out about the entrenched racism in the Israeli planning system, especially when it comes to the administration of occupied Palestine. The Association for Civil Rights in Israel has spoken out against racist laws and laws that are applied unevenly, depending on whether one is Israeli or Palestinian. It has detailed in the past at least 50 laws, if not more, that have entrenched discrimination on the statute book. The NGO BADIL talks often about the Palestinian refugees' right of return and how this is enshrined in international law. This right of return has been utterly ignored. Compare that with the law of return and how anyone seeking to make aliyah to move to Israel can return. Discrimination is entrenched in that. Like many other Members of this House, I have seen this discrimination at first hand. I have stood on the rubble of a Palestinian home that was demolished. Not only was the home demolished, the family was given a tent by the Red Cross, and because it was pitched on the same property, it was considered a building and the Israelis came and demolished the tent. While I stood on the rubble of this house, I could look over a settler-only road, across the separation barrier, to a hill opposite where there was an illegal outpost of the Neve Daniel settlement. This outpost was not just illegal in the way we talk about settlements being illegal in terms of international law, which they are and which the Minister recognises, but even illegal under Israeli law. This outpost was never going be demolished. Here we have a Palestinian home that is demolished and, a hundred yards away, an Israeli home that will never be demolished. What is that if not entrenched legal discrimination? As I stood there, I could see the cars on the settler-only road flying into Israel, whereas just up the road from it was a checkpoint choked with Palestinians struggling to get through to get some work to earn some money to feed their impoverished families, as the Amnesty International report says. I have seen settlers throwing stones and assaulting Palestinians while soldiers have done nothing. All a Palestinian has to do is look at the settler wrong and he or she will be arrested, exactly as the Breaking the Silence report has said. I have visited the Aida and Dheisheh refugee camps. I have seen refugees denied their international law rights to return to their homes. Again, this is entrenched legal discrimination. All of that adds up to apartheid. It is not just that, but what we see in Israel's policies towards the Palestinians is a deliberate inflicting on Palestinians of a way of life calculated essentially to bring about their destruction in part and the destruction of their communities. That is what we are witnessing here, ultimately. We have seen an attempt at a rebuttal within this complex of the Amnesty International report. All we heard was the same regurgitation of the same tired debunked hasbara, the same lies that are told to justify the occupation. The crushing reality of the occupation never got a look in. The settlement building, the wall, the checkpoints, the home demolitions, the random arrests, the ID cards and the arbitrary nature of all of this kind of administration of the occupied Palestinian territories did not get a look in. All we got was the same tired hasbara that has all been debunked before. To listen to it was infuriating. If international law is to be real, we must find a way to enforce it. To allow one state to act with impunity emboldens others to do the same. We have seen it in recent weeks with regard to Ukraine. We also see it in Western Sahara with the Moroccan occupation there. They know they can get away with it because they know their friends in Israel are getting away with it. If we allow the breach of international law to happen anywhere, it becomes an insipid cancer that eats away at peace and prosperity everywhere. Palestinians are looking on, hurt and confused and wanting to know why they are different and not getting the same response. I spoke to one Palestinian during the week and the hurt was palpable as that person spoke about this. We need to ensure the International Criminal Court is strengthened and can act on this and that we support and fight against that. What is the use in that? The Goldstone report detailed strongly the concerns about breaches of international law, and again nothing happened. It is deeply infuriating. We need to find ways to enforce our commitments under the Geneva Convention. Deputy Haughey talked about recognition earlier. The Minister has spoken about recognition and said we had the most leverage with the threat of recognition before we actually do it. However, what leverage are we getting? All I see is the Israelis acting with impunity and ignoring what the world says. If we do not get any leverage out of it, what is the benefit to it? In terms of the cost of recognition, let us look at what happened to Sweden when it recognised Palestine - nothing. There were a few angry press releases and some people returned IKEA furniture but, certainly-----

The department of foreign affairs in Sweden told me it faced no problems in terms of its programmes within Palestine after the recognition. IKEA may have had some furniture returned but that was about it. If we are not getting leverage from it and there will not be a cost from it, surely this is one small symbolic act we can do to support the Palestinians.We all stood together in this House to recognise and call out the annexation that is taking place, which is a crime in international law. The Minister has spoken out in the past about the settlements being illegal and in breach of international law. These criminal enterprises are happening. If a company here was engaged in criminal enterprises, would we allow it to bid for government contracts? Companies that are engaged in criminal enterprise over there are bidding for government contracts here. There is a disconnect there. Surely, we should be saying that anyone involved in a criminal enterprise, whether at domestic level or internationally, should not be getting Government contracts. I share the frustration of Deputy Boyd Barrett. This is a deeply frustrating and upsetting subject. I am conscious that I am in a very safe, privileged place, whereas Palestinians are living under occupation and, right now, some of them are probably being arrested and their homes raided. We need to find ways to do more because what we are doing is not enough. The occupation is not just continuing; it is grinding on and down and becoming more entrenched. The lives of Palestinians are being destroyed as a result.

It is not an easy read. It sets out a catalogue of oppression, state discrimination and the widespread denial of basic human rights. It contains graphic detail on what it is like to live under apartheid, which is a series of criminal policies carefully designed to break the spirit and resolve of people in order to steal their land. Make no mistake about it. This is about land. To complete this programme of theft, the Israeli authorities must remove the very idea of Palestine. The reality of the Israeli vision for the Palestinian people is played out nightly. Doors are kicked down by violent thugs in uniform. Children scream as parents and siblings are torn from their beds. This would be bad enough if it was mindless violence but it is much more than that. It is a concentrated campaign of coercion, ruthlessly administered by Israeli security forces in the name of their government with the objective of terrorising people from their homes and land. When Palestinians cannot be terrorised from their homes, the Israelis use huge diggers to raze their homes to the ground, leaving whole families homeless. On the site where Palestinian homes once stood, they erect illegal settlements in their place in blatant breach of international law. Apartheid is a cruel and inhumane system and a gross abuse of human rights. It is the splitting up of families and segregation of Palestinian communities. It is being forced to use a different road. Like the apartheid system of South Africa, Palestinians are being forced into Bantustans, that is, fragmented segments of inferior land where a person requires the permission of his or her oppressor through the issuing of permits before he or she is allowed to travel, even to visit families. The Israeli authorities recently undertook to designate six Palestinian NGOs as terrorist organisations, for which they offered not a sliver of reliable evidence. Two of these NGOs are funded by the Irish taxpayer. This was a blatant attempt to suppress the role of those organisations in bringing to the attention of the whole world the searing oppression visited upon innocent Palestinians. The failure of the Government to attempt to counter the chilling effect of this move has been disappointing. Last week, I was disappointed that this institution - the seat of the Irish Government - allowed room for an apologist for the inhumane policies of the Israeli Government a platform in the audiovisual room of the Dáil complex. She spoke nothing but Israeli propaganda. The Irish Government has a seat on the UN Security Council. Ireland must use this seat to engage with the Israeli Government to stop the persecution of the Palestinian people and the annexation of their homelands. Last year, the reality of the Israeli de facto annexation of Palestinian territories was recognised through the motion passed by the Dáil. The people of Ireland can and always will identify with oppressed people across the world. Just as we must help the Ukrainian people as best we can, we must also stand against apartheid in all its shapes and forms. We must support the Palestinians and their rightful place among the nations. There can be no two-state solution if a Palestinian state is no longer viable.

The report details how Israeli authorities are forcing a system of apartheid against all Palestinians living under their effective control. This include Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories as well as Palestinian refugees in other countries. The report documents how Israel treats Palestinians as an inferior racial group, segregating and oppressing them wherever it has control over their rights. It provides new evidence of the institutionalised nature of Israel’s oppression of Palestinians and how Israeli laws and policies are designed specifically to deprive Palestinians of their rights. I will reference some of the findings of the report. I do so knowing that I sit in a Parliament where across the Chamber, be they in government or opposition, all parties recognise the findings; we just call them by a different name. Does anyone in this Chamber, on the Government side or elsewhere, believe that illegal settlements, enforced evictions against the Palestinian people by the Israeli state, demolitions, torture, detentions and unlawful killings, as evidenced in the report, are not taking place? I do not believe anyone does but we tie ourselves up in phraseology. I believe the Government accepts that these things are happening and being inflicted upon the Palestinian people by the state of Israel, yet we tie ourselves up in phraseology. This is not about phraseology or whether a particular word is helpful. It is a matter of law, and international law is clear that such a system of domination and oppression by one racial group over another constitutes the crime against humanity of apartheid. If we recognise that these systems of oppression are in place, it is beyond insulting that we quibble over phraseology. The Taoiseach is on record as saying the Government would not use the term "apartheid" in describing Israel’s policies against the Palestinians. Again, this is not about the terms used. The Amnesty International report provides evidence that makes it very clear that, as a matter of law, the crime of apartheid is being perpetrated. It is not a glib term or phrase. Amnesty International employs international law in the specific context and finds groundings in law. Again, it is not a phraseology. It is about law and respect for the rule of law, respect for human rights and the dignity of millions of Palestinians, which the international community has failed to protect for decades. As we equivocate, we make ourselves complicit in that. The report by Amnesty International makes a variety of recommendations, one of which was repeated by Amnesty in its engagement with the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Defence last week. It called on Ireland as a member of the UN Security Council to "impose targeted sanctions, such as asset freezes, against Israeli officials most implicated in the crime of apartheid." It called on Ireland to support action to "impose a comprehensive arms embargo on Israel." The embargo should cover the "direct and indirect supply, sale or transfer, including transit and trans-shipment ... of all weapons, munitions and other military and security equipment, including the provision of training and other military and security assistance." It seems an extraordinarily reasonable request. If we believe the sanctions imposed on the Russian Federation because of its grotesque invasion and the terror it is inflicting upon the people of Ukraine are legitimate and that we moved quickly and swiftly, as we should have, what is the difference? Why have we been so slow to act? There is no justification. Amnesty International is calling on Ireland to support actions to explore avenues to bring perpetrators of crimes under international law to account, in particular, the state of Israel's failure to investigate and prosecute those responsible for crimes against humanity and other human rights violations perpetrated against the Palestinian population in Israel and the occupied Palestinian territories. This should include referring the entire situation to the International Criminal Court or establishing an international tribunal to try alleged perpetrators of international crimes. I fully agree with Amnesty International. Does the Minister wish to comment?

When a crime against humanity is committed, the international community has an obligation to hold the perpetrators to account. There is hope that by shedding more light on Israel's discriminatory system of domination over the Palestinian people, Ireland will intensify efforts to dismantle the harmful policies and practices that prevent Palestinians from living with equal rights and dignity. Amnesty believes that this can only be achieved when the international community holds the Israeli Government and other complicit parties accountable. Apartheid has no place in the world. States that choose to make allowances for Israel will find themselves on the wrong side of history, as was outlined by Amnesty to the foreign affairs committee last week. It is believed that Israel must dismantle the system of apartheid and must start treating Palestinians as human beings with equal rights and dignity.  At this point I also want to talk about the importance of the occupied territories Bill. I know that the Minister and people across the Chamber find differences with me regarding the importance of the occupied territories Bill. I believe the occupied territories Bill is absolutely essential. It would not simply be targeted at the Israeli state. It would be targeted at occupied territories elsewhere, such as in the Western Sahara, possibly in eastern Europe at this moment in time and in other places too. It means that we make no equivocation. It would mean that we would not be hypocritical. We do not say that when bombs are falling and being inflicted upon one people by another powerful force, that this is different to that situation in another place. Right now, the international community is making huge efforts of solidarity by targeting the Russian Federation. The people of Palestine must be looking on and asking, "Why are we different? Do the bombs not hurt us as much?" The torture, the demolitions, the manner in which their homes are being destroyed; how is that different? There is an obligation on the Irish Republic to not be hypocritical in how we engage. I understand that we want to be seen as neutral actors, but we cannot be neutral in this injustice, be it on the Ukrainian people, on the Palestinian people or anywhere where oppression is being enforced on one group by a powerful force.

The report by Amnesty International, which is subtitled “a cruel system of domination and a crime against humanity”, calls for Israel to be held accountable for committing the crime of apartheid against the Palestinian people. The obvious question is who will hold Israel accountable. It should be said that the Irish position is much stronger than in most of the western world. Yet, it is extremely telling that we refuse to call the Israeli regime for the apartheid that it is. If Ireland cannot state the truth, then who will? Ireland knows better than most the devastation and implication of occupation, oppression and aggression by a powerful neighbour. If we cannot repeat the indisputable fact that Israel is responsible for criminal, oppressive acts of apartheid, then who will? Israel does what it does because it can. The only way it will stop is if the world forces it to stop. Just as the world said “Stop” to apartheid South Africa and then acted accordingly, we must say “Stop” to apartheid Israel and act accordingly. However, somebody must take the lead. If it is not Ireland, then who? If not now, then when? How many more international laws must be broken? How many more Palestinian families must be displaced? How many more Palestinian children must grow up under a government that systematically discriminates against and oppresses them? How many more of these children must be killed before the world says “Stop”? We have to tell the Israeli Government that it will be an international pariah until it engages in a meaningful peace and reconciliation process, until it withdraws from the occupied territories and until it adopts a semblance of humanity in its treatment of its Palestinian neighbours. The time to act is now. The first to act must be Ireland and the Irish people.

The actions of Russia show the fragility of the global order that has been underpinned by active democratic processes in most countries for over three decades. Today, that is under threat, as it has been this week. As a democratic people and as parliamentarians in this Chamber, we have a duty to support and advocate for those who are seeking freedom, the right to expression and peace across the globe. Tonight, people of all ages shelter underground in makeshift bunkers, metro stations and hospital basements in both Kyiv and Kharkiv. It is a brutal and sudden conflict, which has had a devastating impact on the people of Ukraine, for whom it is hard to find appropriate words. I did not have the opportunity to contribute last night to the debate, but want to take the opportunity to update the House and update the Minister on the family to which I referred in the Topical Issue matter on Thursday of last week, the first day of that invasion. That family is now here in Ireland. A grandmother, an aunt and two children have been reunited with their beloved daughter, sister-in-law and cousins. The gentleman of the family could not leave Ukraine. My thoughts are with him and with others tonight. This requires that we reflect on the fact that the conflict in Ukraine shows how clearly fragile our world order is. I suggest that if anything can come from that, as other Deputies have said, it must be an increased urgency to resolve the many other conflicts that have predated this terrible war on our Continent. That involves dialogue, respect for democracy and using our place to call out those things that are wrong, as well as highlighting and amplifying issues that can lead to conflict resolution.  As the Minister knows, I am a member of both of the parliamentary friendships groups that are reflected here tonight. The Ireland-Israel parliamentary friendship group has, on the Israeli side, one male Jewish member of the Knesset and one female Arab member of the Knesset. I am also a member of the cross-party Oireachtas friends of Palestine group and I have been since it was established for this Dáil. I do that out of a genuine interest in conflict resolution in the region, as well as a desire to see both communities thrive and live well side-by-side. To be frank, after many years of progress and dialogue in the past, the peace process between Israel and the Palestinian people has gone backwards. We must in this House stand with international legal norms, rules-based systems and the protection of human rights. The actions of successive Israeli Governments in relation to settlements in the West Bank are wrong. I want to state and add my opposition to what is the relentless and illegal expansion of settlements in the West Bank. Similarly, the practice of forced evictions, demolitions and relentless encroachment into other lands is wrong, illegal and destructive to the opportunity for peace. I have visited the West Bank, as I have visited Israel. I have seen this, as other Deputies have described, in Bethlehem, near Ramallah. It is unlawful, it is a barrier to conflict resolution and it is a barrier to peace. It is directly contradictory to Israel’s democracy, which is a democratic, rules-based system and to the values of a democratic rules-based system. We must also recognise that there are many among the Israeli political system and the Israeli people who also condemn that. They look instead towards measures that will develop and deliver the opportunity for peace and conflict resolution. Israel must comply with international law, as must every other country. I recognise how Ireland consistently raises this within its role on the Security Council in the UN.  Here tonight, we are democrats in a freely elected Parliament. I have to recognise as well that Israel is also a democracy, with a strong Supreme Court, protections for the rights of women, the LGBTI community, freedom of expression and a diversity in political representation. It is a place of political dialogue and criticism of the Government by parliamentarians. What we all hope for in this House, and we have all said it, is to see a two-state solution, for two strong, different, independent and preferably democratic states, with the protection of human rights in both, with the protection of minorities in both, with an end to violence and violence of language. That means ending and demolishing settlements. It means holding elections and enabling a strong representation of the Palestinian people to enable their own self-determination and their own self-governance. It means an end to the language that suggests the ending of the state of Israel. It means celebrating those areas of collaboration and friendship which do occur. It means celebrating and recognising minorities and highlighting where that does happen as much as legitimately criticising where it does not. There are people in Israel and across the Palestinian territory who share goals of peace for the future. Their political representatives deserve amplification, support and engagement. Those representatives that amplify violence, settlement building and racist language, on both sides, deserve our round condemnation. I had a constituent email me today to highlight that Irish people and the Irish State have friends and partnerships among the Israeli people and the Palestinian people. Our shared goal is conflict resolution. The steps to be taken to achieve that are to identify and amplify the champions of peace building for the future. We as a Parliament and as a democracy can contribute to, support and engender that.

I support the calls for the Russian ambassador to be expelled, but the Israeli ambassador should have been expelled a long time ago.There have been double standards on the part of many, not least some members of Kildare County Council, which recently unanimously requested the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs to expel the Russian ambassador. The same council in May 2017, albeit with some different members, refused to support the flying of the Palestinian flag to express solidarity with the people of Palestine, who have endured continuing crimes of apartheid committed by Israel. I was shocked last week to see that Yoseph Haddad had been given a platform within the grounds of our national Parliament. Mr. Haddad had stated he travelled to Ireland to fight against the lies of the recent Amnesty International report. The report is the latest evidence of Israel's crimes against the Palestinian people following the Human Rights Watch report of last year. Mr. Haddad has praised Israel's attack on Palestinian civil society, including the classing of six NGOs as terrorist groupings and the shoot-to-kill tactics used by Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank. My instinct was not to attend his appearance but I could not let his propaganda go unchallenged. My presence obviously irked Mr. Haddad because he tried to misrepresent me on Facebook by claiming I had asked him what he thought of the UN. In fact, I had asked him why the Israeli Government has such contempt for international law, given it is in breach of almost 50 UN resolutions. Almost half of all country-specific resolutions have been about Israel. If there had been time, I would also have asked Mr. Haddad how, as a Christian Arab, he can condone the murder of children, the targeting of vulnerable adults such as Muhammad Al-Ajlouni and the deliberate targeting of Palestinian olive groves and other sources of income, which to the people of Ireland looks very much like ethnic cleansing. I would also like to have asked him what his response was to the call by the patriarchs and heads of churches in Jerusalem at the end of last year when they said the authorities had failed to curb assaults against Christians and the desecration of their sites. Mr. Haddad and his ilk will no doubt paint me as antisemitic, as they do to anyone who challenges the Israeli narrative. It is not antisemitic to call out evil deeds perpetrated by the Israeli regime, not all of whom are Jewish. We must hate the sin, not the sinner.

I will not speak for long, given my views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict are well known at this stage. I very much welcome the report from Amnesty International. It may not be universally accepted, but it is certainly consistent with many similar reports in recent years and it chimes with my experience in the region over the past decade. Based on the report and what is happening on the ground, we can understand the inequality, discrimination, lack of freedom of movement, illegal settlements and forced evictions, and it is good that all of that has finally been catalogued in a comprehensive document. I welcome some of the recommendations of the report and only wish they were easy to implement, not least in respect of the Gaza Strip, where the completely unjustified blockade should be lifted. Moreover, in respect of East Jerusalem, there should be a halt to the illegal settlements, while in the West Bank, there should be freedom of movement without any discrimination and a right of return for all the Palestinian refugees throughout the region and their descendants. They are noble yet basic aspirations; if only they would be implemented. I greatly appreciate the Government's position - I think it is the correct one to adopt – supporting a two-state solution, with the end of the occupation that began in 1967, and with Jerusalem as the capital of both states. How realistic does the Minister consider that goal to be? Is it a consensus position among the international community or is Ireland an outlier? Are there main players in the globe who disagree with that position? What is holding us back from getting to it? While I recognise the geopolitical realities in the region and on the Security Council, everything has changed utterly in the past week. There is an opportunity now for us to look at the Middle Eastern conflict, and indeed conflicts across the globe, through a very different prism, namely, that of the Ukrainian situation. Some of the calls from Deputies during this debate have been very reasonable. I appreciate that the Government's posture is one of diplomacy, but have we come to the point where we must move from advocacy towards compulsion? That is the question we have to ask. People can rightly ask where the sanctions are in this case, where the travel bans are, where the political isolation is and whether it has come to that. I appreciate diplomacy is the best way to go, but compulsion is an option to be considered. Finally, I hate to use the Ukrainian crisis as an opportunity because it is a terrible tragedy, but we could use it as an opportunity from a Middle Eastern point of view. I would be grateful to hear the Minister's views on this. There is a relatively new Administration in the White House, which will run, we hope, for a further three years, and it is the same story in the Knesset, where there is a relatively new coalition government, with an Arab party as part of the coalition for the first time ever. Furthermore, there is now, I hope, a much more cohesive, organised and effective European Union. I do not know what the status of the Middle Eastern peace process is at the moment. Is any shuttle diplomacy going on? Is any entity or country taking the lead globally? Given that there seems to be a vacuum in that regard, does the Minister see the EU as being able to fill that vacuum and take a more leading role? It has much more credibility globally owing to how it has acted in the past week. Could the same credibility be applied to the Middle East?

I thank the Leas-Cheann Comhairle for the opportunity to speak on the significant Amnesty International report on Israel's apartheid against Palestinians, which Amnesty describes as a cruel system of domination and a crime against humanity. Some of us have long known that Israel is an apartheid state, but we can hide from that fact no longer. It is now written in black and white. What are we going to do about it? There are simply no excuses left. We must come out in full support and solidarity with Palestine and its people. As a country, we can no longer pretend we support Palestinians while continuing to facilitate this apartheid system and these terrible crimes against humanity. The previous speaker referred to an Arab party now being in government. In South Africa, there are black policemen; it is the same thing. The Amnesty report is a bleak and sobering read. It states that Palestinians living in Israel and the occupied territory are disadvantaged according to every well-being indicator for which measures are available. More than 80% of the population depends on international assistance. It found that institutionalised segregation is evident in all aspects of Palestinian life under Israeli control and that Israel's laws and practices deployed against the Palestinian people amount to apartheid. I might compare our stance on Palestinian and events of a similar nature with our stance on the recent invasion of Ukraine. I note with interest how quickly the entire world imposed sanctions on Russia in response to Putin's violation of international law. This is completely justified and I fully support this move, but we must ask why the same cannot be done to Israel. The shocking fact is that, despite the world knowing about human rights abuses and international law violations that have been happening in Israel and the occupied territory for decades, not a single economic or diplomatic sanction has been placed on Israel. We need to ask what the difference is. Is it that Israel is a de facto member of the EU? There has been talk about the EU having a role to play, but that role is not a good one. The Minister recently announced that 20,000 Ukrainians will seek refuge in Ireland and that is welcome. However, when the crisis in Kabul emerged last summer, the Government provided fewer than 200 places for Afghan refugees. Again, what is the difference? War is war, no matter where it is. People fled Afghanistan due to war and people are fleeing Ukraine due to war. They should be treated no differently.

There were 600 Afghan refugees, compared with 20,000 Ukrainian refugees. No matter what the person’s skin tone, every human life should have the right to live a life free from war and oppression. We have turned our backs on Palestine for too long. We have ignored its people's cries and stayed silent in response to the hideous crimes committed against them.The Minister has been outspoken in the House here in relation to it, but what actually happens on foot of that? The Minister goes to Europe and says he has had meetings at European level, but Europe just decides to let things continue on. We know what we have to do. The report clearly sets it out. We need to ban all products from Israeli settlements. The Government needs to publicly and openly recognise that Israel is an apartheid state and use all the political and diplomatic tools we have to ensure Israel implements the recommendations outlined in the Amnesty report. We must begin to right decades of wrongs. We can stay silent no longer. The EU cannot continue to support and facilitate Israel's apartheid state in Ireland's name.

I will leave it to the Acting Chairman, Deputy Murnane O'Connor. I listened to the Minister's speech. He spoke about being deeply troubled and about matters being "acutely worrying". He said "I am seriously concerned", and words to that effect. I note the Department is examining the report. If a busy Deputy can read the report, I am sure the Department can read the report quicker than it is reading it. The Minister might have had some reaction to it tonight because it is utterly damning. I say that reluctantly because I stand in solidarity with the Jewish people on what they have suffered. What is happening to the Palestinian people has been set out clearly in the report. They look at the different segments - the occupied territories and areas A, B and C. They look at East Jerusalem, at Gaza and at a citizen within Israel. It is a nuanced report. It is set out. I have read every word of it. The report sets out their conclusions and recommendations. I would like to hear from the Minister what he has to say in relation to it. We know what the Taoiseach is saying. The Taoiseach is uncomfortable with the word "apartheid". The Minister does not think it advances the issue but actually this is what Amnesty is saying, which is more important. Amnesty is not saying that Israel is an apartheid state. They are saying Israel is carrying out an apartheid system. On the basis of approximately five years' research and based on the research of the other human rights organisations, they set it out, clearly and factually. Therefore, when I hear people saying that this is lies or a set of lies, I would like to know where the lies are. I do not mind dialogue but if we are to make statements such as that, let us see where the lies are. When we look at this report, we are told it "concludes that the State of Israel considers and treats Palestinians as an inferior non-Jewish racial group." Listen to that abhorrent language that we heard leading up to and during the Second World War in relation to Jewish people themselves. Now that is the system. That is the way Palestinian people are being treated. An earlier section of the report looks at security concerns. Certainly, Israel has security concerns but Amnesty came to the conclusion that the "element of genuine security considerations has been far outweighed by the clear, and illegitimate, intent to dominate and oppress." They looked at the security concerns and came back and said that such concerns have been "far outweighed" by what is going on here. The report uses phrases like "widespread and systematic". It makes it clear that "discriminatory, segregationist laws, policies and practices are systematic." After careful consideration of the factual findings, the report states that they form part of a widespread as well as systematic attack directed against the Palestinian population and that the crimes committed within this context constitute crimes against humanity. We often talk about a rule-based order. Russia has clearly carried out an appalling invasion of Ukraine against the rule-based order, but what rules apply to Israel? If we ignore an Amnesty report that is modest, nuanced and based on years of research, we will have done nothing except express our worry and concern in relation to the designation of six organisations as terrorist organisations, and we fund two of them from public money. The report sets out clearly - I was going to say "in a fool's guide" but that is inappropriate language - the conclusions and recommendations targeted at this country, the UN and the UN Security Council. I am over time. I will finish on this. It has been a quick debate. I and other colleagues asked for statements so that we would have some action from the Government. If the Minister will not act on it, he should tell us that and let language mean something so that we know where we stand with him. If the Minister agrees with us, we will stand with integrity, not only for the Palestinian people but for the people of Russia who are out demonstrating and the people of Ukraine so that they will know where they stand with language. Truth is not the first casualty of war; language is. With that language, truth goes by the board, we get a particular narrative, we join in with that narrative, or otherwise we are ostracised and demonised. If we are feeling that when we stand up here, I can only imagine what it is like for the Palestinian people. I thank the Acting Chairman for her discretion.

Certainly, the reading of this report shines a strong spotlight on everything that is wrong and illegal, and unacceptable, about how Palestinians are treated by the Israeli state. I have been consistent on this issue that Ireland is a country that needs to use its influence in the UN, in the UN Security Council, in the EU and in other international forums, such as the human rights council which we will use tomorrow on this issue, to speak out in a way that can try to bring about change. My priority here is not to focus on protest or language for the sake of it. It is to try to find a way to change reality on the ground. That is why I have chosen engagement to do that as opposed to making statements and using language that, I believe, will potentially isolate Ireland on this issue. I have been consistent in that approach for the past number of years. I have been to Israel and Palestine five or six times now as Minister for Foreign Affairs, which is more than any other country I have been to outside of the European Union. I have done so because I want Ireland to be involved in this issue, and because I know that Irish people care about it and are knowledgeable in relation to it. When people say that they want me to use our position on the Security Council to speak up, I say that we are doing that. Every month we speak up on this issue. We did so again on 22 February. When people say to me that they want Ireland to make a difference on this issue, I say that is what we are trying to do. We are undoubtedly now seen as the most vocal country in the European Union on the Middle East peace process in terms of getting across a Palestinian perspective as well as holding the Israeli Government to account in terms of international law. A number of months ago, we decided to effectively agree a motion in this House calling out de facto annexation in the West Bank because of the strategic nature, pace and extent of Israeli settlement expansion across the West Bank. People made the case for that motion and they were right. We called that out. Many people said to me that if we did that, it would create a domino effect across the European Union and other parliaments would do the same. We were right to do what we did that night but it did not create a domino effect across the European Union, even though I have spoken to many of my colleagues explaining why we did it and suggesting that they should do the same. If we are serious in this Parliament about trying to protect the Palestinians and to create a relationship with Israel that can help to change Israeli Government policy towards Palestinians, we have to engage. That is not achieved by expelling the Israeli ambassador. You cannot say we need to engage through the UN Security Council with the Israeli Government to try to bring about change in the Middle East and at the same time cut off our diplomatic channels for communication with a country. That is not consistent. I care about this issue as much as the Deputies opposite do.I too have stood in UNRWA schools speaking to young teenage girls about their future, hemmed in in Gaza, unable to fulfil their full potential because of a blockade. I am driven by that too in terms of the commitments that I have given on behalf of our Government and country in wanting to help those people to a better future. I have done the same across the West Bank, visiting people's homes and farms at different times. I have been speaking to Bedouin communities, who have been pushed out of their lands. I have seen the settlement infrastructure, strategically linking settlement to settlement across the West Bank. Let us be clear: the outcome that we are looking for here is the same - a two-state solution; two peoples that respect each other living in peace side by side; an end to illegal occupation, an end to relentless expansion of settlements; an end to forced evictions; an end to impunity on the back of settler violence towards Palestinian communities; and an end to violence against Israel coming from Palestinian sources too, in particular from terrorist organisations in Gaza. If we are serious about being a force for change in this space, and using our position in the European Union and using our influence on the Security Council, we have to build an alliance to do that.

That is the difference in the approach between me and many of the Members opposite. It is a judgment call politically in how we should approach that. I agree with Deputy Berry, whom I know has served time in the Middle East, and has been in either UNIFIL or UNDOF, or perhaps both. One of the reasons Irish people are so knowledgeable and interested in this part of the world is because close to 50% of our Defence Forces have served in UNIFIL or UNDOF at some point in their career. That drives more knowledge and concern and a sense of injustice across society in terms of what continues to happen across the Middle East, in particular towards the Palestinians. Do I believe a two-state solution is still possible? Yes, I do. Do I believe that people are actively looking to undermine it as weeks and months go by? Yes, I do. Am I worried about the possible illegality of the recent announcements by the Israeli Government on the strategic nature of the latest settlement expansion that is being announced to essentially cut off Palestinian communities from each other in the context of a future Palestinian state? Yes, I am worried about that. Yes, it is illegal, and, yes, I call it out. Do I want to engage with an Israeli government? Yes, I do as well. Do I want to work with the Palestinian Authority to create a more credible political leadership across Palestine? Yes, I want to do that too. I have been working with other countries to try to help do that, both in the region and in the EU and elsewhere. I will continue to do that. It is my judgment that if we isolate ourselves by the strength of language that we use at this stage, even though we may passionately believe in that, then my job becomes more difficult in trying to create that consensus. Deputy Boyd Barrett is correct that the EU has responded in an extraordinary way to the shocking violence that we are seeing as war is waged on Ukraine from Russia. It has been an extraordinary response. I have never seen anything like it in my 23 years of politics linked to the Union. If we could respond like that to other conflicts around the world, whether in Yemen, Ethiopia over the past year, Afghanistan or Syria, that would be a powerful thing. If we could create that kind of consensus, drive and influence in the context of encouraging and pushing for peace in the Middle East, that would be a powerful thing too, but to achieve that, consensus has to be achieved, or at least partial consensus by building an alliance of countries that are willing to push in that direction. Ireland does not have the capacity to impose sanctions on its own. Ireland does not have the capacity to impose an arms embargo on its own, not that we sell arms anyway, but we can create momentum around that kind of activity by creating a narrative that is agreed by other countries in the EU. That builds momentum - the kind of momentum that we have created in the context of the horrors of the war in Ukraine right now. The approach that I defend and take is one of engagement with an Israeli Government that is highly diverse and that has multiple partners to it, including Arab partners. I have invested in trying to build a relationship with the Israeli Foreign Minister, and I make no apologies for that. That is what Ireland should be doing as a member of the international community and as a country that wants to change Israeli policy towards Palestinians. I will also work with others in an effort to try to build momentum in that space. In the meantime, we are a country that continues to support Palestinians from a humanitarian perspective. I remain a strong advocate for UNRWA, as others try to undermine its credibility as an organisation. So far this year, we have committed €6 million to UNRWA and we may commit more. I think it was €9 million last year. I see the extraordinary benefits of UNRWA through education, healthcare, income distribution and so on that UNRWA continues to provide. I accept the strength of feeling and also much of what is outlined in this Amnesty report. We will study it. We will study the recommendations and conclusions of that report and I expect we will use it to influence the approach that we take towards trying to protect and encourage a peace process that can deliver a two-state solution, which is absolutely the Government's priority in this debate.
