        <heading>Lost at Sea Scheme: Discussion with Minister of State</heading>
        <speech by="#JohnnyBrady" as="#Chairman" eId="spk_1">
          <from>Chairman</from>
          <p eId="para_14">I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food with special responsibility for fisheries and forestry, Deputy Seán Connick, and his officials.  As this is the Minister of State's first meeting with the joint committee, I wish him well in his new position.  On behalf of the joint committee and the delegation which travelled to Brussels for an important fisheries meeting a few weeks ago, I thank him and his officials for the briefing they provided.  It was much appreciated by members.</p>
          <p eId="para_15">The format of today's meeting, which will discuss the Ombudsman's special report on the lost at sea scheme, will be the same as previous meetings on the issue.  Each spokesperson will have 12 minutes for questions and answers with the Minister of State, while other members will have ten minutes each.</p>
          <p eId="para_16">Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official, by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#SeanConnick" as="#Minister_of_State_at_the_Department_of_Agriculture,_Fisheries_and_Food" eId="spk_2">
          <from>Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Fisheries and Food (Deputy Seán Connick)</from>
          <p eId="para_17">I welcome the opportunity to appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Agriculture, Fisheries and Food as part of the committee's consideration of the lost at sea scheme.  I hope I can be of assistance to the committee's consideration of the issue.</p>
          <p eId="para_18">The committee has already heard from a number of witnesses, including the Ombudsman, whose report prompted this series of committee meetings, the former Minister, Deputy Frank Fahey, who introduced the scheme, the current Secretary General of my Department as well as the former Secretary General of the then Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and those officials who were serving in the Department at the time the scheme was introduced.</p>
          <p eId="para_19">I have followed the proceedings of the committee with great interest.  I found it particularly interesting to study the interactions between the then Minister and the officials in the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources at that time and how, through their respective roles, policies were developed and advanced.  I do not propose to cover all of the ground which has already been covered by previous witnesses, although there is total common ground between my views and those of the current Secretary General of the Department.</p>
          <p eId="para_20">Through the contributions of the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, and the former Secretary General of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources, the committee has heard extensively about the circumstances through which the scheme was designed and introduced.  The current Secretary General of the Department dealt extensively with the Ombudsman's report and the reasons the Department has taken the view it has on the Ombudsman's recommendations.</p>
          <p eId="para_21">At the outset, I extend my sympathy to the Byrne family, whose tragedy is central to the Ombudsman's report.  Their loss was, obviously, immense and, to reiterate what the current Secretary General said, the Department's attitude to their application and the position taken since in no way implies disregard for the tragic loss of life suffered and the circumstances in which the family found themselves as a result of that loss.  Since my appointment as Minister of State with special responsibility for fisheries, I have been visiting various fishing communities and I have been emphasising my determination to work with those communities to advance the Irish fishing industry, not least in the context of the review of the Common Fisheries Policy.</p>
          <p eId="para_22">I have already placed on record my respect for the Ombudsman and her office.  In the case of this particular report, I accept that the Ombudsman exercised her right to submit a special report only after lengthy correspondence and dialogue with the Department.  The report is both thorough and comprehensive.  If the Department and I do not agree with the Ombudsman's findings, as in this case, that should not be taken to imply disrespect for the Ombudsman and the work of her office.</p>
          <p eId="para_23">The background to the lost at sea scheme has already been set out in considerable detail, both by me and my predecessor, Deputy Tony Killeen.  That background has also been considered exhaustively by the committee in its meetings with Deputy Fahey, the current Secretary General and the former Secretary General of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources and his officials who worked at that time on the design and promulgation of the scheme.  The Department has made available all relevant records to the Ombudsman.  I believe my Department has assisted the committee in every way possible.  As anxious as I am to be of whatever assistance I can be to the committee, I do not believe I can add any facts today.</p>
          <p eId="para_24">The former officials of the Department of the Marine and Natural Resources who attended the committee and who were responsible for the design and promulgation of the scheme have explained in great detail the basis for the decisions they made in regard to every step of the process of designing the scheme, advertising it and evaluating those applications received.  I have no reason to differ with the positions taken by those officials.</p>
          <p eId="para_25">I am satisfied and I believe that it is clear from the information previously provided to the committee and supported by the Department's files, that the scheme was carefully developed and fairly administered.  The Ombudsman has expressly acknowledged as much.  She has also acknowledged that the Department is free in law to disagree with her findings and to refuse to implement her recommendations.  Both the former Minister of State, Deputy Killeen, and I have previously dealt in considerable detail with the Ombudsman's findings in our respective contributions to the Dáil and Seanad debates.</p>
          <p eId="para_26">I reiterate the comments of the current Secretary General  who told the committee that the Department's decision not to accept the Ombudsman's findings or recommendations in this case was taken only after extensive analysis of the background papers relating to the scheme and to this particular case and only after taking account of all the issues surrounding it as well as the legal advice available.</p>
          <p eId="para_27">There is a genuine concern that the Ombudsman's recommendation in this case could give rise to significant financial liabilities arising from claims from other unsuccessful applications under this scheme that may well in turn undermine other schemes right across the public service.  In his presentation to the committee, the current Secretary General dealt extensively with this issue and the basis for the concerns held by the Department about the potential precedent that might be set for other schemes.</p>
          <p eId="para_28">The committee has had a number of presentations and had the opportunity to interview a wide range of people, ranging from the Ombudsman to the current and former Ministers and the present and former Secretaries General.  Members have heard a range of well informed views and opinions.  I am confident that a fair and objective examination by the committee of all the written and oral evidence placed before it over the past two months will show that the Department's position is both fair and reasonable.  I have nothing further to add to the detail of what has already been well covered at previous meetings of the committee.  I await the outcome of the committee's deliberations and look forward to reading its report.</p>

        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_3">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_29">I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, on his first appearance before the committee to deal with a complex and controversial issue which requires familiarity with much detail.  I trust he is well briefed and on top of his portfolio.  I am appalled at his opening remarks.  Just because one repeats something <i>ad nauseam</i> does not mean it is true.  The same goes for the Minister for Agriculture, Fisheries and Food, Deputy Smith, and the former Minister of State, Deputy Killeen.  I take absolute exception to the paragraph at the bottom of page three of the Minister of State’s script which states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_30">I am satisfied and I believe that it is clear from the information previously provided to the committee and supported by the Department's files, that the scheme was carefully developed and fairly administered.  The Ombudsman has expressly acknowledged as much.</p>
          <p eId="para_31">That is patently untrue.  I ask the Minister of State to retract that from the public record.  I wish to read what the Ombudsman says on page 81 of her report.  She found that:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_32">The way the Lost at Sea Scheme was designed was contrary to fair and sound administration.  The specific weaknesses in the design process included, lack of adequate research, lack of thorough documented analysis of the pros and cons of the various criteria and a failure to include provision for discretion in the vetting of applications.</p>
          <p eId="para_33">That is but one of a number of her findings.  It is unfair to the committee and to the Office of the Ombudsman for the Minister of State in his address to seek to hide behind a fig leaf.  It was his contention that that was part of the Ombudsman's report but it is patently not the case that the scheme was "carefully developed and fairly administered".  We are meeting because the Ombudsman found there was "maladministration contrary to sound and fair administrative principles".  That was one of the Ombudsman's critical findings.</p>
          <p eId="para_34">A second critical finding is in respect of the Byrne family.  I invite the Minister of State to accept that what he has stated on the public record is inaccurate in respect of the Ombudsman's findings.  That is my first question.</p>
          <p eId="para_35"><b>Deputy Seán Connick</b> I thought the Deputy had a number of questions.</p>
        </speech>
        <speech by="#MichaelCreed" eId="spk_4">
          <from>Deputy Michael Creed</from>
          <p eId="para_36">I have 12 minutes so I will ask the others later.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_37">I am sorry the Deputy has taken that particular line.  I will refer again to the Ombudsman's report.  On page 18 she states: "I had found no evidence to suggest that, once the scheme was launched, that it was not applied equitably."  That is the actual position.</p>

          <p eId="para_51">Let me move on to the maladministration finding.  The Ombudsman, in her correspondence to Deputy Fahey, copies of which correspondence were forwarded to members, said there is no difference between the terms "maladministration", as mentioned in page 18 of the report, and "contrary to fair and sound administration".</p>
          <p eId="para_52">With regard to maladministration, given that the Department acknowledged in the early days of designing the lost at sea scheme that it had in house details of all vessels lost at sea, does the Minister not believe it would have been appropriate to trawl through or inquire into the 120 files in the maritime safety division?  That line of inquiry was never pursued.  That 16 known individuals were the only people who were put on an inside track, thus adding insult to injury, backs up the finding of maladministration and gives the impression that there was an inner circle which was favoured during the design and administration of the scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_53">The 16 cases to which the Deputy referred concern people who were lobbying intensively at the time.  They were seeking the introduction of a new scheme.  I am aware the sea-fisheries administration division sought from the marine safety division the information regarding other boats.  The difficulty was that files were in deep storage, as the Deputy is well aware from the reports.  It was not pursued through the Department following that particular answer.  I cannot answer in that regard at this point but, at the time in question, it was felt that by going to the various organisations and consulting the industry representatives, people who were at a loss and whom the scheme might suit would be found.</p>

          <p eId="para_55">I do not accept that there was maladministration.  I agree with Mr. Tom Carroll that the finding of maladministration is harsh.  The issue of the files was dealt with at the previous meeting by the former Secretary General, who was in charge at that time.  I do not have much more to add other than that I do not accept the charge of maladministration.  There is quite a difference between maladministration and procedure that is contrary to fair and sound administration.</p>

With regard to the issue of maladministration, he said, "I do not wish to diminish the standing of the findings of the Ombudsman where she states that elements of the Scheme design 'were contrary to fair and sound administration', but the possible cascade from what might be described as minor administration failings, [...]".

The Minister of State said he would like there to have been a heavier trawl.  If he accepts not doing so was a failing, be it through maladministration or a "minor administration failing", as it was described by Randall Plunkett, he must accept that if the 120 people had been written to, we would not be here.  If they had been written to, they could have applied to enter the scheme and nobody could have been accused of being on the inside track.  We are present today because of administrative failings.  Let us not get hung up over word games in respect of whether they were minor or major.  The Minister of State accepts there was a failing.  Does he not accept that, if the Department had written to all 120 individuals, the case for the Ombudsman to carry out an investigation would not have existed?</p>

Does the Minister accept that does not stack up at all.  There were 68 applications.  The Department said that, of the 68, only six qualified.  Of the 62 that did not qualify, six felt sufficiently strongly about their refusal that they went to the Ombudsman.  Of those six, one was successful in the upholding of a complaint.  By any mathematical analysis, the argument that there would have been a cascade of applicants had the Department yielded does not stack up.  Since the recent publicity, the Office of the Ombudsman confirmed it has only received two further inquiries.  The argument does not stand up.</p>

          <p eId="para_83">We need to take cognisance that the Minister of State must speak authoritatively about the design and promulgation of a scheme which predates his membership of the House.  On one level and with a degree of equity, one must recognise it is difficult for him to speak with some authority on the scheme's good parts and flaws several years after it has finished.</p>
          <p eId="para_84">Having said that, there is nothing new in what the Minister of State has said today.  With respect to him, I must conclude he is following the line of his Department's Secretary General, which he acknowledged in his opening statement.  When the committee was seeking witnesses to the lost at sea scheme, the obvious move was to request the current Minister with responsibility for fisheries to attend the committee.  However, it is not surprising he has followed the same line.  Who among us would not do so in a particular set of circumstances?</p>
          <p eId="para_85">The issue for the Labour Party is whether this committee will support the Ombudsman's findings in her special report laid before the Oireachtas that there was maladministration or administration contrary to sound and fair principles of the scheme in question.  The other issue is whether the Byrne family has a legitimate case in their complaint about the scheme to the Ombudsman.</p>
          <p eId="para_86">My view, and that of the Labour Party, is that they have a legitimate case.  However, it is clear from the Minister of State's submission he has made up his mind, along the same lines as the Minister and the Secretary General, that there is no case to answer.  The Government will, therefore, run contrary to the Ombudsman's view.</p>
          <p eId="para_87">If the Oireachtas is to give due regard to the Ombudsman's independent role, it must respect the findings of any report she lays before the House.  If any citizen is to have confidence in making a complaint to the Ombudsman, the right option is for the Oireachtas to accept her findings, the independence of her office and move on.</p>

          <p eId="para_104">It is ironic that today is an historical day in which after 38 years, 14 people in Derry got justice while we have a family, along with their community and other coastal communities, sitting in the Visitors Gallery fighting for justice from the Government.  I hope it will not take 38 years for the Byrne family to receive the justice to which they are entitled.</p>
          <p eId="para_105">Much information has been forthcoming during the committee's deliberations over the past several months yet I still cannot figure out the scheme's criteria.  We were told one had to be involved for at least two years in fishing prior to applying for the scheme.  If one was not actively involved in fishing, one did not fit the scheme's criteria.  There was a timeframe but it was pushed out for one group, which the Minister of State confirmed today.</p>

That is part of the evidence that was given here.  However, I know that in 1983 when the two Aran boats were lost, they were involved in a cross-over, because there were no specific sectors at that time.  Subsequent to that and up to the introduction of the lost at sea scheme, they were involved in a sector that came within the register.  What sector were they involved in?</p>

If one was part of a sector and lost one's boat when there was no actual definition but rather overlapping in this regard, one would find oneself in a situation where one would be involved in a different sector and yet would be given pelagic tonnage.</p>

          <p eId="para_118">The evidence is in the transcript, on the specific case.  I can only say what they explained, since they were dealing with it at the time.  Some confusion is creeping in because there is an RSW pelagic segment and a polyvalent segment which may or may not have pelagic entitlement.  There are rules as regards whether the polyvalent segment would have pelagic entitlement.  Some polyvalent tonnage, depending on its record of fishing, can have such entitlement and some will not.  It does not make it pelagic tonnage.  It is polyvalent tonnage without the inclusion of pelagic fishing.  That was explained, as per the transcript of the previous meeting.</p>

          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_122">Although I cannot be definitive on this, the rules stated that if a vessel was more than 65 ft. in length, a history of fishing for pelagic was required.  They would still be given polyvalent capacity, but their history in fishing for herring and mackerel would determine whether they had a preclusion in their licence for these fish.</p>

          <from>Mr. Cecil Beamish</from>
          <p eId="para_123">There may be some confusion, also, because as I understand it, those vessels sank when they were herring fishing, and they were pair fishing at the time.  They were polyvalent vessels which were pelagic fishing.  That would put them in the polyvalent segment without a pelagic preclusion.  In addition, people may have owned a vessel in the specific aquaculture segment side of that.  That was not a segment which was subject to the tonnage replacement requirement, and therefore that would not have debarred people from applying under the lost at sea scheme if they had owned a vessel in the aquaculture-specific segment dealing with bivalve molluscs because they are outside the tonnage——</p>

That was not relevant to eligibility under the lost at sea scheme.  Eligibility under the lost at sea scheme related to the specific vessel that was lost, and what it was doing when it was lost.  It had to be in use prior to the two years prior to it being lost, so eligibility relates to the actual vessel that was lost and not to whether one had a bivalve mollusc or aquaculture licence.</p>

However, this committee was told that one had to be involved in the sector for two years prior to that.</p>

Quite a number of people have sought to bring the vessels back under the tank boat.  I do not know whether there was an application.  It has been dealt with as an independent licensing authority under the Fisheries (Amendment) Act 2003.  Individual applications in respect of individual vessels are made to that licensing authority and not directly to the Department.  They are determined on the basis of the policy and the ministerial directives in place under the 2003 Act and European law.  If somebody is not happy with the determination made by the licensing authority, there is an appeals process available.  I am not aware of any individual applications made, but the licensing authority officials would be aware of anybody seeking to bring a former RSW tank vessel into the polyvalent segment.</p>

          <p eId="para_166">I think it was harsh.  Both the Minister of the day and the officials set out to tackle a particular difficulty in the sector.  Since my appointment to this job a few weeks ago, I have been on a bit of a tour around the different harbours, meeting the various organisations, talking with the officials and meeting fishermen, and there is a great number of concerns out there.  Deputy Fahey would have done the same at the time.  I am already identifying a number of areas which I hope to change.  I do not know whether I can deliver on that, but at the end of two to three months of travelling around, I will come back to the Department with recommendations.  In fairness to Deputy Fahey, when he was Minister he identified this as a particular area of concern to the industry and tried to address it.  The officials at the time had their own concerns and they tried to work within the constraints in which they found themselves.  Ultimately, that is how the scheme came about.  I do believe that everybody had the best intentions in doing what they did.</p>

          <p eId="para_167">The reason we are here is due to the Ombudsman's report, particularly in respect of the Byrne family.  Two reasons were given for the refusal of the scheme to the Byrne family, namely, an application that was 12 months late and the fact that they were not continuously fishing at the time.  The Ombudsman took on several people, but she only recommended that the Byrne family get some monetary reward out of the decommissioning scheme.</p>
          <p eId="para_168">Was justice done to the Byrne family?  Was the system fair, in that six people got a reward under the scheme, even though there were 86 applications?  Why did the Ombudsman make a recommendation for the Byrne family only, while refusing other cases?  These are the questions that we need to answer for our report to be laid before the Oireachtas.</p>

          <from>Deputy Seán Connick</from>
          <p eId="para_169">I cannot really comment on the justice aspect of it.  I am aware of the difficulties for the family in this instance and the losses they suffered.  I cannot answer whether justice has been served.  Justice is ongoing at the moment because the process is continuing.  We will await the outcome of the deliberations of the committee and whatever recommendations it sends back to the Oireachtas.  Ultimately, it will be a Government decision.</p>
          <p eId="para_170">The Ombudsman has said that once the scheme was up and running, it was operated fairly.  I cannot say why only six boats benefitted from the scheme.  They all fitted the criteria at the time.  The Ombudsman looked at a number of cases, because a number of people approached her, but she just pursued this one particular case.   She outlined her position on that and we have taken our position on her findings.  That is where it sits at the moment.</p>

          <from>Deputy Bobby Aylward</from>
          <p eId="para_171">The Department seems to be very set on the principle that no monetary reward should be given.  The Minister of State said that this would give rise to a significant financial liability, arising from claims from other unsuccessful applicants under the scheme, which may in turn undermine other schemes right across the public service.  I would like him to elaborate on that.  In her own evidence here, the Ombudsman said she did not feel this was the case.  She said that she only made a recommendation on one case, the Byrne family, and that other cases would not resurface if this happened.</p>
          <p eId="para_172">I know that it is up to the Department to accept or reject our recommendations and that it is obvious the Department officials will not change their minds at this stage, but what consequences will that have for other people?  If the Byrne family was successful and we got some monetary reward for them, what effects will this have across the public service and on other fishing vessels that were lost?</p>

          <p eId="para_173">It was not a redress scheme.  It was a scheme that would award capacity to allow families that had a tradition in fishing to get back into the industry.  At no stage was monetary compensation an issue with the Department and this is its strongest argument in favour of its position on this.  Monetary value was never considered.  I understand how the Ombudsman came around to the monetary value she chose in her report.  She used a decommissioning scheme process.  On the basis that the family was fishing for six years since the award of the capacity, she worked out that they would have an income of over €40,000 and that is how she came up with a figure of €250,000.  The Department officials agree with that particular process.  All of us around the table know that many schemes are run across all Departments and all of them have closing dates.  There is very little flexibility, if any, and most committee members will be aware of people being a day late and their applications being refused.</p>
          <p eId="para_174">There is concern that this could set a precedent that would open up other applications for late entry into various funding schemes.  That is the concern of the Department and its legal adviser.</p>

          <p eId="para_177">On a final question, Deputy Fahey has come in for much criticism in regard to the scheme.  There has been innuendo against his name and character, and character assassination has happened in this room while this hearing has been taking place in recent days.  Is it the case that Deputy Fahey set up the scheme but had no hand, act or part in implementing it, and it was Department officials who implemented it?  Opposition members can laugh all they like but I am entitled to ask these questions and get a straight answer.  While he set up the scheme, was it not officials who implemented it and he had nothing to do with it?  This innuendo about two people from his own constituency getting the largest monetary——</p>

          <p eId="para_179">This is very important to Deputy Fahey's character.  His character is being assassinated on a continuous basis by innuendo but nothing has been proven.  I want to make the point that while he set up the scheme, it was the Department which implemented the scheme as set up and as laid down by best practice.  I want to know whether this is true and what is the Minister of State's view.  We all have constituents, as I do in the south east, including some in Waterford who would also have claims.  The smear seems to be that he was responsible for two of his constituents getting favourable treatment.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's view on that point.</p>

          <p eId="para_180">Again, having considered the report and read through the case in recent weeks, my view is that the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, set out on an honourable crusade to try to do something to solve a particular problem within the industry.  Although my officials are beside me today, I will say that I would already be questioning particular policies the Department is following.  From my perspective, I would be asking them for the one reason we can do it instead of the 50 reasons we cannot.</p>
          <p eId="para_181">The then Minister, Deputy Fahey, saw this particular issue as one about which he might be able to do something, so he pushed forward with trying to develop a scheme.  I believe he did that with the best of intentions.  He was not and could not have been aware that six boats or 26 boats would get the funding — it was not something he could have made a judgment call on.  The Ombudsman has referred to the fact the scheme was fairly administered, once it was up and running, and that Deputy Fahey did not have any further involvement in the scheme once it was set up.</p>
          <p eId="para_182">Ultimately, Deputy Fahey did what he thought was right at the time.  I believe the officials at the time cautioned him over the difficulties that it could perhaps cause within the fishing sector, not the difficulties it could cause in any one individual case.  Ultimately, his intentions were honourable and of a good nature.  I have nothing further to add to that.</p>

I have no doubt he will be working closely with us in the interests of the industry, an industry which is very important to us all.  Most of the questions have been asked.  I most definitely respect the views that have been expressed in the committee, where all views have been heard, and in particular I respect the Ombudsman's view, although I do not necessarily agree with it.  I will be making my mind up on this issue when the final day comes.  Other than that, the issue has been well aired and has taken up a lot of our time.</p>
          <p eId="para_184">I have a particular concern.  Coming from a constituency where there are quite a few fishing ports, I have spoken to people who made applications under this scheme and felt those applications were more entitled to being accepted than the case that is being dealt with before us at present.  I have my opinion on that, as will other members present, and we will have our day to make a decision.  I thank the Minister of State again for attending.</p>

          <p eId="para_185">It is ironic that when the issue of justice was mentioned, the Minister of State had no comment, which surprises me.  This is what the matter is all about — justice for the family.  The Minister of State said he would consider the recommendations of this committee when we draw up our report.  That is a fob job.  The Department received a special report from the Ombudsman but it did not take cognisance of it.  It refuted it and said the Ombudsman was wrong.  How does the Minister of State expect this committee to have any confidence that the Government will yield to this committee, following its deliberations, when it would not be directed by the Ombudsman's report?  Let us be blunt and honest about this point.</p>
          <p eId="para_186">Deputy Aylward asked in regard to the two successful applicants who got the majority of the fund in kilowatts and tonnage.  To the best of my knowledge, although I do not have the paperwork in front of me, there was much communication with those two applicants prior to the scheme being set up.  I would go so far as to suggest the scheme was designed for those two people, through communications between the former Minister of State and the two people at constituency level as well as at Department level.</p>
          <p eId="para_187">Now that Deputy Connick is Minister of State, I ask that for any future schemes he will introduce for the fishing industry, and I hope he does so, he will expect his Department to check the bona fides of every application and the information in it.</p>

          <p eId="para_188">First and foremost, with regard to the justice issue, I referred to the fact the process is still ongoing.  This whole episode is not complete but, when it is, we can at that stage make a decision as to whether justice has been served or not.  It is unfair to suggest I would not have an opinion on it.  I just do not believe it would be appropriate for me to make a comment on it ahead of the outcome of all the deliberations.</p>
          <p eId="para_189">With regard to cognisance of the report, we certainly did take note of the report.  I know from my officials and from my own information that we have spent many hours considering and reading through the report.  In terms of debating it within the Department, the position taken is that we feel the accusation of maladministration is harsh.</p>

          <p eId="para_193">Harsh.  That is the word I am using.  It is unfair to say we are not taking cognisance of the report because we absolutely have done so.</p>
          <p eId="para_194">With regard to the two applicants and the scheme being designed for them, surely the Deputy is not suggesting he does not consult with his own constituents on an ongoing basis.  I am sure the Deputy talks to farmers and fishermen every day of the week, as we all do.  There are invariably people within one's own constituency from whom one seeks advice, but that does not necessarily mean one will build a scheme around them.  At the same time it would be irresponsible not to take cognisance of what those in a particular industry or sector are saying.  I do not accept the contention that the then Minister built the scheme around two particular applicants.  Once the scheme was launched, he had no hand, act or part in its subsequent administration.  That was recognised by the Ombudsman and everybody else, so I am surprised by the Deputy's accusation in that regard.</p>
          <p eId="para_195">In regard to any new schemes that will come forward, I will be working with my officials to ensure, as far as possible, that we do not make any mistakes.  However, one can never be 100% sure that one will not encounter some difficulty with a particular scheme.</p>

I put it to him that the Ombudsman spent years investigating this issue in order to produce her report.  The bottom line is that one of the successful applicants should have been disqualified because his application contained a falsehood.  The applicant in question was later shown to be joint owner in two boats, a fact which should have led to his automatic disqualification.</p>
          <p eId="para_197">In the administration of any such scheme, would the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, consider it acceptable to write to the successful applicants two months before the closing date in order to congratulate them?  The Attorney General pointed out that this letter of congratulations from the Minister made it very difficult for the applicant's acceptance into the scheme to be revoked.  Would the Minister of State, Deputy Connick, write such a letter in those circumstances, long before the closing date for applications to a scheme?  Through some inexplicable error of administration the falsehoods in this person's application were not noticed or were not brought to the attention of the Minister.  I do not know what was going on in the Department.  The bottom line is that one of the successful applicants should not have qualified.</p>

If the other 120 files had been examined, who knows how many would have been successful?

          <p eId="para_223">I welcome the Minister of State,Deputy Connick, and wish him well in his new role.  I thank him for being as honest, open and frank as he could be, which is only what I would expect of him.  The Ombudsman fully accepted at the meeting of this committee which she attended that the Government of the day may or may not accept the findings of her or any other Ombudsman's report.  The <i>raison d’être</i> of the Minister of State in politics is to ensure justice for all, so the allegations that have been put to him are very unfair.  He has not had much time to research all the background before attending this meeting and I thank him for his open and honest contribution.</p>

          <from>Deputy P. J. Sheehan</from>
          <p eId="para_224">While I welcome the Minister of State, I am a little disappointed that he does not appear to be the harbinger of good news.  He appears already to have made a cut and dried decision not to deviate from the information that has been put before the joint committee by other departmental representatives.  It is clearly evident that the Ombudsman would not have made the decision she did, were it not for the fact that she correctly considered the Byrne family to have been treated shabbily.  It is also clear to all concerned that the Department has dug in its heels and that unless he is convinced today against his will, the Minister of State is of the same opinion.</p>
          <p eId="para_225">It appears that from the outset, justice was not delivered in the Byrne case.  Moreover, it is evident that there is growing inaccuracy in respect of much of the information that has been elicited from several speakers on the matter.  Therefore, as a man who has been newly given responsibility in the Department, I advise the Minister of State to re-examine seriously this case.  He should examine the details as outlined in the Ombudsman's report as he may be sure that the Office of the Ombudsman went to great pains in arriving at its decision.  No matter what is stated here, it appears as though the Department has dug in its heels and that it considers the case to be a <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>
          <p eId="para_226">The irregularities that were outlined by my colleague, Deputy Sheahan, emphasise clearly the point that these allegations require investigation.  The Minister of State should take this into consideration because the air has been completely polluted as far as this report is concerned.  The report demonstrates clearly that justice was not done to the Byrne family.  No one went to the trouble of advising the family of the scheme.  Although the Department must have a register of what fishing boats were lost within that period, for some unknown reason the Byrne family was overlooked.  Therefore, the case exists for the Minister of State to make a decision on the matter.  Even at this late hour, I appeal to him to take into consideration the facts and to make his own decision, irrespective of the written advice provided by the Department officials.  Two wrongs do not make a right and the Minister of State should be advised that this case stinks of inefficiency.  Moreover, no opportunity has been given to air it rightfully because the Department appears to have copperfastened its ideas and does not intend to change.  However, this prerogative lies in the Minister of State's hands and I appeal to him.  I have much respect for the Minister of State and he should take into consideration the serious situation that has arisen as a result of the lost at sea scheme.</p>

          <p eId="para_227">I assure the Deputy that I take seriously the entire debate on this case.  I cannot accept that it has not been aired, as much time has been devoted to this case through statements to the Dáil and the Seanad, as well as through the work of this joint committee over recent weeks.  There is a process under way towards an endgame and an end target and the joint committee's report will be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas when members' deliberations are complete.  Obviously, the Government will then review the position in light of that report.  However, I cannot go further than that at present.  I cannot go against my Department and my legal advice on this matter.  While my heart might say "Yes", my head and all the advice available to me suggest that I am not in a position to so do.  Consequently, justice must be allowed to play out in this regard.  I note the word "justice" has been used a lot all day today and at the end of the deliberations, I hope that everyone will consider justice to have been served.</p>

          <p eId="para_239">The Minister of State speaks of justice and fair play.  However, in support of his statement he has relied on the Ombudsman's statement on page 18 of her report that "I had found no evidence to suggest that, once the scheme was launched, that it was not applied equitably".  However, in the same paragraph of her report, she states "My finding of maladministration arises from my conclusion that, having regard to the nature and purpose of the scheme, its design lacked equity and it was not properly advertised."  Consequently, the Minister of State cannot possibly state that the Ombudsman stated or acknowledged that it was carefully developed because what she does acknowledge, to the extent that it was developed and designed, is that it was designed to facilitate two constituents of Deputy Fahey and I can quote that from her report.</p>
          <p eId="para_240">However, the point is that Deputy Fahey stated publicly on television that he was vindicated by this report.  The Minister of State is suggesting the same here, when the exact wording of the joint committee's report and its finding of maladministration states something quite different.  The design of the scheme was flawed and that was where the inequity of the scheme lay.  This is the reason her findings applied to the then Minister and this is the reason a party line has been laid down in this regard.  The Minister of State rejects outright the findings of the Ombudsman's report because the former Minister has been included with the Department in her findings of maladministration.</p>

The industry was consulted and word went out to the various fishing and coastal communities.  Moreover, it was advertised in what I would describe as three periodicals because they are not like daily newspapers, in that they are retained.  I recently have been in receipt of <i>The Irish Skipper</i> and it is a very good publication that one retains in one’s house for a month or six weeks.  All the advice at the time from the individuals putting together the scheme was that they had done their research in respect of publicising this scheme.  I accept the word of the officials in that respect.  I accept the then Minister, Deputy Fahey, acted in the interests of the industry, not in his own interest.</p>

The Minister of State replied to Deputy Sheahan that he had no opinion on this matter and that it is an ongoing process.  He referred to sleepless nights and awaiting the outcome but he concluded in his report, on page 4, that he is confident a fair and objective examination by this committee of all the written and oral evidence over the past weeks will show the Department's position is fair and reasonable.

          <p eId="para_262">Fair is fair.  We cannot have one rule for Deputy Fahey and another rule for the Byrne family.  The letter from the Ombudsman on 11 May specifically informs the Chairman about the exchange in which Deputy Fahey states that this scheme applied to people involved in the fishing industry in 2001.  He went on to say that this was the entire point misunderstood by the Ombudsman's office, namely, the point of the scheme.  We pay great respect and suggested deference to the Ombudsman but then we suggest she made mistakes.  We have dealt with the suggested mistakes, by Deputy Fahey at this committee and the Deputy Aylward today.  The Ombudsman states:</p>
          <p class="indent_1" eId="para_263">I have serious concerns in relation to the accuracy of the foregoing statements having regard to the actual terms of the Lost at Sea Scheme and how it was applied by the Department following the receipt of applications.  The clear implication of the foregoing statements is that the Byrne family could not have qualified for the Scheme as they were not involved in fishing in 2001.  This is not correct.</p>
          <p eId="para_264">Deputy Aylward is wrong and Deputy Fahey was wrong when he said that.  His case is fatally flawed in making his entire submission to this committee based on that premise.  In a letter to this committee of 10 May, the Ombudsman has shown it to be false.  That false analysis and spin by Deputy Fahey has brought us here.  The Ombudsman's report and recommendations should be respected by this Government.</p>

From travelling around and negotiating different aspects of this industry, I know it is acutely complex.  Those from coastal communities know these are difficult cases.  It is not a case of one size fits all.  We must go back to the start of the scheme when it was launched and decide whether it was for good intentions.  My opinion is that it was.

          <p eId="para_280">How much was spent on advertising the scheme compared to other schemes at the time, such as decommissioning or the salmon drift netting scheme?  Can the Minister of State or the Department supply that information for comparative purposes?</p>

          <p eId="para_281">The scheme took a number of months to be rolled out.  There was wide consultation with the organisations on the ground and coastal communities.  The advertisements were placed in what were considered at the time to be the three main forms of communication with the industry, <i>The Fishing News</i>, <i>The Irish Skipper</i> and <i>The Marine Times</i>.  It was considered a successful trawl at the time.  Some 68 people applied.  The figure of 120 people is thrown out by other members and the figure of 500 is buried somewhere in the report.  From an application and advertising perspective, that 68 people applied to the scheme is quite a success.  The Department thought so at the time.</p>
