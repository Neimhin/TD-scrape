#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	0	I have received notice from Senator Henry that, on the motion for the Adjournment of the House today, she proposes to raise the following matter:The need for the Minister for Health and Children to indicate who, if not the Irish taxpayer, will pay for historic liabilities in medical indemnity claims in view of the changes he has made in medical negligence cover in this country.I have also received notice from Senator McHugh of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment to amend immediately the Redundancy Payments Act to provide a minimum of three weeks' pay per year of service.I have also received notice from Senator Finucane of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Communications, Marine and Natural Resources to provide funding for Shannon Foynes Port Company to carry out remedial works to prevent tidal flooding at Foynes, County Limerick.I have also received notice from Senator Terry of the following matter:The need for the Minister for Transport to urgently review his proposal to implement car parking charges at outer suburban rail stations.I regard the matters raised by Senators Henry, McHugh and Finucane as suitable for discussion on the Adjournment and they will be taken at the conclusion of business. I regret that I have had to rule Senator Terry's matter out of order as the Minister has no official responsibility in the matter.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	1	The Order of Business is Nos. 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6 and 11, motion No. 10. Nos. 1 to 3, inclusive, which deal with amendments to the terms of reference of select committees relating, in particular, to the numbers of Seanad Members on committees, as agreed by the Committee on Procedure and Privileges last Thursday, will be taken without debate. I thank all Members of the Seanad for the instructive debate we had prior to the meeting of the Committee on Procedure and Privileges which led to welcome changes. No. 4 deals with the application of the Freedom of Information Act, 1997, to certain public bodies and will be referred to the appropriate finance committee. As regards No. 5, statements on Northern Ireland, the contributions of spokespersons shall not exceed 12 to 15 minutes and those of all other Senators shall not exceed five minutes. Statements shall conclude no later than 5 p.m. and Members may share time. No. 6 is the Digital Hub Development Agency Bill, 2002, Committee Stage. No. 11, motion 10, will be taken from 6 p.m. to 8 p.m.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	2	We agree with the Order of Business. I thank the Leader for agreeing to hold a debate on Northern Ireland and I welcome the fact that the Minister will make a statement to the House.In light of the aftermath of last Thursday's "Prime Time" programme on child sexual abuse, I am sure the Government will take the view that a full inquiry will be required to investigate all the matters which are coming to public attention. A time of reflection is required to ensure we get this inquiry right, that it is fully comprehensive and deals not just with the dioceses of Ferns and Dublin but with all allegations in connection with all Irish dioceses which have made within a specified timeframe. Does the Leader agree that a debate on this issue is necessary in the weeks before the Government decides the terms of reference of the inquiry? I ask this in order to be helpful. We all agree that the enormity of the issue for the Roman Catholic Church and for the State demands that it be addressed in a constructive, open-minded and transparent manner. We will do the country a service by holding the debate in the weeks before the inquiry is announced.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	3	On behalf of the Independent group, I express appreciation to the Leader for the efficient manner in which the question of committee membership was dealt with in the past week. It has helped enormously. It is important this House should take the lead on this matter. I have discussed it with many people in the other House, all of whom agreed with me on this, demonstrating that we must examine the structures and technical details of the decisions taken in other places.I echo the point made by Senator Brian Hayes. Nobody in his or her right mind on any side of the House wants to make political capital out of the recent extraordinary events. We have discussed these matters on several occasions and nobody can claim to have better knowledge of the issue than anybody else. I ask the Government to give a clear undertaking that the law of the land takes precedence at all times over Canon Law or the internal laws of any other group. It is completely unacceptable that there should be any doubt about this. I ask that the Leader request the Government to outline what is being done to protect young people now and into the future.The Leader will be aware, from a time many years ago when we both wore other hats, of the opposition we encountered from major right-wing Catholic groups when we tried to introduce the Stay Safe programme, which she supported. I want parents and communities to be reassured that as well as dealing with the problems of yesterday, we are taking the appropriate steps to deal with today's and tomorrow's threats to our children.I support Senator Hayes's call for a period of reflection. This will be important to ensure decisions are taken properly. It would be completely at one with the objectives of the House if the Minister were to consult Senators on how to move this matter forward. The Government will receive nothing but supportive advice from the House on this issue and it would be worthwhile for it to take the advice of all sides.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I am delighted with the degree to which the House was able to agree on various matters in my absence. I hope it was a coincidence. I am glad the Leader and the Committee on Procedure and Privileges managed to change the number of Members on committees. I pay tribute to her. She has always been more than willing to be agreeable. Because of this, she is particularly difficult to deal with when she chooses to be otherwise. We have only seen one side so far and I am glad to see that it is in the ascendancy.The Leader responded more or less positively to a request from my colleague, Senator McDowell, to a debate on the report of the Flood Tribunal and on the Lindsay Tribunal report, which disappointed by failing to draw conclusions from the evidence. Has the Leader made any progress on scheduling those debates?There is nothing additional to say about the revelations of child sexual abuse that has not been said by my colleagues, except to reiterate what Senator O'Toole said about the stay safe programme. I was a member of the board of management of a boys' school when that programme was introduced and the difference between parents and the clerical church was immediately made very clear. A meeting was held on the matter attended by 300 to 400 parents and, contrary to what we were led to believe beforehand, their universal response to the stay safe programme was that it was too mild. They felt their children should have been told about threats in more specific and explicit terms. As parents appreciate these things, we must assert the primacy of the State and, as people who remain practising members of the church, assert the primacy of those who are its mainstay because excuses of lack of knowledge are beginning to wear very thin.If we are to have a review of this we must look at issues of education law and equality legislation because certain things were entrusted to certain institutions by statute and many of us have reservations about continuing with them. I believe, therefore, in proceeding with this period of reflection which Senator Hayes suggests. After we have had time to think, we should have a serious, measured and sensible debate about the issues and the implications for the structures of our society, the relationship between church and state and, above all, about the primacy of the law of the State.
#JimHiggins	unknown-#JimHiggins-party	unknown-#JimHiggins-dob	unknown-#JimHiggins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	5	Recently, RTÉ did an excellent series for its news programmes on the ravages of famine in Somalia. The chief reporter, Charlie Bird, went right to the heartland of the areas affected and the prognosis is that things will get worse. I would like a debate on our overseas development aid, particularly in the context of the fact that the Taoiseach has been going to international conferences and indicating that Ireland is ahead of the world in meeting United Nations targets when, in reality, in the spate of current cutbacks we have substantially reduced that aid. The consequences are quite obvious, which is why I call for a very comprehensive debate on what is a matter of life and death.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	6	I join with colleagues in calling for a debate on the tragedy of the sexual abuse of children. It is a great pity that we have never included the abuse of children by violence and we should look at this issue because it has done extraordinary damage to people. It has not happened simply in Roman Catholic schools or been done only by Roman Catholic orders. It was endemic throughout society in the 1950s, which I remember very well, and it should be addressed. I do not have any great hope that this issue will be resolved on a global basis until the dictatorial attitudes of the present governing clique in Rome are overcome, which is a central issue. Until Christian churches begin, for the first time, to tell the truth about human sexuality we will continue to have this kind of evasion and damage to young people. I hope they will.It is quite extraordinary that the churches, particularly the Roman Catholic Church, sought exemption from legislation regarding equality and the entitlement to fire people from their employment on the grounds simply of their sexuality. That needs to be looked at again and I hope this House will do so. While this is not a happy subject, I hope we might be able to address it in a way that would draw a line under it in order that we can put it to one side and move forward positively.I ask the Leader of the House, in particular, as a result of her distinguished career as Minister for Public Enterprise, to ask the Minister for Transport to come to the House to give an update on the question of transport, in particular in Dublin and in light of the commitments given to the development of an underground railway section in the city. People like myself who fought for this for many years are concerned that in the current difficult economic situation this might be avoided.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I have given the Senator great latitude.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	8	The Cathaoirleach has, and I am grateful to him for it.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	9	I support what was said by Senators about the Stay Safe programme and compliment the Leader on the work she has done. I read reports in a newspaper during the week to the effect that the Department of Education and Science had abolished the exploring masculinities programme. One report stated there was a concern that the programme would turn young men into a bunch of sissies.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	10	What is wrong with that?
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	11	It is regrettable that the programme has been withdrawn. We might get a reply from the Department as to what is happening regarding the programme on which a good deal of money has been spent on related literature and videos.Regarding another issue in education, successive Governments talked about setting up a college of music in Galway, a matter on which we should get a response from the Department. Students in the west who wish to study music face practical difficulties. Senator Brian Hayes prepared a report on the role of music in education for the previous Joint Committee on Education and Science.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	12	It is gathering dust.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The role of music in education and the difficulties facing students who wish to take music as a subject are matters to which we should return.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	14	I support the call by Senators Brian Hayes and O'Toole for a debate on child abuse and hope the Leader can accede to their request. I do not want to be repetitive, but the points they made are meritorious and of major concern to Church and State.I support the call by Senator Ryan for a debate on the interim reports of Mr. Justice Flood and Ms Justice Lindsay. Can the Leader tell the House today when we will have a debate on these matters?
#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	15	I support Senator Higgins's request for a debate on overseas development assistance on which we have made great progress which I would like to see sustained.I wish the Leader to raise with the relevant Minister the reported situation relating to rail freight. I spent an hour travelling from the Naas Road to this House this morning. I had visions of beet lorries clogging up towns from Wexford to Mallow, if a measure such as that proposed was to go through. The Leader, as a former Minister with responsibility for this area who will go into the history books for her role in the rail safety programme, would realise from going through the transport history books that we have an underutilised resource on which a good deal of money was spent in refurbishing and making it safe. It is not acceptable for that resource not to make its contribution to alleviating congestion. We need a "can do" management approach in our transport company rather than any feeling of defeatism.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	16	Here, here.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	17	I ask the Leader if the relevant Minister will come to the House to explain to us how widely the Stay Safe programme is being applied in national schools. I wrote to the former Minister for Education and Science, Deputy Woods, about the programme six months ago because it is not being applied in schools attended by many children to whom I talked about this. He said it was being applied only in about 70% to 80% of schools, which seems low given the length of time it has been introduced. Perhaps the Minister will explain how widely the programme is being applied now.I was delighted to hear the Leader say she thought Senator Quinn's idea of discussing various reports in the House was a good one. I suggest that we start with the report of the inspector of mental hospitals which was published in September. It has a wide application throughout the country to those with psychiatric illness and their families.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I note that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform will be in the House tomorrow. As a matter of courtesy I would like the Leader to inform him that I will be raising issues relating to the Education (Welfare) Act, 2000. Under the Act, many schools are obliged to report children who are absent for more than 20 days; unfortunately not one education welfare officer has been appointed in that time. That obviously can be a big link to crime. Many of the children who are absent from school get involved in petty crime.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	19	That is for tomorrow's Order of Business.

#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	21	The Senator can make his contribution on that tomorrow.
#FeargalBrowne	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-party	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-dob	unknown-#FeargalBrowne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	22	Will the Leader ask the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to find out why no education welfare officers have been appointed and what effect that is having on crime?
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I urge the Leader to seriously consider debating with a Minister the motion I tabled on rural development, community infrastructure-services and depopulation. It is on the Order Paper and she might recommend that it be dealt with during Private Members' time. My mandate comes from the county councillors who elected me. I am delighted to have been elected to this House but it was a tough and gruelling task. I have not yet contributed to the debate on Seanad reform.I would like the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, to give me an updated position regarding funding towards the Letterkenny leisure centre.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	24	Will the Leader consider holding a debate on the equality legislation that has been passed in recent years? At the time we passed the legislation we believed it to have been in good order. However, a number of issues have cropped up since then. One that comes to mind is the finding of a judge that pubs are no longer allowed to debar children at any hour of the day. It appears that the censorship of films and the certification of children who must be accompanied by an adult may not be enforceable for the same reasons. Perhaps these are not the most important of topics but if we pass legislation, it is worth debating it in order to advise the Minister that it is worth being reconsidered.
#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	25	Will the Leader ask the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, or the relevant Minister, to come to the Seanad to debate the national stadium issue before a decision is made on which company will construct the stadium, or if the stadium should go ahead at all? I believe the Taoiseach's office has received several expressions of interest. It is important that the Seanad debate the issue before the contract is issued.
#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	26	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Transport to come the Seanad to debate the issue of toll roads, specifically the recent suggestion of the NRA of cash only tolls? That was a ludicrous suggestion to make as the use of electronic methods of payment could facilitate the flow of traffic. The last thing we need is another road like the West Link which is a bottleneck and an environmental disaster but a cash cow for NTR.
#UlickBurke	unknown-#UlickBurke-party	unknown-#UlickBurke-dob	unknown-#UlickBurke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	27	I would be grateful if the Leader provided time for a debate with the Minister for Education and Science on a recent report carried out in the Eastern Regional Health Authority area which showed that one out of every three children was being bullied at school. The consequences of this are serious, both for the education system and the children being bullied, the vast majority of whom are vulnerable and disadvantaged. As a result of being bullied, they are likely to be further disadvantaged which will have a devastating effect on them in later life. I accept that the report deals with only one health authority area, but it surely follows that a similar position, perhaps not to the same degree, obtains nationally.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	28	Will the Leader invite the Minister for Finance, as a shareholder in the national lottery, to come before the House to explain the diabolical and discriminatory decision taken by that company to remove lotto machines from most rural post offices and shops? Most of these machines will be moved to major shops on the east coast and people in rural areas will only have the opportunity to obtain quick picks. This is another attempt to undermine the viability of rural post offices and shops which surely runs contrary to Government policy.
#JohnPaulPhelan	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-party	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-dob	unknown-#JohnPaulPhelan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	29	Will the Leader arrange for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come before the House to discuss an issue which arose yesterday, namely, the fact that barristers at the tribunals were awarded a 50% increase in their fees for daily attendance for which I understand the Attorney General gave approval a number of months ago? I urge the Leader to request the Minister to appear before us to discuss the issue.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	30	On the basis of the referendum on the Nice treaty held last Saturday, will the Leader agree to bringing forward an all-party motion for consideration by the Minister for the Environment and Local Government and other appropriate individuals that, in the future, general elections and local elections be held on a Saturday?
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	31	Hear, hear.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	32	It obviously suits the electorate to vote on a Saturday. If we compared the recent general election and Saturday's referendum in terms of who did or did not vote, it would emerge that elections held on weekdays disenfranchise a segment of the electorate.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	33	With regard to Senator Finucane's point, while I accept that people have different viewpoints, everyone was pleased with the turnout on Saturday which, for a referendum, was high but not as high as people would have hoped in the context of the universal franchise. The fact that the referendum was held on Saturday and the fine weather, for which we cannot legislate, contributed to the high turnout. The result was excellent and people's voices were heard, loud and clear. I am sure the Minister for the Environment and Local Government will be giving consideration to this matter. A by-election in Tipperary was held on a Saturday, but this was the first national poll to be held on that day and it clearly facilitated people in terms of their getting out to vote.Senator Hayes, who welcomed the fact that the debate on Northern Ireland is to take place today, and many others raised the extremely serious issue of child sexual abuse. The Senator stated he believes there should be time for reflection before people rush into making precipitate announcements which later might be found to be insufficiently comprehensive to enable the issue to be fully debated. I will return to this matter later in my reply and thank the Senators for raising it. They did so in a helpful manner.Senator O'Toole referred to the results from the committee in which he and the other group leaders played a strong role. He also mentioned the child abuse issue, the law of the land and what we are not doing in this regard. We talk about the dreadful events that occurred, but what are we doing now to safeguard young people and children? I remember the warm sunny day in July 1991 when the Senator called to see me with the two primary school teachers who were concerned with getting the Stay Safe programme off the ground. I was accompanied by the chief psychologist and the assistant secretary in the Department with responsibility for primary education. We decided there and then to go ahead with the programme.Senator Henry said that between 70 and 80 schools are implementing the programme, but we have to confirm that figure. All Members who spoke on this issue are correct. In all my time in public life I do not think I received as many bitter letters as on that occasion. I left the Department six months later, but by then the Stay Safe programme was started. The letters were from groups which chose to represent themselves as being in the top echelon of parents. They were determined that the programme should not be started. It was amazing. The tenor of the letters was that children should not know what they did not need to know. When one thinks about it now, one's heart aches.Senator Ryan sought debates on the Flood and Lindsay tribunals. I am trying to organise those debates and will refer back to the House about them. The Senator also referred to child sex abuse and the equality legislation. Senator Higgins raised the famine in Somalia and the need for a debate on overseas development aid. This call was echoed by Senator Mansergh. It is time we held such a debate.Senator Norris referred to child abuse and violence and asked that we look at the progress of equality legislation since its introduction. He linked the need to tackle violence to children with tackling child sexual abuse. He also asked that the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, come to the House to discuss transport in Dublin. I know of old the Senator's strong concern about this matter. That concern was echoed by other Senators.Senator Kitt raised the proposal regarding a college of music in Galway and asked about the exploring masculinities programme in schools. I will endeavour to get the information sought by him.Senator Coghlan raised the church-State issue and sought a debate on the Flood and Lindsay tribunals. I hope there will be movement on those issues shortly.Senator Mansergh referred to the important matter of rail freight, as well as the ODA issue. There is no doubt that the roads are clogged and if the goods currently carried by rail are transferred to the roads, the situation will be disastrous. That issue can be brought up with the relevant Minister when he comes to the House.Senator Henry asked that the report of the inspector of mental hospitals be debated. Following the remarks made by Senators Quinn and Leyden last week, we took the decision that the House should discuss important reports.Senator Browne mentioned what he would like to say to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform. As he will be here tomorrow, the Deputy should avail of that opportunity. I will inform the Minister's office of the Senator's remarks.Senator McHugh sought a debate on rural development services and gave an impassioned description of how he became a Member of the House. I am sure many other Senators can echo his sentiments. Lest he thinks I became a Member the easy way, I secured election to the Seanad many years ago myself. I know how long and convoluted the process is.Senator Terry raised a matter concerning the Minister for Arts, Sport and Tourism, Deputy O'Donoghue, and I propose to invite him to address the House shortly. The national stadium issue could well be aired on that occasion.Senator Jim Walsh raised the issues of rail freight costs and toll road charges. He said that toll roads were milch cows, given the investment that is to be made in them. We will be better able to discuss that matter when the Minister for Transport, Deputy Brennan, addresses the House. Senator Ulick Burke wants the Minister for Education and Science to address the issue of bullying; that is a matter which the House can address in due course. Senator Feighan mentioned the removal of lottery machines from rural post offices. I regard that as a matter for The National Lottery and I have not come across such cases personally.Senator John Phelan raised the matter of tribunal fees, which was also mentioned in the House yesterday. If we did not have tribunals, however, we would be seeking their establishment. They are doing satisfactory work and lawyers are paid what is deemed to be the appropriate rate or remuneration. I do not intend to go into the issue of whether that is fair. In general, we are pleased with the work that is being undertaken by the tribunals. We are particularly pleased they have come out with strong, cogent statements. The going rate for the job is a matter for those who decide upon such matters and I do not intend to comment further.Begging your indulgence, a Chathaoirligh, I would like to make some general remarks on behalf of all Members of the House, on the child abuse issue. I hope that young people were not watching the "Prime Time" programme last Thursday because it was so raw. At the same time, however, it was very powerful and I notice that Senators have not commended RTÉ on the programme. It was a fine, professional and potent documentary which has touched everybody. One thinks of the young people whose youth and innocence were stolen, never to be regained. They will always be affected, as will their partnerships and their own children, in turn, by the degradation and deviance that was wreaked upon them. We all share in that awful feeling.It should also be stated, however, that there are many hundreds of clerics throughout the land who are doing their duty. They have to face their parishioners every day, knowing that they are being viewed with suspicion. One cannot blame people for this reaction but the clergy want to undertake their work in the way Christ ordained. That is the other side of the picture.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	34	Hear, hear.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	35	We cannot allow the current problem to continue, however. As the Taoiseach has stated, the law of the land must apply to everyone, no matter what their status in life. There are no more hiding places for those who seek to cover up their crimes in this way. There should never have been such hiding places, although there were. I am happy that this matter was raised in the House today in such a positive way. It gives a clear signal to those who would seek to withhold information and keep young people in a subservient attitude to authority, particularly church authority. Young people should be taught proper respect for authority, but not subservience.There has been a general call for a debate in the House on this matter. The Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform and the Minister for Health and Children will be meeting the representatives of the victims of abuse today. We will watch those developments with interest and, hopefully, we will have an informed debate in the House in due course.

However, as I stated to the Dáil last week, it is important to remember that while the devolved institutions may be suspended, the Agreement itself is not. As the Taoiseach put it, the development is a setback and not a defeat for the process.As a clear illustration of the continuing commitment of the British and Irish Governments to the Agreement, a meeting of one of its institutions, the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, took place in Hillsborough yesterday. The Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. Reid, and I jointly chaired yesterday's session, and I will provide Senators with a more detailed briefing on our discussions presently.I return to the first point that I wish to emphasise here today: the Agreement remains our template for political progress in Northern Ireland. It draws its overriding strength and authority from the sovereign will of the people of Ireland, North and South, and there can be no firmer mandate than that. Our absolute commitment to the Agreement is clear. As the Taoiseach and Prime Minister Blair said in their joint statement last week, the two Governments remain committed to "the full implementation of all aspects of the Agreement that will be within their respective powers to implement".The current situation presents us with difficulties and these difficulties are not easy ones to overcome. Devolved government cannot be made to work effectively in a situation where there has been a breakdown of trust and confidence between the parties. Restoring that trust is the challenge that we now face. It may not be easy and there are no doubt difficult challenges ahead, but I firmly believe that it can be achieved. However, one thing which must now be abundantly clear to all is that the use of force, or indeed the threat of force, does not have any place in the democratic politics of this island and offers nothing but misery and suffering to our people. That imperative applies to all paramilitary groupings, both republican and loyalist. We have all invested too much in this process to contemplate any sort of return to the failures of the past.Senators will have listened to and absorbed, as I did, Prime Minister Blair's speech in Belfast last week, which gave us a perceptive and candid insight into his personal experience, both of the elation of Good Friday 1998 and the grind that has followed in making it a reality. I have shared some of the grind in the last four and a half years and certainly share the Taoiseach's determination not to countenance any path other than the full implementation of the Agreement.In the same spirit of constructive candour that characterised the Prime Minister's remarks, I would like to address the point he made about perception difficulties for Unionists in terms of Sinn Féin being included in government in Northern Ireland, in contrast to the situation in the South. The Prime Minister is correct in saying the Government's response to this perception of differential treatment may not be as pithily expressed as the charge. However, that does not make our position any less valid.The fact of the matter is that circumstances in Northern Ireland are very different from this jurisdiction. The devolved institutions of the Agreement were specifically designed to operate on an inclusive basis, with automatic representation in the Executive for those parties which achieved the required electoral mandate. All of the parties to the negotiations signed up to this arrangement which was endorsed by the people of Ireland, North and South. We are in a transition period in Northern Ireland from a destructive and divisive conflict to a more peaceful and democratic society. In our own history in this State, a similar transition was achieved many decades ago.In the years since the signing of the Agreement in 1998 and its subsequent endorsement by the people of the island, we have only gradually become fully aware of its vast potential to effect transformation. It has greatly improved the situation, not only through the creation of the new institutions of the Agreement, but also through the hands-on experience gained by politicians on all sides in making them work. The Agreement has set a new agenda based on partnership, equality and mutual respect.The last 12 months, in particular, have witnessed changes and developments on a scale which was truly impressive and which, five years ago, might even have been regarded as unrealistically ambitious. We had two acts of arms decommissioning by the IRA duly verified by the independent international commission on decommissioning, the second of which involved a substantial and varied quantity of arms being put permanently beyond use. Regrettably, the IRA's initiative in this key area was not matched by parallel moves on the loyalist side.Significant announcements about the normalisation of security arrangements in Northern Ireland were also taking place at this time. Additionally, the British Government announced in May that a number of military facilities in Northern Ireland would be transferred to the ownership of the Northern Ireland Executive for economic and community use, as a consequence of very effective work by the First and Deputy First Ministers.While some welcome progress on security normalisation has been made, there is certainly scope for doing a good deal more. For many Nationalists, there is still a far too intrusive security presence with little evidence of visible reductions despite the Agreement and the enormous improvement in the security situation throughout Northern Ireland. In this regard, I welcome the indication by Prime Minister Blair in his speech last week that rapid and total progress on this and other issues was possible in the context of the full implementation of the Agreement.In recent years the Northern Ireland Executive, under the joint leadership of David Trimble and both Seamus Mallon and, latterly, Mark Durkan, has achieved much success in bringing together political representatives of both communities to work in partnership with common purpose, for the betterment of all of the citizens of Northern Ireland. The work of the Executive has had a substantial impact, with locally accountable Ministers taking decisions of real importance and significance to the lives of the people of Northern Ireland. A full range of matters have been addressed, including agriculture, industrial promotion, health and education.The successful workings of the Executive have shown beyond question that partnership government works to the benefit of both Nationalists and Unionists alike. Moreover, while some anti-Agreement parties might still have difficulties with the concept of a fully inclusive government involving participation by Sinn Féin, the political requirement of partnership government embracing both Unionists and Nationalists is now a recognised principle across the full spectrum of political opinion in Northern Ireland.The Assembly has also been operating successfully, proving itself capable of withstanding robust debate on controversial matters in line with the best traditions of parliamentary democracy. Assembly Members from all traditions have taken on their responsibilities with commendable enthusiasm and sincerity and their contributions have been marked by commitment and diligence.Meetings of Ministers from both parts of the island through the North-South Ministerial Council have become a recognisable feature of ministerial calendars, north and south. Ministers from both parts of the island, representative of both traditions, have been taking decisions on a regular basis that benefit all of our people in a practical and meaningful way. While North-South Ministerial Council meetings have become unremarkable parts of the diary of most Ministers, it is worth recording here that 65 full meetings at ministerial level had taken place prior to suspension.Similarly, the all-island implementation bodies established under the Agreement have now been in successful operation for over three years. They operate in sectors which range from trade and business development to the maintenance and development of the island's waterways to food safety promotion, and their functional achievements are many. The development of rational co-operation in a sector that is economically vital on both sides of the Border is perhaps seen most manifestly in the case of the all-island tourism organisation, Tourism Ireland Limited. The promotional campaigns of Tourism Ireland Limited are undoubtedly crucial to the success and development of the industry throughout the island at a very challenging time in the global tourism market.I pay tribute to the outstanding effort and commitment which all Ministers, from both parts of the island, displayed in the operation of the North-South structures. While we all came to these meetings from different political cultures and traditions, these were transcended by a common commitment to advance co-operation between both parts of the island to the mutual benefit of our people. In my experience of these meetings, partisan politics was never allowed to undermine sensible and practical work that improved our citizens' lives. I, therefore, pay particular tribute to the Ulster Unionist Party Ministers for their honourable and diligent participation in the work of the North-South Ministerial Council. The sooner we can renew that partnership the better for all of the people on this island.When we look at what has been achieved in such a relatively short period, we gain a renewed sense of the importance of preventing the development of a political vacuum. The seeds of fruitful change have been sown and it would be unthinkable to abandon the Agreement without giving it the necessary time to mature and produce a maximum yield. We must continue to nurture the Agreement and to ensure that the transition from paramilitarism to exclusively democratic means is clearly advanced towards a definitive and unambiguous end-point. We cannot allow the process to descend into deadlock.We need to re-establish confidence on all sides to safeguard the Agreement's achievements to date and to secure progress on the areas which remain outstanding. We are all agreed that the transition from paramilitarism must be demonstrably advanced if the necessary trust and confidence to sustain the institutions is to be refurbished. Equally, however, that transition will not happen if we simply sit back and wait for it. It is clear that the required transition can best be achieved by driving forward the Agreement.At the core of the Agreement is the partnership of the two Governments, and this strategic relationship continues to provide the underlying stability and support for the redevelopment of trust among the parties. The vibrancy and cohesion of that partnership has been particularly evident in recent weeks, including the recent meeting between the Taoiseach and Prime Minister at Downing Street and their subsequent joint statement of 14 October which laid the basis for the two Governments' management of the current difficulties. The Taoiseach and Prime Minister will have a further opportunity to review developments when they meet tomorrow in Brussels en marge of the European Council.One of the ways in which the two Governments will continue to co-operate bilaterally is already provided for under the Agreement itself. The British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference was created under strand three of the Agreement. The Conference provides a platform for co-operation between both Governments on all matters of mutual interest. However, it particularly recognises the Irish Government's special interest in Northern Ireland and the extent to which issues of mutual concern arise in that regard. The Conference is tasked with meeting on non-devolved Northern Ireland matters, including, among other things, the areas of rights, justice and policing.The Conference provides a basis for the ongoing co-operation that will facilitate the two Governments in their management of the process. This will be particularly important during the hiatus in the operation of devolved institutions in Northern Ireland. While co-operating through the Conference, our ultimate aim is directed towards the full operation of all the institutions of the Agreement, including the restoration of the Assembly and the Executive and the reactivation of meetings of the North-South Ministerial Council.Lest there be fears or misapprehensions, I reiterate that the British-Irish Conference is not joint authority nor joint authority in waiting nor is that on the agenda of the Irish Government. We want to see a devolved government operating on a fully inclusive basis and we want to have a full partnership with that administration, involving Unionists and Nationalists, through the North-South Ministerial Council.At yesterday's meeting of the Conference, at which I was accompanied by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy Michael McDowell, we reviewed recent political developments with the Secretary of State for Northern Ireland, Dr. John Reid, and Minister of State at the Northern Ireland Office, Ms Jane Kennedy. Both Governments again reiterated our commitment to the Agreement as the only viable future for the people of Northern Ireland and emphasised our determined wish to see devolved Government restored as soon as possible and, in any event, in advance of the scheduled elections.In keeping with its mandate under the Agreement, the conference reviewed a number of confidence issues, including the process of security normalisation and the implementation of changes to the criminal justice system. The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, the review of the operation of the Parades Commission and the Barron Inquiry into the Dublin and Monaghan bombings were also discussed and we agreed to meet again in the format of the conference in December.The conference also discussed the implications of suspension for the operation of various institutions under the Agreement. The determination of both Governments to protect the achievements of the Agreement in all its aspects was reflected and we considered the practical steps that need to be taken in that regard. One such practical issue that our officials will address is the continued operation of the all-island Implementation Bodies, which employ over 600 people in locations such as Enniskillen, Cork, Scarriff, Newry and Omagh. The total budget for these bodies is about €200 million. In a short space of time, they have become a vital part of the economic and social fabric of the island.Policing is another central element of the Agreement and substantial progress has been made in this area in the last 12 months. The Police Service of Northern Ireland has come into being drawing recruits on a 50:50 basis from both communities. The Northern Ireland Policing Board has proven to be one of the key achievements of the Agreement as it has shown that it is capable of dealing with controversial and sensitive issues in a positive and cohesive manner. I am glad that its members have agreed to continue serving on the board during the period of suspension, continuing their commendable work on a new era of policing in Northern Ireland. While much has been achieved on the policing issue, there is undoubtedly more to be done to realise the vision of a police service that is acceptable to all sides of the community.We will continue to drive forward the agreed agenda for change, including the introduction of additional legislation by the British Government as provided under the revised implementation plan. The progress achieved on policing through the Agreement should not be materially affected by the suspension and we will continue to move the agenda forward in the weeks and months ahead. At yesterday's meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, I was pleased that the British Government confirmed its intention to introduce amending legislation as early as possible in the forthcoming Westminster parliamentary session, in accordance with the provisions of the revised implementation plan.The Agreement signalled the prospect of a fresh start for a divided community and we must continue to move towards a full normalisation of society in Northern Ireland. There have been setbacks in recent times. During a tense summer, we witnessed a series of violent events that we had hoped were consigned to the past – sectarian murders, vicious sectarian attacks, pipe bomb attacks, punishment beatings and shootings. The fact that such crimes are still occurring is a stark warning that complacency is not an option. We are continuing to make it clear to all in Northern Ireland that such attacks simply have to stop. At yesterday's conference meeting, we were briefed by the Chief Constable of the PSNI and the Deputy Garda Commissioner on cross-Border security matters. There was also a wide ranging discussion on paramilitary activities, sectarian violence and disturbances in interface areas. The two Governments restated the message that there can be no place for the twin scourges of paramilitarism and sectarianism.I am particularly concerned at the systematic and ongoing violence of loyalist paramilitaries. The PSNI has certified that the majority of the serious violence, including murder, has been coming from that quarter. The serious injury of two young teenagers, who were struck by a pipe bomb in east Belfast last night, was a shocking and barbaric act. This litany of crime and thuggery has to be brought to a complete and rapid end and I do not doubt that the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, is determined to stamp down on such nakedly sectarian attacks. I particularly welcome yesterday's find of weapons in the Rathcoole area of north Belfast and I wish to reiterate the Government's strong support for the PSNI in all its efforts to bring an end to violent sectarianism. Continuing and effective policing reform is the best guarantee that the rule of law will prevail and that those responsible are made accountable for their criminal activities. Vulnerable communities are entitled to the protection of effective and consistent policing. Equally, the PSNI, which undertakes that difficult task, is entitled to expect the support of the community it wishes to serve.I think Senators will agree with the comments made by the chairman of the Labour Court, Finbarr Flood, on "Questions and Answers" two weeks ago. He said that when trust breaks down in industrial relations, all parties are required to make a quantum leap to salvage the situation. This perceptive insight is also a valuable one in the current context of the peace process. There is clearly a need for such a leap on all sides to get clear of the present impasse.While I strongly believe such a quantum leap can happen, it will require that all parties to the process undertake a rendezvous with reality. If we are to make the great leap forward, advancing substantially the transition from paramilitarism to democracy and refurbishing the trust and confidence required for partnership government to operate, we must all get real. We need an end to tactical games, polemics, posturing and paramilitary muscle flexing. Civic society on this island needs to send a clear message that no one should be playing party political games with the peace process. Everyone should be getting on with it, leaving any partisan tactics and unhelpful behaviour behind.All of the parties which subscribed to the Agreement have a contribution to make in now achieving the political context which allows its potential to be realised fully. The Agreement was the product of a huge collective endeavour across the spectrum of politics in Northern Ireland. In renewing and revitalising the Agreement, we again need to harness the energy and talent of that collective input. In consultation with the parties, the Secretary of State and I are currently considering how that collective engagement should best be structured and deployed.We have come a long way since Good Friday 1998. The two Governments are determined that the achievements of the past four years will not be squandered but maintained and developed. We now have, however, a challenge and an opportunity to finish the job. We must establish the political context that entrenches the peace and total equality which are at the heart of the Good Friday Agreement. Peace involves an end to the practice and culture of paramilitarism and equality demands an unambiguous and permanent acceptance of partnership politics and inclusive government. With the continued support of this House, that is the urgent and vital task the Government will be addressing in the weeks and months ahead.
#BrianHayes	unknown-#BrianHayes-party	unknown-#BrianHayes-dob	unknown-#BrianHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	42	I welcome the presence of the Minister for Foreign Affairs to lead statements on Northern Ireland. It is significant that he chose to impart to us the information he gained from yesterday's meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference, for which I am grateful. I wish to inform him of the all-party support in this House for the full and comprehensive implementation of the Good Friday Agreement. He enjoys the support of my party and its members for his efforts, and those of the Government, as they go forward to work our way out of the current impasse. The Government can rest assured of that support. I also thank the Leader of the House for providing us with the opportunity to debate this matter.We are in a difficult situation. We have been here before, but this is the third time that the institutions have been suspended since they were established as a result of the Good Friday Agreement. It is paramount that both Governments take ownership of the difficulties faced by all the parties and confront them with a way out of the problems. If there is a political vacuum in Northern Ireland, there are very dangerous consequences for the people of Northern Ireland, where frequently paramilitaries take the place of politicians and fill the vacuum with vicious and violent crimes.I agree with the Minister about the importance of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference which he rightly stated is an essential part of strand three of the Agreement. I disagree publicly with the comments made by the Ulster Unionist Party about its importance. It is as much a part of the Agreement as anything else and was established to ensure that when difficulties such as those being encountered at present arose, the two Governments could take ownership of the issue. It was an amalgam of the Anglo-Irish Intergovernmental Conference established under the Anglo-Irish Agreement. It is vitally important that there is a mechanism in place to deal with these outstanding issues, where the two Governments, in effect the guarantors of the process when it breaks down, can ensure it is up and running again with the goodwill of all parties. Any suggestion that the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference is not an essential part of the Agreement is nonsense. I hope those outside the House listen to me on this issue.How do we move forward? The Minister and Senator Mansergh know more about this than other Members. There is a need for contact between all of the parties concerned to get us out of the current impasse. Intensive round table discussions are required. However, I strike a note of caution. We have been here twice before since 1998 and must now inject an element of realism into the debate. Specific commitments given in the Good Friday Agreement on the key issues of decommissioning and putting paramilitarism to one side for good have not been honoured. That ensured the breakdown of trust. There are many other issues, such as security normalisation and the assurances on policing reforms, but it is unacceptable that four years since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, and a new form of self-determination was established on the island, paramilitarism of any sort, be it republican or loyalist, continues. That is the cancer in the current process and the problem to which we must all face up.Difficult things need to be said in order that we can move forward. Four years after the negotiation of the Agreement the situation cannot remain that active paramilitarism continues to be linked with a political party in a normal democracy. We all know Northern Ireland is not a normal democracy, but we expected, not just in Northern Ireland, but also in this jurisdiction, that significantly more progress would be made on the twin issues of decommissioning and the abandonment of paramilitarism than has been the case.I will not lecture the House on all the developments of the last four years, but we all know that decommissioning has bedevilled the process. Senator Mitchell's twin track approach proposed that as talks moved forward, decommissioning would take place, but that did not happen. The former Tánaiste, Minister for Foreign Affairs and leader of the Labour Party, Dick Spring, held the view that decommissioning would start even before the talks. That did not happen. In the Agreement itself there was a clear undertaking that disarmament would be achieved within two years. That did not happen either. After the Weston Park talks and the 1 August statement issued by both Governments, the IRA stated it would engage with the decommissioning body to such a degree that it would ensure maximum public confidence would be restored on the issue of decommissioning, but we have only seen two events, significant though they were.Paramilitarism, be it republican, loyalist or whatever form of neo-nationalism, must come to an end once and for all. Those who still have a military connection to certain organisations must hear it loud and clear from the seat of our democracy that we expect commitments entered into in 1998 to be honoured.The Minister did not refer to the recent spate of incidents and alleged incidents in Northern Ireland and in the State about which we are concerned. I refer to the recent incident in County Wicklow where, I understand, five men were arrested by the Garda in connection with incidents there. I also refer to the ongoing punishment beatings and shootings by loyalist and republican communities and the Stormont arrests, although they were ham-fisted. Would we accept it if the Progressive Democrats, the minority party in government, sent to another organisation transcripts of a conversation between the leader of the Government and another of its members? We would not. We would not accept any party in government handing over to third parties confidential information, such as the names, addresses and telephone numbers of prison officers in Northern Ireland or anywhere else. Depending on the information which comes before the courts, these worrying incidents seem to have occurred. If the IRA has been put out of business, why were four members convicted in a US court on gun running charges in September 2000?I do not raise these issues in a party political sense or to put a spanner in the works but to reinforce the view that obligations must be met on all sides. In that regard, I want to quote a small section of the British Prime Minister's speech last week in Belfast when he correctly described the core of the Agreement. He stated:At the core of the Agreement was this deal: in return for equality and justice – in politics, policing, in acceptance of nationalist identity – all parties were to commit exclusively to peace. And for unionism, the right of the people of Northern Ireland to remain part of the UK so long as a majority want to, was enshrined. Indeed, provided, in effect, unionists agreed to equality and to recognising the legitimacy of the identity of nationalists, the union would remain.That is an essential point on which we must make progress. We entered the twilight zone politically ten years ago when our discussions with republicans first started. That zone must end now. The people concerned must be informed of their obligations. They must be reminded that the transition into democratic politics is the only impediment which will stop progress on all the outstanding matters. I urge Members of the House and all parties to remind them of their obligations under the Agreement. It is the only one which provides for the self-determination of our people, North and South, since it was agreed in 1998.We all know the IRA was given significant concessions as part of the deal that was negotiated. We should not forget that a former Member of the House, Billy Fox, was murdered in 1974. The person who murdered that member of my party was released under the Good Friday Agreement. It was difficult for people to make such a compromise. I encourage them to make that transition.The Real IRA recently issued a statement that its self-inflicted war was now at an end. Has the Government made its view known since that statement was made? It may be the case that the new surroundings in Portlaoise do not suit some people and they want to declare a unilateral ceasefire. I am suspicious of the statement issued by that organisation. I want to know from the Government that deals, covert or overt, will not be done to ensure these criminals are released from prison.
#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	43	I welcome the Minister to the House to discuss Northern Ireland. One of the first requests I received when we met some weeks ago was for the Minister to come to the House to discuss this issue. We are pleased he has come after his meeting with Dr. John Reid, Minister Jane Kennedy and the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform, Deputy McDowell, in Belfast yesterday. During that meeting they discussed how to move the process forward and avoid stalemate. I was struck by a remark the Minister made in the other House yesterday that Northern Ireland is about politics and people and that structures, of whatever nature, are not viable unless the will of the people is implemented.As we look back over the past four years, as the Minister did today, we realise that a lot has been achieved. It is easy to glide over those achievements. The Good Friday Agreement was endorsed by the people, North and South. Politicians were given a clear mandate to get on with the job, while taking into account the sensitivity of the parties involved and the positions from which they came and endeavouring to merge them together in a satisfactory whole. I remember that fraught Good Friday and the Ministers and officials returning to Baldonnel. We then had to set out on the difficult and arduous road of combining all that was best in the Agreement with the legislation and the establishment of the various bodies, particularly the North-South Ministerial Council and the all-Ireland implementation bodies, which have played a vital role.The Minister said today that 67 North-South Ministerial Council meetings took place which helped to move matters forward in the North and the South. It is a staggering number of meetings in a relatively short period and highlights how much has been achieved. I attended many of those meetings. There were one to one sessions with Sir Reg Empey both here and in the North. The gas agreement, for example, meant a lot to Northern Ireland and all the parties in it. Given that this is an island, we had to ensure business was conducted in a common sense way which would benefit each individual unit. It was good to work harmoniously together to develop and further the causes of the people.Devolved government is about democracy and about those who have been elected coming together to work through daily issues, such as those related to agriculture and education. Those two areas come to mind because they were to the forefront in Northern Ireland. The robust and strong debates in the Assembly showed how the everyday business of politics had taken root with great celerity. There were common issues to discuss, such as those relating to agriculture which does not know any geographical or religious bounds. Agriculture is a subject of daily interest to those involved in it. Similarly, I took a great interest in education, an area in which many significant changes were being made. We must remember that people voted for a devolved Assembly and for politicians to get on with it, which is what happened.The Minister cited the Taoiseach's description of the temporary suspension of the devolved institutions as a setback and not a defeat. His words are correct and that spirit, on which democracy is founded, has permeated all the substructures and aspects of the peace process in the North. If we hold firm to our belief in the process, the transient difficulties which have emerged on this occasion, and on other occasions when they were worked through, can be put into perspective. Yesterday the Minister and his opposite number were ensuring that business will proceed and that, rather than bureaucracy taking over, the will of the people will prevail. For the time being, this is not taking place through the devolved Assembly but by using other methods. We should hold fast to this effort.With such a dramatic transition under way during the past four years, many setbacks will be inevitable, particularly when one recalls the background of the various public representatives who entered the devolved Assembly, the nature of their convictions, many of which they hold as firmly as ever, their thought processes and the sensitivity required to weld together trust among the protagonists. Trust is essential for the political system to work and when one considers the huge degree of give and take and trust which is required in this context on a daily and hourly basis, it becomes apparent that we have failed to sufficiently take stock of our achievements in recent years and the giant steps we have taken. This approach – taking matters for granted – is in some senses an example of how deeply rooted the process has become. It is now part of people's everyday lives.We want the protagonists to declare openly and unambiguously that violence from whatever source or for whatever spurious reason has no part to play in the democratic process. We do this regularly, emphatically and openly and must continue to do so. The main task is to rebuild trust. People on all sides will argue that certain matters have not been attended to and must be addressed. All these fragments and components will now be worked through in order that we will be able, I hope, to build layer by layer the special trust that is necessary to re-establish the entire devolved system of Government in Northern Ireland. That is my wish.I was very honoured by the Taoiseach's request that I act as party spokesperson on Northern Ireland in this House. In the period 1994 to mid-1997, when we were in opposition, I was given a number of roles on this issue which I was always glad to fulfil. There is not an Irishman or Irishwoman who does not have an abiding sense of history about what is happening on this island. Everyone, regardless of political party – in this respect I welcome Senator Brian Hayes's firm cross-party commitment to the process – wants the process to be given a fair wind.Given that so much has yet to be done and we do not live in a utopia in which everything works out satisfactorily for everybody, it is inevitable that huge issues, as well as matters of lesser concern, will arise. In a strong democratic process, such issues must be worked through, trust rebuilt and violence disavowed. I commend the work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, in this process and his decision to come to the House to debate the issue.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	44	With the permission of the House, I wish to share my time with Senator Norris.I compliment the Minister on his extraordinary work on both the Nice treaty and this issue. He has done a fantastic job. I ask him to consider re-establishing the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation. There is outstanding business which the forum could consider, particularly on the question of consent which was not addressed last time round because the parties could not find common agreement on it. This fits in with Senator Brian Hayes's call that everybody in the Houses be tied into the issue of consent which has been accepted and adopted by the vote of the people in both parts of the island.The Minister and other speakers noted that the Good Friday Agreement amounts to more than the Assembly. While I will not labour the point, it needs to be taken a little further. None of the sides is acting in a fully responsible manner. I accept the Unionist community is entitled to feel as it does about decommissioning, the alleged activities in Columbia and Florida and the alleged espionage in Stormont. There is no question these matters are important. Equally, Sinn Féin has not accepted the huge advances made in the area of policing. In view of the progress which has been made, it is unacceptable that it refuses to take its place on the Policing Board. I could make many similar points. However, while I understand the position of Unionists and accept their right to take their recent decision, possession of this right does not mean it is correct to use it. Their decision was wrong and they must now look beyond it.The Minister's reference to Finbarr Flood of the Labour Court was interesting. Negotiation is essential. A chasm must be breached and people must take the necessary steps forward. The reality is that in all negotiations of this nature decisions are taken at the final moment when people are on the brink and, ultimately, they can only be taken by the people to whom they matter most. I ask people on both sides to consider this.Too often the Assembly has broken down or been suspended, whichever euphemism best describes events at a given time, and it has been left to certain people to pick up the pieces. Sooner or later, a message will have to go out that a time will come when nobody, other than the parties most involved, namely, the parties in the Assembly, will pick up the pieces.

This is not happening. It is no longer simply a matter of justifying positions. This island has been troubled for too many centuries and generations by people justifying their positions. Let us forget about the justification and instead look at how we can make progress for a better island for everybody. That is about looking forward and discovering what the next step we can take is.The decommissioning scenario sickens me too, but the Minister of State made the interesting point that decades ago a Dáil met in this building to which people carried arms and though it was not liked, people closed their eyes to it. We have outgrown those days, as have many other emerging Parliaments around the globe. I am not saying that we should condone or welcome such a thing, but our strong feelings and the need to express them should not be a block to progress.I am delighted that we have the opportunity to debate this matter and welcome to the House the Minister of State who has been involved in it in various ways. I wish to share the rest of my time with Senator Norris.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	47	I also welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Kitt, to the House and ask that some of the salient points of our discussion be passed directly to the Minister for Foreign Affairs. I compliment him and his officials on their doggedness and determination in continuing when faced with an extremely difficult set of circumstances and start by making a few positive points.I agree with much of what Senator O'Toole said about the parties in the Assembly not always having to be nannied and have the pieces picked up for them. I had a meeting with the Taoiseach last week about a totally different issue at the end of which I said I would not be too worried by current events because the inevitable outcome of an election would be polarisation. The principal party on the Unionist side would be the DUP and, on the other, the Sinn Féin crowd and they would soon start to deal with each other. This could be the most positive thing that ever happened because they would have to take responsibility, which is very significant. I would like to see elections as soon as possible and the reality in Northern Ireland reflected in its Parliament. We are trying to massage the process because we do not like the bully boys on either side when, by virtue of the ballot, we are stuck with them. Let us not pick up the pieces, let us face them with the reality of their own posturing and let them get on with it.Ministers on both sides have done damn well. Bairbre de Brún is a remarkable Minister. I saw her interviewed on television and, like all Sinn Féin people, she is a mistress of evasion, but she gave some damn good answers and was clearly on the ball. Nigel Dodds has been a good Minister, as has Peter Robinson, a poisonous man who has been extremely efficient. We may not want them on a personal level, but let us get them back into a scenario where they have to work together.We had a remarkable session in this House last week attended by Pat Cox, President of the European Parliament, who addressed us during a very well informed and excellent debate. There is virtually no person in either House of this Oireachtas who has made any real attempt to understand the Unionist position, perhaps excepting Senator Ross. Occasionally I try. It is a failure of the Government. There is also a failure of imagination.In the Minister of State's speech I see criticism of Unionists and advances for the Nationalist position, which are all seen as positive. What is there for Unionists? Have we ever tried to enter the mind of the Unionist and discover what Northern unionism means? There is no doubt that Unionists are caught in a historical bind and that the end game of the process in which we are all involved is the ultimate extinction of unionism. Let us try to reverse this. If we were back at the beginning of the 20th century and the end game was the extinction of an infant Irish Republic and its reabsorption into the British Empire, how emotional do Members think we would all feel? Yet, there is nothing for Unionists in a speech which states for many Nationalists there is still a far too intrusive security presence and little evidence of visible reductions and that the IRA's initiative in this key area was not matched by parallel moves on the loyalist side. Is that so?

They were the first to apologise and never got any credit for it, though, admittedly, it was far too little. What do we really know about decommissioning in Northern Ireland? For all I know they could have buried a box of paper clips because there is no quantification. We require and demand that the Unionist people sit in government with the Sinn Féin people who are clearly associated with the IRA while at the same time our own Prime Minister says he would not touch them with a barge pole.Let us look at the catalogue which includes Colombia, Castlereagh – over which there is certainly a question mark – and the business in Wicklow where known Provisionals were clearly involved. Every time someone is interviewed about these matters they refer back to exactly the same thing. They use language describing how if one goes back to the fundamentals, one will see that the problem is Unionist intransigence. I am obviously a rather simple person and do not see how Unionist intransigence causes a bank heist in County Wicklow.

It is very important that he has taken time out to address us and bring us up to date on recent events and his recent discussions. I welcome warmly the contributions of colleagues on both sides of the House.The serious impasse we face has to be met head on. It is time for some hard talking. I say this because I asked who the beneficiaries of this current impasse were. What concerns me is that they are the extremists on both sides of the divide. It is in no one else's interest that they are the ones who stand to gain. It is certainly not in the interests of the peace process and most definitely not in the interests of democracy on this island.There is a responsibility on us all to move forward. In doing so, we must ask some hard questions and I am not afraid to do so. I am not afraid to ask those people who have replaced the balaclava with a veil of democracy what is behind that veil. These are the types of questions we must pose. We must ask them what is their serious intent with regard to their future activities.On this island we have the Defence Forces. We have an Army, in which I am proud to have served. I am proud to have played my part in the face of so-called terrorists. However, we have walked on egg shells around these people for a number of years while they have continued a trade in terror, internally in this State and externally. How serious are they about democracy? There is no place for a dual track approach. I do not like to use the phrase "the armalite in one hand and the ballot box in the other", but it depicts the dual trade with which we have put up for far too long.The challenges that face both Governments now are serious. I cannot comprehend a return to the past. I welcome the fact that the Agreement is an agenda based on partnership, equality and mutual respect, but those qualities extend to all peoples and not exclusively to a few.Decommissioning is an issue that bothers me greatly, particularly when we are looking at decommissioning in this State. We are the guardians in one degree of illegal arm dumps, an area in which progress is far too slow.While there is that setback, I urge Members, in asking these hard questions, also to give encouragement to those among us tasked with the responsibility to move this process forward. I welcome the fact that the all-Ireland implementation bodies will continue. This is a positive step and it means we are not pulling down the shutters. I appeal to those directly involved in bringing this process back on track to ask the hard questions. It is only when we receive the answers to those questions that we can truly move forward this process from the half-way line to the end line.

#DrMauriceHayes	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-party	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-dob	unknown-#DrMauriceHayes-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	68	The Senator is very kind and I thank him for that. I welcome the Minister of State to the House. I congratulate the Minister, Deputy Cowen, on his speech, which was thoughtful and purposeful, and on the way in which he is tackling this subject. His speech should be read in parallel with Prime Minister Blair's speech – also a nuanced one – rather than the soundbites taken from it. I wish I had taken possession of the phrase "rendezvous with reality" before the Minister but, as Oscar Wilde said, maybe I will.It is important the Minister made clear that the arrangement under direct rule was not an attempt at the reconquest of Ulster and that what was being pushed forward were the important common elements, which are greatly important, the policing of human rights and reform of the criminal justice system, which are a part of the Agreement as well as the North-South implementation bodies. I hope they are pushed on.It is clear to those of us living in the North that things are better. I was at the Ulster Unionist Conference on Saturday and heard a delegate from West Tyrone say, "Things are better. I haven't been at a policeman's funeral for five years." We all have our benchmarks. Mine is that my children can go out on a Saturday night and I am not worrying about whether the pub they are in will be blown up. There are sectarian interfaces where people have much less pleasant lives, but by and large for the bulk of citizens there has been a change, and that is recognised.There has been a severe breach of trust or loss of confidence. It is all very well talking about the electoral mandate people have and that they were voted in to do a certain job and should get on with it, but one can bring the horses to the water and that is as far as one gets. A shared administration hypothesises the support of representatives of both communities and a majority of people in both communities. It also requires a willingness to share to achieve that.The key element over the past three or four years has been the erosion of support in the Unionist community for the Agreement. I am sure Unionists would be surprised to hear me trying to tell Senators of the difficulties in their community. These are seriously and severely felt by people who thought they had entered into an undertaking on a particular basis, which they find hard to sustain. Some 55% of Unionists voted in favour of the Agreement, but their level of support has fallen to the low thirties or even lower. We have lost the soft Unionist vote and perhaps some of those who were committed before hand. There is an urgent need for the recreation of that trust.I am attracted by the Minister's formulation of the need for a quantum leap. The first people who have to make that quantum leap are republicans in the current circumstances. There has been a loss of trust on both sides. Unionists also have to make a quantum leap.Episodes like Columbia, Castlereagh, on which I have an open mind, and Stormont, on which I have a less open mind, should not have happened. Nobody is looking for disbandment in real terms. Nobody is looking to denigrate people or to force them to do things that would make them look defeated. What the Unionist people badly need is to know that the war is over and that it will not be renewed. The challenge facing republicanism, which has proved itself to be very good at politics, the use of words and the formulation of phrases, is to find a way of showing that and expressing it practically on the ground. That would convince the Unionist community that the war is over and that they, as a political party, are committed to purely democratic and normal means of politics.That could help in two ways in the short term. It would indicate that there is no threat to prison officers in Northern Ireland. Hundreds of families have moved house. There should never be such a threat to people. There is nobody in jail in that regard. A good deal of heat could be taken out of the situation by doing that. Once the measures to implement the changes in police legislation, agreed at Weston Park, are in place, they should take their place on the policing board. A commitment to police a society is the most certain endorsement one could have of one's commitment to the values of that society and to the democratic process. I hope they see their way to doing that.I accept and believe the commitment of the Sinn Féin leadership to the peace process. I know where they want to get to, which is where we all want them to get. These are delicate matters of timing and sometimes the cart has to be put before the horse.The majority of Catholics, Nationalists and republicans I meet increasingly doubt the will of Unionists for shared government. They believe that while decommissioning is a good excuse, if the IRA was to walk naked down Royal Avenue, there would be another excuse next week. Unionists have to restore that trust by convincing people that other demands will not be raised and that they will seriously try to work the Agreement. These two elements of trust counterbalance each other. Somebody has to leap first – I think it has to be republicans.There has to be substantial, successful and persistent police action against loyalist paramilitaries. As the Minister said, based on the security advice he received yesterday, loyalists are by far the greatest offenders. Having said that, the loyalist and Protestant working class are lost souls. They do not have the political voice they had from people such as Gary McMichael and need the support of David Ervine and the PUP. It is extremely important that they are brought into whatever discussions and talks that are ongoing. I hope the elections are not postponed as they could be quite important. People should not talk about postponing them.Direct rule should not be a comfort zone for any of the parties. It should not be made so comfortable that they do not have the incentive to return to devolution. People from all sides liked ruling themselves and were quite good at it. Direct rule should not be punitive, but should be sufficiently unattractive that people would want to take the reins in their own hands again.I wish the Minister well and congratulate him on what is being done. I like to move forward with hope. It is a time for steady nerves, no recrimination and facing realities as well as getting others to face realities.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	69	It can be difficult for somebody from Cork particularly, but the South generally, to follow Senator Hayes as they might say things which are trite. Various thoughts come to mind when one listens to a Minister as erudite as the Minister for Foreign Affairs. Nobody has ever disputed his abilities, he is a very capable man and the negotiations on Northern Ireland are in capable hands.There is a danger from ratchet politics. I say that as a reflection, not to lecture anyone in this House. We should not always say we have reached a plateau from which we cannot retreat. As one moves through the fog of the previous problem, one identifies a new problem which must then be disposed of because the others have been got rid of. I do not think this is a characteristic of any community in Northern Ireland, but a classic quality of any process of conflict resolution.People have both small and large agendas. If they deal with the horrific parts of a large agenda, like murder and violence, then the matters that look trivial, perhaps flags and emblems or the badge of a police force, become more significant. That is a reason a phrase from a police officer, perhaps unintentional, can become a recipe for distrust for those who are wary of the police. I am thinking of comments made by a senior RUC officer during the controversy in Belfast during the marching season which were, to say the least, unhappy. I choose to believe they were inept rather than politically inspired. Some of Gerry Adams's phraseology about the reaction of republicans to recruits to the new Police Service of Northern Ireland was similar, but I do not believe there was an implied threat. A ratchet is being used in such circumstances.Matters are being taken for granted that could not have been even five years ago. I remember debates in this House 20 years ago in which there was a sense of eternal despair. People agreed then that the solution was what we agree now. The real problem was how to start the process in a way that would not descend into recrimination. There is a Senator present who contributed enormously to the starting of that process. There were many delicacies involved in making contact with people who were, to a large extent, outside the political firmament. No conflict will be solved by leaving a major participant to the conflict out of the solution. It took almost 20 years for us to realise this. It took us time to realise that painful compromise, not just trivial compromise, is the stuff of conflict resolution.It has been painful for everyone – not just on a party basis. Each of us has a view of Ireland which is more or less our own and bits of it are more or less precious to us. It is the same in Northern Ireland. Each person has a view of Northern Ireland, the relationships within it and its relationship with the South. Almost everybody found something in the Good Friday Agreement which was painful for them, perhaps because of a family, political or housing experience. Each person had to choose to accept compromise.We must be extremely careful in our use of language when working towards a compromise. We must make sure that the words we use are either properly qualified or made to apply universally. A word like "consent" is not simply one to describe the agreement that the constitutional status of Northern Ireland will not change without the consent of a majority of its population. If we believe in the principle of consent, the corollary is that the future of Northern Ireland must be based on internal consent. This means that members of the current demographic minority must not be coerced into institutional arrangements which are not acceptable to them. The same applies to members of the current demographic majority.As we move increasingly closer to demographic equality, a whole new dynamic of consent approaches. I would be horrified if the constitutional future of Northern Ireland was decided by a 50% plus one voting arrangement. The idea that there could be such a spectacular change in constitutional arrangements because of a majority of 1% on either side and that ten years from now the pendulum could swing back in the opposite direction is a matter of concern. It must go deeper than that. It is for this reason that words like "consent" are so important.It is time for us to speak honestly, not brutally or bluntly, to everybody in Northern Ireland, to ourselves and to everyone involved in politics, North and South. It is surely time for those who wish to lead the majority community in Northern Ireland – there are now two political parties in contention for this role – into institutions which have met with popular consent across the political divide to repudiate sectarian language, whether it is used within the sphere of politics or that of the church. There cannot be people in politics who feel they can utter the language of consent, agreement and tolerance in political institutions but who then donning a religious cloak, use language, phraseology and terminology about other religions which is grossly offensive and repudiated by the vast majority of the Protestant churches. It is not an attack on anyone to say it is time we moved on from the position where sectarian language is still being used and where people can move from one position to another.If the latter is true, it is also true that we are entitled to considerably greater precision about the future than has been the case to date from those on the republican side. I wish to relate a story but I am reluctant to indicate to whom it happened because the person in question is a member of my family. Gerry Adams recently addressed a meeting in Galway about the Nice treaty. According to the person to whom I am referring, Mr. Adams was at his plausible best and extremely impressive. The person was so impressed that she attended a meeting in Salthill organised by Sinn Féin, in which she has a certain interest. An intelligent, perceptive young woman, she came away from the meeting frightened by the atmosphere of quasi-intimidation and the second grade Wolfe Tones kind of singing that was going on. In my opinion, it is impossible to have second grade Wolfe Tones songs because the originals are so bad.The issue Sinn Féin faces is that the image it presents at mass public meetings and at recruitment rallies must coincide. In addition, what they say to us as plausible statesmen must match what they say to their members when they do not believe the media are present and when there is no need for them to be statesmanlike. Politicians in Sinn Féin and their colleagues on the other side of the divide must realise that the image they present must be always be the same, regardless of the circumstances.
#PaschalMooney	unknown-#PaschalMooney-party	unknown-#PaschalMooney-dob	unknown-#PaschalMooney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	70	Many Members have correctly referred to language. Without any reflection on the contributions of other Members, Senators O'Rourke and Hayes have already brought their broad experience to bear on the debate.We must consider the question of language as it relates to Sinn Féin. I share the view expressed by a number of Members about the manner in which Sinn Féin uses language. I have been involved in the area of broadcasting for some time and I am aware that there is constant criticism of interviewers on current affairs and political programmes with regard to why they do not get to the nub of a question when talking to Sinn Féin leaders who are constantly evasive in the replies they give. There is no doubt that Sinn Féin politicians must be schooled in their approach as in the past politicians in the Dáil and Seanad were taught to do at what was euphemistically termed the "Bunny Carr School of Communications". It used to be said of politicians here that, whether they appeared on radio or television, they all sounded the same.I saw the programme on Ulster Television, to which Senator Norris referred, on which Bairbre de Brún was interviewed and there is no question that she was quite superb. However, when one analysed the interview, it was apparent that she did not answer the questions she was asked. This returns to what Senator Hayes said earlier, namely, that Sinn Féin must address the reality of language. While a particular statement might seem to members of that party to be a proper and appropriate response to make in the context of the Good Friday Agreement, common sense dictates the audience to whom they are addressing their remarks – I refer here not only to republicans and Nationalists but also to Unionists – do not believe them. I am concerned about this breakdown in trust, particularly in light of the fact that a recent opinion poll indicated that 54% or 55% of Unionists interviewed did not believe that it was right to share power with Nationalists.I began, in the context of preparing for this debate, to reflect upon the anniversaries that have taken place this year. Great play has been made of the fact that Ireland will have been a member of the European Union for 30 years on 1 January. However, if we cast our minds back, we will remember that 1972 was an annus horribilis as far as Northern Ireland was concerned. Death and mayhem visited the streets of that jurisdiction in 1972 and the effects were also felt in the South. The excellent contribution of the Minister, Deputy Cowen, contained phrases such as “sectarian murders”, “vicious sectarian attacks”, “pipe bomb attacks”, “punishment beatings” and “shootings” and one could be forgiven for thinking it was 1972 all over again. The sad reality is that in the interface areas of Belfast and other Nationalist areas of the North, such attacks, beatings and shootings are everyday occurrences.As Senator Hayes correctly stated, however, there have been great changes and improvements in the past 30 years. Who would have believed that the changes which have occurred in Northern Ireland in the past five to ten years would ever have taken place? Such changes were hoped for and aspired to, but everyone felt ten years ago that it would take a great deal longer for them to happen.I am forced to agree – this is the challenge for unionism as much as for nationalism – that the re-establishment of direct rule is not in the best interests of Northern Ireland. Such was the concern that direct rule was slipping away in the days leading up to the suspension, the mainstream Ulster Unionist Party, led by David Trimble, suggested that a Shadow Cabinet should be appointed the members of which could shadow the British Ministers. All of those – Ministers from the DUP, Sinn Féin, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionist Party – involved in the governing of Northern Ireland, did an excellent job and that makes it all the more regrettable that political pragmatism, if one is a Unionist, or the political reality, if one is a member of Sinn Féin, heralded the eventual suspension of the Executive.The Minister stated that he has no doubt that the Chief Constable, Hugh Orde, is determined to stamp down on nakedly sectarian attacks. In my opinion that is not only the responsibility of Mr. Orde or the PSNI; it is also the responsibility of the British Government. It has been acknowledged publicly – yesterday's security briefing confirmed it – that most of the sectarian attacks in the interface areas are coming from the loyalist side. That would not be acceptable in Bradford where similar but ethnically different communities face each other across estates. If it is not acceptable in Bradford, it is not acceptable in Belfast.

#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	73	There are a number of cross-Border institutions which I can discuss from a Donegal perspective. They include the peace and reconciliation fund, the international fund for Ireland and the INTERREG programme. All of them have done much good work in the last five years for which I congratulate them.The current situation has reached an impasse but, from my perspective, the glass is half full rather than half empty. As a Donegal man I never saw the Border in the first place because socially, economically and politically the two areas are interlinked. I sit on a political cross-Border group with members from Derry and Strabane local councils. People from the Bogside and Waterside in Derry and from Northern Ireland generally have bought land in Donegal. The area is a social melting pot. Economically, Donegal's greatest business comes from the North. Business in Letterkenny is thriving because of the spending power of people from Northern Ireland.The politicians who represent the people of Northern Ireland on both the Unionist and Nationalist sides must come clean. We have been working together but they are not conveying that message. We need honesty. I welcome this debate because people are being honest. Language is important. There has to be honesty in the messages being delivered by Unionists and Nationalists in their speeches. That also applies on this side of the Border. Until that happens there will not be peace in Northern Ireland.The kernel of the problem in Northern Ireland is sectarianism. When young people in County Donegal are asked to debate the Northern Ireland issue they read from Sinn Féin scripts. They still talk about 300 years ago and about getting Brits out of Northern Ireland. They continue to use this language but that is no longer reality. We are living in a working community, North and South, and we should demand honest language from both the Unionist and Nationalist representatives in Northern Ireland.I could talk all day about this issue but I have no more time.
#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	74	I welcome the Minister's salient remarks. The suspension of the Assembly is most regrettable and there is a danger that the existence of a vacuum could allow paramilitaries and other men of evil to gain the upper hand over democratic politicians. I am glad the all-Ireland bodies are still working and that so many meetings of the bodies have been held since the Agreement was established. That is a positive aspect of the Agreement.Violence, sectarian attacks and punishment beatings have no place in a democratic country. We should continue to condemn these attacks unreservedly. I do not accept Senator Norris's assertion that he and Senator Ross are the only Members who try to understand the Unionist voice and perspective. My party has always respected the Unionist position, without necessarily agreeing with its stance in many areas, and will continue to do so.I am most concerned about the decline in support from middle class and moderate Unionists. That is a cause of concern for everybody. Senator Hayes made a good contribution in that regard. There is a need for give on both sides and for less emotive language.

#DrMartinMansergh	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-party	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-dob	unknown-#DrMartinMansergh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	76	The Minister's speech was excellent. It was also good to hear from Senator Maurice Hayes because, as I said in my contribution on the reform of this House, it would be better if there were more Northern Ireland voices in the Seanad. Consideration should be given to the leader of the SDLP's request for the recall of the Forum for Peace and Reconciliation.Nobody familiar with the Northern Ireland situation could have supposed that after the Good Friday Agreement the path of peace would run smooth. However, even if it has been far from smooth and if many aspects of the process, including the current situation, are anything but satisfactory, it is still a vast improvement on the endless coffins, shattered lives and the broken limbs of the 30 year conflict. Too much sententious moralising can contribute to intransigence and conflict. If the price of less death is forgoing the indulgence of self-righteous political sermons, I am content with the bargain.Irish democracy is robust, strong and deeply rooted and any group that tries to challenge it will lose. In my experience, and some questions have been raised in this regard outside the House, the senior public servants and the political leaders who have had to grapple with the problems of peace are deeply conscious of their democratic responsibilities. The Irish people have not been let down or betrayed. The Taoiseach, working in partnership with others and building on the achievements of his predecessors, has given magnificent and steady leadership. I also appreciate the steady cross-party support there has been over a long number of years.It is no use, when standing over a team trying to defuse an explosive device, telling them to hurry up or abandon the job. Sometimes people's demands are too peremptory. We must separate three things – the peace process, the Agreement and the institutions. Only some of the institutions are temporarily down and perhaps the peace process needs a breather. The dual track has run out of road. Mr. Tony Blair was right to point out that it has become more of a liability than an advantage. People will have to reflect carefully on that.Understanding Unionism should not be equated with agreeing with it. I am concerned about some anti-Agreement Unionists trying to invert the Agreement by making it exclusive rather than inclusive. That will not work. Greater priority should be given to economic considerations which are most important. It is a matter of grave concern to business people. The image of the Agreement having broken down does no good for investment in Northern Ireland so it is important to restore the situation.Much time was devoted by the Governments to the issue of policing reform. That is the reason I was unhappy with the image of the raid on Stormont. That part of the raid seems to have been unproductive anyway but it sent out many different messages. The Chief Constable has apologised for it.Many issues will be discussed in trying to resolve the current situation. It is vital that loyalism should come into the equation. It is a cop-out to claim loyalists are not part of government and that, therefore, their position does not matter. One of the biggest differences in political culture between North and South is the belief in the North that hard balling all the time is the best method of negotiation. What it does is lead to crises, stops and starts. If I had my wish it would be that negotiation would become more fluid, as we know it in the South.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	79	I am a member of the board of the Food Marketing Institute in the United States and, immediately after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, was asked to explain to my colleagues in Chicago what it was all about. I found it comparatively easy to explain in 1998. Last Tuesday, however, I was in New York at a similar meeting where I was asked to explain the third suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly. My colleagues in America wanted to know how it could have happened. An article in The New York Times last Tuesday did its best to explain that things were better in Northern Ireland, as Senator Maurice Hayes mentioned in dramatic terms. He has said his children can now go out to a pub at night and one does not hear of policemen being killed.The Minister mentioned how the successful working of the Northern Ireland Executive had shown beyond question that partnership government worked to the benefit of all. I found it difficult to explain, however, the reason the Agreement had collapsed. The danger is that voters in Northern Ireland will say to the politicians, "A plague on all your houses". In that case, we would again lose control. It is important for this House to remind people of the goals that can be achieved. We should also remind them of the horror of failure.Earlier this year I was in India at a time when Hindus and Muslims were fighting in Gujarat. I was not in the affected area, but that weekend hundreds were killed because of sectarian conflict. It reminds us of how quickly this could happen again in Northern Ireland, and just how short a time it has been since we were in the same situation. The goal is worthwhile. We must encourage people in the North to find the solution, whatever it may be.I met the former South African President, Mr. de Klerk, recently at the Centre for Peace and Reconciliation in Glencree, County Wicklow, where he spoke about how they had managed to get both sides together in South Africa. His great achievement was to invite Mr. Mandela, who later became President, for talks on the country's future. He said the real problem was that once people came together for talks, they had to be reminded that no one could come out of the meeting happy. It is highly unlikely that all sides can leave any such meeting satisfied. Courage and leadership are also required in Northern Ireland. I hope that by talking and reminding ourselves that the goal is worthwhile, we will achieve it.
#ShaneRoss	unknown-#ShaneRoss-party	unknown-#ShaneRoss-dob	unknown-#ShaneRoss-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	80	We have debated Northern Ireland in the House for many years. This particular debate, however, is taking place in a more mature atmosphere with people with whom one might disagree, but who are well qualified to talk on the subject. It is a great reflection on the House that such debates now take place in a calm atmosphere. It is indicative of the situation in the North because some years ago it would have been impossible to have such a debate in the House, as feelings ran high and irrational – certainly emotional – things were said by some on the subject.Senator Maurice Hayes said that a majority of Unionists were against the Good Friday Agreement. Senator Norris spoke briefly about how he has tried to understand the Unionist community, as I have. That is not a particularly great boast to make, but we happen to have constituents – although unfortunately, a diminishing number – who are in touch with us. Their message is that they are disillusioned, upset and lost. It is amazing for us to contemplate the fact that 70% of Unionists – I think that is the figure Senator Hayes cited – are against an agreement which we see as a passport for peace. Voters here virtually voted unanimously for the Good Friday Agreement and if it was put to this part of the country again, it would be passed by over 90%, yet in Northern Ireland, for some reason, the Unionist community does not see it as a passport for peace at all. Our job is to try to understand the reason that is so. I think it is because they see such gaping flaws in the Agreement.Decommissioning is the one facet that sticks out and is regarded by Unionists as bogus, cosmetic and virtually non-existent. One must be honest about it – what has happened in terms of decommissioning is zero. It has been a small, token gesture in order to produce a symbol to pacify and provide a fig-leaf for Mr. David Trimble. It has succeeded in doing this, but the emphasis must now be placed on what the British Prime Minister, Mr. Blair, said, that the next move is up to the IRA.There is absolutely no doubt that the IRA has called more shots than the other side in this process. Neither is there any doubt that the situation in Northern Ireland is far better than it was ten years ago. We have hit crises before and will do so again, but this time the next move is up to the IRA. There has been too much evidence of its activities, including the incidents in Bray, Stormont, Castlereagh and Colombia. The IRA has got to prove for once and for all that the violence is coming to an end.

Although I know there is pressure on the time allocated, it would have been better to have more time for these contributions. No major purpose will be served by trying to lay blame on one side or the other, although I am sure that will happen elsewhere. We look to both sovereign Governments which, at the end of the day, are the guarantors for the national and international implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, including the Northern Assembly, the Executive and the cross-Border bodies which flowed from it.In reflecting upon the current situation we should consider the success we have had to date. It is not too many years since we were all living through a terrible nightmare on this island. People were almost afraid to turn on the radio in the morning lest they would hear of the latest atrocities. Gradually we became immune to what was happening, yet there were people with vision, patience and tenacity who were prepared to continue seeking a solution. At times, they circumvented problems and at others overcame them, but we reached a stage of positive interaction between the different traditions. We also restored sanity and hope to the island.While I have no intention of apportioning blame for the current situation, it would be undemocratic for anyone to contemplate dismantling the Agreement. People on the island, North and South, have voted clearly for what they want to happen in their name and in demonstrating that confidence they have been proved right. No matter how seriously we view the current difficulties, can anybody genuinely imagine us returning to where we were? It is absolutely unthinkable that that would happen. Perhaps what we need at this stage is a commitment from all people of all persuasions, no matter how extreme views may be or how uncommitted views may be, that we will all work together in the name of humanity to bring about a full and final resolution of a conflict which has existed on this island for centuries.
#MaryMWhite	unknown-#MaryMWhite-party	unknown-#MaryMWhite-dob	unknown-#MaryMWhite-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	89	Thank you, a Chathaoirligh, for allowing an extension because I thought the timing went a little adrift earlier this afternoon.I do not want to go back over everything, but I would like to remind everybody in the Seanad that the 1921 Treaty gave 26 counties political freedom from Britain – after about 600 years – but there were Six Counties which were left disenfranchised. There were half a million Nationalists and Catholics left afloat in Northern Ireland. They were suppressed by the Unionist communities and trapped by them for many years, which gave birth to the continued life of the IRA. During the 30 years' war, our Government neglected looking after the Nationalist community and their rights. Those half a million people who were left in the Six Counties saw our Government as looking after their needs – and they seek this continuously.I draw attention to what was said by the director of the CBI: direct rule in Northern Ireland could lead to a serious loss of inward investment. He said it sends out "the wrong message, especially for inward investment" and "our biggest concern is the negative image that comes out. We have to work twice as hard to get the message out that it is business as usual.".Sinn Féin must manage itself because of poor public relations arising out of what happened in Stormont during the summer.

Many of the Unionists do not feel that devolved government is in their economic interests and many of them do not want to share power with the Nationalists, whether one likes it or not. I have many friends on the Unionist and republican and Nationalist sides. The bottom line, as far as I am concerned, is that our Government must tenaciously support the rights of the Nationalist and republican communities in the North, as tenaciously as many Unionists want to remain with Britain.

#JimWalsh	unknown-#JimWalsh-party	unknown-#JimWalsh-dob	unknown-#JimWalsh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	98	Cuirim fáilte roimh an Aire Stáit go dtí an Teach. There are many people alive in Northern Ireland today who would not be but for the efforts and, indeed, the leadership of the Taoiseach and the British Prime Minister. While I commend them for the leadership they have given and for the success of the Belfast Agreement, the political parties – the Unionist Party, the SDLP, Sinn Féin, the DUP, the PUP – all deserve great credit as well. It is easy to criticise them for some of the failings and shortcomings and some of the mistakes, but we must bear in mind tremendous progress was made and it was made with their support for a large part of the period.I welcome the comments of the Minister regarding the continuation of the North-South bodies. I would have been somewhat critical of the last minute changes in the Good Friday Agreement where we got into North-South bodies on areas which perhaps did not have the potential or were not as important as the areas of co-operation. Nonetheless recently it was interesting to hear Northern Unionist politicians argue that there should be a North-South agricultural committee. Members of the House would have heard a prominent member of the Unionist Party say that would be in the interests of their agricultural sector. Therefore there are opportunities to be developed.However, it is not just about the institutions which are in place. It is imperative that we build on the common interests that we have in the area of community and, indeed, in civic areas. If we underpin them, through the various twinnings between towns in the Republic and in the North, and if we also look at what is happening in the area of co-operation and cohesion being developed between local politicians, we must build it at that level to ensure that what is being achieved will be sustainable into the future. There can be no place for sectarian bigotry in any society and it behoves all of us, not alone in political life but in society, to play our part to achieve a better Ireland for the future.
#TomKitt	unknown-#TomKitt-party	unknown-#TomKitt-dob	unknown-#TomKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	99	I am pleased to be part of this debate and to listen to the views of so many people. I acknowledge the work of many individuals who are Members of the Seanad, in particular, the Leader of the House, Senator O'Rourke, who did trojan work with her counterpart, Sir Reg Empey, on the issue of gas interconnection and an all-island gas energy market and, indeed, Senator Mansergh who, as others have acknowledged, has played a pivotal role in the peace process. I will refer to Senator Hayes in due course but I will try to be brief.One of the areas in which I am involved in my new Ministry is human rights. I might briefly refer to it because it is a key area with regard to the Good Friday Agreement. Under Strand Three, I would remind the Houses, the parties expressly "affirm their commitment to the mutual respect, the civil rights and the religious liberties of everyone in the community". The Northern Ireland Human Rights Commission, established under the Agreement, has been engaged in important work since its foundation, including valuable consultation and advice on the scope for a draft bill of rights for Northern Ireland. It is a key objective which we should all pursue. If I can help in this area, I certainly will.Progress is continuing towards the enhancement of a human rights culture throughout the island. I was very pleased that the work of the human rights commission was reviewed at the meeting of the British-Irish Intergovernmental Conference only yesterday.Human rights is also at the heart of the vision for the new policing service in Northern Ireland. That vision was provided for in the Agreement and was given full expression in the Patten report. This document provided a comprehensive blueprint for far-reaching change to policing in Northern Ireland. From the vantage point of the future, the Patten report will be identified as one of the core milestones on the road to peace in Northern Ireland. Indeed, from an international perspective, Patten is already one of the seminal documents for change management in policing.This House and all of us are very proud of the key role which one of its Members, Senator Maurice Hayes, played in the preparation of the Patten report, and I want to acknowledge that role.The Policing Board has been one of the great achievements of the Agreement. Under the able leadership of Des Ray and Denis Bradley, the board has courageously and cohesively tackled a number of difficult and sensitive issues. This is all the more remarkable when one considers that the board comprises political nominees from the SDLP, the UUP and the DUP. Many people would have doubted that politicians as diverse as Alex Attwood, Fred Cobain and Sammy Wilson would have been able to find common agreement on the handling of sensitive policing issues, but they have – on the symbols to be included in the police badge, on the Ombudsman's report into the investigation of the Omagh bombing and on the recent adoption of a manpower strategy, which included the contentious question of the full-time reserve.The recruitment of Hugh Orde as the new Chief Constable, selected by the Policing Board, has also marked a significant milestone in policing change in Northern Ireland. In his first two months, the Chief Constable has shown a refreshing candour and directness in addressing the challenges and difficulties of policing in Northern Ireland.The success of the policing project to date owes a considerable debt to the SDLP. At the talks in Weston Park last year, they negotiated the changes which, when incorporated into legislation, would allow the Patten threshold to be met.Of course the operational performance of the PSNI over the last year has not been perfect. Even allowing for the inherent difficulties of policing in a divided society, the PSNI's policing of the interface violence in east Belfast over the summer left some room for improvement. In addition, the excessively high profile nature of its search operation at the Sinn Féin offices in Stormont was clearly ill-advised. However, the important point is that the PSNI is now being held to account for these failures – as reflected in the Chief Constable's commendable apology for the nature of the police operation at Stormont.Policing change was always going to be a process rather than an event. The SDLP is an active and robust player in driving the change. Sinn Féin, on the other hand, has thus far not come on board the new policing dispensation. I respect its right to make its own judgment in that regard, provided it does not create a chill factor for others who wish to make a different decision. I welcome the fact that Sinn Féin has expressed a wish to come on board when, according to its own criteria, the appropriate threshold has been established. The sooner that happens the better for the overall health of the peace process, since the sight of young republicans in PSNI uniforms might be the most compelling and reassuring evidence that the war is indeed over.In the weeks and months ahead we must re-dedicate ourselves to the task of fully implementing the Agreement. The current impasse is not a terminal crisis. It may be an opportunity to take the quantum leap which is required if we are to secure the foundation for stable and inclusive government in Northern Ireland.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	115	I believe the grouping, as it has been read out to me, is incorrect.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	117	I move amendment No. 1:
In page 5, subsection (1), line 24, to delete "shared" and substitute "stored".The current definition of "digital content" is as follows: "Digital content means content shared in a digital format that can be created, manipulated and exchanged electronically."In my innocence I believe that is a misprint and that it should read "stored in a digital format". The phrase, as it stands, is meaningless.

The proposed wording is as follows: "Publication shall be construed as including electronic means of publication and cognate words shall be similarly construed." This amendment will be brought forward on Report Stage.Amendment No. 3 is a drafting amendment.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	119	We are not discussing amendment No. 3.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	122	The Minister is so agreeable that I almost lost track of him. That is fine by me.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	123	I move amendment No. 2:
In page 5, subsection (1), line 25, after "electronically" to insert "but shall include where required content stored electronically in formats other than digital format".I am glad the Minister is considering these amendments. It would a pity to restrict activities to exclusively digital material. There is often a mix in multimedia, particulary in material that would be used to publicise multimedia activities. Video tapes, for example, could be used and it would be a pity if litigation arose because of this.I am grateful to the Minister for being accommodating.

In page 6, subsection (1), to delete line 2, and substitute the following:" ‘Minister' means Minister for Communication, Marine and Natural Resources;".This is a technical amendment to reflect the recent transfer of ministerial responsibilities.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	125	I move amendment No. 4:
In page 6, subsection (1), line 42, after "hub" to insert "and shall as soon as may be publish the reason for making such an order".I am wary of Ministers being able to change boundaries without scrutiny and accountability. I do not wish to launch into a discussion on planning and re-zoning matters, but to leave the power to extend the border of the digital hub entirely in the hands of the Minister without some level of accountability – and I am prepared to debate the level of accountability – is unwise, in the light of what we know about the pressures and inducements that come the way of Ministers. My amendment requires that the reason for making such an order be published as soon as may be. Otherwise the whole thing could be done quietly and in private.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	126	The wording of this section is similar to the provision in the Dublin Docklands Development Authority Act, 1997. The amendment requested by Senator Ryan would not appear to add anything to the provisions. The Minister would have to bring a statutory instrument forward if there was to be an extension of the boundary and there would be the possibility of Members of the Oireachtas or members of the public asking, under freedom of information legislation, why an extension was being granted.We are following the model of the docklands Act. A statutory intrument would have to be brought forward.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	128	I am never happy, a Chathaoirligh. You know me long enough to know that I am never happy on Committee Stage.I regard myself as being reasonably familiar with legislation but I do not interpret this section as requiring the Minister to bring forward a statutory instrument. However, if the Minister assures me that there is the possibility of the matter being debated in both Houses, either by way of a positive or negative procedure, there is no need for my amendment.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	129	Section 3 states: "The Minister may by order, with the consent of the Minister for Finance .". Sections 4 and 5 also refer to orders being laid before the House.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	130	My mistake.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	131	I move amendment No. 5:
In page 8, subsection (2)(d), line 22, after “projects” to insert “together with a strategy to ensure access to such educational provision by people suffering from physical or other disability or who are otherwise disadvantaged”.This amendment is very appropriate given the Minister's previous portfolio. We ought to have some reference on this and I am quite happy to listen to the Minister on it. The digital divide is now something of a cliché. It preoccupied the British Chancellor of the Exchequer in many of his budget speeches where he was concerned that the United Kingdom was developing into a two-tier society with one part of Britain digitally aware and engaged and the other part outside the digital world.It would be very useful to extend the functions or the development plan of the digital hub agency to include my amendment which argues for a strategy to ensure access to such educational provision by people suffering from physical or other disability or who are otherwise disadvantaged. It is logical that an agency such as this ought to have a brief, in the light of the national poverty strategy where all public policy is meant to be tested for its impact on poverty reduction and the reduction of inequality. The Minister and I have discussed before with some enthusiasm whether poverty and inequality are the same thing. However, it would be a pity if we had to do all of this again to deal with the issue of socially disadvantaged people considering the objective of reducing poverty and deprivation, and also the general public policy for people with disability.I am not hung up on the wording of the amendment if the Minister wishes to look at it before Report Stage. I would be quite happy if he did that because this is an issue that needs thought. However, there should be some objective to deal with what is called the digital divide. It is an important concern in our society.

#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	133	I thank the Senators for their remarks and thank Senator Ryan for putting down the amendment. While I am not accepting it, there is provision under section 8 of the Bill that the agency would have to consult with local community interests as one of its functions. That has been done and is ongoing. A number of officials in the existing company were designated and have met on a regular basis with 140 to 150 community groups, some of which are involved in the issues referred to by the Senator in this amendment. I will consider giving a directive under section 12, as I am allowed to do, to the board of the agency asking them to address the issue of access and inclusion, and to make a report to me on this. Under section 12, which concerns directives of the Minister to the agency, I will consider doing that to take into account the issue the Senator refers to.On the broad issue of working with local community groups, there has been an absolute insistence from the beginning of this concept that the agency work hand in hand with these groups so that they feel part of the process. That experience has been very positive. The CAIT programme is specifically designed to assist disadvantaged areas and the Government has already given €8 million for this year and last year. That is to be made available to disadvantaged groups to help to look at the issue of the digital divide in their respective areas. That could be tapped into also. With regard to the amendment, I will consider giving a directive under section 12.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	134	Is the amendment being pressed?
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	135	I am disappointed. The Minister effectively said that there is merit in the amendment but he then said – and I listened carefully – that he would consider giving a directive. If he would drop the word "consider" and say that he would give a directive, I would be happy, in so far as I can be happy on Committee Stage. I am sure the Minister will consider 100,000 different things between now and when he starts giving directives. That is not the same as taking action.Regarding the local community initiative, I accept that it is an important contribution but it is not what I am talking about. This agency has more than a local role. It is very important that its local role be one which meshes well with the local community. However, the subsection which I want amended talks about a strategy for educational provision, particularly for the digital arts and technology and including linkages with first and second level schools, etc. It does not talk about local first and second level schools. I assume that it means schools generally and third level institutions generally. I would have put down an amendment if I did not assume that. Regarding disadvantage, I am not just talking about the local community in the area surrounding Thomas Street, for example, but about a national objective. This agency should think nationally.The area of disability is an obvious one for digital technology. Even Mr. Bill Gates of Microsoft has made some effort to improve accessibility for people with various disabilities. It is strange that this agency, which is supposed to put us at the heart of future developments, does not have this as an objective. May God forgive me for saying it, but it could even be commercially attractive to do this. There is a large market for the use of digital technology to improve accessibility to books, films and music, among other things. It is strange that we cannot have a commitment that the Minister will see to it that the agency considers this.

Obviously, we cannot include other schools because they are not within the general area involved or within the remit of this legislation.The point the Senator makes about access and the digital divide is well made, particularly for people with physical and other disabilities, and I will take it on board.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	144	I move amendment No. 6:
In page 8, subsection (4), between lines 39 and 40, to insert the following new subparagraph:"(a) publish the draft development plan by electronic means;".Before the Acting Chairman came in, the Minister explained that he was willing to accept a form of words which will, in effect, accept the amendments entirely. I am happy to withdraw the amendments but will say a few words to express my appreciation to the Minister for his understanding of the point that Senator Ryan and I have made. While I am aware that the Minister is accepting the amendments, I am sticking to the few words I had planned to say as it is important that they are put on the record for others and in relation to other Bills.Publication is one of the great tools of democratic accountability and that is reflected in the saying that knowledge is power. It is further reflected in the cynical phrase that what people do not know will not hurt them. Ireland has a long history and tradition of assuming accountability through publication. In trying to bring this tradition up to date, I attempted to embrace the new technology and hoped that this would increase the meaningfulness of accountability.Until recently, our publication tools were very limited in certain respects. We could require publication of critical information in Iris Oifigiúil, in national newspapers or in local newspapers if the information was relevant to a specific area of the country. We could require State bodies to publish their accounts and an annual report. State bodies and other organisations could be required to keep registers of certain information. Such registers had to be made available for inspection by the public at a certain place and between certain times. We could require certain information to be laid before the Oireachtas. Such publication tools proved useful in the past and are the established pillars of our democracy; they are the means by which we give teeth to the notion of accountability.The arrival of the Internet, however, radically changed all that. In one stroke, it greatly improved the efficacy of publication and the means of enforcing accountability. It has done this for a number of reasons, one of which is its broad reach. If something is published on the Internet, it is immediately available to an increasingly vast range of people. It is an inexpensive medium, as it costs virtually nothing to publish on the Internet. It is quick – one can publish on the Internet within seconds – and permanent. It is a great deal quicker than printing and, once published, a document is available on the web for all time. As legislators, we should consider the Internet when we seek to use publication as a tool of accountability. We have been quite limited in the past as the tools at our disposal were not as advantageous as the Internet in terms of reach, expense or time limits.For a number of years, I have put down amendments to incorporate the notion of Internet publication in legislation. Ministers have been open to my suggestions, generally speaking, although there have been cases when they came to the House with their hands tied with regard to accepting amendments. I was delighted, therefore, to hear the Minister's words. I have gone to some trouble to recognise what the Minister has done today. I hope that amendments such as the one before the House will not have to be put down again, as future Bills should contain such provisions before they reach Committee Stage. I hope that we will eventually be heard by officials in the Office of the Chief Parliamentary Counsel, who will feed the notion of electronic publication into their word processors, meaning that it becomes an automatic feature of Bills.My amendments in relation to this matter are not intended as enabling measures. I do not doubt that the bodies with which we deal will have the power to publish on the Internet, as they have such powers already. The amendments are proposed as compelling measures, intended to make the notion of accountability more meaningful through the use of available technology. I am not talking about replacing any of the existing tools, but of adding to them. Apart from the day to day job of enabling the development of the digital hub, the principle behind this Bill is to signal to the outside world that Ireland is serious about the information age. It carries a message that we are determined to take a leader's role in the new era. I congratulate the Minister on his immediate reply to my amendments and I appreciate his response. I hope that we save time in future and that those who are drafting future legislation will include a reference to Internet publication. Perhaps the Interpretation Bill could provide that references to "publication" in Acts will mean "publication by electronic means". I appreciate the Minister's immediate response to my amendments.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	145	I appreciate the Senator's argument. When this Bill was being drafted, it was considered that "publication" meant publication in all its various forms. It did not mean that we were ignoring electronic means, especially bearing in mind that this Bill deals with a digital hub. I imagine that those involved with the digital hub are to the fore in using electronic means for disseminating information, gathering comments and consulting on matters within their remit. All the digital hub project's reports can be found on its website, www.thedigitalhub.com, and people are invited to consult the digital hub's officials through the site.I appreciate the Senator's remarks and I have mentioned the Government's proposed amendment to take care of this matter. I agree with the Senator that this subject should be borne in mind for future reference.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	146	I appreciate the Minister's reply to my comments. I was trying to influence the drafting of future legislation. I do not doubt, as the Minister says, that "publication" will be interpreted as including Internet publication in the context of this Bill, particularly as it deals with the digital hub. I can inform him, however, that a number of Departments have refused to accept such an interpretation in recent years. Perhaps the Interpretation Bill should provide that the word "publication" includes "publication by electronic means", just as it clarifies that the word "he" means "he or she". The benefits of electronic publication are so huge that we should ensure it is used in all cases.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	150	I move amendment No. 8:
In page 9, subsection (1), line 30, to delete "6 months" and substitute "3 months".This amendment seeks to speed up the process of drawing up strategic plans. Section 10 is written as if the new body is coming out of the blue and the period of six months to draw up such plans would be reasonable if this were the case. It is not as if the Digital Hub Development Agency will be starting from scratch on its establishment day, however, as the interim body that this Bill will dissolve will have been in operation for a number of years by then. Part of the interim company's job is to lay the ground for the agency, so most of the strategic thinking will have been done by day one.Time is of the essence for this project and I know the Minister, Deputy Dermot Ahern, shares this belief. This agency should have been in existence at least a year ago, although it is not the Minister's fault that it was not. We should not further slow the process by laying down such a leisurely procedure, which is why my second proposal is to replace "as soon as practicable" with "as soon as may be".
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	151	That is provided for in amendment No. 11.

#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	153	The Deputy asked for the amendments to be taken separately and the House agreed.

I accept the Senator's point that the interim body has been up and running for some time, but there is a multiplicity of stakeholders whose views have to be heard. My officials feel strongly that three months would be too short a timeframe. The Communications Regulation Act, 2002, for example, shares the responsibility for the Office of the Director of Telecommunications Regulation among three persons, as opposed to one. Although the existing ODTR structure was probably more advanced than the digital hub project is at present, a six month timelag was built into the Communications Regulation Act to allow for wide consultation. I can inform the Senator that I will accept his amendment No. 11.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	155	I understand the Minister's reluctance to accept my amendment, which merely tries to remind him of the need for alacrity in relation to this matter. He has indicated that he intends to move speedily and I am sure the gesture I made will serve as nothing more than a reminder.

In page 11, subsection (1), line 10, to delete "14 members" and substitute "12 members".This is an issue of corporate governance. Most State bodies are too big to be effective because the size of the board reflects the political need to appoint people to it rather than a desire to get the job done. I was chairman of the board of An Post and to make sure unions were represented there was a board of 15 people. In business it would be rare to find a board of that size. Cabinet works well as a board of 15 people but that is not generally the case. Once a group has a membership greater than 12 it becomes clumsy.The object should be to build a team that will work together in pursuit of common objectives. When a board is larger than 12 members, it is hard to build the necessary cohesion. People behave as individuals rather than team members and often it is necessary to split up into sub-committees, which have their own problems. It is often harder to get a quorum from a larger membership. It might not appear there is a great difference between a board of 12 and one of 14 but there is a world of difference.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	160	A membership of 14 is too cumbersome for a board of directors. If the Minister wants a precedent he should look at the port companies where there were 12 recent appointments. I was Opposition spokesman on the marine and natural resources in the other House and when the Minister, Deputy Fahy, established those companies, there was great reassurance that it would be a new dawn for the industry because he would appoint business people with marine expertise who would contribute handsomely. I was disappointed because the board of 12 was eventually composed of only six business people and six county councillors who had to accommodate different local authorities. I support a reduction in numbers from 14 to 12.
#DermotAhern	unknown-#DermotAhern-party	unknown-#DermotAhern-dob	unknown-#DermotAhern-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	161	Normally I would sympathise with Senators on the size of the board, but the strong advice is that, because of the nature of the digital hub and the need to include appointees from State agencies such as the IDA, Enterprise Ireland, Dublin City Council and the education authorities, this number is necessary. There are already representatives from many of those agencies on the existing board who would have to be accommodated. In the circumstances, 14 is a reasonable figure.

Under the Freedom of Information Act it would be possible to extract the correspondence exchanged in the process. If legislation states that persons are to be appointed who, in the opinion of the Minister, have a special interest or expertise, then it should be enforceable. That is what it means and, therefore, the Minister should have to put something in writing.I am reluctant to tie Minister's hands too tightly in such matters. The problems with appointments to State boards are better rectified with politics rather than excessively complicated legislation. Many incorrect appointments have been made but the Minister who has the freedom to appoint should have the obligation to make such appointments for reasons stated in writing and laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas so we know what he is thinking. Otherwise the definition of an interest or expertise is too flexible.

If that was to be applied to all State boards, it would be an onerous operation that would take a very long time. These boards must come before the Oireachtas anyway so there are plenty of opportunities for people to find out about the abilities of the members.

All I want is the conclusion the Minister draws from the documentation. Is it a case of an appointee simply raising his or her hand? This could be onerous only is if there is nothing written down already. These are serious appointments to serious bodies with serious work to do. The idea that it would be onerous in terms of additional paperwork is nonsense. It is a pity since the Minister has been more than forthcoming so far. There must be better reasons than this to reject the amendment.I assume the Minister, who has considerable ability, would not pretend he was going to appoint the 14 members of the agency without having something in writing to enable him to make an evaluation of who should or should not be on it. If he has something in writing which enables him to make that decision, he could use that as the document to be published. Otherwise, he is saying he makes it up as he goes along, which I do not believe is the case.The Minister said the Higher Education Authority will be represented on it. However, there is another sector of third level education which is not represented by or accountable to the HEA. I hope the technological sector of third level education will also be in a position to have equal status in terms of the development of the digital hub. A considerable amount of the most imaginative work in the area of multi-media has been done outside the university sector.

If this had happened 20 or 30 years ago, Senator Ryan would not have tabled such an amendment. History has shown some bad examples of appointees to boards which were not valid. I understand the reason Senator Ryan tabled the amendment. I am sure he would like to include it in almost every State board. There are too many stories and examples of political appointments. There may be a better way of doing it than the method the Senator suggested. I would like the Minister to consider it for Report Stage.

I am not being flippant, but there are times when it is difficult to fill board vacancies. It is often difficult to get people of calibre. However, that does not apply in this case. The most recent appointment to the board was the change of the chairperson. William Burgess has an excellent track record in this area. The other members of the board are Paul Kavanagh, Dan Flinter, Peter Cassells, Jackie Harrison, John Fitzgerald, Don Thornhill, Paul McGuinness and Sean Dorgan. While people might have some justification for questioning appointees to other boards, regardless of what Government is in office, no one could suggest that any of the appointees to this board are not deserving either because of their expertise or because they are members of a political party.

As regards appointments I have made to boards since I became a Minister, if I was required to justify in writing why someone should or should not be appointed, it would be a practical nightmare. It would also be dangerous because people might at a later date see something about themselves in it which they might not want to be in the public domain. Why would people want the hassle of having their personality brought out into the open? The system has worked well in relation to this board and I do not see any reason to change it. I see some merit in the way it has been done. I appreciate what Senator Ryan said about the involvement of politics in the appointment of boards and the fact that it has been a relatively good thing. I cannot accept the amendment.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	175	I am astonished by the degree to which the Department of Education and Science and other Departments – I do not include the Minister's Department – seem to believe that when it comes to expertise there is only one sector of third level education. The last time I checked the board of the Irish Council for Science, Technology and Innovation there was nobody from the technological sector of third level education on it. However, that board compiled a detailed report on the teaching of science in secondary schools without serious reference to the sector of third level education which specialises in scientific education. The national foresight panels, which were set up in recent years, contained one staff member from the technological sector of education and dealt with a range of areas which are in many cases more developed and advanced in the technological sector of education. I make no apology for saying that because it is my own sector. As the Minister said, many of these jobs are more trouble for people than they are worth. I am concerned about the lack of willingness because of traditional thinking to use expertise which is available rather than about jobs for my colleagues, most of whom have enough to do. There is an unwillingness to use the expertise.I am not prepared to withdraw the amendment because I do not believe the Minister made a convincing case. I refuse to accept that appointments to State board are made from thin air without written justification.

It was not Senator Ryan's intention to suggest that an explanation is required for the board the Minister is appointing. However, this organisation will last for a long time. There will be other Ministers and appointees. Senator Ryan is attempting to ensure that in future an explanation will be given for appointments to avoid some of the problems we had in the past where political appointments were made. The Minister is correct in that this board is well represented. However, I am more concerned about the future and about establishing a board where the appointees could end up in a similar situation to that in other boards.

#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	178	I move amendment No. 18:
In page 12, after line 41, to insert the following new subsection:"(6) The chairperson of the Agency shall not exercise the functions of the chief executive, except in exceptional circumstances on a temporary basis which shall not exceed a period of 3 months.".The amendment refers to an important issue relating to corporate governance. It is now accepted in management thinking that there must be a clear separation between the role of chairperson and that of the chief executive in an accountable public company. I stress the notion of public accountability. The chairman has a special role as a bridge between the ultimate owners, the State – in this case, the people – and the body. The chief executive has a more restricted role, namely, to do the business. Experience has clearly shown that in such cases two heads are better than one. Combining the two jobs can lead to conflicts of interest and other such problems. We should legislate against such a situation arising.The Minister may argue it is not the intention to allow one person to do both jobs, but that is not enough. We do not have to look any further than the history of the interim company to see how easy it is to sweep principles aside for reasons which look good at the time but rarely prove to be the case at the end of the day. We need to legislate against that eventuality and we must send a clear message about the level of corporate governance we expect. We saw a number of times in the past where State and other bodies had joint chief executives and chairmen. It is not a good idea.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	179	I move:That Seanad Éireann, noting with alarm the deteriorating condition of the health services and the failure even to make proper provision for the Government's own health strategy, condemns(1) the failure of the Government to provide appropriate additional funding to hospitals affected by the winter vomiting virus,(2) the decision to increase both accident and emergency and drugs refund charges,(3) the failure to give any real commitment to extend the BreastCheck service to the entire country and(4) the omission from the programme for Government of the election commitment to end hospital waiting lists in two years.When the general election was called everybody agreed the health services would probably be the single most important issue in the campaign. This was not my view. The single most important social issue in our society is housing, the lack of which will ultimately do more harm to more people than even our abysmal health service. However, in terms of popular perception and its impact on society, health is the most immediate concern. The health service, therefore, became the most important issue during the campaign.Coming into the election, the Government was happy to boast about the sums of money it had spent on the health service. Those of us who live in Cork are well aware that the Minster for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, has a penchant for quoting large sums of money to the extent that one would think it was his only task as a Minister. I will turn to what Ministers should be doing in a moment. Perhaps the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, will have more constructive things to do and say than to quote large sums of money.As the previous Government repeatedly told us for five years, it spent an increasing amount of money on the health service. Having done this, it proceeded to draft a health strategy. My understanding of how to run a business or organisation is that one first produces a business plan or strategy. Once the strategy or plan has been defined and one has identified where one is and where one wants to be, one begins to organise resources to achieve this objective. The approach of the previous Government, however, was entirely perverse in the sense that it constituted a reversal of all logic. Clearly the health strategy was no more than a cobbling together of every good aspiration and intention people from around the country had expressed. It said nothing about the way in which we would get from our then position, which was awful, to where we wanted to be, which was excellent. This is the fundamental problem the Government still faces.In its amendment the Government admits it will not deliver one of the commitments it trumpeted in the health strategy and during the general election campaign, namely, that it would end waiting lists in two years. The Minister toured the nation announcing that waiting lists would be eliminated within two years of the general election, yet just a few months later the commitment on waiting lists has been dropped and replaced with the commitment in the amendment to make them "a priority".Having debated the issue of the health services with the Minister on local radio in Cork recently, I already had an inkling of what was in store. During the programme he refused to state that the Government would eliminate waiting lists in two years, instead saying it would do its best and was working towards that objective. This was one of the very few specific, unequivocal commitments the outgoing Government made during the campaign and it dumped it within two months of election day. It is not in the programme for Government, which contains nothing more than the usual aspiration on the matter. We all aspire to have a good health service and it would be a strange politician who aspired to any other kind of health system. The health service no longer needs aspirations, it needs a strategy backed up by the necessary resources.The topics we identify are ones which we know to be of central importance to ordinary people. The first, for instance, relates to an unforeseeable development which is causing enormous trouble and expense to hospitals around the country, namely, the winter vomiting virus. The Government has announced that no extra funding will be made available to health boards to compensate them for the unavoidable additional costs they incur as a result of the virus, which effectively means that other services will have to suffer.Last week the Evening Echo published leaked figures which indicated that waiting lists in Cork University Hospital, the flagship hospital of the Southern Health Board, were 26% higher than six months previously. If resources are being consumed by the entirely unexpected outbreaks of the winter vomiting virus and extra resources are not provided to deal with the matter, naturally one will reach a point where hospitals have insufficient funds for treatments.Money of itself, however, will not solve the problem, given that the management of the health service has been a failure. It is one of the ironies of life that many officials, particularly in the Department of Health and Children and the Department of Finance, constantly seek to introduce performance indicators to the health service, notably through the Health Service Employers Agency. They always start at the grassroots, trying to impose performance indicators on nurses, doctors, orderlies and so on. Good management, however, dictates that in order to transform an organisation, one introduces performance indicators and changes values and attitudes at the top first.One must get those responsible for managing the health services to accept they are the ones who are accountable. Anybody working in a health board will tell you that when a decision is taken somewhere in its amorphous bureaucracy you can be certain that you will not know who took it. It is not a revolutionary change that every decision taken by the management of something as large and complex as a health service should identify the individual taking responsibility and the circumstances under which that decision was taken. The result of the current mode of operation is perpetual frustration with nobody knowing why some decisions were taken and others were not, while nobody knows who was responsible.It is into this unaccountable mess that the previous Government pumped billions of euro and, inevitably, did not get what it wanted. That happened for a number of reasons, one of which is that the billions of euro were spread over an extending health service. Every time he gets the chance, the Minister for Finance wonders somewhat plaintively where all the money went and why nothing improved. It seems difficult to get him to read what the Department of Health and Children said about the increased expenditure. The Government had to provide hugely expanded services for children because of the scandalous neglect of child services previously and it had to expand services for people with disabilities, which I acknowledge it did, particularly for those suffering from intellectual disability.The health service was out on its feet because a bad service was devastated by the cutbacks post-1987 and a huge amount of now vastly more expensive equipment had to be replaced as a matter of urgency. The Government could not understand why all the money it was spending was not doing what it wanted and it was unable to deal with the ineptitude of management in health boards which could not use resources it was given and was not prepared to identify its members as the accountable parties. The absence of a real strategy meant that money was scattered across every area.We must remember what we know about the health service. The rural GP system is falling apart because young people will not work in single GP practices any more, while the availability of medical cards has dropped dramatically and people are suffering greatly as a result. People on quite small incomes who have to pay out €65 every month are suffering from hardship. We know, because the Minister for Health and Children told me, that the BreastCheck scheme is essentially on the long finger in terms of being extended to the rest of the country. He waffled to me of a two and a half year roll out time in Cork and could not announce when he was going to start planning for that. Presumably, we will have an announcement about the complete roll out of the BreastCheck service before the next election.The Government has a strategy that cannot be funded, funding that cannot be accounted for and there is no sense in which the needs of the population at large are being dealt within the current health service. The fundamental problem is unwillingness to think this through, inability to manage the health service and the now critical shortage of resources, all of which are responsibilities of the Government for which it must be held accountable. It is the classic example of the deception this Government used to win the last election.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	180	I am proud to second the first Labour Party motion of this Seanad term. In bringing forward this debate on the health service we are, as my colleague has pointed out, attempting to raise the issue of accountability in relation to this important Government responsibility. In particular, I draw attention to the non-extension of the breast cancer screening programme to the remaining parts of the country.The mid-western region is the one with which I am most familiar and I direct the Minister's attention to the fact that there is major concern about the lack of a breast screening service there. Recently, the mammograph machine at Nenagh General Hospital has been shut down, there are no plans by the health board to replace it and a perfectly good breast and smear clinic has come to an end, leaving the women of north Tipperary without a breast screening service. There is no better example of how not to do things. The Government announced a national screening programme and a timescale for it, then failed to meet its own deadlines and allowed local services people had confidence in to be run down without providing for replacements.At a public meeting which I called because of the level of concern about this matter, a number of issues came up with regard to the lack of services for women. We have one of the highest rates of breast cancer in Europe, are now in the middle of breast cancer awareness month and we have a failure to roll out the screening service. It is – at the very least – ironic and insulting to switch on the radio every day and hear advertisements exhorting women to use a service which is not available. It is a disgrace and nothing short of a scandal. Speaking to women and their families who have been affected by breast cancer brings home the extent to which this Government is failing a section of women, at least in the community I represent. I do not speak lightly when I say it is a scandal.In the context of how we are spending national resources on health, I bring to the attention of the House the issue of care for the elderly and the effect of privatisation. Once again, I use examples I am familiar with from my own area and point to the community hospital in Thurles which we were told last year, amid great fanfare, would be upgraded at a cost of several million euro while the number of beds for the elderly would be reduced. In other words, a State facility was winding down the number of beds available to families who could not otherwise manage. There are many families who have elderly parents or relatives and do not have the resources to meet the high cost of nursing home care even with a subvention. I am acquainted with an elderly couple the husband of which supports on a pension his wife who has been in a nursing home for a number of years. No other resources are available to him, the subvention does not simply meet his requirements and he is crucified.At the same time the number of places in State run facilities is decreasing. As a result people are being forced and, effectively, told to rely on private nursing homes without any recourse to public care. That is creeping privatisation, a development with which I have a major difficulty at a time when private facilities are popping up all over the place and for which there is active Government support. They are not care based facilities but financial arrangements, in effect, financial units run by conglomerates on a commercial basis. We must seriously ask ourselves how we are managing, in particular, elderly care in the community.I commend the motion to the House for which I ask for support. A high standard of health care and equal access to it are basic rights that currently are not available.

I welcome the opportunity to speak to this amendment which affords me and other Members a chance to highlight the successes of this and the previous Government during the past five years.One can do no better in talking about a service than talk about the service in one's area. I am chairman of the Midland Health Board and I am pleased to say that under the health strategy, which highlights as one of its flagship proposals an increase in the number of beds, the Minister for Foreign Affairs, Deputy Cowen, recently lay the foundation stone for the construction of a new hospital at Tullamore. Next week or the week after a presentation will be made by the architect to the Longford-Westmeath members on the development control plan for the completion of phase 2B of the Longford-Westmeath General Hospital, now known as the Regional Hospital in Mullingar which when completed will increase its bed capacity from 203 to 311, an increase of 108 beds. The number of beds in Tullamore General Hospital will increase by 68. Substantial developments currently taking place in Portlaoise General Hospital will result in an increase in the number of beds in the new paediatric department, the new accident and emergency and new psychiatric units by five beds, respectively, while the medical unit will be refurbished and extended.I worked as a professional for a number years in St. Loman's Hospital, Mullingar where I had the honour of officially opening a department in recent years. A unit for psychiatry of later life was opened there some months ago. These are only some of the developments taking place.Various speakers have made points pertaining to waiting lists in recent years. In the period March 2001 to March 2002 there was a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ENT procedures and a reduction of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the same period. The total number of adults waiting more than 12 months for treatment in target specialties has fallen by 16% in the same period.Regarding an area that is close to my heart, I recall that when I started to operate a constituency clinic, I shrivelled up when constituents raised the issue of orthodontic treatment. The waiting list in my health board area and other health board areas was unacceptable. However, the following is the current picture. The waiting list in County Longford was eliminated last year and patients currently receive treatment as soon as is needed. This, effectively, represents treatment on demand. The new clinic at Portlaoise General Hospital opened this month and all patients will taken off the waiting list in County Laois by the end of this year. As a result of an increased productivity incentive in place in County Offaly, all patients there will be taken off the waiting list by the end of 2002. New orthodontic clinics will be installed in County Westmeath in Athlone and Mullingar in early 2003. These facilities should enable all patients on the waiting list in the county to start treatment by September 2003, but the improvements do not end there.We are fortunate to have David Hegarty, a consultant orthodontist who trained in the United Kingdom, who has established training institutions, as a result of which 19 dentists are training as orthodontists to work in the health boards. That is great news for many children and adults, especially those in poorer sections of the community, who could not avail of the orthodontic service due to the shortage of professionals in this field.Regarding the accident and emergency service, I had the honour of leading a deputation to the Minister for Health and Children yesterday. Comhairle na nOspidéal has approved the appointment of 29 accident and emergency consultants, five of whom will be assigned to the Midland Health Board area. A new accident and emergency unit will be opened in Portlaoise General Hospital and new facilities will be available in the Regional Hospital in Mullingar, which represents good news.While BreastCheck provides a screening service for members of the female community—

Out of a total of 91,906 women eligible for screening, 68,184 were screened, representing an uptake in the programme of 74%, with 544 cases of cancer detected. This level of uptake in the programme must be welcomed.In early 2002 a multidisciplinary validation visit was carried out by the European network of reference centres for breast cancer screening charged with external validation of the screen mammography centres. Its report indicates the national breast screening programme is operating to a high level clinically, professionally and organisationally in the screening, diagnosing and treatment of breast cancer.The Labour Party motion refers to the winter vomiting virus, which, as everyone knows, is highly contagious. The public has a major role to play in this regard. Infection control officers have been appointed in hospitals where there has been an outbreak and, in many instances, such officers were already in place. In the event of an outbreak, members of the public when visiting a hospital, irrespective of its location, should take cognisance of the instructions given by the hospital authorities and, in particular, infection control officers.
#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	184	I commend the Labour Party motion and support totally what Senator Ryan said. I have been in politics long enough to know that the Government will produce a counter-motion that congratulates throughout. The perception fostered before the election and the current reality are completely different.While Senator Glynn eulogised the successes in his health board area, I am critical of what is happening in the mid-west. In July 2000 the Mid-Western Health Board made a submission to the Minister for Health and Children for a radiotherapy facility. I understand that Dr. Hollywood has engaged in the production of a report on radiotherapy facilities around the country. Perhaps the Minister of State could clarify if that report is with the Minister – I understand that it is. If so, are we likely to get a radiotherapy facility in the Mid-Western Health Board area? The Caiman-Hine report states that there should be two radiotherapy machines in areas with a population of 280,000 to 300,000. The population in the mid-western region comfortably exceeds that.Regrettably 1,500 patients are diagnosed with cancer in the Mid-Western Health Board area each year, of which about 750 will need radiotherapy. These facilities are mainly provided in either Dublin or Cork. Many people from the area travel to St. Luke's in Dublin where access to the service takes, on average, seven weeks. A woman with breast cancer who may have the choice of a mastectomy or lumpectomy will, regrettably, often decide on a lumpectomy because of the travel time to Dublin and the length of the wait. That is a criticism of the health service in the mid-western region. There have been good developments in other specialisms such as urology, colorectal and other disciplines. Regrettably, the radiotherapy facility, which is very important for our area, has not been provided. Maybe the Minister will do one good thing this evening and announce that it will be provided. That would give reassurance to a lot of people there.During the general election campaign I asked an elderly woman in a rural area if I could speak to her daughter. She told me that I could not as her daughter was in bed, suffering from cancer. She asked me to try to get radiotherapy facilities in the area. Those women did not have a car, yet she had to travel to Dublin for treatment. Having to travel 150 miles in an ambulance while already suffering from cancer is poor from a palliative perspective; in many cases it can exacerbate the cancer. A woman with five young children living five miles from the regional hospital told me that she found it a terrible nuisance to have to travel to St. Luke's when she lived so close to the regional hospital.Radiotherapy treatment in St. Luke's is often given between 5 p.m. and 9 p.m. Not alone do people have to travel great distances but many of them have to stay overnight. If we are to talk of centres of excellence in medicine and proper facilities, rather than eulogising that which was achieved in the past – Senator Glynn lacked credibility – it is important that we have that type of facility.The difficulty of having the elderly admitted to hospitals under health board control is known in all areas. St. Ida's hospital in Newcastle West was told six years ago that it would be given an Alzheimer's unit with 14 beds. If one has advanced Alzheimer's one cannot be admitted to category one and will not be admitted to either St. Ida's or St. Camillus's. The Taoiseach came to Newcastle West and took the de rigueur look around St. Ida's. Deputy Cowen, when he was Minister for Health and Children, visited St. Ida's, as did the current Minister. The Minister of State, Deputy Callely, visited St. Ida's on his way back from Killarney. Government Ministers need to stop looking at St. Ida's. The figures prove that the unit is needed and €1 would provide it.Action in those areas would not cost a fortune. How many health board areas have a charity organisation in place like the Mid-Western Hospital Development Trust Limited? It is prepared to fund the installation of the radiotherapy equipment. It only requires a commitment from Government to put it in place. Planning permission has been granted in a dedicated area beside the oncology unit. That would mean more to my area than eulogies. It would demonstrate the tangible commitment of a Minister that cares.The big, glossy report published before the election spoke of all the marvellous things that were going to happen. Although it said what we would all want, the Government knew the funding was not available. Some of it was Disneyland stuff. Senator Glynn told us that no one in Longford is waiting for orthodontic treatment – good luck to them. Anyone asking a representative from the Mid-Western Health Board region about the type of orthodontic service available would find that there are massive waiting lists. People cannot wait to be treated publicly and they borrow money to pay for private treatment.I hope the Minister of State will clarify if the Hollywood report on radiotherapy is with the Minister and, if not, when it will be with him. Will we get a radiotherapy unit in Newcastle West? Maybe the Minister of State will come to Newcastle West and we will show him around the hospital.

The Senator will be aware that the Minister of State, Deputy Callely, has been assigned special responsibility for the elderly at the Department of Health and Children.I take this opportunity, on behalf of my colleague the Minister for Health and Children, to set out the current position of the health services. I thank the Senators for their contributions. I welcome Senator Ryan's acknowledgement that the problems in our health service will not be solved by money alone. He also suggested that the electorate had been deceived regarding health policy.Senator Finucane referred to perceptions created, he maintained, before the recent general election. The perception set out to the people prior to the election was the national health strategy. The Department has developed this strategy to move away from short-term approaches to planning and provide a blueprint for the whole health system that will realise ambitious and wide-ranging change over seven to ten years. That is the policy of the Government in its key priority area of health. The targets in the health strategy are ambitious and they reflect the determination of the Government to deal with this area.In setting out such a comprehensive and large-scale plan of this nature, it is inevitable that a prioritisation of actions must take place. There is no magic overnight formula for putting right deficiencies in the system. These deficiencies are the legacy of many years of underdevelopment. The strategy represents a step-by-step approach to reducing inequalities in the system and building the necessary capacity to meet the growing needs of the population.Equity in health care is one of the cardinal principles on which the new health strategy is based and it is also one to which the Government is committed in terms of the implementation of the strategy. The health strategy recognises that access to the health service is just one of the determinants of health status. Efforts to improve access must take place in the context of health-supporting public policies in other areas. That is why the strategy proposes the introduction of health impact assessment as part of the public policy. We will seek to ensure that the statements of strategy and business plans of all relevant Government Departments incorporate an explicit commitment to sustaining and improving health status.As part of ensuring fair access, the strategy identifies the need to ensure equitable access to services. This is concerned with improved access to hospital services for public patients as well as recognising other barriers, which affect the ability of individuals to access services.In recent years – I regret that I will have to place information about some of these matters on the record for Senator Ryan's benefit – health was by far the biggest beneficiary of new resources available for public services. Over the past four years, under the guidance of the previous Government, funding of the health service has doubled and the debate on health funding has now moved from resources alone to both resources and reform. The Government is committed to working to protecting Ireland's economic and fiscal position as the key prerequisite to providing the funding required to implement the strategy.In the current year the Government has invested almost €8.2 billion – £6.4 billion – in the health services, which represents an increase of 134% since 1997. As a percentage of gross national product, health revenue expenditure now stands at 7.8%. This is the highest it has been in almost 20 years. The establishment by Government of a national development plan is the most important event in the development of the health capital infrastructure. The level of funding in 2002 represents a 33% increase on the 2001 outturn. This funding will allow for the continued progression of major projects in the health sector, such as hospitals and community facilities. Every region in the country has had a major investment programme in its health facilities and equipment.The health strategy acknowledges the central role of primary care in the future development of the health services. A major refocus on primary care services is marked by the introduction of a new model of primary care involving a core interdisciplinary primary care team, which will work with a wider network of health and social care professionals and will offer 24 hour cover. The Government is fully committed to the implementation of the primary care strategy and this is specifically reflected in the programme for Government agreed earlier this year.Primary Care: A New Direction represents one of the most significant developments to have been proposed for primary care in Ireland. This strategy will shape the development of primary care and policy related to it in the coming years. The key objective of the strategy is to shift the emphasis from our current over-reliance on acute services, such as hospitals, to one-stop-shops where patients will be able to access a team of general practitioners, nurses, physiotherapists, chiropodists, social workers and home helps. This strengthened primary care system will play a more central role as the first and ongoing point of contact for people with the health care system.Earlier this year a small primary care task force, drawn from the Department and the health boards, was established. In line with the role set out for this group in the strategy, it has responsibility for driving the implementation of the changes and developments set out in the model. A national primary care steering group has also been established. All the key stakeholders are represented on this body which will give guidance on the key elements of the implementation plan. There is also scope for the steering group to have a significant input into the development of the implementation plans. Earlier this month the Minister for Health and Children gave approval to the first ten primary care implementation projects, with funding totalling €8.4 million being provided for this purpose in 2002 and 2003.These projects will build on the services and resources already in place in the ten locations involved so as to develop a primary care team which will include general practitioners, nurses/midwives, health care assistants, home helps, an occupational therapist, physiotherapist, a social worker and administrative personnel. This is only one of the first steps along the way. The strategy takes a long-term view, looking forward over the next ten years or so. For many reasons it is appropriate that we take an incremental approach to achieving change, rather than trying to transform things overnight. This implementation period recognises that there are major structural changes which must occur in order for the new primary care model to be implemented. It is also necessary to ensure that the required numbers of health professionals are trained and retained in the system over the coming decade and beyond to meet anticipated needs.We have not always planned in an adequate way for the future human resource needs of the health services, with the result that the number of health professionals available has not kept pace with our needs. Staff planning for the decades ahead, therefore, will be directed at meeting the human resource requirements of primary care on a planned and structured basis.The single most important limiting factor for admission to hospital is bed availability. In this context a comprehensive review of bed capacity needs has been conducted in conjunction with the Department of Finance and in consultation with the social partners. This review, Acute Hospital Bed Capacity – A National Review, focused primarily on the need to increase bed capacity and to have a strategic framework in place in terms of the number of additional beds required in the short, medium and long term. On foot of this report the Government decided, in the context of the strategy, to provide an additional 3,000 beds in acute hospitals over the next ten years. This represents the largest ever concentrated expansion of acute hospital capacity in Ireland.Some €65 million capital and revenue funding has been provided in 2002 to put an additional 709 acute beds in place to meet the first phase of a programme to provide a total of 3,000 new acute beds over the next ten years. The Department has been informed by the Eastern Regional Health Authority and the health boards that, to date, 258 of these beds have been commissioned under this initiative. It is expected that in excess of 600 beds will be in use by year end and that the remainder of the 709 beds will be commissioned early in the new year.Last year, visits to accident and emergency Departments countrywide exceeded 1.2 million, which is equivalent to 3,300 visits per day for each day of the year. A number of significant initiatives have been taken to improve services in accident and emergency departments. A €40.63 million investment package was provided by the previous Government in the winter of 2000-01, aimed at alleviating service pressures and maintaining services to patients, particularly in the acute hospital sector. This investment package provided for the recruitment of an additional 29 accident and emergency consultants and for the contracting of additional private nursing home places for patients whose acute phase of treatment has been completed but who require additional care in an alternative setting.Other initiatives have been identified in the national health strategy which are designed to improve the operation of accident and emergency departments. These include the establishment of minor injury units to ensure appropriate treatment and management of non-urgent cases; the use of chest pain clinics, respiratory clinics and in-house specialist teams to fast-track patients as appropriate; and the re-organisation of diagnostic services to ensure increased access to, and availability of, services at busy times in accident and emergency departments.At the request of the Minister, Deputy Martin, Comhairle na nOspidéal undertook a review of the structures, operation and staffing of accident and emergency departments. The report of the review, Report of the Committee on Accident & Emergency Services, examines and makes recommendations on the provision of emergency services in public hospitals in the State. It explores factors that affect efficiency and effectiveness of hospital emergency services and links reform of accident and emergency departments with the need to look critically at hospital processes and patient flows throughout the hospitals. I am confident that its work will contribute significantly to advancing the existing and proposed policy framework for accident and emergency services as set out in the health strategy.The Minister for Health and Children is committed to ensuring that accident and emergency departments are in a position to respond to the need for their services. I am confident that hospital management and staff in hospitals providing accident and emergency services will continue to work together to respond to any difficulties and to ensure that a high quality service continues to be provided to patients in the best conditions possible.The statutory charge for attendance at accident and emergency departments increased from €31.70 to €40 on 1 August 2002. This charge is levied only on persons who attend at accident and emergency departments without a referral note from their general practitioner and applies only for the first visit of any episode of care. As well as providing hospitals with a source of income, the charge is important as an incentive towards the appropriate use of accident and emergency departments.A number of persons are exempt from the accident and emergency charge, including medical card holders, women receiving services in respect of motherhood, children up to the age of six weeks and children referred for treatment from child health clinics and school health examinations. Also exempt from these charges in respect of treatment for the particular condition are children suffering from prescribed diseases, that is, mental handicap, mental illness, phenylketonuria, cystic fibrosis, spina bifida, hydrocephalus, haemophilia and cerebral palsy. Where exemptions do not apply, the charge may be waived if, in the opinion of the chief executive of the appropriate health board, payment would cause undue hardship.The drugs payment scheme significantly benefits families who regularly or occasionally are faced with large drug bills. No individual or family has to pay more than €65 per month for prescribed approved drugs and medicines. Any costs over €65 are paid by the State.The monthly threshold for the drugs payment scheme was increased from 1 August 2002. Although the threshold had not been increased since the scheme's introduction in July 1999, the cost of the scheme had risen by 73%, up from €51.34 million for the last six months of 1999 to €177.6 million for 2001. Approximately 1.15 million persons are now using the scheme as opposed to 699,867 in 1999. The Department of Health and Children considers it reasonable that the contribution by those benefiting from the scheme should reflect that high increase in spending. It has been estimated that the increase in the drugs payment scheme threshold will provide a saving of €7 million from August to December 2002.Where persons cannot without undue hardship arrange for the provision of medical services for themselves and their dependants they may be entitled to a medical card. Eligibility is a matter for the chief executive officer of the relevant health board to decide.The SRSV or small round structured virus is a virus that causes gastroenteritis. It is commonly referred to as the "winter vomiting bug" as it is most prominent at that time of year. In common with Ireland, some other European countries are experiencing outbreaks of the virus. This virus can easily spread through person to person contact. It can also be spread through the air, hence it is difficult to contain. Since the illness lasts about two days and is highly infectious the assessment of its prevalence changes constantly. Where outbreaks have occurred, hospitals have put full infection control measures in place in line with best practice guidelines. Hospitals have been co-operating and supporting each other to deliver both emergency and elective services during the recent outbreak.The national breast screening programme was established in 1998 with the aim of reducing mortality from breast cancer by 20% by screening women in the age group of 50 to 64 years of age. BreastCheck commenced screening in March 2000, with phase one of the programme covering the Eastern Regional Health Authority, Midland Health Board and the North Eastern Health Board areas. The decision to proceed on a phased basis is a reflection of the complexities involved in the screening process. It is essential that the programme is driven by international quality assurance criteria and best practice. To the end of August this year, almost 92,000 women had been called for screening and over 68,000 women had been screened, representing an uptake of 74%. BreastCheck is on target to complete phase one of the programme by December 2002.The commitment of the Minister and the Department of Health and Children to BreastCheck is evidenced by the significant funding which has been provided for the programme. This year additional funding of €1.5 million was provided to BreastCheck for the continued development of the programme, bringing the total allocation to date to €8.7 million. In addition, the Minister has allocated approximately €6 million for the construction of a new state of the art screening unit at St. Vincent's Hospital. Work is expected to commence shortly on this development.The Minister is fully committed to the development of quality services to achieve best health outcomes. In relation to the development of cancer services generally, this commitment can be seen in the level of funding provided. Since 1997, over €103 million has been invested in the development of services, well in excess of the £25 million initially envisaged in the cancer strategy. This investment has enabled the funding of 76 additional consultant posts in key areas such as medical oncology, radiology, palliative care, histopathology and haematology. This includes approval for nine new consultant posts with a special interest in breast disease.In recognition of the need to further develop cancer services, the national health strategy has identified the need for the preparation by the end of this year of a revised implementation plan for the national cancer strategy. The national cancer strategy 2003-2010 is currently being prepared by the national cancer forum in conjunction with the Department of Health and Children. The new strategy will set out the key areas to be targeted for the development of cancer services over the next seven years.The board of BreastCheck has submitted a business plan for the national expansion of BreastCheck. The total cost of the extension as calculated by BreastCheck is approximately €27 million, including capital costs of €13 million. The annual cost of the current programme is €8.7 million. The Department is in discussions with the executive of BreastCheck in relation to the expansion and especially the linkages with the existing symptomatic services. The Minister is committed to the national expansion of BreastCheck and a decision in relation to this issue will be considered in the context of the overall investment programme in cancer services for 2003.The health strategy provides a framework for the reform of the acute hospital system and for improved access for public patients. It includes a plan covering the action required to address the issue of waiting lists, particularly waiting times. The target set out in the strategy is that by the end of 2004 no public patient will wait longer than three months for treatment. The programme for Government clearly states that this Government is committed to treating persons within the targets for maximum waiting times as set out in the national health strategy. A sum of €43.8 million has been made available to health agencies in 2002 under the waiting list initiative to support waiting list procedures.A dedicated national treatment purchase fund has been established to target those waiting longest for treatment by purchasing treatments for public patients in private hospitals. The national treatment purchase fund expects to treat up to 1,900 patients this year. Taken together with the waiting list initiative and bed capacity funding, significant improvements in access to acute hospital care have been achieved this year.Considerable progress has been made in reducing waiting times for public patients. The total number of persons on public hospital waiting lists at 31 March 2002, the latest date for which figures have been published, was 25,105. The comparable figure for 31 March 2001 was 26,382. This represents a decrease of 5% on the comparable figure for March 2001. The total number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for treatment in the target specialties has decreased by 20% between December 2000 and March 2002.In the period March 2001 to March 2002 there has been a reduction of 62% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for cardiac surgery and a reduction of 67% in the number of children waiting more than six months for cardiac surgery. There has been a reduction of 34% in the number of adults waiting for more than 12 months for ENT procedures and a fall of 33% in the number of adults waiting more than 12 months for ophthalmology procedures in the period March 2001 to March 2002.Hospital waiting lists must be viewed in a context of a hospital system which discharged 920,000 in-patient and day cases in 2001. That represented an overall increase of 42,000 in the number of discharges or 5% over the figure for 2000. I take this opportunity to salute our hospitals and their staff on the productivity of the system, which is evident in these figures. Day case activity has increased by 10% from 324,000 day case discharges in 2000 to 359,000 day case discharges in 2001.There has been a rapid movement in the last few years towards day case work. A variety of routine and complex treatments, surgery and diagnostic tests can now be performed with the patient being admitted and discharged from hospital on the same day. The settings for day case work vary from traditional theatres to specially constructed day surgery units and treatment rooms. The ability to carry out day case procedures has increased the efficiency of the hospital system to the extent that half of all elective surgery is now done on a day case basis. Increased use of day case surgery will improve the efficiency of the hospital system, provide speedier access to services for the patient and reduce waiting times.The Department has set out to regularise and standardise the reporting of waiting lists. There are a number of definitional issues surrounding day case work that need to be addressed to allow consistent and comparative analysis throughout the hospital system. The Department will continue to work closely with health agencies on these issues and hopes to be in a position to publish data on day-care waiting lists and waiting times in the near future.The acute hospital system is under continuous pressure with regard to many aspects of service delivery. Despite these pressures, the system continues to achieve increased annual output. For example, the total number of persons treated last year in acute hospitals increased by almost 6% over 2000, and represents an extra 48,500 persons treated over last year. This is the biggest ever increase in hospital activity and represents an increase in activity of 17% over the last five years.Senators may be interested to know that there was a total of 920,000 discharges from acute hospitals last year. This equates to some 2,500 discharges per day for every single day of the year. Comparing the current numbers on hospital in-patient waiting lists to the total number of discharges shows that waiting lists represent less than 3% of all discharges. This will give Senators some idea of the scale of activity taking place in acute hospitals.I acknowledge the excellent work carried out by all staff in the acute hospital sector, which continues to cater for the increasing demand on its services. The knowledge and expertise of this dedicated workforce in the acute hospital system ensures the system continues to deliver the necessary services for those who need them.The health strategy is the blueprint for the development of the health services and, especially, the acute hospital system. I do not underestimate the extent of the task ahead, but I am confident that the Government has the necessary commitment to deliver a quality and equitable health system for all.

#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	188	While I also wish the Minister of State well, he will be hearing from me regularly. I am glad he ended his speech by congratulating those who work in the acute hospitals. Never has there been a greater throughput of activity within these hospitals. What is being done on a day-care basis is amazing, but that is not to say I agree totally with all that is being done in this respect. Many patients could do with the care and comfort of at least one night in a hospital bed, for example, when having a gall bladder removed. Unfortunately, more straightforward operations of this kind are now being done on a day-care basis.I do not agree with Senator Ryan's statement that the electorate was fooled prior to the last general election with regard to health service expenditure. I watched the Minister for Health and Children, accompanied by the new Secretary General of his Department, as they left the Government meeting in Ballymascanlon. They had presented the new health strategy, yet one could see quite clearly from their faces that the €12 billion sought would not be forthcoming. Anyone who really believed the strategy would be implemented was only fooling himself or herself, although it is a good strategy that should be implemented.In recent years, there has been an unparalleled level of expenditure on the health service. However, when one looks at health spending levels in other EU member states, we have come from a very low level. If we are not prepared to pay the taxes necessary to support the health service we say we want and the Government is not prepared to levy them, we can only expect what is happening now.What worries me most is the terrible loss of morale in the health service. I was glad to see that the Minister of State used the word "retain" because one of the biggest problems in the health sector is retaining staff. Despite the fact that there have been wage increases all around, we still have great difficulty in retaining nurses and now have to hire nursing staff from abroad. Worse still, we have a terrible problem in retaining staff during their final five years of service prior to retirement. The number of consultants and senior nurses opting for early retirement is alarming. Early retirement not only represents a loss of personnel but also a loss of expertise because it takes newly appointed staff some time to build up experience.I cannot say exactly how many who qualified from medical school with me have chosen to retire at 60 years of age rather than 65. Doctors are under appalling stress in this country, which has higher levels of litigation than anywhere else in the world. Medical personnel do not deserve this.I am a member of the board of the Rotunda Hospital and can say Irish midwifery services are second to none. Our maternal mortality rate is among the lowest in the world, even accounting for the fact that in recent years pregnant asylum seekers and refugees, who have had no ante-natal care, have given birth shortly after their arrival here.It costs €50,000 to insure a midwife working in a labour ward, yet what proportion of the health service's budget goes towards these major costs? I do not know what health boards have to pay to insure their personnel, but it amounts to a considerable sum. We must examine our compensation culture to see how much money is being taken out of the health service. Claims arising from medical treatment are causing great concern internationally.We should do more to ensure health service workers are not unnecessarily tired. We know that errors occur more frequently when staff become tired. Recently, I read a worrying report by a Ms Hilary Coates at the department of health and science at the Royal College of Surgeons. She extrapolated figures from American statistics in a survey that considered clinical errors which led to patients' deaths. Ms Coates's figures indicated there could be as many as 90 Irish patient deaths due to clinical errors, the vast majority of which were made when staff were working overlong hours. We know, for example, that mistakes can be made in prescribing drugs. I cannot say whether Ms Coates's figures are correct, but they are worrying. Perhaps the Department of Health and Children could look into the report. The surveys quoted from America were carried out in Colorado and Utah. The report stated there was a 2.9% occurrence of error due to treatment, 53% of which were said to be preventable.At the same time the 17 October issue of the New England Journal of Medicine has been addressing the issue of fatigue among clinicians and the safety of patients. I suggest to the Minister of State that this publication is well worth reading. Morale among hospital workers is low and needs to be addressed. It is not entirely the fault of the Department of Health and Children, but only the Department can ensure the position is improved upon.I do not know if the Department is aware of the fact that it is becoming impossible to replace general practitioners in the more deprived areas of our cities. It is proving impossible to get people to take jobs from general medical service lists. It has proved impossible, for example, to find a replacement for an excellent practice run by a husband and wife team in Ballyfermot. Something will have to be done to improve eligibility levels for patients in the general medical services scheme because many who are not really in a position to pay for health care are having to do so with difficulty.The expansion of the number of acute beds is an excellent development, but, unfortunately, people seem to gloss over the fact that while beds may be available, there are no staff to service them. This still presents a major problem. The fact there are new facilities does not mean they can be provided because it may not be possible to recruit the necessary staff.It is a pity there is not better co-ordination within the health service to move patients who should not be in acute beds to step-down facilities. I am aware that the Department is doing something about this, but every week one reads about patients who have spent months in hospital, when they really should not be there, because there are no step-down facilities available for them.The Minister of State devoted part of his speech to hospital accident and emergency services which have been abused by people who should have gone to their general practitioners instead. The planned one-stop-shops represent a very good idea. It will take quite an effort to promote them, however, because it has proved difficult to get them going in the United Kingdom. It may, therefore, take quite some time before we are in a position to see changes taking place due to their introduction.A dispute has been ongoing for years with the Department of Health and Children over the recognition of those eligible to be considered as chiropodists or podiatrists. That is to be resolved. I want to point out another area where the lack of these sorts of paramedical people makes such a dent in the finances. There is no foot clinic in St. James's Hospital but there is a huge diabetic clinic. The hospital has no chiropodist at present; someone comes in occasionally. Last year they had to admit 30 patients with foot ulcers. The average stay in hospital was 30 days. Eight lost their legs. They reckon it cost €1 million. Surely one could run a foot clinic for less than €1 million.A Leas-Chathaoirligh, you are indicating my time is up when I have many more issues to raise, but I will finish with two important points. The Minister wants to produce 29 new accident and emergency consultants. That is a very good idea, but before this comes to fruition some sort of agreement must be made with these consultants about staffing the place on longer than a nine-to-five basis.I strongly support all those who said something must be done about radiotherapy services. Recently I wrote to a constituent in Wexford about his wife, who has breast cancer and whom I had seen in the summer when she had chemotherapy. The reply I received thanked me for my remarks about the patient. He stated that she is doing well but we must surely get a radiotherapy unit in Waterford, and that trying to get into St. Luke's is a nightmare. He stated that she was hoping to commence radiotherapy two weeks previously, but he rang, the day before he wrote this letter to which I refer, to be told there were 22 people on the waiting list before her for this treatment, and that she will be at least another two weeks waiting. What difference is that making to her survival chances?It is all very well talking about setting up centres of excellence around the country, but it is only theoretical unless we actually put in place the physical units which are needed. There are two only and that really will not do.
#GeraldineFeeney	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-party	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-dob	unknown-#GeraldineFeeney-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	189	I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to the House.I want to share with my colleagues in the House two reports, People Living In Tallaght And Their Health and People Living In The Dublin Docklands And Their Health, which I have had an opportunity to read over the past couple of days. They have been prepared by the Adelaide Hospital Society and by the Department of Community Health and General Practice in Trinity College. The docklands, as the House will be aware, covers the regions of Pearse Street, Ringsend and Irishtown.I was so surprised at what I read. In the Tallaght report, there were 420 houses and 1,300 people surveyed. Of these, 49 households had one person on a waiting list and three households had two people on a waiting list. Of 699 people surveyed in the docklands report, 26 – the equivalent of about 3.7% – were on a waiting list and only two of those were on a waiting list for over 12 months. Therefore, I am not convinced, by what I have read in those excellent reports, that the magnitude of the waiting list would be as Senator Ryan stated and I would gladly allow him look at them.The Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, spoke about the primary care strategy and, like him, I welcome this strategy. I acknowledge the good work being done by the general practitioners, not only by those who practise today but by those who practised in years gone by at a time when there were few resources and they worked from early morning until late at night.Everybody here will remember the general practitioner living at the end of their road or around the corner who was a friend to one and all. However, the health environment is changing and moving at a pace where general practitioners are coming into a system that will find them working as part of a multi-disciplinary team. This was also pointed out by the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan.The primary care strategy will be a big challenge for us all. It will involve not alone commitment from the medics, but also commitment and involvement from all the local communities. Here we will see a wide range of services, all under one roof, being brought into the communities for the first time and away from a hospital setting. We will find routine minor surgery being carried out, together with services for the elderly. All of this is being brought nearer the patient in a one-stop approach. This, in my opinion, will prove very popular with patients as they will be familiar with staff and with their settings. In many cases, it will cut out a great deal of unnecessary travelling to the hospital in the next town.This also involves an economy of scale. Patients will make very good use of services that will be provided to them. The potential is limitless in providing these services for local people. I would hope it would expand to a point where we would see consultants like paediatricians and geriatricians coming from local hospitals. I would like to think that they would be allowed conduct out-patient clinics from the health centres.Recently I was interested to read evidence from an international study carried out by Professor Barbara Starfield from a teaching hospital in Baltimore. She stated that if you spend on primary care, you spend less on secondary care. As we all know how expensive hospital care is, that does not need any qualification.I welcome the conference in Galway over the next two days into the primary care strategy. Mr. Michael Kelly, the Secretary General of the Department of Health and Children, gave a very strong commitment on the primary care strategy stating, "It's the only show in town." The Government is positively committed to the primary care strategy and believes it must be rooted in the community. We must find out what the people want. They will not buy into change unless they are part of it. This can be achieved if we can bring the profession and the local community on board.A moment ago, I welcomed the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, and now I welcome a fellow Offaly man, the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House.

It is wrong to state that the Government's health strategy is a success. It has deteriorated since the general election.I live in a small town in the west of Ireland. Last Thursday I left the Seanad to drive home, like most Senators do. I went to an arts auction, 10% of the proceeds of which were donated to the Marie Keating Foundation. I then realised that there was no BreastCheck service in the west of Ireland. The auction was a great occasion. I was very impressed that this brilliant foundation was trying to provide the much needed service. The foundation has three fully-fitted mobile information awareness units, but surely this is a service which should be provided by the Department of Health and Children, not only in the North Eastern Health Board, the Midlands Health Board and the Eastern Regional Health Authority, but nationally. Irish women, especially those living in the west, are more likely to die of breast cancer than their counterparts in the east of Ireland or, indeed, in continental Europe.We were promised a comprehensive health strategy to end waiting lists. This promise lacks credibility. I acknowledge that the Government has tackled the problem. I was glad to hear last year that the number on the waiting lists fell from 31,000 to 26,000, but this is little consolation to someone who has been told he is No. 26,000 on the list.The Plunkett Home in Boyle looks after elderly people very successful. However, the town went without a physiotherapist for a full year because the Western Health Board could not recruit one who was willing to locate there. As a result, many hundreds of people went without primary care and physiotherapy.We have a two-tier health service. The poorest, who have the greatest need of health care, often get the worst deal. Morale in the health service is at an all-time low. The Government pumps millions of euro into the health service but this is merely throwing money at the problem. Preventative care and health awareness are vital, but in my town we do not even have a leisure centre. Surely leisure activity should be the responsibility of the health service and should not be left to the education and other services?Over-indulgence in alcohol and tobacco is creating a burden on the health service and these problems must be tackled. Last year we were told that 200 jobs must be cut in the Western Health Board. This is not the way to provide the care essential to a good health service. These staff cuts have affected the processing of medical cards and other essential services in the health service of which we are all part.
#MichaelPKitt	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-party	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-dob	unknown-#MichaelPKitt-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	191	I join in welcoming the Minister of State, Deputy Parlon, to the House. It is important to have the Minister of State with responsibility for the Office of Public Works in the House when we are discussing hospital building and development.I am glad extra funding has been provided for the health service this year. As the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, said, health is the biggest area of extra funding this year. The Western Health Board has been given 15% extra funding for 2002, or 20% if one includes the funding for the health board's takeover of Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe. There has been considerable development in Ballinasloe. When the Franciscan sisters decided two years ago to extend the hospital, the Government provided £6 million for that project. The Government has provided a further £11 million for the purchase of the hospital. Portiuncula Hospital will now be a public hospital and will not be sold into private hands, as many people feared. The decision to purchase the hospital in Ballinasloe was a good one. It will serve the western region and much of the midlands.The Western Health Board has also purchased the Bon Secours Hospital in Tuam and this hospital will remain in public ownership. The programme for the Tuam hospital campus has gone to Government in the last few weeks and I hope the Minister for Health will look favourably at the proposal to have a first class health campus, including a good community hospital and other services which are needed in the north Galway and south Roscommon area, in Tuam. I have a particular interest in this hospital because my brothers and sisters and I were born there, as were many of the people of north Galway.The issue of bed availability which was raised by the Minister of State, Deputy Lenihan, is important. The Minister of State mentioned the provision of 3,000 beds in the next ten years. We have a problem in Galway regarding step-down accommodation. In County Mayo, there are several small district hospitals but Galway, the biggest county in the west and the second biggest in Ireland, is in need of more step-down accommodation. Patients who are recovering from operations are not in a position to go home and need nursing care. Small community hospitals are ideal for this type of service.There are considerable problems in the maternity section of University College Hospital in Galway and there are similar problems in Ballinasloe. Many asylum seekers, who arrive in Ireland after horrific treatment in the countries they have left and traumatic journeys, see a doctor for the first time when they are about to give birth. Hospitals need extra resources to deal with this issue. I ask the Minister to look at the situation in Galway where there were 300 births to asylum seekers in the first nine months of this year. Extra funding is required for the maternity unit in Galway.I commend the community care service. As recently as five or six years ago home helps were paid a miserable £1 per hour. They are now paid €9 per hour. This is an important and welcome development. The general practitioner service gives excellent value for money, often in multi-disciplinary and multi-functional units. It is difficult to replace GPs or to provide temporary locum cover in many areas and this problem must be addressed. The community care service does excellent work and gives excellent value for money.Alcohol and drug abuse is a serious health issue. At a conference arranged by the Western Health Board which I attended last Friday, a speaker mentioned that only 6% of the population are teetotallers, the lowest ever figure in the history of the State. Reference was made to the fact that binge drinking is now the order of the day for young people. Smirnoff Ice and Bacardi Breezers are now available on draught and little concoctions, which are up to 45% proof, are added to drinks. Opening and closing times of public houses are not significant factors in the problem. Abuse of alcohol and binge drinking are dangers which must be highlighted. The Government must examine this problem, which will lead to serious health problems in the future.I am glad the Government's health strategy is sound. It is based on equity and fairness and is people-centred. In Galway, for the first time, we now have cancer, neurosurgery and other services. I hope the people of the west will have these services in their region and will not have to travel to Cork or Dublin, as they must do at present.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	192	I thank the Minister of State for coming to the House for this debate. I support the comments of my Labour Party colleagues and the Fine Gael Members. I remind Members of the Labour Party proposals which were ridiculed by members of the Government parties during the general election, but which are still relevant and vital.In light of cutbacks, increased charges and people dying on waiting lists, it is madness to put aside 1% of GNP for the pensions reserve fund. The Labour Party proposes that part of this money be invested in the delivery of health infrastructure now. This investment would benefit pensioners now and in the future because they would have a proper health service. It would also save money in the long term because, if investment in our health infrastructure is continually cut back and put off, the money to meet the burden of tackling the needs of the health service will have to come from the tax revenues of the future. This will be at a higher cost and make the pension reserve meaningless in terms of its future value.Crisis management measures such as the treatment purchase scheme do not solve the long-term problems in the health service and perpetuate inequality. The Labour Party proposed in its health policy radical reform of the structure of the health service to ensure efficiency and eliminate injustice. The top rate of tax was cut in the last budget, benefiting the well-off most. This was insisted on by the Government, in particular by the the Progressive Democrats, the party of the Minister for State, Deputy Parlon. It was immoral, especially so in the light of the Government's failure to fully address the needs of the health service. People have died and will die on waiting lists because of this type of immorality.
#EamonScanlon	unknown-#EamonScanlon-party	unknown-#EamonScanlon-dob	unknown-#EamonScanlon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	193	I welcome the Minister of State to the House. Before the last general election, if one was to believe the newspapers, one would have thought that every hospital in the country was closing down. As a member of the North Western Health Board, I wish to put some facts before the House on the improvements that have taken place in the health board with which I am most familiar.In 2001 the North Western Health Board received £283 million to run the service while in 2002 it received £322 million, an increase of £40 million in one health board area or €50 million. I recognise that there are waiting lists. However, if a person walks out of this House and is hit by a car, an ambulance will be at the scene in ten or 15 minutes. The person concerned will be taken to a hospital and looked after better than anywhere else in the world. While those with private insurance are receiving treatment, I admit that there are waiting lists.In my health board area in 2000, 1,004 were waiting for ear, nose and throat treatment, but by July 2002 this figure had been reduced to 243. Some 76 people were waiting for gynaecological treatment, but by July 2002 this figure was down to 17. For orthopaedic treatment, the figure was 211 in December 2000 while in July 2002 it was 116. The orthodontic service is a problem all over the country because health boards cannot get orthodontists to do the work as they are not available. Some 400 people were on waiting lists in December 2001 but this figure had been reduced to 150 in July 2002. The health board has just received €282,000 under the private purchase scheme and I am told that another 100 people will be treated this year under the scheme.Nine new consultants have been appointed in the last three years while one of the most modern oncology wards has been provided at Sligo General Hospital. I recently spoke to a man who suffers from cancer and is attending the ward, which has only been open for the past 12 months. Before that, he had to travel to Dublin to receive treatment which he can now have in Sligo. He is at home with his family and can continue to work, even though it is on a short-time basis. Two years ago this would not have been possible. It is a real improvement.There is a new day-surgery ward at Sligo General Hospital which, as Senator Henry said, is the way forward. While I accept that not every procedure can be carried out on one day, it has led to major improvements in waiting lists. Senator O'Meara said she was not happy with health boards taking beds in private nursing homes. My father is currently in one of those beds and I have not known him to receive anything but the best treatment. Anyone suffering from cancer should not have to wait because to have the disease is traumatic enough without that. The service should be improved as quickly as possible.
#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	194	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and compliment the Labour Party on tabling this important motion. Some of my colleagues on the far side of the House are not living in the real Ireland where there is much anger vented against Government politicians for the manner in which they have made reductions in health services. Since the Government took office it has reneged on pre-election promises not to introduce health cuts. Many health board bosses are concerned that they are being forced to sacrifice jobs in order to comply with demands from the Minister for Health and Children to make savings.The most vulnerable are being targeted, such as clerical and administrative workers whose contracts began less than 12 months ago in the run-up to the general election. In most cases, they have not acquired any employment rights. The Government is foolish to think that, at the stroke of a pen, it can take away 800 administrative jobs without an impact on services. Every health board worker is either providing a front-line service or fulfilling essential support functions. Patients will be affected because essential health care embraces a team approach.The loss of key personnel, such as ward clerks and secretaries, will have a serious effect on patients. The people concerned are a part of teams which get patients ready for surgery by ensuring charts and x-rays arrive in the operating theatre with the patient. Will this part of the team service no longer be available? Will nurses and junior hospital doctors be diverted from direct patient care to take on secretarial work? Will doctors and nurses have to look after clerical work in busy surgical wards in acute hospitals? They are under enough stress and cope with enough demands as it is.Earlier this year in the North Eastern Health Board area there were cases where elective surgery in the region had to be severely curtailed. I am amazed by the magic figures for waiting lists that my colleague Senator Glynn provided for counties Longford and Westmeath and wonder where he got them.

#JamesBannon	unknown-#JamesBannon-party	unknown-#JamesBannon-dob	unknown-#JamesBannon-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	196	Senator Glynn and I met a deputation which came to the House yesterday to meet the Minister for Health and Children with regard to getting extra consultants and shortening the waiting lists in the midlands.Many people due to have hip replacements have to wait longer. This has a consequent knock-on effect on those originally earmarked for surgery later this year. Despite what has been said by the Minister of State, waiting lists are lengthening in every health board region. Where does this leave the much hyped national health strategy document? Would the money and effort that went into it not have been better spent on continuing to employ essential staff? Not in the Government's view, but it is the opinion of many that this much hyped document was only part one of the famous Fianna Fáil manifesto.The electorate has been completely betrayed by the Government. Following the general election in May, shortly after being reappointed Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin approved an 18% increase in VHI charges effective from 1 September 2002, the largest rise in the history of the State which puts an extra €65 annually to the cost of a plan B scheme. The Minister then announced an increase in charges for patients attending accident and emergency units without a doctor's letter, and changes in the drug refund scheme. Research funding was withheld or curtailed for new trainees in important areas of the health service. In recent weeks – though only when he was caught out – the Minister withdrew a circular covering payments to some parents of disabled children. I am particularly concerned that orthopaedic vascular surgery and older people's services will be prime targets for the next round of cuts.The people are very angry, and rightly so. They were lied to in the run-up to the general election when Ministers denied health cuts were being planned. The Government must rethink its cuts strategy or the health service will be in a shambles. Service plans in most health boards have been snookered by the Government. Cuts will affect services and the most vulnerable will suffer.I call on the Minister, Deputy Martin, to re-examine his party's election manifesto and to take responsibility for a policy that is bound to damage health services throughout the country. His Government's approach flies in the face of its pre-election promises and the national health strategy. Senator Glynn referred to services and infrastructure in the Mullingar area. A building constructed over seven years ago has not yet been fitted out.

#MauriceCummins	unknown-#MauriceCummins-party	unknown-#MauriceCummins-dob	unknown-#MauriceCummins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	203	The Minister of State was not in the House when Senator Henry read a letter sent to her from a patient in County Wexford who needs radiotherapy treatment. The woman in question was told that she would have to wait 22 weeks to be seen at St. Luke's Hospital. I am from Waterford, the capital of the south east region which has a population of over 450,000. Seriously ill people in any region should not have to wait 22 weeks for radiotherapy, especially as national best practice guidelines recommend that such treatment should be given within ten weeks of an operation, as to do otherwise would diminish its effects. This Government is presiding over a health service that cannot meet national guidelines.Before this year's election, all three Fianna Fáil candidates in Waterford gave an undertaking that Waterford Regional Hospital would have a radiotherapy unit within three years. If that is to happen, however, building work would have to start in the first quarter of 2003. I sincerely hope that this election promise will be met. The Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, is hiding behind the promised publication of a consultants' report. We were told over 12 months ago that the report was imminent, but we have yet to see it.The Labour Party's motion refers to increases in medical charges which were not flagged prior to the election. The need to extend the BreastCheck programme, at a cost of €27 million over four years, is also mentioned in the motion and I hope it will become a Government priority. The report of an expert group in this area has been received and I hope it will be acted upon as the BreastCheck programme has been proven to save lives. People will not accept "No" as an answer in this instance. The motion also refers to the election promise to end hospital waiting lists within two years, which has been omitted from the programme for Government. The Government seems to be rich on promises, but slow to deliver. Eligibility limits for medical cards have not been increased for many years. I call on the Minister to rectify the matter in the forthcoming budget as people on low incomes, many of whom are hardship cases, are ineligible. Many parents deprive themselves to be able to afford to bring their children to a doctor for much needed care. I could mention many other inequities in our health service.Many speakers complimented the dedicated staff of hospitals and I would also like to mention the tremendous work done by nurses and doctors under difficult circumstances. I could speak about the inadequacies in the health service for a long time. I have mentioned some of them, but cancer care, particularly radiotherapy treatment, is the area the Government will have to prioritise. The Government has to deliver the regionalisation of radiotherapy services and I urge the Minister of State to bring my message to the Minister, Deputy Martin.The Minister for Health and Children has finally agreed to meet a deputation from Waterford City Council in November to discuss the radiotherapy issue, after initially refusing on the ground that he could not find time for weeks or months. Elected representatives from Waterford had to threaten to picket this House before they were granted a meeting to discuss this important issue. This a matter of great concern not only in the south east, but in every other part of Ireland that does not have radiotherapy facilities.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	204	There are two approaches I could take in response to this debate. If I were to attempt to respond to the arguments from the Government side, I would have to conclude immediately as I heard nothing that I did not know already. The Government Senators seem to have become clones of the Minister, Deputy Martin, as they spout statistics in large amounts. Anyone who has followed the health service debate in the last two years is already familiar with the statistics we have heard tonight because Deputy Martin has a button on the back of his head which he presses to make them come out.We are tired of the statistics as the real issue to be discussed is where the money is going. If so much money has been spent, why have we not seen improvements? In fairness, the Minister for Finance keeps asking this question. The first answer I would suggest is that the service is not improving because we are trying to run a health service on the cheap. Civilised countries spend 10% of GDP on their health services, but we only spend 7.8% of GNP. As our GDP is higher than our GNP, we are spending 40% less than should be the case. Let us remember that Ireland is not the béal bocht country of 50 years ago; it is the third richest country in the world and liable to become the second richest at current projected growth rates. This country has a bad health service because a political decision was taken to keep our health service bad while other priorities took over in the last five years. The first of these decisions was to have an orgy of tax cuts for those who did not need them, like myself.

#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	206	Nobody in the last Government was capable of thinking in new terms. The Labour Party suggested that the country should follow the French health service model, which is the most successful in the world. The Government decided to build on our system, which was not working, so now we have a larger system that still does not work.Fundamentally, we can afford the resources needed by the health service. Senator Tuffy spoke of the illogical idiocy of borrowing money to place it in a pension fund where its value is reducing. Special savings accounts are taking between €500 million and €600 million from the State coffers each year. I will not mention the other sources of revenue that could have been used, but which are being wasted elsewhere. This country does not have a financial crisis, it has a political crisis caused by a Government transfixed by its own obsession with cutting tax. It does not know what to do as it has never thought about what will happen. Its fundamental strategy is challenged and it is now running around bewildered.The model is there, all over much maligned Europe – I am reminded of the Tánaiste's famous reference to Boston and Berlin. It exists in Germany, the Netherlands, Scandinavia and France; they all have decent health services. Only rich Ireland, richer than any of them, thinks it cannot afford to give its people a decent health service. The fundamental problem is that the Government is convinced that we cannot afford to do it. As a person of the European social democratic tradition, I know that we can do it, but the lack of political will is the problem.I cannot finish without pointing out the gobbledygook thrown out by the Department of Health and Children. The Minister stated, concerning the drugs payment scheme, that "the cost of the scheme had risen by 73%, up from €51.34 million for the last six months of 1999 to €177.6 million for 2001." It is a wonderful trick in statistical manipulation to quote the expenditure for half a year and then compare it to the expenditure for a whole year, bedazzling people with figures. It represents a 70% increase year on year.For the Department of Health and Children, the scandal is that 1.15 million people used the scheme instead of roughly 700,000 in 1999. The way this is written one would think there was something wrong with this. An otherwise very intelligent man, the Minister of State stated the Department "considers it reasonable that the contribution by those benefiting from the scheme should reflect that high increase in spending." Why? Why should the fact that it costs more mean that people should pay more for it, given that most of the increase in spending is caused by the fact that more people are using it? Why are more people using it? Because the number entitled to medical cards has been reduced by 30% in five years. The Department penalises the people concerned for being sick.

I declare an interest in this issue. The Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society always have a few members of long standing on what are called their Irish advisory committees. I am currently on the Irish advisory committee of the Medical Defence Union.It is said the benches of this House and the Dáil are very sparsely populated. The last time we debated the role of the Seanad I pointed out that many of us are in our offices watching events unfold in the Houses, which is how the matter I am raising came to my attention. Naturally, I keep a close eye on the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin. Last week, I watched him reply to questions tabled by Deputy Coveney and Deputy Olivia Mitchell concerning the main indemnity bodies operating here. These are the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society, St. Paul having recently pulled out of medical indemnity worldwide and Medisec, of which Deputy Glennon is a founder and, I believe, chief executive, mainly providing cover for general practitioners.The huge awards made here against obstetricians have led to a significant increase in subscriptions for medical indemnity. Between 1985 and 2000 annual increases averaged 26%. Early this year an award of €4 million was made in a case of medical indemnity taken against an obstetrician and even in a case which was won the cost in legal fees amounted to some €350,000. This is a very expensive business, particularly for the Department of Health and Children, which pays between 80% and 90% of the fees incurred by obstetricians who are public employees. Private obstetricians must pay their own fees.The Department has been trying to introduce enterprise liability, whereby the State will cover all the indemnity of the hospitals, including that of junior doctors and consultants. However, consultation is still ongoing, particularly with regard to hospital consultants. Last year a deal was done with the Medical Protection Society to hold the subscription for obstetricians at a certain level, amounting to about a sixth of the level the Medical Defence Union proposed to charge. A request under the Freedom of Information Act found that the Department was subsidising the Medical Protection Society, a practice which has been queried by the Medical Defence Union before the European Commission on the grounds that it breaches competition laws.While this is not a major concern of mine, I was concerned by the Minister's reply to Deputy Olivia Mitchell in which he stated that one of the main reasons the Department ended negotiations with the Medical Defence Union was that the organisation concentrated on the issue of historic liabilities. The Department should have concentrated more on the issue of historic liabilities because, as the Minister admitted, these are considerable. It is important to note that only about 20% of general medical claims occur after six years, whereas about 40% of obstetrics claims occur after six years. Frequently, these claims are made by young adults. The costs of such claims are currently paid by the Department through the reimbursement of subscriptions to the various medical protection societies.The Minister gave us to understand that he hopes enterprise liability will be introduced by the end of the year. He still has not settled the question of what will happen with regard to historic liabilities. He established a fund with the Medical Protection Society which will be reimbursed to the Exchequer if there are no claims by public patients by the end of a given year. No decision has been taken regarding the fund he established for private obstetricians, a generous move on his part as it avoided about 30 people being left without cover and the need for private hospitals, such as Mount Carmel and the Bon Secours, to stop undertaking obstetric work. Has the Minister not left the taxpayer in a very serious, open-ended position regarding historic liabilities, which, as he stated, can be considerable?The current position is that neither protection society will have to take account of these historic liabilities once enterprise liability becomes effective because no agreement has been made between the Minister and either society. It, therefore, will be at their discretion to take up the historic liabilities. Given that they are funded from subscriptions from doctors, it is impossible that other doctors would be able to cover from their much smaller fees the very large obstetric claims which arise. I am at a loss to understand how the Minister proposes to cover these liabilities without resorting to Exchequer funds and why the Department of Finance has not been informed of this surprise.I am very disappointed the Minister has not addressed a problem associated with obstetrics, namely, the recurrence of cerebral palsy. I am glad the Minister of State at the Department of Health and Children, Deputy Brian Lenihan, is here because the area of children is his responsibility. Difficulties are raised by the fact that a small number of people here can show that obstetric liability is the cause of cerebral palsy in their cases and thereby receive funds to try to improve the life of their children, whereas many families are unable to do so and are, therefore, not in a position to receive financial help. We should promote the idea that the State should provide sufficient assistance to these people. It does not have to be a massive amount, merely sufficient to meet their ongoing needs. While some people receive huge claims, such as in the case to which I referred earlier, others receive nothing.As the Minister of State will not be in a position to address this important issue now, I ask that he places it at the top of his agenda. We know that those in lower socio-economic groups have lower birth rates and are much more likely to have children with cerebral palsy. This means that those most in need are frequently those who receive nothing.

I will have to trespass on your patience, a Chathaoirligh, as this is a somewhat complex and technical matter. One of the great difficulties which arises when litigation is resorted to is how to assist those who have a very great need. Some people are able to obtain substantial, generous compensation which goes a long way towards assisting them with their needs, while others receive nothing at all due to the vagaries of liability in a very indeterminate area.It is also the case that were the child unfortunately to die, the compensation moneys would pass on by succession or inheritance to the next of kin, whereas it would be much more desirable in such an instance that there would be a central fund. As the Senator will be aware, the Government is addressing many of the issues related to insurance.To explain how the issue of what are termed "historic liabilities" has arisen, I need to outline in greater detail how hospital consultants provide themselves with professional indemnity cover at present. Hospital consultants are obliged by their contracts to keep themselves indemnified against the cost of malpractice claims that may be made against them. They provide themselves with this cover through membership of one of the two mutual defence bodies that operate in Ireland. These are the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society. Both bodies are based in the United Kingdom.The Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society are not insurance companies and are, therefore, not subject to regulation under insurance legislation in either the United Kingdom or Ireland. Since April last year the Medical Defence Union has effectively become an insurance intermediary and offers its members in Ireland an insurance policy underwritten by the Zurich Insurance Company, trading here as Eagle Star. However, this policy does not cover obstetric risks. The bulk of the cost of the subscriptions paid by consultants employed in the public health service is reimbursed to them by their employers and borne, ultimately, by the Exchequer.The particular form of cover offered by the defence bodies has left them vulnerable to sudden or unexpected increases in the cost of settling claims, especially in circumstances where claims arise from events in the past when subscription levels were much lower. In the absence of regulation by the insurance authorities the defence organisations had a particular obligation to ensure they were prudent in their reserving policies and that they charged their members subscriptions sufficient to meet those members' liabilities. When the clinical indemnity scheme is extended to cover consultants, the subscriptions the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society charge should fall as they will in future only be liable for those aspects of their members' practices not covered by the scheme and the non-indemnity benefits they also provide. The arrangement whereby consultants are reimbursed the bulk of the cost of their subscriptions will also cease when they come into the scheme.These changes will obviously have an impact on the cash flow of the Medical Defence Union and the Medical Protection Society, but they will also mean these bodies will no longer be responsible for the greater part of the risks attached to their members' practices. If the defence bodies have conducted their affairs in a prudent and responsible fashion, there is no reason they should not be in a position to meet the liabilities for which they have accepted subscriptions in the past. Irish doctors have always paid the subscriptions requested of them and our public hospitals reimbursed to the consultants the amounts they were obliged to pay under the consultants' contracts. It is a matter for the managers of the defence bodies if they have not accurately costed their liabilities or failed to set the correct level of subscriptions to meet them. To suggest that the Exchequer and taxpayers should take on these liabilities makes no sense and cannot be justified on any reasonable ground.Only one of the defence bodies, the Medical Defence Union, is suggesting that this is a problem, but its recently published annual report and accounts for 2001 do not highlight it. The notes to the accounts suggest that liabilities not backed by assets in the balance sheet are backed by reinsurance arrangements and access to capital. If this is the case, there is no reason to suggest that taxpayers should take on liabilities properly accounted for.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	219	I welcome the Minister of State to the House and bring forward this matter in the light of a letter I received recently from the Letterkenny and District Trade Union Council which seeks to have the Redundancy Payments Act amended immediately to provide in cases of redundancy for a minimum of three weeks' pay per year of service without reference to age. The legislation currently provides for half a week's pay per year of service for those under 41 years of age and a full week's pay per year of service thereafter.I refer to this matter in the light of what has happened in County Donegal, but without wishing to pre-empt doomsday. We have lost many factory jobs in recent years, an example of which is the closure of Fruit of the Loom at Inishowen, Milford and Raphoe. Given the economic climate further redundancies may be imminent. The payments currently provided for are not acceptable and the people to whom I have spoken who have been made redundant agree that they are insufficient given present circumstances.I have already mentioned to the House the fact that the IDA still targets large factories for County Donegal. However, we do not have the infrastructure to accommodate them. There are no provisions to implement infrastructural improvements and no funding available for large-scale road projects or broadband connectivity. To take employment seriously in Donegal – the county with the highest rate of unemployment as all political parties attest – we must reconsider our approach. The IDA and the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment must seriously look at finding the best way forward to achieve job sustainability. It has been proven that large-scale factories do not work in County Donegal. I have already proposed that we examine the promotion of indigenous industry to harness and foster local job creation. If we do this, we will avoid having to speak constantly of redundancy payments and job losses, as is the case at the moment.Tonight in this Chamber I reiterate the demand of Letterkenny and District Trade Union Council for a change in the legislation because in the current economic climate its insufficient provisions constitute an embarrassment to those who have put in years of service. They are entitled to compensation.
#FrankFahey	unknown-#FrankFahey-party	unknown-#FrankFahey-dob	unknown-#FrankFahey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	220	I congratulate the Cathaoirleach on his appointment to his prestigious post and wish him well. I have no doubt that he will do extremely well given his long and great career. He is following the steps of great Limerick politicians. I welcome Senator McHugh as a new Member and thank him for tabling this motion.The Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment carried out an internal review of the redundancy payments scheme earlier this year. With an almost 50% increase in the number of redundancy claims during 2001 compared to 2000, the Department reviewed the operation of redundancy legislation and scheme from an administrative efficiency perspective as well as from a customer service aspect. The purpose of this internal review was to examine the rationale and continued relevance of the scheme, discover whether its delivery could be made more customer-friendly, find out if greater use of information technology could be made and suggest ways in which the operation of the scheme could be streamlined.The review was completed in April 2002. It developed a vision of an improved statutory redundancy scheme which would involve appropriate, yet affordable, payments to redundant workers to meet the original principles, be simple to understand and involve administrative arrangements to maximise the use of e-government to deliver the scheme quickly and efficiently. As the review was nearing completion, the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, in the face of certain cases where only statutory redundancy was paid to employees, initiated a campaign to have the benefits provided for under the scheme substantially increased.In April 2002 the Government established a review group in the context of social partnership to examine the operation of the scheme to ensure it best meets the requirements of employers and employees. The group consisted of representatives of the social partners, including IBEC, the CIF, the ICTU, the Departments of the Taoiseach, Finance, Social and Family Affairs, and Enterprise, Trade and Employment, which provided its chair and secretariat. The terms of reference of the review group included a review of the operation of the scheme, which is funded from the social insurance fund and operates on the basis of the Redundancy Payments Acts 1967 to 2001. It was also asked to identify the legislative, administrative and systemic requirements of a more effective, efficient and simple customer-service driven scheme adapted to an e-government environment. The group was further required to examine the benefit of developing options for Government and social partner consideration and report to the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment within four months with recommendations and costings of the various proposals.The Redundancy Review Group commenced its work in April 2002 and the Government considered the report last week. The report has now been published. The conclusions of the group are that agreement has been reached in a wide range of policy and administrative issues which will contribute to the efficiency and effectiveness of the operation of the scheme.Policy issues that were agreed include the treatment of older workers, the insurability requirement, a ceiling on wages, qualification period, determination of weekly pay, non-reckonable service, employees working abroad, fines and penalties and the link between redundancy and training.Administrative issues that were agreed include the rounding of years of service, forms used in the administration of the scheme and the need for a new computer system. To give effect to these efficiency measures the Government has agreed to prepare legislation that will reflect the conclusions of the Redundancy Review Group and other minor changes in redundancy legislation and to proceed with planning a new IT system, which will implement the legislative changes proposed by the review group and make the delivery of the redundancy scheme more efficient by maximising the use of e-government.Agreement could not be reached within the group on a range of improvements in the level of benefits payable under the scheme. The ICTU has reactivated its campaign for improved benefits and will vigorously push for this in the next round of social partnership discussions.The Redundancy Review Group agreed that customer service and administrative efficiency should result from an e-government approach to service delivery. This will require building such an approach into the proposed legislation and supporting IT. The measures identified by the Redundancy Review Group are an integrated package, requiring that legislation and associated IT delivery systems should be developed in an integrated manner to deliver efficiencies.On foot of the work of the Redundancy Review Group, costings have been developed and shared with the social partners and relevant Departments on the full range of policy and benefit options. As a result informed analysis and costings are now available to Government and the social partners in the context of post-PPF negotiations. The Government hopes that the analysis developed by the Redundancy Review Group will facilitate agreement in the post-PPF negotiations on the level of statutory redundancy payments.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2002-10-23 00:00:00	Prelude	222	I am pleased the Minister of State is here. Coming from Wexford I am sure he is aware of the effects of tidal flooding in that location. There seems to be a constant problem of flooding in Foynes. The council has tried to alleviate some of the flooding in the upper part of Foynes in Colgrigg in recent times, a problem which will probably be resolved in time to come.I am greatly concerned about tidal flooding. I grew up in Foynes where there was an embankment which acted as a protective mechanism if there was tidal flooding. With industrial progress the embankment was removed and many people in Foynes regret that. I remember in my younger days coming down the stairs in my home to find that the tide had overflowed and the water has risen to the level of two flights of the stairs. Since then our house and many others on the main street have been flooded. They were flooded once again last February.Following a flood, there is usually a ritual of politicians and others saying that something will have to be done. There were high tides again in October. The concern among the community about flooding is remarkable. They live in great anxiety when high tides are anticipated. They are afraid of weather conditions. I have seen at first hand the havoc caused by flooding in houses and premises in Foynes. Many people cannot get insurance because the insurance industry will not tolerate claims for flood damage on a continual basis.The Shannon Foynes Port Company, previously the Foynes Harbour Board, which operates in this area probably has a difficulty in regard to finances, if what I believe is true. A sum of money was allocated to Ringsend recently to resolve the flooding difficulty there which is related to the tides in Dublin Bay.While Shannon Foynes Port Company and the other port companies are expected to operate as autonomous units, I raise this matter with the Minister for Communications, the Marine and Natural Resources because he has overarching responsibility for this area. I hope sufficient funding will be allocated to provide a tidal barrier in Foynes.A port company exists with the co-operation of the community. The community in Foynes has been tolerant in other respects over the years. It has put up with a good deal of disturbance, heavy trucks parked outside houses and premises and the dust and other problems associated with the transport of products from a shipping port. These problems will probably be resolved in the near future to some degree as there is a new access road in Foynes.I raised this matter on 22 July with the local council, recognising that Limerick County Council would not have a role in this matter. I met members of the board of works recently who investigated the drains in Foynes and indicated that they possibly would not have a role in this matter. This problem is the responsibility of Shannon Foynes Port Company. As a result of raising it on the Adjournment, I hope that something tangible will be done to ease the concerns of the community about this problem in Foynes. I look forward to the Minister of State's reply.

All State port companies are established under the Harbours Acts, 1996-2000, the statutory basis for their formation. Shannon Foynes Ports Company was formed in September 2000 following an amalgamation of the Shannon Estuary Ports Company and Foynes Port Company and operates as a commercial State port company under the Harbours Acts. The port company is statutorily responsible for the management, control, operation and development of the harbour as a commercial State port company.Shannon Foynes Port Company must operate under a rigorous commercial mandate. The Minister is precluded from interfering in the day to day business of the port company, nor would it be appropriate for him to do so. The relationship between the Minister and the port companies is that of a shareholder with an independent board reporting to him in terms of corporate governance and effective use and management of State port assets.My Department has sought a report from Shannon Foynes Port Company on the issue raised by the Senator. The position as advised by the port company is as follows. It is the view of the company's professional technical service that the recent flooding incidents are not the responsibility of the port company, nor is it the responsibility of the port company to introduce mitigation measures. However, the port company has entered into discussion with the local authority concerning the surface water drainage system and these discussions are ongoing. I have been advised that in the interest of good community relations, the port company has met with representatives of the local residents' committee.The cause of the flooding, which has adversely affected Foynes village and is a source of great concern to residents and local business interests, has not been fully identified. Neither my Department nor the port company has a function in the matter, nor has the Department any funding available to assist. However, we will urge the port company to continue to assist the local authority in whatever way possible to identify the precise cause of the flooding.I have asked Shannon Foynes Port Company to keep me and the Department advised as to developments. I would also welcome any information Senator Finucane has from his local knowledge or from representations that may have been made to him in the matter, which I would be pleased to make available to the port company.I am very well aware of the flooding problems that exist in counties from time to time. We have had many problems in Wexford, particularly in my town of Enniscorthy. On every occasion that we received compensation it came from the Department of the Environment and Local Government. We will continue to assist in whatever way we can in that matter, but there seems to be some doubt as to where the flooding is being caused. We will keep the Senator informed as developments arise.

I am afraid the port company is doing a Pontius Pilate act on this issue. I will take this up with the local authority again – I intend to get to the bottom of this matter. It appears to me that the Shannon Foynes Port Company has a responsibility. It is a tidal problem.
