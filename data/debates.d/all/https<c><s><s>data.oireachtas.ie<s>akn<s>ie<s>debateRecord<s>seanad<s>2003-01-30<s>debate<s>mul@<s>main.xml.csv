#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	1	I move: "That the report be laid before the Seanad."These are formal proceedings and the general principle of the Bill, as in the case of a public Bill, will be discussed on Second Stage. The report, a copy of the Bill and an explanatory memorandum on the Bill were circulated to each Member and copies are available in the Seanad office. The report is simply the decision of the Examiner that the Standing Orders relative to Private Bills has been complied with and that the Bill is a Private Bill. The next Stage will be Second Stage which must be taken first in the Seanad.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	2	In accordance with Standing Order 62, leave is given to proceed with the Bill which is now deemed to be read for the first time in the Seanad.

#MichaelFinucane	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-party	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-dob	unknown-#MichaelFinucane-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	4	I welcome the fact that the two people from Limerick were returned safely. When I heard that news I felt that sanity was at last beginning to prevail but this was tarnished again by the murder of another person in the Limerick area. In recent times Chief Superintendent Kelly gave an excellent interview in which he outlined the difficulties which the Garda are experiencing in the Limerick area with regard to about eight or nine families. He also spoke about the difficulties regarding the deployment of Garda resources in the area. These resources have been diminished due to many members of the force having to attend various cases in the Dublin area.I refer the Leader to a statement made by one of the Garda representative organisations that there was a lack of resources in the Limerick area. With all due respect to the offer of the Minister of State, Deputy O'Dea, to mediate with the families, I believe much more than that is necessary. Owing to the urgency of the situation I ask the Leader if it is possible for the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to come to the House, not to make statements but to answer questions with regard to the situation in the Limerick area. If there is a critical problem with resources, will he deploy the necessary extra resources in order to effectively deal with this situation which is damaging the image of Limerick, creating mayhem and causing murders in the area? I ask that the Minister come to the House early next week. Acres of media space are being devoted to this issue and it is imperative that it be discussed in this House.
#JoeOToole	unknown-#JoeOToole-party	unknown-#JoeOToole-dob	unknown-#JoeOToole-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	5	I support that request. I raised this issue before Christmas after the murder of Brian Fitzgerald. This problem is spreading and it is writ large in Limerick at the moment. There is a crime problem that needs to be addressed. Our discussion should focus on Limerick if necessary but it is a wider issue. We need to know that the Garda have a handle on it in the future.We have discussed and passed legislation in this House last year on the question of competition. That legislation is fine but it is not working. I believe the reason is lack of resources in the Competition Authority. There are only three detective gardaí assigned to the work of the Competition Authority. The authority should have the same resources as CAB. Cartels are driving up prices, fuelling inflation and hurting the country at all levels. Part of the farmers' problem is the food chain and there has not been proper investigation of where the cartels are increasing prices. There are cartels feeding into agriculture and there are cartels coming out the other end and the farming community is in the middle. We are not considering a broad enough picture.I ask that the appropriate Minister – I believe it to be the Tánaiste and Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Employment, Deputy Harney, who has expressed firm views on this matter – explain to us why we should not put more resources into the operation of the Competition Authority. That body certainly needs additional investigative strength because this is now a criminal issue and the burden of proof is beyond reasonable doubt. It is a criminal activity to which criminal penalties attach. With inflation rising in any event and with the impact this will have on people's lives and on the economy, I ask that we have a debate on the issue.
#BrendanRyan	unknown-#BrendanRyan-party	unknown-#BrendanRyan-dob	unknown-#BrendanRyan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	6	There is a need for a serious reflection on crime in our society. The two manifestations of crime of which most people are aware are, first, the appalling incidence of armed crime and related murders and, second, the endemic public order problems we seem to have, at least on weekend nights, in most major cities and towns. There is a need for a fundamental debate. I welcome the attempt by the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform to initiate a debate about alcohol in respect of this area. He is to be commended for initiating such a worthwhile debate.Senator Ross made a request yesterday for a debate on the partnership agreement. In characteristic fashion, he blamed all the problems Ireland is experiencing on the public sector unions. The part of the public sector – the third level education sector – in which I work not only embraced technological change but demanded it. Members of the NUJ were still insisting on using typewriters, when my colleagues and members of my union were demanding access to modern information technology and when everybody else had consigned typewriters to history. The idea that a member of the private sector NUJ would give lectures to the public sector in Ireland about change and modernisation is flying in the face of reality. The Internet was invented in the public sector, it was developed in the public sector and it became a tool of the public sector when the troglodytes of the NUJ still thought that typewriters were the way to type up copy.
#JoeMcHugh	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-party	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-dob	unknown-#JoeMcHugh-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	7	I concur with the sentiments expressed by Senators Finucane and Ryan on crime. We have an opportunity to bring the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform before the House, not just for the purpose of his making a statement on the matter but to allow Members the opportunity to engage in a constructive debate.We should not take our eye off the ball in looking at crime on an all-island basis. Legislation will be coming before this House regarding the PSNI and the Garda Síochána and we should look at crime on an all-island basis in good time prior to the introduction of legislative changes. It is opportune and imperative that the Minister come before the House for a debate on the matter.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	8	I have to dissociate myself from any attacks on the National Union of Journalists, of which I am, after all, a member. It is unfortunate that these attacks were made when the person specified was not present.I fully support benchmarking and, at least privately, so does every Member of the House. As public representatives, we work very hard. We were seriously underpaid for many years. I am glad that this report, which covers everybody, has gone through. I know that payments will be staged so that they will not cause financial embarrassment for Government in what are difficult times. That is appropriate.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	9	Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	10	Yes, I have two. First, I would like her to arrange a debate today on Iraq. I wish again to formally propose that we take the item – it was No. 13, motion 23, on yesterday's Order Paper – on the question of the Shannon stopover. I do this because there is an added urgency to dealing with the matter.The reason I was not present at the very beginning of business is that I was listening to "The Marian Finucane Show". This morning's show was one of the most unbalanced programmes I have heard in a long period and I was very surprised, particularly as Ms Finucane is such an excellent broadcaster. She had on her programme a not terribly articulate woman from the peace camp who was ambushed by a range of people, including a representative of the Independent Group – we know what that individual feels about American investment and how one should toady to the Yanks – and a shrill academic.

#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	12	I am moving an amendment that we take item 11, motion 22, first and I am providing the reasons for doing so.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	13	The Senator can provide those reasons when the matter is debated.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	14	It is particularly important that we have this debate. I am giving the reasons I want to have to be held today. The academic to whom I refer went unchallenged in questioning Irish neutrality—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	15	The Senator need not give the reasons, he should just move the amendment.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	16	—and saying that the Government has effectively lied about the state of neutrality in this country.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	17	Senator Norris is proposing that item 11, motion 22, be taken.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	18	I beg the Cathaoirleach's pardon, I did not make myself clear. I proceeded to give the reasons the matter should be debated.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	19	We do not want the reasons.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	20	The Cathaoirleach may not want the reasons, but I want to supply them.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	21	We do not want the reasons to be outlined on the Order of Business.
#DavidNorris	unknown-#DavidNorris-party	unknown-#DavidNorris-dob	unknown-#DavidNorris-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	22	The second matter is that I want to support colleagues who have spoken about the necessity for a major debate on crime. The question of drunkenness, misbehaviour and violent death arising from alcohol abuse is one I have raised on many occasions in the House. There is a more serious situation at present and I regret very much that it affects a small area of the beautiful and vital city of Limerick. What we need to look for is decommissioning of these arms and an incisive investigation of the relationship between drugs and guns and also the crossover of republican paramilitaries into this area. I said a long time ago that I strongly believe we are in danger of allowing the creation of a Mafia by virtue of the fact that members of the republican movement have crossed over from politics into violent crime.
#LabhrasOMurchu	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-party	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-dob	unknown-#LabhrasOMurchu-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	23	I support Senator Norris regarding a debate on Iraq. I genuinely feel that we need to discuss this matter at an early date because I also heard the programme to which he referred and I was absolutely shocked at how unbalanced it was. I was so angry I almost had to pull the car in off the road. I could not believe what I was listening to on the radio.One of the reasons this is happening is because we are not providing leadership. There are many issues to be discussed which are coming forward on a daily basis. It is not a matter of being pro-America or anti-America, it is a matter of taking a moral stand as a country which has suffered so much itself in the past. I fully support what Senator Norris has said this morning.
#KathleenOMeara	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-party	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-dob	unknown-#KathleenOMeara-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	24	I also support the call for an early debate on Iraq and, in particular, Ireland's position on the unfolding and frightening situation in the Middle East. I hope it does not come down to a question of whether we are pro or anti-American. It should not come down to that, it should come down to an issue of how Ireland, as a sovereign state, behaves in terms of its foreign policy and the view it takes on this particular issue.I ask the Leader to ask the Minister for Transport to clarify as soon as possible the position regarding the strategic rail review. At least one Cabinet Minister has been making statements in his own constituency with regard to the future of a railway line which has been a matter of major concern in this House. I ask the Leader to inform us when the report of the strategic rail review will be circulated and request a debate on it at an early stage.Finally, I strongly support calls for a debate on the issue of crime and the question of the causes of the escalating level of serious crime.
#PaulCoghlan	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-party	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-dob	unknown-#PaulCoghlan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	25	I also support Senator Finucane and others in their comments on crime. While the release of the two abducted men is to be welcomed, the situation in Limerick is, unfortunately, continuing to spiral with a further abduction and murder taking place.The Leader promised yesterday that she would enlighten us about what Bills will be dealt with in the House between now and Easter. Perhaps she will do so in order that we can prepare for them.
#MaryHenry	unknown-#MaryHenry-party	unknown-#MaryHenry-dob	unknown-#MaryHenry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	26	There is an extraordinary contradiction in the fact that the UN inspectors are searching for weapons of mass destruction in Iraq at the behest of the Americans. I have frequently raised the issue of the United Nations convention on biological weapons and toxins which was introduced in 1972 but had no verification programme. Ireland was one of the countries working on the programme when, 18 months ago, the United States scuppered it by deciding it would not co-operate with it or bring forward something better. I second Senator Norris's call that we debate motion No. 22 today. The hypocrisy of this situation is unbelievable.
#FrankFeighan	unknown-#FrankFeighan-party	unknown-#FrankFeighan-dob	unknown-#FrankFeighan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	27	The area allowance scheme was both useful and practical to encourage the long-term unemployed to set up their own businesses and get back into full-time employment. While I have praised the scheme, why has the Government changed one of the criteria from one year's unemployment to five years' unemployment? The scheme got the long-term unemployed out of a cycle of unemployment and also helps the marginalised and disadvantaged. It is an insult to the unemployed to require that they be out of work for five years before they can avail of the scheme.I am a member of the county enterprise board and the partnership board. The scheme has helped establish most of the small businesses in this country and tackled hard core unemployment. I am asking that the Minister come before the House to explain the reason the requirement in the scheme has been changed from one year to five years.
#NoelCoonan	unknown-#NoelCoonan-party	unknown-#NoelCoonan-dob	unknown-#NoelCoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	28	I support the call by Senator Finucane for a debate on crime. No Member of the House or the Government can ignore the statement by the Association of Garda Sergeants and Inspectors that uniformed gardaí are no longer in a position to give the service the public needs and deserves. We cannot ignore such comments. They are crying out for help. People in cities and rural areas are living in fear in their homes.The issue I wish to raise has been raised on many previous occasions, the concern about alcohol consumption, particularly among young people. Perhaps the Leader will also raise with the relevant Minister or the Director of Consumer Affairs the rip off prices being charged for drink. Last night a pint of Guinness cost €6.50 in an establishment not far from here. If that price was charged outside Dublin, there would be a revolution. Somebody is ripping off the system. This particularly applies to the price of non-alcoholic drink. A split, for example, costs €4. A drink the Cathaoirleach might like, a bacardi and coke, costs €10. That is a rip off.

It is affecting tourism. I call on the Leader to take the matter up with the relevant Minister.
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	32	Senator Ó Murchú said we needed to provide leadership. There is a serious danger that we are not providing it. Last night, with items such as Iraq, crime and other serious matters on the agenda, both large parties devoted the night to discussing rugby football in Connacht.
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	33	That matter was dealt with and we cannot revisit it. Does the Senator have a question for the Leader?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	34	I am talking about providing leadership when so many matters of concern are threatening this nation. We have mentioned crime and Iraq. Senator Norris has tabled a motion, seconded by Senator Henry, that we debate Iraq today.Another issue should be raised, not for debate today but which the Leader should bring to the relevant Minister's attention – the danger of bankrupting the country. We have been a nation for over 80 years. In that time we have seen some countries go bankrupt and others succeed. Recently we have taken a number of steps which have put us in serious danger of making this country the laughing stock of the world, one of which should be followed up by the Leader. As I listened to the radio and watched television over the last week, hardly half an hour passed without an advertisement being played for the Residential Institutions Redress Board. The advertisement asks if people have suffered abuse and, if so, says they may be entitled to compensation. It invites them to get in touch with the board.When we established the Residential Institutions Redress Board and allocated funds to it, we did not reckon that the first tens of thousands of euro would be devoted to encouraging people to get involved in the compensation culture. We had this situation with Army deafness claims. It almost reached the point where, if one had ever served in the Army, one was considered a fool if one did not make a claim. Now we are saying if somebody was ever in a residential institution, he or she is a fool if he or she does not make a claim. The Residential Institutions Redress Board is a worthy—
#RoryKiely	unknown-#RoryKiely-party	unknown-#RoryKiely-dob	unknown-#RoryKiely-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	35	Is the Senator seeking a debate?
#FergalQuinn	unknown-#FergalQuinn-party	unknown-#FergalQuinn-dob	unknown-#FergalQuinn-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	36	Yes. Will the Leader ask the Minister to come before the House and explain if that was the purpose of the board. Was it to encourage compensation for almost everybody who had been a resident in an institution? This is only one example of the standards we are setting which may endanger the country's economy in the years ahead.

#MaryORourke	unknown-#MaryORourke-party	unknown-#MaryORourke-dob	unknown-#MaryORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	45	Senator Finucane raised the issue of crime in Limerick. I understand his deep concern as he knows the area well. He spoke about Chief Superintendent Kelly, who was also mentioned yesterday by Senator O'Toole, and the articulate way in which he expressed his views on what was happening. The Senator asked that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the Seanad for a question and answer session. The Minister responds well to such an arrangement and I will ask him to come to the House as quickly as possible. I share the concern of Members about crime. People have a sense of fear and a desire that we get to grips with the problem. Practically all the contributions referred to this.Senator O'Toole raised the murder of Brian Fitzgerald before Christmas and spoke with great foresight of how the situation would develop. Today he said the competition legislation was not working because only three gardaí had been allocated for it. He asked that the Tánaiste come to the House to discuss it. I will make that request.Senator Ryan also spoke about crime in society. He mentioned a colleague, Senator Ross, blaming all our ills on the public service and offered a rebuttal to that argument. Many of us would have similar feelings.

He or she is entitled to be present or absent. Senator McHugh also requested that the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform come to the House to discuss, on an all-island basis, forthcoming legislation to deal with crime.Senator Norris supports the benchmarking process, as many of us do. He proposed that we take No. 11, motion 22, on the Iraqi crisis, which proposal was seconded. He also called for a debate on crime.Senator Ó Murchú strongly emphasised the need for a debate on the Iraqi situation, a sentiment he has expressed repeatedly in the House. We are requesting a debate on Iraq next week to which I hope we will get a response. Senator O'Meara also supports the call for a debate on Iraq and wants the strategic rail review to be debated when published. We will certainly take that matter up.Senator Coghlan called for a debate on crime and asked to be informed of Bills to be taken between now and Easter. I intend to call the Whips together on Tuesday, I hope, to prioritise the Bills printed on the Order Paper. The Minister for the Environment and Local Government has confirmed that we will deal with the Protection of the Environment Bill 2003 in the House next week.

She also seconded Senator Norris's call for a debate this morning on the Iraqi issue.Senator Feighan wants to know the reason the criterion for availing of the area allowance scheme has changed from one year's unemployment to five. He also spoke about the worth of such a scheme. This is a matter for the Tánaiste who was keen to come to the House before Christmas but we ran out of time.Senator Coonan wants a debate on crime and also expressed concern about alcohol prices and the ripping off of consumers.

He referred, in particular, to the advertisement being played on radio for the Residential Institutions Redress Board. If any of us had suffered in that regard, we might feel encouraged to come forward on hearing the advertisement. It is right that people should do so. I apologise to the Senator but that is my view. However, a debate on the matter with the Minister for Education and Science would be useful. The Minister has a very fine article in today's edition of the Irish Independent which lays out the facts very clearly and rebuts an earlier piece by the journalist, Bruce Arnold. It is an excellent article.

The period within which to make an appeal against a recommendation under section 12 of the Refugee Act 1996 is currently ten working days from the sending of the notice of the recommendation. In the case of a negative recommendation on an application investigated under section 11 of the 1996 Act it is 15 working days from the date of the notice of the recommendation, in other words, two and three full working weeks, respectively, with weekends and public holidays excluded.An applicant is aware from the time he or she receives the information leaflet at the start of the process of the time limits involved. Nothing is hidden in that regard. I do not think the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees would jump for joy at the news that what was being advocated was that, notwithstanding the obvious lack of merit of a claim as established by an independent investigation, the further time and resources of an oral hearing were to be extended at appeal stage.In this Bill I intend to bring forward further amendments to the Refugee Act 1996, among which will be proposals for an accelerated procedure for dealing with certain categories of applications. My proposals will radically replace the current provisions for manifestly unfounded applications in section 12 of the Act. While the final details of this are still being worked out between my Department and the parliamentary counsel and have yet to be brought to Government, I assure Senators that oral hearings for obviously baseless claims will not feature large.

After paragraph (e)(iii), to insert the following subsection:"(iv) the insertion in subsection (14) after ‘private' of ‘unless the appellant so requests'.".The purpose of this amendment is to allow the applicant to decide whether the media should be present at a hearing.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	67	The effect of this amendment would be to allow oral hearings to be conducted in public where the applicant so requested. Senators will be aware the Bill already contains an amendment to section 19(2) of the Refugee Act 1996 that removes the requirement for ministerial consent to publish or broadcast any matter likely to identify the person as an applicant. It will no longer be the case that any organisation that broadcasts material concerning an applicant requires my consent. However, the requirement to obtain the consent of the applicant remains.There are good reasons that the oral hearing should remain private. The oral hearing is conducted as informally as possible. The applicant is encouraged to state his or her case openly and freely. The commissioner's representatives will present relevant points from the investigative process. Witnesses may be called and questioned. The hearing is presided over by a member of the tribunal who is, of course, independent in his or her functions. The applicant will usually have legal representation and the UNHCR may have representatives in attendance if it so wishes.I do not believe it is in anyone's interests, particularly those of the applicant, if the public or the media is invited by the applicant to see how the proceedings are carried out. The nature of these occasions is not the administration of justice in courts established by law under the Constitution; they are informal and proceed subject to law. In the great majority of cases they proceed with lawyers present. The UNHCR can attend if there is any concern about the quality of the proceedings. I do not think making a public circus of the proceedings is a good idea.

In page 6, paragraph (b) between lines 37 and 38, to insert the following:"and by the insertion after subsection (5) of the following subsection:‘(6) Notwithstanding anything in this section the Tribunal shall make available to the public copies of its decisions regarding appeals under this Act with any publicly identifying information deleted unless the appellant so requests'.".The purpose of this amendment is to ensure decisions of the tribunal would be made available to the public to ensure they were open and transparent and that the public was aware of what decisions were made. That would be reasonable while at the same time protecting the identities of applicants. Will the Minister comment?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	70	It is my understanding that the tribunal already has within its discretion the power to publish decisions, if it so wishes, with sufficient details obscured to preserve the anonymity of applicants. The effect of the amendment would be to require the tribunal to make available to the public copies of its decisions on appeals with identifying information deleted unless the applicant were to request otherwise. Every decision made by the tribunal would have to be the subject, after it was delivered, of an extensive process whereby all the detail which could tend to identify the person in question would be removed. Some may think that is a simple task of looking for Christian names and names of villages or whatever and identifying material of that nature. However, it would not be that simple because, in many cases, the facts of a claim of persecution would clearly identify a person and expose them to danger in their home country in certain circumstances.The amendment would cover both successful and unsuccessful appeals. An immense amount of time would have to be put into re-editing every decision to ensure it could not embarrass the applicant. Bearing in mind that the subject matter of these applications contains immensely personal or highly political details and material which would, in the ordinary course of events, tend to identify a person to anyone who had an interest in the country of origin, the amount of public time that would have to be taken to go through each decision to reduce it to a form that could not embarrass the applicant would effectively be a huge misuse of public resources.Bearing in mind that the advice available to me is that the tribunal is not excluded from publishing any or all of its decisions which it considers of sufficient legal or factual importance to bring to the public's attention, to cast an obligation on it to edit and produce a sanitised version of every decision which could not possibly embarrass anyone involved would be quite difficult to do. The Senator should also bear in mind that decisions of this nature could reject an allegation that someone in another state committed acts of an horrific nature which amounted to persecution. Bearing in mind that this State must protect not only the interests of the applicant but also those falsely accused by applicants of persecution, the balancing act involved in such an operation would be immensely difficult. Regrettably, I must oppose the amendment.

I would like to hear the Minister's comments.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	73	These amendments are opposed because they are fundamentally at odds with the nature of the Dublin Convention as an instrument for determining which EU state – now including Iceland and Norway – is the proper one to examine a specific asylum claim. Before a person may be transferred under the convention, the commissioner is obliged to examine the relevant provisions of the convention, especially Articles 3(7), 4 to 8, inclusive, and 10 (1)(d), to determine whether the asylum application should be examined in another member state.Clear criteria are set out in the articles mentioned for determining the applicability of the convention to a specific case. If the commissioner determines that the application should be transferred to another member state, the agreement of that state to examine the application must be obtained before the person can be transferred there. This is effectively a legal decision and if a person was to object to it and say it was being made irregularly or in bad faith, he or she would have the option of seeking to challenge the decision of the commissioner in the courts. However, it is not proposed to complicate the operation of the convention further by introducing a domestic appeal process other than by judicial review by the courts in such cases.The convention is thought by many to be of major practical import, but in a given year, fewer than 140 cases, either inwards or outwards, are dealt with. Ireland repatriates about 32 people to other states in a given year. In each case it is done with the consent of the other state. There is no need for a further layer of appeals process to be built into this procedure of transference.The Senator may be interested in the following figures. In terms of operations under the convention, 39 people were referred to this State by other states, 35 from the United Kingdom, one from Finland, two from Norway and one from the Netherlands. Some 64 people were referred outwards by this country under the convention in 2002, 48 to the United Kingdom, four to Belgium, one each to Spain and Germany, two each to the Netherlands and France, one to Greece and five to Austria. We are dealing with a small number of cases per annum and, in each case, I remind the Senator that it is not only Ireland that decides under the convention the case should be an outward one or, in the case of a foreign decision under the convention, accept that it should be an inward one. In every case there is effectively an examination by two states of the position before anything happens.In that context, it is sufficient for the High Court to be available to anybody who thinks the system is being used against them ultra vires or in breach of good faith. I have already signalled my intention to introduce further amendments to the Refugee Act, which will address the question of applications with safe third countries. Far from adding layer upon layer of delay and futile expense to the resolution of these issues, my proposals are aimed at robustly foreshortening the process and having the issue resolved quickly.As the figures show, in the vast majority of instances we are only dealing with cases involving EU or EEA countries and with people who are going to member states of the European Union, in the main, with whom the procedure under the European arrest warrant is about to come into effect. We trust those countries and, therefore, this is not a final determination of whether somebody is or is not a refugee. This is simply a system for deciding on venue and we cannot put the full panoply of domestic applications into operation on a procedural jurisdictional point as to which country is appropriate for the application to be determined.

I ask the Minister to comment on that.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	75	Amendment No. 24 questions whether Dublin Convention cases would warrant an oral hearing. If there are matters that need to be explored more fully at appeal, the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, which deals with these appeals, may, under article 7.5 of the Dublin Convention Implementation Order 2000, direct the commissioner to make such inquiries and to provide it with such further information as it considers necessary or expedient for the purposes of deciding an appeal. Applicants are transferred to a Dublin Convention country on foot of a deportation order which is made subject to the requirements of section 5 of the Refugee Act 1996. This is the obligation of non- refoulement.To attempt to graft on to this process the notice provisions of section 3(3) of the Immigration Act 1999, as would be the effect of amendment No. 24, simply serves to delay the examination of the asylum claim. The person will not be returned to his or her country of origin, but will be transferred to a state where he or she will have his or her asylum application dealt with. The prolonged consideration of these cases serves no purpose and will only encourage abuse of the asylum process by those who engage in asylum shopping.Under the Dublin Convention, if somebody is being moved from Ireland to another state, section 5 of the Act, which deals with non- refoulement, comes into effect. This is fundamentally a safety net preventing somebody from being seriously prejudiced by a radically different approach being taken to the issues of their claim in the other country. So the deportation order, which would be made and served in order to operate the Dublin Convention procedure, already takes into account the question as to whether they would be gravely prejudiced by the fact that they are being moved from one jurisdiction to another. To have an oral hearing in those circumstances is not necessary, particularly when the tribunal can ask the commissioner to carry out any further investigations if it considers the material before it is inadequate to decide on the matter.
#	unknown-#-party	unknown-#-dob	unknown-#-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	76	Amendments Nos. 22 and 23 and amendment No. 1 to amendment No. 23 are related and may be discussed together by agreement.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	77	These amendments make similar provisions in a number of significant respects regarding the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the chairperson of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, respectively. Each has two purposes: they make provision for a situation where through some unforeseen circumstance the office holder is temporarily unable to carry out the functions of the office; and they set out to a greater or lesser degree of detail the powers of the office holder to manage the business of the office.The provisions regarding a temporary stand-in are, in the case of the Refugee Applications Commissioner, in amendment No. 22 at the proposed paragraph 10 of the first schedule to the Refugee Act. The similar provisions for the chair of the Refugee Appeals Tribunal are in amendment No. 23, at the proposed paragraph 8, subparagraph (2). Provisions of this nature are to be found in much legislation governing the creation of public offices and the holding of those offices. Some that spring to mind are those of the Director of Public Prosecutions under the Prosecution of Offences Act 1974 and the members of the Ethics in Public Office Commission under the 1995 Act which established that commission.It is not tempting providence to make statutory provision for the unlikely and undesired situation where either the commissioner or the chairperson of the tribunal would be laid low by accident or illness. However, certain critical functions under the Refugee Act must be carried out personally by the office holders in question and even a temporary unavailability of a couple of months could impact seriously on the ability of the commissioner's office or the tribunal to continue their respective important work of investigating asylum claims and considering asylum appeals. It is accordingly prudent that there should be the ability to appoint a substitute in each case.The proposed provisions also deal with the event of either office becoming unexpectedly vacant through resignation, death, etc. The process of filling each of these positions involves running a Civil Service Commission competition. This is not simply an office in the gift of the Minister. Because it is an independent office, its independence is being underlined by the fact that the appointments process is carried out through the Civil Service Commission. That can take some time to set up and run, and in the meantime the work of the office may be piling up. Backlogs of work either at first instance investigation or on appeal are, as we can all agree, highly undesirable. It makes sense that the eventuality of the sudden vacancy should also be catered for in these amendments.I have no reason to anticipate that either the commissioner, Bernice O'Neill, or the chairman, P. J. Farrell, will be the subject of any of these provisions. I pay tribute to the immensely hard work they do and the public spirit in which it is done.In amendment No. 23, paragraph 8 subparagraph (1) reproduces the current paragraph 8 with a minor amendment. The provision, as it stands, allows a replacement member of the tribunal to be appointed, but only to serve out the remainder of the term of the member being replaced. There is no particular benefit to be achieved by that arrangement, which might mean that someone could be appointed for a mere couple of weeks to replace a predecessor who had almost completed a three year stint before leaving office. There is no good reason that there should not be overlaps of membership.Amendment No. 23 goes on to set out in some detail the management powers of the chair of the tribunal. The relevant paragraphs in the amendment are paragraphs 13 to 20, and I will give a brief commentary on each. Proposed paragraph 13 simply restates the current paragraph 13. Proposed paragraph 14 makes clear the chairman's function in ensuring that the tribunal's business is carried out fairly and efficiently at all levels, including the throughput of cases of the other members of the tribunal to which cases have been assigned. It gives a management function to the chair of the tribunal to make sure they are evenly assigned where that is appropriate or assigned to avoid backlogs where that is appropriate.Proposed paragraph 15 makes clear that the tribunal chair can prioritise cases as he or she thinks fit, based on the criteria set out at the paragraph already set out either expressly or by implication in the existing provisions of the Act relating to the commissioner's functions.Proposed paragraph 17 enables the chairperson to issue guidelines and guidance notes on aspects of work of the tribunal. This will be most useful from a number of points of view as it will help to bring a greater degree of consistency to the work of the various members of the tribunal while, at the same time, fully respecting the obvious fact that each of them is independent in the decision making function he or she carries out. Guidance notes are a useful aid to practitioners representing asylum applicants and the staff of the tribunal and the Refugee Appeals Commissioner in enhancing the clarity and certainty of the appeals process on a procedural and functional level.Another means of enhancing consistency of decision making and the operation of the Act among the membership of the tribunal is the power in paragraph 18 to convene meetings of the membership from time to time. Such meetings can engender a sense of collegiality and the convergence of views in a general way while still respecting the independence of each decision maker in the individual cases assigned to him or her.Proposed paragraphs 19 and 20 provide for the preparation by the tribunal of annual reports and reports on a one off basis for submission to the Minister. These provisions are currently in place for the commissioner. Amendment No. 22 also provides powers for the commissioner to prioritise her caseload.Senators will note that the provisions regarding the commissioner's management functions are not anything like as extensive in the amendment related to the commissioner as they are in the amendment related to the chairperson of the tribunal. The simple explanation for this is that much of the detail specified for the tribunal chair is already set out either expressly or by implication in the existing provisions of the Act relating to the commissioner's functions. It is also noteworthy that the relationship between the commissioner and her staff is quite different in nature from that between the tribunal chair and the other independent members of the tribunal. I commend the amendments to the House.

#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	86	While I do not have a problem with the section or the amendment in general, I ask the Minister to accept the amendment to amendment No. 23, the purpose of which is to ensure the guidelines issued by the chairperson of the tribunal would be made public and that the Houses of the Oireachtas could address any problems which may arise.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	87	I have substantially addressed the reasons for my opposition to the amendment to amendment No. 23. As I stated, the proposed paragraph 17 enables the chairperson to issue guidelines and guidance notes on aspects of the work of the tribunal. This will assist with the efficient functioning of the tribunal and will be an important aid to the work of the various members of the tribunal, practitioners representing asylum applicants and staff both of the tribunal and the Refugee Appeals Commissioner in enhancing the clarity and certainty of the appeals process on a procedural and functional level.I am prepared to leave it to the discretion of the chairperson of the tribunal as to whether these guidelines should be widely available, for example, through a website. However, it is important to remember that they are guidelines, not legislative instruments, although they may assist in the application of the instruments and are likely to be issued or revised with some regularity. Moreover, they will reflect the chairperson's view as to how his or her office should operate under the Refugee Act or the law relating to refugees generally. Therefore, the Oireachtas should not need a role in overseeing or possibly annulling guidelines which the chairperson of an independent body sees fit to issue for the proper functioning of his or her office.If the amendment to amendment No. 23 was accepted, the guidelines would be transformed from the status of simple guidelines to quasi-statutory instruments. Requiring the approval of the Houses of the Oireachtas would transform them from one category of instrument into another. It is better that they be left amendable and flexible because the whole purpose of this innovation is to introduce day-to-day consistency and enable the chairperson to deal very quickly with unforeseen difficulties or difficulties of interpretation of previous guidelines. We do not want to arrive at a position in which the Houses of the Oireachtas must be involved every time some question of doubt arises as to the intention of the chairperson or the collective view of the members of the tribunal expressed at one of its meetings.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	88	I move amendment No. 25:
In page 7, before section 6, to insert the following new section:6.–The Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act, 2000 is amended:(a) in section 5(2)(a) by the deletion of ‘14' and the substitution of ‘35', (b) in section 5(3)(a) by the insertion after the third and fourth references to ‘the High Court' of ‘or the Supreme Court'.”.The amendment proposes to substitute the period of 14 days within which applications must be made for a judicial review, which is too short, with a period of 35 days. The purpose of the second part of the amendment is to restore the right of leave to appeal refusal by the High Court. The reason we introduce this proposal is that a similar amendment tabled in 2000 was withdrawn by my colleague, Deputy Howlin, in the Dáil because an assurance was given that it was implicit that an applicant would have a right of leave to appeal a High Court decision. That has not been the case and we want to address that gap. I would like the Minister to comment on these amendments.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	89	As the Senator will probably be aware, the Supreme Court, in the matter of Article 26 of the Constitution and the provisions of sections 5 and 10 of the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Bill 1999, has examined in great detail the provisions of section 5 of what is now the Illegal Immigrants Trafficking Act 2000. The court held that no provision of the section was repugnant to the Constitution. Section 5(2) provides that the 14 day limit may be extended whenever the High Court considers there is good and sufficient reason for doing so. In its decision under the Article 26 reference, the Supreme Court found that the State has legitimate interest in prescribing procedural rules calculated to ensure an early completion of judicial review proceedings of the administrative decision set out in section 5(1).In exercising its discretion to choose an appropriate time period, the Legislature must not undermine any right guaranteed under the Constitution such as the right of access to the courts. The Supreme Court noted that the 14 day limit was not the shortest that the courts have had to deal with and was satisfied that the power of the courts to extend the time limit for good and sufficient reason is wide and ample enough to avoid an injustice.The Law Reform Commission, in its recently published consultation paper on judicial review procedure, discussed the matter at length. The commission concluded that the 14 day limit "achieves the necessary balance between the rights of the applicant and the policy concerns of the legislature" and it recommended no change. I am satisfied, therefore, in view of the Supreme Court decision on the Article 26 reference and the experience of the day to day operation of section 5, that there is no requirement to amend the provision and it is working well. The commission's report confirms my view.I do not see a value in the proposal that the jurisdiction of the Supreme Court should be invoked in matters of leave to appeal and that the competency in these matters should remain with the High Court. The entire point of these provisions is to ensure the judicial review process, which is fundamental to our system of justice and Constitution, cannot be abused to create unnecessary delays in the deportation process where there is no issue of substance that would warrant postponement of a person's departure from the State. It would be easy, if we acceded to these amendments, for those who wish to resist deportation from the State to create such a volume of case law for the courts that the administration of the burden on the courts and the State in attempting to deal with it would add a year to every procedure if these strict time limits were not in place.The Article 26 reference arose from a decision of the President as a result of concerns expressed at the time that this provision might be dubious in terms of the Constitution and the matter was referred to the Supreme Court for its decision. When the court examined the matter, it stated there was a fair balance between the rights of the people to have a system that works and the rights of an individual who could be subject to an injustice if limits were put in place.The escape hatch is that this is not a rigid system that is immovable in any circumstance because the High Court makes the ultimate decision as to whether time will be extended. It was held, therefore, that that formula was fully constitutional. We have an independent Judiciary and it comprises the appropriate people to decide whether in exceptional cases there is a need to extend the ordinary system.There has not been an injustice over the past year arising from the operation of this provision. On the contrary, it has concentrated people's minds. I do not suggest lawyers abuse the process, but they are tempted when their clients badly want to create space in terms of time to invoke the jurisdiction of the court. Under this provision, they are required to address the issue in clearer terms and outline their case in terms of whether it has a chance of succeeding and on what grounds it is based. If there are no clear grounds on which the decision they wish to impugn can be challenged, they must tell their client there are no such grounds and not waste the resources of the judicial system processing claims that are submitted primarily to avail of the time delay that follows from all court procedures.If we want to preserve the integrity of the system, we must adhere to current procedures. If we amend the provisions in question, which have been adjudicated on under Article 26, one of the by-products would be that it would subsequently be subject to separate constitutional challenge because once an Article 26 decision has been made about a provision of an Act, it is thereafter immune from constitutional challenge. However, if the provision is amended, the doors would be open again to every lawyer to continue to attack its constitutionality in case after case without end in the courts on the basis that they think they can repeatedly reopen the issue.The State successfully defended this provision before the Supreme Court when I was Attorney General and I do not propose to surrender the effect of that Article 26 decision through this amendment.

Article 26 is a good procedure but, on the other hand, it is good for people to be able to test the constitutionality of legislation by applying it to real facts and events. Will the Minister consider the issue of providing for leave to appeal to the Supreme Court?
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	91	The Senator is asking me to provide for an automatic right of appeal to the Supreme Court against a High Court decision. The answer is no because that would transfer the problem for another few months from one court to another. Almost all the applicants are legally aided. It costs them nothing to take a case but it costs the State in terms of paying for the applicant's lawyers and its own. It would also cost the State, if I were to open the floodgates in this way, as the Supreme Court would be inundated with these cases, which would be brought solely for the purpose of creating delay without expense to the applicant. If such cases were taken in sufficient volume, the system would clog up and I will not go down that road.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	92	This is a largely technical amendment. Its purpose is to restore to the Minister for Justice, Equality and Law Reform a power to prescribe the ports and airports at which non-nationals coming from a place outside the State can land. This is a matter of secondary legislation under the Aliens Act 1935 and worked effectively without controversy as part of the Aliens Order 1946, which was the major statutory instrument made under the 1935 Act.It could be modified from time to time by the Minister making a simple amending statutory instrument to reflect shifts in traffic flow and new routes being established. However, section 2(1) of the Immigration Act 1999 gave the force of statue to the Aliens Order 1946. It was claimed in the wake of the Laurentiu decision that it was invalid to have something as extensive as the Aliens Order in the form of a mere statutory instrument amendable by me or my successors without reference to Parliament.It was decided to give the Aliens Order, which was up to then only a statutory instrument, the effect of statute law in the recent legislation. Senators will recall that this was done to protect the order from challenge following the finding of the High Court in the Laurentiu case.Currently I would have to introduce primary legislation if I wanted to designate any new port in the State as one where non-nationals may land in the State. Clearly this is not an efficient way to do business. For example, if the owners of Greenore port in County Louth were to establish a new ferry service the day after tomorrow, then to be consistent with the present situation the matter is solely capable of being dealt with by primary legislation. I would have to bring an amending Bill to the House if I wanted to designate Greenore as a place where persons coming into the State had to make an application to land in the State. That would clearly be impractical. What would happen if the Houses of the Oireachtas were not in session?Without the flexibility to make suitable provisions by secondary legislation, which is always subject to review afterwards by the Oireachtas anyway, the potential delays in securing the passage of a Bill could create difficulties for port or airport authorities which would have to await the passage of such legislation before they could act legally to allow non-nationals to land in their ports. It is not a power that is used frequently but it is a power that is best dealt with by order rather than primary legislation. Therefore I urge Senators to accept this amendment.

I reserve my position on it. I am not in support of it.
#JoannaTuffy	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-party	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-dob	unknown-#JoannaTuffy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	94	I move amendment No. 27:
In page 7, before section 8, to insert the following new section:8.–A restatement of the enactments relating to non-nationals, immigration and asylum as amended inter alia by this Act shall be prepared under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act, 2002, as soon as may be after the passing of this Act.”.The law on immigration and asylum goes back to 1935 and has been amended on a number of occasions. My colleagues and I feel it should be tidied up and I await the Minister's comments.
#MichaelMcDowellPD	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-party	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-dob	unknown-#MichaelMcDowellPD-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	95	I agree with the spirit of this amendment but not with the amendment itself. The law relating to enactments dealing with non-nationals is capable of being restated under the Statute Law (Restatement) Act, which has recently come into operation. The effect of that Act is that where a particular statute has been amended or can be found in a number of places, from time to time the Attorney General can produce a single effectively consolidated and updated text for the guidance of the public and the use of practitioners. It is not simply to be used as a domestic document for guidance but a document which can be used in court. People can see the Attorney General's certificate on the front of it and then realise it is the law in an official form.The unofficial restatement of the Refugee Act 1996 has been widely available from my Department's website for several years as the Department has been doing this work informally. It can be downloaded from the Department's website, which is a demonstration of my Department's commitment to the principles to which the Act now gives statutory effect and the Restatement Act. It also shows the spirit of Senator Tuffy's amendment has been anticipated by my Department in relation to the Refugee Act legislation.I hope to have a similar version of the Immigration Act on the website today and once the amendments to the Bill become law the website will be updated again. If there are other areas, such as the aliens legislation which I referred to earlier, which I can neatly put into a restated form then I will do so. We will make that available to anyone who needs to find it as soon as we can.However, it is not necessary to have a specific obligation cast on the Minister. The amendment does not specify who would have to do so but it would be the Attorney General or the Minister and it is not necessary to cast that duty on the State. That is because in this area we have anticipated the Restatement Act and the concerns the Senator has very properly raised about making the law available in an easy single text form. Therefore it is not necessary to accept this amendment and I oppose it.

#SheilaTerry	unknown-#SheilaTerry-party	unknown-#SheilaTerry-dob	unknown-#SheilaTerry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	101	I welcome the Minister of State to the Seanad. I also welcome the French Minister and his party and I hope they enjoy their visit.I am raising a very local issue which I am sure will be familiar to the Minister of State as it is in his own area. I have received a number of queries from schools in our local area who are concerned that Fingal County Council will no longer collect waste from schools free of charge. This will now be a cost to the schools and it will vary from €4,000 upwards per annum. The council has said – I think rightly so – that it cannot carry the burden of the collection of waste from the schools, that it is a cost for the Department of Education and Science.I ask the Department to reimburse the schools for the cost of waste collection. In addition to charging for the removal of waste, the council has also removed the green bins from the schools. School managers now must inform pupils that any recyclable waste such as cans and paper must be taken home. This may seem like a good idea but it is extremely difficult to implement and will no doubt cause a nuisance. Some children may not take the waste home and it will be dumped somewhere. The schools are left in a very difficult position.The Minister of State is aware that parents must fundraise extensively for various school needs and to expect schools to carry a cost of €4,000 or €5,000 or perhaps more in the case of larger schools is causing boards of management great concern. I ask the Minister of State if the Department will reimburse the schools for this cost which is now being imposed by the council. I support the council's decision on this but I want something done about it. The Department of Education and Science must deal with it.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	102	Primary schools' running costs are met by the Department of Education and Science scheme of capitation grants and the local contribution. These grants are intended to contribute towards the general operating costs of national schools which would include heating, lighting, cleaning, insurance, painting, teaching aids and other miscellaneous charges.Since 1997 the standard rate of capitation grant has been increased from £45, €57.14, per pupil to €111.58 in the current school year. This represents an increase of more than 95% over the period since 1997. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools, bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to €149.67.Significant improvements have also been made in the level of funding to second level schools. The standard per capita grant of €224.74 that applied in 1997 was increased to €256.49 in September 2001, and was further increased to €266.49 in September 2002. An additional per capita grant of €38.09 is paid to disadvantaged schools, bringing the total per capita grant in the case of such schools to over €300. In addition, under the school services support initiative, second level schools have benefited from further significant increases in the support grant from €25.40 per pupil in 2000 to €88.88 from September 2002 and to €99 per pupil from 1 January 2003.Funding for voluntary secondary schools has been further enhanced by the introduction of a range of equalisation measures designed to reduce the historical anomalies in the funding arrangements for the different school types at second level. Under the terms of recent equalisation measures, the support services grant was increased by €28 per pupil with effect from September 2002. This brings the support services grant in the case of voluntary secondary schools to €116.88 per pupil from September 2002 and to €127 per pupil from 1 January 2003. This increase is in addition to the range of equalisation grants of up to €15,554 per school, €44.44 per pupil, per annum approved for secondary schools in December 2001. For a voluntary secondary school with 500 pupils, this amounts to extra funding of up to €100,000 per annum and additional grants of up to €236,761, €255,811 in the case of disadvantaged schools, towards general expenses and support services.Local authority service and other charges payable to the various local authorities do not come within the remit of the Department of Education and Science. It would be a matter for the local authorities to decide whether schools are liable to pay such charges. Where it is decided that schools are liable in respect of such charges, the cost of paying them would form part of the normal running costs of schools and would fall to be met from the capitation funding which schools have received from the Department of Education and Science. Schools are afforded considerable flexibility in the use of these resources to cater for the needs of their pupils. In my view this is in general a preferable approach to putting in place grants for specific initiatives such as water or refuse charges.It is the intention of the Minister for Education and Science to further improve the financial position of primary and second level schools to the extent that the availability of resources permits.
#TomMorrissey	unknown-#TomMorrissey-party	unknown-#TomMorrissey-dob	unknown-#TomMorrissey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	103	I welcome the Minister of State. I raised this motion on the Adjournment because I became aware of this problem with MRSA recently when a person I know suffered from it. I understand that it is quite prevalent in hospitals and is an ongoing concern within hospitals countrywide.The source of it is hard to understand, but the recuperating process for patients who get this bug is quite serious. It is not exactly life-threatening, but it certainly extends their stay in hospital and, therefore, does not free up beds for people who might wish to enter hospital for surgical procedures. I ask the Minister to give us whatever information the Department has on the prevalence of MRSA and on what actions are taken in hospitals, particularly in regard to geriatric patients coming from a district hospital to a surgical hospital for procedures to ensure that it is not carried among that population cohort.
#BrianLenihan	unknown-#BrianLenihan-party	unknown-#BrianLenihan-dob	unknown-#BrianLenihan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2003-01-30 00:00:00	Prelude	104	I thank Senator Morrissey for raising this matter on the Adjournment. MRSA is a significant infection which occurs in hospitals and in the community. It is a major issue for health care systems in all countries. There are many contributing factors, including the use of antibiotics and the control of infection in our hospitals.MRSA is part of the broader issue of antimicrobial resistance and this is being addressed in a number of ways. Guidelines for acute hospitals and other facilities on the control of MRSA were developed and circulated to health boards and other relevant parties in 1995. In 1999 a North-South study on MRSA prevalence was undertaken under the direction of the Eastern Regional Health Authority. This was a follow-up to a previous study carried out in 1995.This study provided much useful data and also made a range of recommendations for the control of MRSA. These included identification of a wide range of issues which needed to be addressed at hospital level. The guidelines issued in 1995 suggest a variety of options for nursing patients with MRSA.In 1999 my Department also asked the National Disease Surveillance Centre – NDSC – to evaluate the problem of antimicrobial resistance, including MRSA, in Ireland and to formulate a strategy for the future. The NDSC drew up a Strategy for the control of Antimicrobial Resistance in Ireland – SARI, which the Minister for Health and Children, Deputy Martin, launched on 19 June 2001. This report contains a wide range of detailed recommendations to address the issues which can be grouped into five categories, as follows: the surveillance of antimicrobial resistance; the monitoring of the supply and use of antimicrobials; the development of guidance in relation to the appropriate use of antimicrobials; education; and the development of principles in relation to infection control in the hospital and community setting.Tackling the problem of antimicrobial resistance is a multifaceted issue which will require action on a number of fronts. Since 2001 approximately €12 million has been provided to the health boards for antimicrobial resistance measures, taking into account the recommendations in SARI and in the North-South study of MRSA in Ireland in 1999. The boards have been asked to address, in particular, infection control strategies and staffing in both hospitals and the community, the development of surveillance systems for the collection of antimicrobial resistance data and information on antibiotic prescribing in hospitals.The report recommended that a national SARI committee be established in order to oversee the implementation of the recommendations in the report and to develop guidelines, protocols and strategies in relation to antimicrobial resistance. This committee has now been established and held its first meeting in December 2002.The NDSC collates information on the incidence of invasive MRSA as part of the European antimicrobial resistance surveillance system – EARSS. This is collected on a quarterly basis and is available only in aggregate form. Details are available on the NDSC website – www.ndsc.ie. Information on individual hospitals is not available.The Seanad adjourned at 12.45 p.m. until 2.30 p.m. on Tuesday, 4 February 2003.
