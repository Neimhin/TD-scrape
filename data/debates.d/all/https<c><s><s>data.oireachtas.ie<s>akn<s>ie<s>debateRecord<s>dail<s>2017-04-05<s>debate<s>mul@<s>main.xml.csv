#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	0	Parents of children with special needs simply face too many barriers and obstacles to accessing services, including school placements, respite, proper and timely assessments, and basic equipment and aids to help their children get through the daily tasks of life. For example, the number of children who are waiting for appropriate occupational therapy assessment is extraordinary. Nationally, 4,640 children have been waiting for more than a year for their first OT assessment despite the Disability Act 2005 stipulating a statutory requirement of three months. In counties Cork and Kerry, which are the worst, well over 1,700 have been waiting for longer than that period for occupational therapy assessment. Up to 60 children in one school are on a waiting list with no special school placement available to them. Some 14,000 are waiting for speech and language assessment. There is no certainty and parents are facing terrible anxiety. As the Taoiseach knows, the therapy services are critical. The assessment and the subsequent access to services are critical to children. Those awaiting OT assessment include children with conditions such as cerebral palsy, dyspraxia and spina bifida. The lack of prioritisation in this area is a shocking indictment of what is going on. Up to 30 parents have been waiting for two years to get a single weekend of respite. Due to cuts to its funding, the disability organisation had to apply a chronological dividing line. That was only resolved last week after we had to bring the parents' representatives to Dublin to meet the Minister of State with responsibility for those with special needs, Deputy Finian McGrath. Those parents of children with severe and profound autism have been without respite for two to three years. It should not take that long and the dynamic of a meeting to kick the system into action to provide for them. Last week I met parents of a young child with muscular dystrophy. There is an extraordinary rationing and medieval bureaucratic system around applications for aids and appliances. I am talking about wheelchairs, specialist footwear for a child with muscular dystrophy and particular body suits that prevent scoliosis or other complications arising. I put it to the Taoiseach that a fundamental and comprehensive look needs to be taken at timely access for such services for children. The mindset and the attitude has to change and the barriers have to be taken down. Parents of children with special needs are still saying that they are facing too many barriers as well as huge stress and anxiety.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	1	I agree this is a matter that has been examined over the years. The Government has adopted the findings of Eamon Stack's report in respect of access to services in schools for children with intellectual challenges which will eliminate many of the problems that have been around for a long time. The HSE is currently engaged in a reconfiguration of the existing therapy resources which are available to teams and spread geographically for children from birth to 18 years. As the Deputy is aware, the objective of that model of assessment is to provide a single and clear referral pathway for all children, irrespective of their disability, where they live or the school they attend, in order to streamline this. Evidence from the areas will show that implementation of the programme will have a positive impact. It has taken quite a while to get to this point. Deputy Martin mentioned respite. The HSE and the agencies it funds provide respite care to children and adults with disabilities. It is clear there are challenges. Respite can occur in a variety of settings for any length of time depending on the needs of the family and the resources that are available. It is not always centre-based. It can be provided in a number of ways, including out of home, in home, home to home, home support and family support. As part of the continuum of services for families, respite helps prevent out-of-home placements, preserves the family unit and supports family stability. While the situation outlined by the Deputy is not as satisfactory as one would wish, the HSE is aware of the importance of the provision of respite to families of both children and adults with disabilities and the impact of the absence of respite service provision on other services. It does not necessarily cease once a person reaches the age of 18 but this will depend on the availability of resources. As a result of the number of respite beds being used for long-term residential placements, the number of people with disabilities in receipt of residential respite services and the corresponding number of respite nights are down against previous activity. This reflects new models of respite care that are now being delivered to home respite and extended day care, etc. The Deputy raises an important consideration, particularly for the families and the young people involved. However, it depends on the availability of trained staff and resources which is why the structure has changed. It is hoped that over time it will be far more streamlined and deliver a more effective service.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	2	The bottom line is that it simply is not working. I refer to the case of a young child of two and a half years who needs an assessment application. The child attended in June 2016 and the family were told it would be dealt with on 23 September. They were then told in November by an assessment officer that there was a five month delay and that she was processing number 482. This child was number 981. Eventually, the family got a private assessment only to be told that an early intervention ASD unit cannot be made available because there must be a HSE assessment. These are the kind of cases that Deputies are picking up throughout the country. There are long waits for assessment and an inability to access services. Marian House is the autism centre for assessment in Cork South Lee. The last paragraph of a letter that admittedly was sent last year reads:Currently in Marian House there are only 8 whole time equivalent post to 770 children. This scarce resource is divided into three teams to support children from time of diagnosis... The situation is out of ... control ... we are sorry we are unable to offer a comprehensive service which you and your child deserve and require.A similar story applies in other areas. In one area, 800 children are waiting for an autism assessment. I could go on. The system is not working. There is no point in talking about models when urgent intervention is required. It should not have to be deputation after deputation going to Ministers to get these issues resolved. The issues must be dealt with comprehensively. 
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	3	The Deputy will be aware of the very close collaboration between the health and education sectors on children's disabilities in general. This is facilitated by the cross-sectoral team on the implementation of the Disability Act comprised of representatives of the Departments of Health, Education and Skills and Children and Youth Affairs, the Health Service Executive, the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, and the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, which has been established to progress specific cases. The full implementation of the progressing disability services programme is expected before the end of 2017. A total of €8 million in additional funding was invested in 2014-15 to fund 200 additional posts to deal with the backlog to which the Deputy referred. A further €4 million in additional funding was provided for 75 therapy posts in 2016. It is expected that the reconfiguration of these services will have a significant impact.  In 2013, there were 260 prioritised front-line primary care posts, including 52 occupational therapists and 52 speech and language therapists. The aim was to address the waiting list to which the Deputy referred. In 2016, €4 million was provided under the HSE's national service plan to focus specifically on speech and language therapy waiting lists in primary and social care for children aged up to 18 years. This represents a long-term investment in speech and language capacity which will be maintained through this year and in the years ahead. 
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	4	The Good Friday Agreement is the institutional, constitutional and legal framework which defines the relationship within the island of Ireland and between Ireland and Britain. I do not believe for one moment that the Government has truly absorbed this new reality. The Good Friday Agreement is an international treaty. The Taoiseach has co-equal status with the British Prime Minister and a co-equal responsibility to uphold, implement and promote all aspects of this new relationship. The biggest threat to the Agreement, the new relationship and the social and economic future of the people of this island is presented by Brexit. I am sure the Taoiseach and I agree on that at least. The British Government has ignored the vote of people in the North and London is intent on pulling that part of our island out of the European Union despite the dire consequences this will have for everyone across Ireland. Sinn Féin has been critical of the Government's failure to hold the British Government to account for its polices in Ireland. Its approach to Brexit, the vote in the North and the Border is a monumental example of this failure. There is a crying need for a special designated status for the North within the European Union, but the Taoiseach has refused to accept or promote this position despite the vote of the people of the North and the majority support for this position in the Oireachtas and Assembly. He has also refused to advocate this position despite the fact that every citizen of the North has a right to Irish citizenship and a legal expectation that the Government will uphold his or her rights, which include the right to European citizenship after Brexit.  Let us contrast the Government's position, which is contained in Article 11 of the draft European Council negotiating guidelines, with Article 22, which contains the Spanish Government's position. Article 11 is ambiguous, opaque, conditional and qualified, whereas Article 22 is extremely clear, stating that after Brexit, no agreement between the European Union and British Government may apply to Gibraltar without the agreement of the Spanish and British Governments. This is exactly the type of veto the Government should have sought in keeping with its responsibilities for the North under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement. It is also the best negotiating position to minimise the dire consequences of Brexit for all the people of this island.  Has the Taoiseach ever said to the British Government that it should accept the vote of the people of the North? He can tell me; nobody else is listening.Has the Taoiseach ever put that point to the British Government? These are draft EU Council guidelines and, therefore, they can be amended. The Taoiseach has the time to amend them. Will he commit to looking for an amendment as I have set out?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	5	The Deputy and I differ on a number of issues in this regard. He does not believe that the Government is serious about dealing with Northern Ireland and the citizens of Northern Ireland. I disagree fundamentally with his political comment in that regard. He is the president and leader of his party and he has a specific responsibility now to see that an Executive is put in place in Northern Ireland, irrespective of his differences with the DUP, in order that we can have a functioning Executive that will, hopefully, put together a set of common objectives as to what the people of Northern Ireland regard as their priorities in respect of the Brexit negotiations. The Deputy will be well aware the people in the Republic voted for the abolition of Articles 2 and 3 on the basis that the Good Friday Agreement means that Northern Ireland is regarded as part of the United Kingdom until the people decide otherwise. The position there is that what I want to see in the final outcome of the negotiated documents is the language of the Agreement, which allows for the opportunity at some future time for the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic to vote in a referendum to have a united Ireland and that there can be a seamless readmission of an area that is part of the United Kingdom by virtue of the Good Friday Agreement being recognised, in the same way as Scotland is, as a member of the European Union without having to invoke Article 49. I hope the Deputy in his discussions with his party will see to it that, irrespective of political differences, a functioning Executive is put together as quickly as possible, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is available to help in every way in that regard because it is important. I pointed out yesterday that Northern Ireland is different from Gibraltar. Gibraltar joined the EU as part of the UK and any change in its status is a matter for bilateral consideration between the Kingdom of Spain and the UK. It is very different from Northern Ireland where we have an internationally legally binding agreement voted on by referendum, North and South. The people of Northern Ireland voted in the expectation and the understanding that their EU membership benefits would continue and they will continue. I have said to the British Prime Minister and her predecessor that the people in Northern Ireland have a very definite point of view and that since the Brexit referendum, of course, I recognise that Northern Ireland voted to stay, as did the people in Scotland. First Minister Sturgeon is now on the path of looking for a second independence referendum. I follow the Good Friday Agreement and our job as co-guarantor of that is to see that all the issues relevant to the Agreement are implemented in full.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	6	I will not take lectures from the Taoiseach about my responsibilities or, indeed, the responsibilities of Sinn Féin. We are very aware of those and we look to his Government to uphold its end of all that. However, he refused to answer my question. I asked him where he has said to the British Government that it should accept the vote of the people of the North. The Taoiseach clearly did not put that position but the main thrust of what I was trying to say was that these are draft negotiating guidelines and he has the opportunity to secure a stronger position. For example, he may know that the European Parliament voted earlier on a joint resolution, which contains stronger commitments about the North and the island of Ireland than either the Government's position or these guidelines. I am sure the Taoiseach knows that the only way to stop a hard economic border on the island of Ireland is to have special status for the North within the EU. I come back to what I said previously. The Taoiseach should have been seeking the type of position which the Spanish secured. His answer shows he does not understand his responsibility as Taoiseach under the terms of the Good Friday Agreement because there is now a new relationship. He has equal responsibility along with the British Government for all of this new relationship.Will the Taoiseach commit to that? Will he say "Yes" or "No"?

I fully understand my responsibilities here. These are draft guidelines and they are to be signed off by the Council of the European Union on 29 April. They are draft guidelines. There are 26 other countries involved with their particular points of view and one of those countries is Spain. The Spanish position in respect of Gibraltar is an entirely different concept from that which applies in the case of Northern Ireland. The Deputy is aware of the Good Friday Agreement. He is aware of a referendum, North and South. He is aware -----

We do not want a return to a hard border and we will not have a return to a hard border. That has been agreed by the Irish and British Governments and is reflected in the Prime Minister's letter triggering Article 50.

#BrendanHowlin	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-party	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-dob	unknown-#BrendanHowlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	16	We read in today's newspapers that the Tánaiste, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, yesterday secured Cabinet approval to establish an independent root and branch review of An Garda Síochána. The Taoiseach is aware that the Labour Party published draft terms of reference for such a review last weekend. We have seen no similar draft terms of reference from the Government. I will meet with the Tánaiste later today and I understand other bilateral meetings with the other leaders will also happen. We will support this process if we are satisfied it is fully independent and will lead to the necessary reforms that there is a consensus on in the House and among the public. At this stage, it is important the review gets under way. What I have not seen in the papers is any urgency to implement the existing proposals for reform. We have spoken in this Chamber many times about the many existing recommendations the Garda Inspectorate has published. We debated them during my time in Government and more recently in this House. There is no recent implementation update on those groundbreaking, important, specific recommendations. It is clear to me the commitment to reform at management level within An Garda Síochána is limited. In addition to our proposals on an independent review of An Garda Síochána, we proposed that the powers of the Policing Authority be expanded. These powers must include giving the Policing Authority the capacity to direct An Garda Síochána to implement the proposals made by the Garda Inspectorate. I am glad to see this proposal has gathered support from other parties in the House. Does the Taoiseach agree this change to the powers of the Policing Authority is needed? Will he task the Tánaiste with drafting the necessary legislative changes to allow this as a matter of urgency and in the meantime will he arrange for an urgent implementation update to be published on each of the recommendations of the Garda Inspectorate setting out what has been implemented to date, which ones are in the process of being implemented, including a clear timeline for each, and what are simply being ignored?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	17	I thank Deputy Howlin for his question and for his party's submission in this regard. One of the reasons the Government did not sign off finally yesterday in respect of a root and branch reform of the structure and future policing operations of An Garda Síochána is that, as I informed the House yesterday, I received the final report of the Fennelly commission last Friday at 6 p.m.I am duty-bound by law to refer that report to the Attorney General, and I intend to publish that report as soon as the Attorney General informs me that it is in order to do so. The reason that it has to go to the Attorney General is as to whether a question arises that there might be implications in respect of any pending case, legal or whatever. I hope that can apply this week, and it would be wrong of me or the Tánaiste to come into the House and say that we are now signing off on all of the issues in respect of future structures for the Garda Síochána, policing arrangements and so on without taking into account the potential impact of the recommendations that are contained in the final report of the Fennelly commission. The Tánaiste has undertaken to talk to the Opposition Members and spokespersons on justice so that the Oireachtas can have a complete view on this, and that is why I say that, when I receive authorisation to publish Fennelly in its final entity, everybody should have an opportunity to read that and see whether people have views as to how that impacts on the-----

The Tánaiste looked at the question of management and structures, composition, recruitment and training of personnel, culture and ethos of policing, and the structures and legislative basis for oversight and accountability. I confirm to the Deputy that she has not seen the Fennelly report and she has not been briefed on the Fennelly report. She does not know what is in the Fennelly report, nor can she until I receive notification from the Attorney General that it is in order to publish it. The Deputy mentioned reforms that were under way.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	21	The Commissioner's modernisation and renewal programme 2016 to 2021 is designed to address the hundreds of recommendations in various reports into An Garda Síochána, including the most recent report from the Garda Inspectorate, "Changing Policing in Ireland". That is a five-year programme with 73 recommendations in it. The current district model of policing will be replaced on a phased basis with a divisional one, where responsibilities are allocated on a functional rather than a geographical basis subject to modifications to meet the needs of large rural divisions and ensure that the close relationship with communities is maintained, which is so important. In line with international experience, a mid-term goal of 20% of civilians for the overall Garda workforce is to be achieved through a civilian-by-default policy to be adopted in relation to the filling of all new posts, other than operational policing posts, and non-operational policing posts that become vacant, a redeployment of gardaí and backfilling by suitably qualified civilians where necessary. Mr. Olson, who is in charge of the inspectorate, has been very clear on these things. Ongoing work to increase the Garda workforce to 21,000 personnel by 2021, comprising 15,000 Garda members, 2,000 Garda Reserve members and 4,000 civilians, is all under way. I take the Deputy's point about publishing the progress that there has been, and that is very important. I will see that the Tánaiste responds to that comprehensively.

We will engage on that basis. However, what I heard from the Taoiseach regarding what was happening right now was that there was an implementation of the Commissioner's agenda for reform. I am asking about the inspectorate's reports. They are ground breaking, far reaching and truly reforming. Will those specific recommendations be implemented?

I do not where the up-to-date publication of what is actually under way to be implemented is, but we will have that very shortly for everybody.As I said before in respect of confidence in the Commissioner, I retain confidence in her to see that the changes recommended independently are being rolled out and timelined, as happens in the case of plans in other areas, including education, jobs and so on. I also take the Deputy's point in regard to the independent Policing Authority. A number of vacancies have been advertised by the Policing Authority. Following the Government's decision, the nature of appointments at senior level in An Garda Síochána into the future will be independent of the Garda Commissioner and Government of the day. I believe this was the right thing to do. That process is under way and being followed. When the Tánaiste meets the Opposition spokespersons she will give them a full briefing on all of these matters.

These are the same banks that we, the public, bailed out to the tune of billions of euro. Some 17,000 mortgages have been found to be affected thus far and there are more than 2 million accounts being queried and examined. This has the potential to be a €500 million scandal. Mortgage holders have been over-charged to the tune of €20,000 to €30,000. All 15 lenders are involved, including Allied Irish Bank and Permanent TSB which we, the State, own. Two of the 15 lenders have confirmed that 15 families have lost their homes and a further 14 are facing repossessions. As we have details from only two banks, this is likely to be only the tip of the iceberg. Most, if not all, of the houses repossessed have been repossessed by the original lenders, the banks which did the damage originally. According to a statement made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Mr. Lane, there is a systemic and widespread aspect to the tracker scandal. He has said, "Underneath it all ... this is a cultural issue which is interpreting contracts in favour of the lender and not in favour of the customer". He has further stated that he could not rule out the hypothesis of collusion between some lenders. In view of those statements and this scandal will the Taoiseach ensure that free, professional legal and financial advice is made available to the mortgage holders affected? Will he give an assurance that the banks will be instructed to stop insisting that hard pressed families sign away their legal rights in order to access any degree of compensation and that any such signature already provided by defrauded borrowers will be rendered null and avoid? Will he also, through the Minister for Justice and Equality, ask the Garda fraud squad to call in the chief executives of the banks concerned for questioning with a view to prosecution for fraud?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	31	I note the comments by the Governor in respect of the tracker mortgages, including that consideration be given to follow through in regard to some of the activities that have gone on in this area. Nobody wants to see people lose their homes. The number of mortgages in distress has fallen substantially from what it was a number of years ago because of the various options put in place by Government at different times to help different categories of mortgage holders under pressure and cases in distress. A number of people have voluntarily given up their homes and others have availed of the services of MABS and other elements of support that have been provided by Government and the line Department. The allegation of illegal activities in respect of tracker mortgages will be followed-through. Deputy Healy will be aware that any person who has a difficulty with his or her mortgage is eligible for assistance in terms of financial and legal advice and to have representation made available to him or her to negotiate directly with the lenders in these cases.Unfortunately, in some cases there have not been any consultations or conversations between lenders and borrowers. At the end of the day, these things always have to be sorted out through some mediation facility. The Government has made a range of such facilities available. I hope people continue to avail of them. We would like to see as many of these cases as possible sorted out so that people can continue to live in their own homes.

We are talking about illegality on the part of the banks leading to mortgage distress and, in many cases, to the repossession of family homes and borrowers losing their properties. We learned from the banking inquiry that the culture permeating the banks was also endemic in the Central Bank and the Department of Finance. There is no guarantee that existing regulations will be implemented by any branch of the financial elites. The Government's task is to prevent fraud and, when fraud takes place, to prosecute those responsible. It is possible that the delay in ordering a Garda fraud investigation into this matter has already led to the destruction or alteration of relevant records with a view to blaming subordinates. Will the Taoiseach order an immediate criminal investigation to prevent any further cover-ups in this regard? Will he sack the highly paid public interest directors and Government nominees on the boards of these banks who failed to bring this matter to the attention of the Legislature?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	33	As the Deputy is aware, it is not for me to order criminal investigations. Where illegal activities are proven to have taken place, the full force of the criminal law is behind those who have illegal acts perpetrated against them. In other words, the criminal law will rightly apply in all cases where illegal activity has taken place.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	34	Page 143 of the programme for Government sets out a commitment to "continue to play an active role at the European Union Foreign Affairs Council, the OSCE and through the UN, in seeking diplomatic resolutions to crises and conflict, with particular reference to Syria, Iraq, Libya, and the Ukraine". Everybody will have been absolutely appalled and horrified by yesterday's barbaric attack on innocent civilians, including many children, in Syria. Up to 100 people were killed and over 250 people were injured. I ask the Taoiseach to outline what the Government intends to do to fulfil the programme for Government commitment with respect to the UN and the OSCE. Certain key countries that have been supportive of Syria must be held to account. There must be a degree of accountability regarding chemical attacks of this kind. As we all recall, the then US President said in 2012 that this was a red-line issue. Nothing happened as a result of that. People think they can act with impunity. It is important for the international community to stand firm on this issue. It needs to begin to engage in mechanisms to deal with it.
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	35	I can confirm that the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, attended last Monday's meeting of the Foreign Affairs Council in Brussels. He has attended all the Foreign Affairs Council meetings. Syria has always been on the agenda. From an Irish point of view, the Minister has been very forthright in his comments at these meetings. The entire UN, which was created for a world that no longer exists, needs to be able to reflect on what is happening. The situation in Syria is appalling. According to news reports, the war has gone on longer than the lives of many of the young children who are now the victims of chemical attacks. This is absolutely appalling. It has to be condemned unreservedly by right-thinking people. The Foreign Affairs Council of the European Union, on which we are represented by the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, is very forthright in its views. My view is that the UN needs reform to be far more effective in dealing with appalling actions like this.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	36	I want to ask the Taoiseach about legislation on information retrieval agreed between the Irish and British Governments on 15 October 2015. This was led jointly by the Houses of the Oireachtas and Westminster in January last year. As part of this process, the Government drafted and published an international agreement to establish the independent commission. The commission has not yet commenced because the British Government insists on imposing a so-called national security veto regarding the process. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, has raised this issue with the British Secretary of State, as have I. Has the Taoiseach raised this matter with the British Prime Minister? I have made four formal requests, some in writing, for a meeting with the Taoiseach and the Sinn Féin leadership to discuss these issues. Given the tone in which the Taoiseach addresses me every so often about the North, it would be expedient if he would agree to such a meeting.

On the matter of the talks, we are very much, in sporting parlance, in time added on for injuries. An earlier question referred to Brexit. In that context and in the context of dealing once and for all with the very delicate and sensitive issue of the horrific legacy in Northern Ireland, in what is not a post-conflict society, there is a need to ensure the many thousands of victims and families, and survivors are dealt with in a way that is real. The international treaty to which the Deputy referred is an important component of that, but other issues are the subject matter of discussions today in Belfast. I intend to be present at a meeting tomorrow. It is incumbent on everybody involved to ensure the legacy institutions, as established under the Stormont House Agreement, are up and running and implemented at the earliest opportunity. I welcome the assistance and involvement of Uachtarán Sinn Féin and his colleagues in that regard.

It is shocking that at least 100 families may have lost their homes because they were wrongly moved from tracker mortgages. When this matter was raised with the Governor of the Central Bank yesterday in a question posed by Deputy Sean Sherlock, the Governor said he cannot name and shame the 15 lending institutions or the number of accounts involved, or the details of how much compensation was paid, because of a legislative barrier. In this regard I refer to the financial services and pensions ombudsman Bill, which is on the Government's priority list. Will this matter be addressed so that the important issues raised by Deputy Healy and me can be dealt with? People are scandalised that obvious wrongdoing will not only not be investigated but cannot even be reported.

The amalgamation of the Financial Services Ombudsman Bureau and the Office of the Pensions Ombudsman is a priority for the Government. I expect the relevant Bill to be published during this session. The matter to which the Deputy referred will have to be addressed in the Bill.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	43	Last Friday, workers in Iarnród Éireann and Dublin Bus engaged in an act of solidarity with their colleagues in Bus Éireann. It was an act that I and my party, and more ordinary people than one might think, are prepared to defend because they are appalled by the role of the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross. Under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act 1990, anti-union legislation inspired by the policies of Mrs. Thatcher's Government in the UK, the action was outside of the law. Many people said they supported the action but felt it would have been better if some notice had been given. However, under the terms of the Industrial Relations Act it is impossible for workers to give advance notice of solidarity action because injunctions can, and will, be put in place. My question is as follows. Our party, in the tradition of James Larkin, is in favour of repealing anti-union legislation, including the Industrial Relations Act. Would the Taoiseach be prepared to comment on that proposal?

If Deputy Mick Barry is suggesting we should legislate for that kind of activity I disagree with him fundamentally. People in this country are entitled to go about their daily work, attend their workplace and expect that transport services can be provided. Strikes have been legitimate in Ireland and there are reasons for that. I am glad to see that both sides, unions and management, are back at the Workplace Relations Commission. The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, is at the Committee on Transport, Tourism and Sport today. I fundamentally disagree with Deputy Mick Barry's presentation of the kind of Ireland he wants to see.

We are now in April, however. Two weeks ago the Taoiseach said he would get back to me but nobody has confirmed dáta an athbhreithnithe.

The rest of them were not stopped. They talked about Syria, wildcat strikes and everything else. The programme for Government contains a commitment under the Health (Amendment) Act to provide safe places of access for people who are sick. The accident and emergency unit in Clonmel is not suitable. It is a crisis day in and day out. The Minister, Deputy Harris, has announced a mini-tender, aided and abetted by Deputy Lowry, so that they would have hotel accommodation there. I now find in a reply from the Minister to a parliamentary question that the mini-tender process is not even complete. It will be a year after that before any effort will be made to have proper accommodation for patients in south Tipperary, west Waterford and beyond. It is a disgraceful situation and something needs to be done before lives are lost, although hospital staff are doing their best in appalling conditions.

Last Sunday there was a massive show of unity in Horse and Jockey by those involved in the greyhound sector. One thousand people attended to discuss all issues within the industry, including mismanagement by the Irish Greyhound Board. Is it not now time for the Minister, Deputy Creed, and the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, to take action to resolve the impasse between the Dublin Greyhound Owners and Breeders Association and the Irish Greyhound Board, to get greyhound racing back in our capital city? Perhaps people should be removed if necessary. It is about time. Current and previous Ministers have left this situation down. It is a disgrace. Genuine people who breed and race greyhounds are being highly blackguarded. The Taoiseach knows that as well as I do.

This had been carried out by primary health nurses until 2008. It was withdrawn from schools due to austerity measures. When I put the question to the Minister he said it seemed logical to reintroduce that simple check carried out by primary health nurses. I asked this question of the Taoiseach a number of weeks ago and he said he would have a look at it. The Minister stated he would undertake to have a look at it in the action plan he was drawing up, which was due to be published at the end of February but we have not seen it.

One such Bill is the Technological Universities Bill, which, as the Taoiseach knows, has been stuck on Committee Stage for some time. I have asked about this previously because it is very important for all those consortia and institutes of technology involved in the process. There is huge uncertainty regarding the funding model for these technological universities. Their governance model, ability to borrow, investment in research and development and capital funding will all be underpinned by the legislation. The institutes involved are asking us whether we can find out when the Bill will be progressed so they have the certainty they need.

I wish to raise one of those Garda stations, Tubbercurry in County Sligo, on the N17. It was built in 1960 and there was one sergeant and three gardaí, all male. Today, we have two sergeants, nine gardaí and two bean gardaí. It is the third busiest station in the Sligo-Leitrim division, after Sligo and Carrick-on-Shannon - it is hard to believe. I understand that the numbers are to increase to two sergeants and 12 gardaí in 2018, but there are a number of serious health and safety issues with this Garda station. There is no interview room, office space, privacy or disabled access, and there are other issues also. The Garda building unit is aware of this situation and has visited the site. I ask the Taoiseach to use his good office to progress this application further.

I ask the Taoiseach to advise the House what developments have occurred with regard to yesterday's Eir announcement. What is planned for the hundreds of thousands of homes across the country that have been left outside the latest expanded area, including large portions of Sligo-Leitrim, south Donegal and west Cavan?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	92	The Minister for Communications, Climate Action and Environment gave a full interview on this yesterday following the Government's meeting and decision. Eir said that it will do a further 300,000 houses in an area that it was not originally intended to include. The commercial body will do 300,000 more houses than it had originally intended. That means that the nature of the contract and tender for areas outside that, to which Deputy McLoughlin refers, is now the subject of an increased focus. The Minister has pointed out the timescale for the bringing of fibre to each home over the next years, which will ensure that every region of the country, however spread out, will have the opportunity to avail of what is the equivalent of electricity in this day and age.

Nobody yet knows the outcome of these negotiations and whether it may involve an amendment to the European treaties. If that is the case, it will necessitate a referendum here in Ireland. Can the Taoiseach confirm that it is not possible at this stage to rule out a referendum on the future relationships between the UK and the EU, in view of the importance of it for Ireland?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	94	Deputy Fleming is well aware that a referendum on the EU treaties is only necessary in this country when the Attorney General of the day advises the Cabinet of the day that there is a transfer of sovereignty under the treaties. That is not envisaged here. What is envisaged is that the outcome of the negotiations will be for the United Kingdom to have as close as possible a relationship with the European Union, of which we are a member. However, given our traditional connections both with Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom on a bilateral basis we want to hold on to those very close trading, social and political relationships. It is only in those circumstances that this would apply, and that is not envisaged.

We have had huge problems over a number of years in this country. Today, in Buswells Hotel across the road, the IFA is launching a framework for negotiations with vulture funds. The loans of hundreds of farmers have been sold to vulture funds and they cannot get a deal done, as they would have been able to do with the standard banks. We find they are now outside the scrutiny of the Central Bank. It is a huge problem, and one of the things that the IFA has sought is that the Government publicly commit to a rebalancing of the power between the borrowers and these new owners of the loans. This is having a huge impact. The vulture funds want a quick turnaround and they are prepared to sell out the farm over the heads of the farmer. It is a big problem around the country.

This programme covered the situation in Bessborough. I want to ask the Taoiseach about the publication of the second interim report from the commission of investigation into mother and baby homes. The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone, had indicated that the report would be published at the end of March. She has now resiled from that commitment and is stalling the publication of the report. She says that both herself and the Government need more time to consider the recommendations. That is an entirely unacceptable position to adopt. The Taoiseach is aware of the trauma that was caused by the discoveries at Tuam. Naturally, it has triggered deep, personal concerns for the survivors of these awful regimes across the State, and the least the Government owes to society at large is the prompt publication of this interim report so that we can collectively take stock and move forward in the most constructive way possible.

It is right and proper for Government to assess carefully every interim report that comes before it, this one included. The question arising from the mother and baby homes, as one of a whole series in this general area, is one that needs to be considered very carefully. I expect the Minister, Deputy Zappone, will bring a memo on this matter before the Government next week, and the report, once Government adopts it, will be published then.

It also states that common supports sought from GPs in this regard include access to counsellors and psychologists. The strategy recommends that appropriately trained staff should be available at primary care level to provide programmes to prevent mental health problems and to promote well being. Has there been sign-off regarding these counselling or psychological services at primary care level for 2017, and if so how many have been signed off?

It pledged to update the guidelines within three to six months but we are ten months on from its publication and wind farms are being foisted on communities, with plans for more. There is more stress and division than ever in those communities and they are asking when the Government will get off its hands and publish the guidelines as promised ten months ago. In my own community in the Finn valley in Donegal, those concerned have already mobilised against and defeated a wind farm application which would have imposed a major wind farm very close to residential premises. Now, a second wave of applications is coming in for the same type of proposal and residents are looking to Government to protect individuals. Nobody is against renewable energy, development or infrastructure but we are against these farms being imposed on a community against its will in very close proximity to individuals where there are ample other opportunities to site them. Can the Taoiseach give clarity on this to the communities in the Finn valley and across the State, who are looking for the Government to fulfil the commitment it gave to them in the programme for Government ten months ago?

However, I was contacted earlier this week about Coláiste an Chreagáin in Mountbellew. Parents of students at the school received text messages stating that the school would not be taking enrolments in September. Are plans in place to ensure there will be full consultation with parents of this school prior to any decision on its future?

Teachers are employed by the boards of management and paid by the Department of Education and Skills. The Government has no intention of closing down any small schools without the consent of the parents. In some cases, parents decide that a school is so small they need their children to go to a larger school with better facilities but the Government has a long-standing position of not closing small schools. Whoever sent the text message needs to be clear about that. It was not a Government direction.
#PearseDoherty	unknown-#PearseDoherty-party	unknown-#PearseDoherty-dob	unknown-#PearseDoherty-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	112	I move:That leave be granted to introduce a Bill entitled an Act to provide for the protection of certain borrowers who are parties to credit agreements in respect of which the owners of the credit are unregulated through the regulation of the owners of the credit; and to provide for related matters.It is apt that Deputy Martin Kenny questioned the Taoiseach on what the IFA told us this morning about the fear farmers have that the vultures are about to pounce on them. The Taoiseach says it is not an issue for the Order of Business but it is definitely an issue for this part of today's schedule. My Bill will, once and for all, regulate vulture funds.After a long period of procrastination the previous Government eventually acted to regulate the so-called vulture funds when they were buying up much of the country through the purchase of commercial and residential loan books. We all know that those are the loan books the banks want off their books. They are made up of small businesses, farm holdings and mortgage holders struggling with arrears. In recent years tens of thousands of families woke up to a letter through the door informing them they now owed money to a company they had not taken out a loan with and one they had never heard of or engaged with. When they tried to contact this company, they could not find an address or even a phone number to make such contact. There was no regulation in place and after much pressure from Sinn Féin and others in many campaign groups, the previous Government eventually moved to regulate the vultures. However, what happened next was that the vultures began to lobby. From responses to parliamentary questions I tabled, we all know the Minister for Finance met the vultures on many occasions and his officials met them even more frequently. That continues even to this day. Subsequently, the legislation that had originally set out to regulate the vultures was weakened. It was decided not to regulate the owner of the debt, but instead the middleperson. Sinn Féin, on Committee Stage, defended the interests of those struggling to pay their mortgages and we sought to ensure the owners were regulated. Unfortunately, Fine Gael and Labour Party members voted against our amendments and the Fianna Fáil members did not turn up at the committee for that part of the proceedings. As a result the vulture funds are not regulated and the middlemen are. The Central Bank's latest figures, indicating 41% of family mortgages owned by unregulated vulture funds are now in deep arrears, are extremely worrying. When we hear about banks turning profits and bankers getting grotesque bonuses, we have to remember that they have sold many of the tough cases to the unregulated vultures to deal with. Today I am moving a Bill that seeks to regulate the owners which have bought up and continue to buy up much of the credit of this State. The half-hearted approach of regulating the middleman has not been enough. The Central Bank has indicated its support for the approach I have set out, which my party has called for since the issue first raised its head. The Bill returns to the heads of Bill that the Department of Finance itself produced when it first assessed how to deal with the issue. This was the plan before the vultures got in the ear of our policymakers. Today I am putting forward one part of a plan, a Bill that I hope can get cross-party support. However, we need to do far more to clip the vultures' wings. The Minister needs to take direct and immediate action based on the powers he has. He needs to direct the banks, in which we have major shareholdings, and NAMA to stop selling to the vultures - no ifs or buts. He should also act immediately to close down the remaining tax loopholes, such as the CGT exemption that is still open to the vultures that are buying up much of the country tax-free or at a reduced tax rate. I believe there is scope for the Minister to follow Belgium's lead in introducing laws that prevent the use of this country as a base for vulture funds as they attack developing countries throughout the world. There is a clear set of policies that can clip the vultures' wings, but unfortunately to date the political will has not existed on Government benches to take them on. That must change and I hope that can begin today. I hope the Bill can win cross-party support and send out a clear message that a free hand will no longer be given to the vulture funds.

The Bill, as introduced, aims to set up a specially designated commission to review the establishment and boundaries of a demographically proportional town council system. At the outset, it is important to set out the motivation for a restoration of town councils because many would ask why we would bother with bringing back this level of government. It is simply because so many other ordinary people have been asking about the neglect and lack of focus for our town centres across Ireland since the town councils were done away with and with them the special budgets for town cores which were vaporised into thin air. A democratic system that represents people living in our towns is needed now more than ever because we are moving towards an ever more urbanised Ireland. Debates in this Chamber concerning rural Ireland are frequent and rightly so but there have been very few about urban Ireland. When one takes account of the new national framework plan, which will see higher densities and increased urbanisation, the requirement to have people representing these large towns is all the more pressing and critical. At the time of the dissolution of more than 80 town councils in 2014 the then Minister, Mr. Phil Hogan, hailed it as reform, but nothing could be further from the truth. Of course, nobody would mourn the loss of 700 politicians from the political field, but suddenly people living in these towns found that they also lost much more than just councillors as they were part of a much larger geographical electoral area under the reformed system. A host of different things went with those councillors. The dedicated budgets for their towns, in many cases over €10 million per annum, are gone. Their statutory powers in respect of their own town centres are gone. The power to set their own rates for their town is gone. This year small businesses across the country are seeing their rates increased above and beyond normal rates because of equalisation. The special focus on the urban space is gone. In the three years since the abolition of town councils people have now realised what a crucial role these bodies actually played in developing life in these urban spaces. I unashamedly have a huge passion for the local government system in this country having spent 17 years in it serving at both town and county level, many of those years alongside the Government Chief Whip during her time on Meath County Council. I understand the value of having a strong town council structure that can look after the many urban areas in our country, and the unique challenges and requirements for people living in our towns. During my time on both councils I can recall when our county council was mired in debt but our town council was actually running a surplus. This meant we were able to raise our own finance to develop a new arts centre, parks and enhanced urban spaces. We did not have to go to elected members from other areas to sanction finance for what was needed in our own town for our own people. The rest of Europe embraces the local government structure. In the United Kingdom efforts are under way to try to reinvigorate this very local layer of government. However, in this country instead of embracing it we squeeze the life out of it and then mock its corpse by calling it reform as we continue the drive towards centralisation. Despite the constitutional guarantees that buttress local authorities in Ireland it remains susceptible to the legislative reforms from central government. The perceived control that central government has over the local level was the focus of a report from the Council of Europe in 2013 which highlighted the need for greater protection for the subsidiarity principle in government. In addition to the structural changes implemented in the Local Government Reform Act, it also did very little to reverse the overarching power that central government has over the policy framework for local government. As I outlined earlier, the Bill as introduced aims to set up a specially designated commission to review the establishment and boundaries of a demographically proportional town council system. The commission will also be tasked with setting out the proposed functions, responsibilities and rating powers of a town council and their composition and size. The commission will be required to report to the Minister within six months of its establishment. The Bill is designed to set up a new town council system on a fair and equitable basis across Ireland in time for the 2019 local elections. It will help to empower communities in our towns to take control of their local areas. It will ensure the new structure recognises the major population shift in Ireland and put forward a new range of powers for a tier of governance closest to our citizens. This measure will help give power back to local communities at a time when more and more people feel alienated and removed from the decision-making process that affects them.

It is absolutely extraordinary. Even more extraordinary, the Taoiseach does not know when the next meeting will be. I want an answer to a very specific question. In my experience, it is unprecedented to table a parliamentary question and not get an answer within four or five days. I have raised this on several occasions. I tabled a parliamentary question on 23 February - I want to know if the Taoiseach's committee discussed this - asking how many people under the remit of the Department of Justice and Equality were suspended on full pay pending investigation. I received an answer stating it was 26. I asked a follow-up question, which was whether the Minister could give a breakdown of the agencies under the Department of Justice and Equality in which these suspensions took place, the grade involved and the length of time the suspensions were in play. The Minister told me that she could not answer me. I find it completely unacceptable that she refuses to give me information. I do not believe that she does not have the information. To be frank, I suspect the information is being withheld because it is relevant to the question of whether Nóirín O'Sullivan should remain in position when she is under investigation for very serious matters.

The Government has responded to the issues that have arisen in recent times in respect of An Garda Síochána, particularly in terms of fixed charge notices and mandatory alcohol testing. The Government has responded and not just a Cabinet sub-committee, which is a feature of Government that allows for issues to be discussed and recommendations to be made for consideration by Cabinet. As I pointed out, the Government has decided that there should be a root and branch analysis of An Garda Síochána in terms of its structures and the policing role and responsibility. This will deal with the management and structures for all functions carried out by An Garda Síochána; the composition, recruitment and training of personnel; the culture and the ethos of policing; and the structures and the legislative basis for oversight and accountability. This is to be carried out completely independently of An Garda Síochána. I assume the parliamentary question to which the Deputy refers is one that he tabled. The committee does not discuss questions submitted by Deputies to the relevant Minister which go through the Office of the Ceann Comhairle.

I put it to the Taoiseach it is extraordinary given the revelations about the latest debacle of 146,000 being wrongly summonsed to court, 14,700 being wrongly convicted and close to 1 million breathalyser tests that never took place having been falsely recorded. The Garda Commissioner stated that they are organisationally shameful, were false and, at worst, there was deception and, at best, incompetence. Given the scale of the falsehoods involved and the disruption to the criminal justice system, does the Taoiseach consider it acceptable that the Garda Commissioner did not inform the Minister of it and did not inform the Policing Authority that such an audit was under way? Has the Taoiseach spoken to the Policing Authority about it? What is the Government's sense of the failure of the Commissioner to inform the Policing Authority? I do not want to be fobbed off with "an administrative oversight" because I do not buy it. Given the scale of the falsehoods and the undermining of the criminal justice system, why the Policing Authority was not informed about this matter is a very serious issue.

The Policing Authority should have been informed. The chairperson of the independent Policing Authority, Ms Feehily, is doing an exemplary job in independently and objectively dealing with the issues for which it has responsibility and in respect of which further powers may well be given to it. The Tánaiste only became aware of the figures in respect of the mandatory alcohol testing and the fixed charge notices on 23 March when the press conference was put together by An Garda Síochána.

I was a member of the last justice reform committee. The Government does not have at its meetings the Garda Commissioner, the chairperson of the Policing Authority or the senior administrators in the Department of Justice and Equality, all of whom should have been there to answer questions of key Ministers in advance of any decisions being made at Cabinet. Did the Taoiseach not see it as appropriate to convene a meeting where all those principals would be present to answer questions such as the one just asked by Deputy Martin? Before the Cabinet could come to profound decisions such as whether to have a Patten-style root and branch commission, surely the precursor would have been to have at least one but probably a series of meetings of the Cabinet sub-committee asking the views of the Policing Authority, asking the Commissioner questions directly and asking the Department of Justice and Equality those questions. I welcome the Taoiseach's response this morning that he will shortly publish an implementation plan. However, does he agree that in the interim we also need amendments to the powers of the Policing Authority to make directions on reform to be implemented by An Garda Síochána?

I was not referring to publishing a plan on reform but to a progress report on a plan that has been published already. The Garda Inspectorate has made its views known and we considered those views at the Cabinet sub-committee. The question now is one of getting on with implementing those changes and that work is under way. The programme is for a couple of years, as the Deputy is aware. We discussed the issue of civilianisation, which means taking gardaí out of the system so they can be on the beat by replacing them with civilians. The Olson report is very comprehensive and is being followed through. I will provide everyone with an update on that. 
#RuthCoppinger	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-party	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-dob	unknown-#RuthCoppinger-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	164	It seems the seriousness of this issue had not permeated the Government. The reputation of the whole system of justice has never been so low, yet the Taoiseach has not bothered to convene a committee on which key players sit and is choosing not to use the forum in question. If the Government is looking after all of this, why is the Taoiseach persisting with the fallacy that it is possible to investigate the most senior garda in the land, while leaving her in situ, with all of her authority, to undermine the investigation? We had the recent revelations, with Sergeant Maurice McCabe and others being blackguarded. Will the Taoiseach comment on the position of Garda Superintendent Dave Taylor who, having been arrested over leaking information about another Garda scandal four years ago, returned to work on 14 February last only to have a fresh disciplinary case brought against him on the very same matter by the same Commissioner? It seems Fine Gael is doing its best to defend the Garda Commissioner and keep her in place, with Fianna Fáil seemingly happy to facilitate it in doing so. We are hearing disturbing reports of what gardaí are describing internally as a praetorian guard around the Commissioner. Two retired gardaí have been brought in to protect the Commissioner. Is the Taoiseach aware that a communication has been sent to every single garda who could testify to the Charleton investigation stating that he or she must liaise with the internal committee the Taoiseach was not even told about before testifying to the commission? Was the Taoiseach aware of this or did the Commissioner not bother telling him about it? The Commissioner hired two retired gardaí and did not bother informing the Government about it. She is clearly giving the proverbial two fingers to any idea that she will be neutral while this investigation takes place. I am surprised the Taoiseach has not convened the committee to ask her about this matter.

#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	166	This is all very strange because it is another case of déjà vu. The Labour Party is now proposing a root and branch review of An Garda Síochána, having voted against such a review in government when we made a similar proposal. Some of this goes back before my time. According to the 2015 report from the Garda Inspectorate, a significant number of the recommendations in its report had been made in one form or another over the past two decades. This takes us back to Fianna Fáil whose position is that it is unable to express confidence in the Commissioner and would remove her if it was in government. However, the party has also indicated it will not support a motion requiring the Government to do exactly that. As a result of the Government's rejection of root and branch, Patten-style reform, the Commissioner is answerable to the Minister for Justice and Equality rather than an independent policing authority with real powers. The Government is not approaching this issue as it should, nor did it deal with the case of the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Mr. Alan Shatter, and previous Garda Commissioner as it should have. I do not have any great confidence that it will approach this issue properly. While we were told the Cabinet was briefed on the establishment of a commission to examine the future of policing, we were not told whether this came from the Cabinet committee on justice reform. Did the committee discuss this issue at its meeting of 7 March? The Taoiseach does not even have a date for the next meeting of the committee.  This is a case of "I told you so" because the previous Government dismissed our proposal in the most defensive, triumphalist and dismissive way when it had a large majority and did not have to listen to Sinn Féin or anyone else in opposition. Now the decent members of An Garda Síochána and those who depend on them to keep the peace and keep us safe have been let down.

As the Deputy knows, the Cabinet is the body which makes the ultimate decisions in respect of all Cabinet committees. That is why it was one of the many discussions that took place at Cabinet and the decision was to have a root and branch analysis of the future of policing, the structure, role and responsibility of An Garda Síochána and so on. The decision involved the Oireachtas which is the reason Opposition spokespersons and leaders, including Deputy Adams, will have their say. When the Attorney General advises publication of the second Fennelly report, they will be given copies and will be able to take the report into account. This is to ensure that we, as an Oireachtas, get the future structure, role, responsibility and work of An Garda Síochána right and citizens can have confidence and trust in the body. That is not to say this is a whole new body of work. As I pointed out to Deputy Howlin, the recommendations of the independent inspectorate are now being implemented. The independent Policing Authority, with which Deputy Howlin had a very close association when it was being set up, came into effect last year under the supervision of its chairperson, Josephine Feehily, who is doing a first class job in its independence and oversight. The Tánaiste is not averse to giving the authority extra powers and she will take advice from Members on that matter.

#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	answer	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	183	I propose to take Questions Nos. 7 to 14, inclusive, together. I spoke with Prime Minister May by telephone on the day Article 50 was triggered. I acknowledged the constructive tone of the Article 50 letter and the references to Ireland and Northern Ireland. We discussed the next steps in the Brexit process and agreed to maintain close contact at political and official level. We also discussed the political situation in Northern Ireland. It has been clear from the start that the United Kingdom's departure from the European Union will have significant economic, political and social implications for Ireland. The Government has been working very hard for more than two years, even before the UK referendum, to engage with all sectors across the island of Ireland, fully analyse our main areas of concern and develop our negotiating priorities. These are to minimise the impact on our trade and the economy; protect the Northern Ireland peace process, including through maintaining an open Border; continue the common travel area with the United Kingdom; and work for a positive future for the European Union. The Government and UK Government are agreed that a close and friction-free economic and trading relationship between the UK and the EU, including Ireland, is in our best interests. We note that our particular concerns, including in relation to the Good Friday Agreement, were acknowledged by Prime Minister May in her letter. They were also reflected in last week's resolution on Brexit by the European Parliament and they are set out in the draft guidelines circulated by President Tusk, which are to be finalised at a meeting of the 27 member states on 29 April. The consistent, strong acknowledgement of the Irish issues in each of these documents is evidence of the extensive engagement by Ireland with our partners at political, democratic and official level in recent months. As I stated the other day, now that Article 50 has been triggered, we will publish shortly before the European Council meeting on 29 April a consolidated paper providing more detail about our priorities and approach to the negotiations ahead. A report on the civic dialogue process to date is available on merrionstreet.ie. Further all-island civic dialogue events and consultations will be held, as required, in the coming months.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	184	I have two questions in this group. We spent some time on this yesterday and we had a debate on Brexit. Will the Taoiseach elaborate on a question I asked? Will he seek an explicit reference to the continued EU citizenship of Northern Ireland residents post-2019 in the Union's negotiation instructions? This has implications far beyond what would happen if there was reunification. The German unification which the Taoiseach referenced yesterday involved the creation of new EU citizens. In this case, we are talking about people who today are EU citizens and we want their continued rights to that citizenship protected. That has many practical implications for the negotiations, including freedom of residence in the Union and guaranteeing access to services. Will the Taoiseach propose an amendment in the draft negotiating guidelines to include an explicit reference to the continued EU citizenship of residents of Northern Ireland? With regard to the consolidated paper, what are the key areas that need to be addressed? Has the Taoiseach pursued special status and a special trading zone on this island? Will the paper detail the Government's approach to key issues such as trade between the island of Ireland and the UK in a post-Brexit scenario where there could be tariffs and where Britain could be outside the customs union?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	185	Under the constitutional framework of the Good Friday Agreement, citizens of Northern Ireland have the right to be British citizens, Irish citizens, or both and Brexit will not change that. Since the referendum outcome, our priority has been to ensure the terms of the Agreement are both recognised and accommodated in the final settlement between the UK and the EU. We have engaged extensively with the EU and its institutions about this and there is now a recognition at European level of the importance of the Agreement and its understanding. As co-guarantor of that, we will work to see that those provisions are protected. The legal provisions governing citizenship and citizenship through naturalisation are set out in the Nationality and Citizenship Act 1956, as amended. Any person living on the island of Ireland, one of whose parents or grandparents was an Irish citizen, is entitled to Irish citizenship by descent and may make an application for a passport directly to the Passport Office. Similarly, any person born on the island of Ireland prior to 1 January 2005 has an entitlement to Irish citizenship and, therefore, European citizenship and may also make an application for a passport directly to the Passport Office. Post 1 January 2005, the entitlement to Irish citizenship of persons born on the island of Ireland to non-national parents is governed by sections 6A and 6B of the 1956 Act, as amended. The Act states: "A person born in the island of Ireland shall not be entitled to be an Irish citizen unless a parent of that person has, during the period of 4 years immediately preceding the person's birth, been resident in the island of Ireland for a period of not less than 3 years or periods the aggregate of which is not less than 3 years." Citizenship through the naturalisation process, on the other hand, is based, among other factors, on the individual having the required lawful residence in the jurisdiction of the State. The Act requires a period of one year's continuous residency in the State immediately before the date of application for naturalisation and during the eight years immediately preceding that period to have a further total residence in the State amounting to four years. That relates to the technical issues. We want to protect the common travel area arrangements. The point the Deputy raised will be followed through by me in these negotiations.
#GerryAdams	unknown-#GerryAdams-party	unknown-#GerryAdams-dob	unknown-#GerryAdams-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	186	The Taoiseach may have said when he will publish the consolidated paper and I may have missed that. That has to be done in sufficient time to allow those of us who want to persuade the Government of the need to make amendments to the draft EU guidelines to do so because, as I said during Leaders' Questions, we are not satisfied that these guidelines are clear enough or that they go far enough. It remains my position - I do not mean this to be offensive - that the Taoiseach and the Government do not understand the huge shift in the relationships within the island and between the two islands since the Good Friday Agreement. The British Government is not just able to make declarations at this time without the Government having co-equal status to deal with it on that basis. The Taoiseach earlier differentiated between the case of Gibraltar and that of the North. Of course, there is a difference. The difference is that the Spanish Government believes that Gibraltar is part of its sovereign territory. Whether it is or not is another issue but that is what the government believes. However, our Government has to believe, as many of the people of the island believe, that the island of Ireland should have territorial sovereignty and in the processes set out under the Good Friday Agreement, we have a responsibility - the Government specifically has a constitutional responsibility - to advance that objective. On Saturday last, on a radio programme with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, he reminded us that Fine Gael is The United Ireland Party. Let us see some evidence of that. We need to have the time, the forum and the ability to look again at what the Government will bring forward and the space that will allow us to make specific amendments in order that we can influence the outcome. Will the Taoiseach give a commitment that he will do all of this in that spirit?

The point he made is central to the future negotiations and, therefore, that will be covered in the consolidated paper. In response to Deputy Adams, there will be sufficient time to consider this when it is published. He has written to some Members of the European Parliament and has expressed his view that both the Irish and British Governments have reneged on their responsibilities in so far as the Good Friday Agreement is concerned.

However, in respect of the potential for a united Ireland, the visionaries who put the Good Friday Agreement together foresaw a time when that may become a decision to be made by the people of the North and the people of the Republic. The answer to the Deputy's question is that there will be time to consider the consolidated paper, and rightly so, because these are the most important negotiations, both between Ireland and the UK and between the UK and the EU, of which we will continue to be a member, for many years. They will impact on all our citizens for many years to come and, therefore, everybody should have their say.
#EamonRyanGP	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-party	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-dob	unknown-#EamonRyanGP-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	195	On the negotiating strategy, the point I made last night in our Brexit debate was that we should be looking to push the Commission and the Council to enter talks on areas where there can be co-operation into the future. Prime Minister May is in the Financial Times today saying a trade deal will not come until after the Brexit talks are finished and that is probably right. There is a whole range of other standards we will have to get co-operation on in energy, digital services, environmental rules and so on. It does not make sense for our strategy to be, first, to talk for six months about whether the UK will pay its exit bill and on the divorce terms and then to start talking about certain areas of co-operation. The Taoiseach should be proactive when it comes to the Council meeting. His officials should set up a safe space in advance in which to discuss some of the standards that are set by the European Union. They should not go into the sensitive area of tariffs or the detailed trade arrangements. There are certain key standards we need agreement on in how energy markets work and in how digital services, privacy and other rules are set and agreed. It is in our interests, with the greatest risk at play, to get those standards and a safe space in which to talk about them straight away in the negotiations rather than waiting six months in what is already a very tight timetable. Would the Taoiseach agree to such a negotiating approach? Will he push it at the Council?
#EndaKenny	unknown-#EndaKenny-party	unknown-#EndaKenny-dob	unknown-#EndaKenny-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	196	Deputy Ryan's question is valid. Article 50 sets out the process for the so-called divorce proceedings over a two-year period. If they are not concluded within that period, an extension can only happen with the unanimous support of the European Council which I assume would be given. The article also clearly states the future framework of the future relationship must be taken into account. These two things confuse lots of people because on the one hand we say we will talk only about the exit strategy and wait until it is concluded before we start talking about the future strategy and yet, on the other hand, Article 50 itself says we must take into account what the future framework is. It may well be that when the European Council comes together on 29 April to sign off on the negotiating foundations there will be some discussion about whether we do this on the basis of a series of pillars that move forward together in respect of the divorce proceedings as distinct from the future trading relationship which is the fundamental issue that will follow. My view is if we focus exclusively on the question of what the assessment of charges might be for the British Government and these are principles and modalities to be followed it would be far better to talk about a range of issues in respect of the exit process by the United Kingdom before we run into any particular stone walls. The Deputy raised a question about common positions. Energy, water and animal health are issues that could be considered for an all-island situation here. The European Union of 27 has its own agenda - the Single Market, the single digital market, the capital markets and how we continue to invest for prosperity and future job opportunities. It is the European Union agenda for the future. The question here is to negotiate what the future relationship of the United Kingdom will be with those 27, one of which will be Ireland. It is a common agenda of the 27. The future framework and that structure of negotiation between the UK and the European Union is one where the negotiations will obviously get into serious detail in the time ahead.

The Taoiseach should be establishing a pillar straight away, not waiting for the autumn. We should be leading co-operation in that area, not just from an Irish perspective although it will affect Ireland more than anyone else. We should be leading Europe in that approach. We have an interlocutory position and we should use it to lead the safe space talks on those sorts of regulations and standards. That is what we need to do straight away and not wait six months into the autumn as the Commission seems to be suggesting.

Right now, the European Parliament is debating its comprehensive resolution. It is interesting to hear Deputy Ryan talk about bilateral discussions on key elements of what would be a new acquis. The European Parliament points out it would be contrary to European law for any individual country to have any such bilateral discussions and that it can only be done on a unilateral-multilateral basis through the 27. Michel Barnier, the chief negotiator, speaking in the European Parliament today, said very incisively of the trade agreement that the devil will be in the detail. There is no expectation that this will be done within the timeframe. The reality is if there is no deal and no withdrawal agreement there will be an automatic disorderly exit on 30 March 2019 which is now under two years away. Does the Taoiseach expect there to be a withdrawal agreement within the two-year timeframe? Does he expect that subsequent to that there will be a transition agreement? Is it his understanding it is what will currently be worked upon? What sort of a timeframe does he envisage for transitional arrangements before the complete exit from the European Union, the end of the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice and the full severance of connections between the United Kingdom and the European Union?
#JoanBurtonLAB	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-party	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-dob	unknown-#JoanBurtonLAB-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	204	Some time ago, Mrs May was at pains to announce on a number of occasions, as were many members of her Cabinet and many leading Brexiteers, that no deal is better than a bad deal. While the tone of her letter, which we discussed last week, is quite emollient, there is absolutely no sign from the British Government that the people who are pro-Brexit, who seem to be in the majority, have moved away from that position. In that context, it is very difficult to see at this point how the negotiations will be successfully concluded. We now have a situation where Northern Ireland is not represented at all in the negotiations. It does not sound like it will become engaged any time soon as a result of the collapse of the power sharing institutions and with both parties seemingly determined to avoid, in practice, any recommencement of the institutions, notwithstanding the fact that they are talking. It is unfortunate but it seems to be a very dug-in position by both parties to the previous power sharing executives. How does the Taoiseach envisage Northern Ireland will be represented? The Taoiseach talked a number of minutes ago about negotiations between Britain and Ireland but, as the Taoiseach has been at pains to say to us, Ireland is very much in the EU 27. Last week, Michael O'Leary said he saw a situation in which it was possible that air travel arrangements could be severely disrupted for a number of months in the event of a total British leaving. There was also an interesting comment by one of the Taoiseach's potential successors when the Minister for Social Protection said the Border would be a camera on a pole. I do not know if that was him acknowledging there was going to be a Border. For a lot of us, a camera on a pole could potentially be quite a hard Border and quite a difficult development. Was he speaking for the Government or was he just giving us the benefit of his thinking aloud?

It is with the Union that this happens. That is why I have explained to others internationally that it is important to understand what the European Union is, what it stands for, how it functions and how trade deals are put together. Michel Barnier has commented on a few occasions that he thinks it would be possible to conclude the "divorce proceedings", as they are called, within the two-year framework. Whether that is possible or not is anybody's guess. When these negotiations start in earnest, both about the withdrawal and the future relationship, I expect them to become complicated. Article 50 is clear, however, in that, if it is not concluded, one either has the option of blunt removal with all that entails or an extension of time granted unanimously by the members of the European Council, which I would expect would be granted were that situation to arise. However, as the Deputy says, nobody can say exactly what the outcome there will be. I expect that there has to be a transition period. As to putting a time on it, it could be quite extensive.

The trading area has become quite complicated. In response to Deputy Burton, I remain optimistic that the politicians in Northern Ireland will accept their responsibilities and that, in respect of the two main parties, the DUP and Sinn Féin, we will get out of that a functioning executive authority, which is very important for Northern Ireland. I assume that Secretary of State Brokenshire would be able to legislate for that retrospectively when the Commons returned after the Easter recess. I hope that the main parties can put this together and that we will have a functioning Executive. It may hold differences of opinion but at least it could have a common set of objectives for the people that it represents across the North. In respect of the Border, the position is that, on behalf of the Irish Government and the British Government, we have a clear understanding of there being no return to a hard Border. By that I mean customs posts on the Border as traditionally applied. My reason for being so clear and so strong about this is that it brought with it sectarian violence and all of the issues that arose in the troubled past that we had in Northern Ireland and between Northern Ireland and the Republic. We are not going back there. That is the political groundwork. It is a political challenge to deal with that, not just a matter of mere technology.

The Cabinet committees on housing and on health have met three times each, the committees on economy, trade and jobs and on Brexit twice each, and the committees on social policy and public service reform, on justice reform, on European affairs, on infrastructure, environment and climate action, and on arts, Irish and the Gaeltacht have each met once. A further round of Cabinet sub-committee meetings takes place next Monday.
#MichaelMartin	unknown-#MichaelMartin-party	unknown-#MichaelMartin-dob	unknown-#MichaelMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	210	I thank the Taoiseach for his reply, but is there a case for a review of the existence of these committees? It was revealed that the justice reform committee had not met since March, but the extraordinary debacle concerning the drink driving tests and the undermining of the criminal justice system via 146,000 people being wrongfully summonsed to court happened under that committee's watch apparently without it or the Tánaiste knowing about it. We have been hearing about justice reform since the days of the former Minister, Alan Shatter. Clearly, the committee has not been working. Likewise with health. The health system has been experiencing significant issues and incredible pressures since 1 January and the full scale of last year's funding gap has been confirmed. The commitments on mental health that were made in the confidence and supply agreement have not been realised. Waiting times for children to access the child and adolescent units are growing. The shortage of staff is as high as 50% in some places. In many respects, the efficacy of these Cabinet committees are highly questionable. For example, recent years are characterised by an underwhelming commitment to physical infrastructure, with many announcements but little in the way of delivery. The capital plan that was announced just before the general election was very much about that election, with everything backloaded to the last two years. Broadband has been an issue. There have been many delays. The Minister, Deputy Naughten, or someone else should explain to the House how his announcement yesterday regarding eir tallies with the tender situation. When we met the officials with some of the Independents at the time of the Government's formation, ensuring that the tender was undertaken properly and carefully so that it would not be subject to legal action was a major issue. Unless I am reading the situation wrongly, and I would appreciate clarification, yesterday's announcement seemed to run counter to the advice that we were given at the time. It was strange, given that everyone had been waiting for the tender's announcement so that we could progress the wider issue of broadband access in rural Ireland. We have had too many false dawns and announcements. People's hopes have been raised but little has happened. There must be scrutiny of whether yesterday's announcement was in line with the Department's broadband tender operation.

I am trying to establish which sub-committee, if any, deals with international affairs. In particular, I am concerned about Ibrahim Halawa, who begins his 21st trial today. Where does the Government deal with that major miscarriage of justice? The family argues that the Government needs to consider other options now, for example, hiring an Egyptian lawyer to file a suit in the Egyptian administrative court, having Rule 140 applied or beginning an international legal challenge against Egypt on the grounds of human rights violations against an Irish citizen. Will the Taoiseach examine these options urgently and can he confirm if they would they be presented before a sub-committee and in which forum would they be addressed?

Cabinet sub-committees have an important role in bringing in Ministers or agencies to progress matters through to a point where they can be sent to Cabinet for decision by Government. I will let nobody run away with the idea that Cabinet sub-committees make a stream of decisions. It is the Government that actually decides on recommendations or propositions that come through Cabinet sub-committees. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality was not made aware of the figures referred to by Deputy Martin on the fixed charges and the mandatory alcohol testing until 23 March, which was very recent. The Government responded immediately in respect of these issues and the Government would have finalised its position except that I wanted Members to have access to the second Fennelly report when it could be published. I hope that will be in the near future once the Attorney General authorises me as the receiving Minister to do so. At that point everybody can include his or her reflections on that in the context of the overall analysis of what we have to do for policing and the structure and role of the Garda for the time ahead. I take Deputy Micheál Martin's point about mental health. We did have a meeting about that with one of his spokespersons. I have asked the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, to respond. I will follow up on that for the Deputy. In respect of broadband, there have been many hundreds of hours put together by officials from the Department with the companies involved in the drafting of the tender. Two years ago, the number of high-speed broadband connections stood at 566,000. It will be 300,000 higher than that.In 2016, the figure represented only 52% of premises. Traditional private sector investment by end 2018 is expected to increase to 77%.  The Minister has agreed that the map for the State intervention should be revised to reflect the fact that he has accepted a commitment by Eir to build a high-speed broadband network to cover an additional 300,000 premises in rural Ireland by the end of 2018, with penalties built it should it not do so. This project will be undertaken on a fully commercial basis, with the commitment underpinned by a formal agreement. Also, 84,500 premises previously identified as being in the commercial area are being taken back into the State intervention area of the high-speed broadband map as plans by commercial operators to provide services to these premises did not materialise. It is intended to finalise the map at 542,000 premises for the remainder of the procurement process. In addition, Eir has signed an agreement with the Minister to provide access to high-speed broadband to 300,000 additional premises by the end of 2018. This is a binding contract with detailed quarterly milestones to be published. If Eir does not deliver fully, premises will be brought back into the intervention area and will be delivered under the Government contract with Eir compensating the Minister in respect of the costs involved. The evidence suggests that the Government's commitment has acted as a catalyst in encouraging accelerated investment by commercial operators.

The groups that wish to tender will be made aware that 300,000 premises previously outside the tendered area are being taken back into the commercial zone. As such, they will understand the changed nature of the tender to be conducted now. Furthermore, Eir has committed to service provision for the additional 300,000 premises. There are penalties built into the agreement between Eir and the Minister which will come into play if Eir does not deliver. I will ask the Minister to circulate to everybody a detailed report on the changed position arising from the agreement which he has negotiated with the companies.

We have heard a lot about census figures and the HP deprivation index and what it comprises but we have not heard on what basis it was applied to individual schools. There has been a real failing in that regard. Since I last raised this issue in the Dáil, there has been a controversy around schools wrongly on the list and schools that were not included. There has been controversy in the media this week by one of the originators of the HP Deprivation Index, Mr. Haase, in terms of how the Minister is proceeding in this matter. There is huge concern about the roll-out of this programme.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	217	I thank Deputy Byrne for raising this issue. The new identification model is designed to be transparent. Basically, it takes into account the children enrolled in the school and the places where they live and then the HP deprivation index is applied. As the Deputy knows, the variables involved in that index are demographic growth, dependency ratios, education levels, single parent rate, overcrowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. This data is applied uniformly to all schools in a fair and objective way to identify the relative level of concentrated disadvantage present in each school. Full details of the process involved in the assessment of schools are available on my Department's website.  It is also my intention to communicate with all schools to provide information on the identification model.  Information provided will include details of how the datasets are used to determine a school's level of disadvantage; the importance of data quality to the process and the need for detailed and up-to-date information from schools.    There is no discrepancy in the schools listed for inclusion in DEIS. The only alteration to the lists published involved a change in rural-urban categorisation of four primary schools arising from an improved method of measurement. It is important to note that the urban-rural categorisation of schools relates to geographical location only and has no bearing on the levels of disadvantage identified within those schools.  In the case of the schools in question, there was no impact on the overall resources allocated.  As the Deputy will be aware, the DEIS programme has been in place since 2005. The publication in February last of the DEIS plan was the outcome of a comprehensive review process undertaken over an 18-month period and represents an updated action plan for future delivery in this critical policy area.

He also said that the schools will be given that information. What I want to know now is how the HP Deprivation Index is applied to schools. In other words, what level of deprivation or areas must children come from for schools to be included in the DEIS programme? Earlier this week, Mr. Haase criticised the application of this index to the DEIS programme and how the programme is being operated. That is very significant criticism. We have heard a lot about this index but the Minister has never explained to schools how it is applied. We all know about formulas. We learned theory in maths class. This is a theory. The Minister has never explained to us or the schools how it is applied to this particular area. There is a huge lack of confidence in this scheme because of the mistakes made. The changes made in this area were made not because of the model being used but because of media inquiries. The Minister purported to put out an approved method thereafter. I put it to the Minister that this scheme was rolled out before it was ready because he was extremely keen to get a good news political announcement out as quickly as possible. It was rushed out, problems have arisen and the details as to why a particular school is included or not in the scheme have never been given.

Its scheme was based on random collection of information. Political information was also brought to bear, which was not satisfactory. The current scheme is transparent. I have just explained to the Deputy how it is put together. In other words, the children in the school and their home addresses are taken in conjunction with the deprivation index, which is used widely, to assess a location. That is the composite index.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	221	It does not matter how many children are in the school, the same rule applies. In terms of the cut-off point, we use the same cut-off point to find the highest level of concentration. I would have liked to have been able to extend that to more schools but the budget I had available had to be used to support the areas with the highest level of concentration. As the Deputy knows, there was no school included since 2009. We have been able to include 79 or 2% of schools in the country because they were at the highest level of concentration of disadvantage. Those are the schools that we are helping. This was not rushed. It was developed over an 18 month period when the statistical system was developed. The commentator, Mr. Haase, did not criticise the selection method rather he said that we should be looking again at some of the schools. We did not take any school out of DEIS. I do not know whether the Deputy is advocating that we should remove schools that have had DEIS. If that is what he is suggesting, he should state that clearly.

He will either have to put up or shut up. That is an extremely serious allegation to make. The Minister should name the schools included in DEIS that should not be included. If there are schools included in the scheme on a political basis they need to be removed because they do not deserve to be there. That is the logical consequence. Nobody would disagree with that. However, I believe the Minister is only saying that because he has not been able to explain how the current scheme operates and on what basis schools are included. How many children in a school must come from a disadvantaged area in order that that school can qualify for the DEIS programme? Is it one child or all children? We do not know that. I am asking the Minister for that information.  In regard to the Minister's statement that there are schools in the DEIS programme that are wrongly included, I call on him to prove that.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	223	The Deputy misunderstands how this index is put together. The whole enrolment in a school is taken into account. We do not designate children as disadvantaged. We take the entire enrolment of the school and we develop a composite index for all of the enrolment in the school based on the areas from which the children come. They are based on objective, scientific criteria, including demographic growth, dependency ratios, the education level of parents, the single parent rate, over-crowding, social class, occupation and unemployment rates. These are objective criteria that are used everywhere.As the Deputy has acknowledged, this was not done in the past because the system was not objective. Some schools applied and others did not. Some principals were very industrious in collecting data and others were not. All sorts of people were involved in collecting data and making submissions. This will now be done on an objective basis that is independent of all political involvement and defined by criteria. Of course we will need to refine and improve it over time. This is an absolutely fair and objective basis for making selections.

There are significant concerns about how this will operate, particularly where the needs of specific children are not captured under the model or where those needs are subsequently identified after allocations have been made to schools. I remind the Minister that such allocations are fixed for two years. I ask him to outline the supports that will be available under the new model to children in the circumstances I have described.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	225	The new model of allocation is designed to more accurately reflect the actual needs in individual schools. It captures a more comprehensive range of needs in schools, including complex needs, measured learning difficulties and social needs, than the previous model. An additional 900 posts will be delivered to reflect this change. This year, more than half of special needs teaching resources will be allocated to meet the requirements of children with complex needs. The new model no longer requires an assessment to be submitted, which means that children who need support can get that support immediately. Indeed, the allocations to the schools are front-loaded so that they are in a position to meet the needs of children without having to get detailed diagnostic tests in respect of them. One of the benefits of this approach is that each school will be able to use its professional judgment and expertise to determine how best to support its students. Schools will be supported by the guidance of the integrated support service in the National Council for Special Education, NCSE. The new model will allow for some additional provision in exceptional circumstances prior to the next review. The NCSE will support schools in managing their allocations in the first instance. If a school's enrolment of new pupils involves a substantially greater level of need than was previously the case, it will be able to seek assistance from the NCSE.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	226	I thank the Minister for his response. This is an issue of huge concern. I have been informed of many cases. Parents are not happy with this. They are worried about their children, many of whom have special needs and are already facing too many barriers in areas like speech therapy and occupational therapy. I am one of a number of Deputies who have raised this issue on the floor of this House. The new resource allocation model has the potential to create another insurmountable barrier for these parents. I would like to give an example of what is happening. I have been made aware that a child with special educational needs was refused admission to a school because of a lack of resources. This is concrete evidence of what children and parents are facing in this day and age. I sent the details of another case, in respect of which my office has been contacted by the parent of two children with special needs, to the Minister last week and I hope some action will be taken on foot of that. One of the children in this case has autism and is transferring from an autism unit to a small rural mainstream school, which is good. If we truly believe in inclusion, such children should not be encountering barriers. Resources should be made available in such cases. None of the children to whom I refer, including the child who is transferring to a mainstream school, has been captured under the new resource model. Parents have very real concerns that schools will not be in a position to support their children. I ask the Minister to consider that such cases will arise under the new approach.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	227	I would like to clarify that no school will lose out. No school will see a child with complex needs lose any of his or her support. No diagnostic tests are required by the parents described by the Deputy to get supports from schools for the learning needs of their children. As the allocations are front-loaded, the big financial barrier that was in the way of parents is being removed. The Deputy has raised the issue of schools' admission policies. We will look at such matters in the context of the new admissions process we are introducing, which will give the NCSE the power to require schools to accept children with special educational needs. Schools will not be allowed to refuse children in these circumstances. As I said in my initial reply, if a school's new enrolment exhibits a far greater level of special need than the level among the children who are already in the school, the NCSE will be able to examine that issue upon the demonstration by such a school of a substantial increase in the level of special need among the new cohort.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	228	I am aware that no school will have its hours cut. My point is that there is no flexibility and there are no additional resources for children. The fact of the matter is that children will lose out because of the manner in which schools will have their resources fixed for two years under the new model. It is extremely worrying that some relevant features, such as the inclusion support service and the model for identification of future complex needs, have not yet been put in place. The Minister needs to take this on board. I know from the response to a parliamentary question I have received this morning that 519 schools have appealed their allocations under this model. This figure is evidence that there are concerns that need to be addressed. It is vital for us to get this right, especially given that the resources to be allocated to a school in two years' time will be based on its current profile. Things are changing quickly. The upcoming admissions legislation needs to ensure children with special educational needs can access their local schools. At the same time, we are introducing a model that fixes the resources given to schools to cater for special educational needs. Will the Minister advise the House of the circumstances in which schools will be provided with additional resource hours that are clearly needed? Does he intend to establish the inclusion support service? Will resource teachers be available to schools under this service?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	229	We are providing 900 additional resource teachers this year at a cost of €54 million. We are putting extra money and extra staff into resource teaching in a way that will ensure no school loses out. Schools that require a high level of support for children with complex learning needs, as identified by these tests, will get more. None of the existing schools will get less. This approach is designed to see more resources going to the schools with the greatest levels of need. That is what we are doing here. We are removing the diagnostic tests. I know the Deputy was sympathetic to the view that the requirement for expensive diagnostic tests to be done before any resources could be allocated in respect of children with special needs was putting an obstacle in the way of the parents of such children. Under the new model, the school will be front-loaded with the resources from day one and will be able to use its own discretion. I have been to Marino College to see where the new model was piloted and I suggest the Deputy should do likewise. The adoption of this approach there created a much better and genuinely integrated service for children with special needs and enhanced the education of all children in the school. I believe this model has many positive aspects, including extra resources.

The Minister is aware that there are key shortages of teachers in certain subjects at second level. I suspect that these shortages are most acute in languages, including Irish. There are surpluses of teachers of other subjects, such as business studies. A report on these issues is sitting on the Minister's desk, just as it sat on his predecessor's desk. We need action now because there are serious concerns in schools about how children are going to be taught some subjects on a continuous and proper basis.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	231	The report of the technical working group that was set up by the Teaching Council to formulate advice on teacher supply focuses on the development of a model of primary teacher supply and outlines the work that will be required in the future to establish a model of post-primary teacher supply. I intend to publish the report shortly. While the Department of Education and Skills has no evidence of an overall shortage of teachers, it is aware of certain pinch points to which the Deputy has adverted. The aim of the Department’s policy is to achieve a balance between the supply of and demand for teachers. When the report is published, the Deputy will see that this is a particularly complex issue at post-primary level because of the absence of a central mechanism for matching the overall subject need requirements of schools with the output from the initial teacher education providers. In addition, schools have significant autonomy in providing a mix of subjects and choices for students. The final report of the technical working group sets out an approach to planning which scopes out the work needed to develop a model for forecasting teacher supply in the medium to long term. Engagement with the providers of initial teacher education programmes will be necessary to ensure supply meets demand and we have the correct balance of teachers in the each of the various subject areas.The report is of value in regard to building data models for predicting future requirements in the longer term. However, it does not address the short-term issues to which the Deputy referred. In the meantime, I am committed to advancing short-term measures to address teacher shortages, including the employment by schools of retired teachers and those on career break, and an increase in the number of days per school year that a post-primary teacher on career break may work as a substitute.

If that is the Minister's answer to this problem, it is deeply unsatisfactory and very worrying. This is a serious issue. The Minister said his Department does not have evidence, but there is significant anecdotal evidence. Any teaching organisation or principal will tell the Minister that there is a major problem. They simply do not have the teachers they need.  Career breaks are being refused left, right and centre. This is not central Government policy, rather it is a practical reality for school principals at second level. If they advertise a career break post, which is temporary, they will not get any applicants, except perhaps for business studies. They would rather have a teacher leave a school completely and advertise a new role. Things are at crisis point. Principals are engaged in a balancing act. Teachers are not available for key subjects. The problem is very serious in gaelcholáistí freisin, mar nach féidir leo múinteoirí a fháil a bhfuil Gaeilge ar a gcumas acu na hábhair uilig a mhúineadh. It is a problem throughout the system. The principals to whom I have spoken are worried about what will happen next September.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	233	I acknowledge there is a problem in key subject areas, but there is no problem overall. Training of teachers involves about 3,800 students, which is split roughly half and half between post-primary and primary schools. About 1,600 teachers retire each year. There is a substantial net increase in supply each year. We are recruiting more now than we were. The current levels are far in excess of those of previous years, and we are now moving to match those levels. The technical working group has not offered any open and shut solution. It said that planning to develop a model is extremely complex and we need to check and develop new data sources and invest in a mini CSO for teaching. This is not a quick or easy fix.  We will consider putting on short-term courses, as happened in the case of mathematics in the past, in order to meet particular pinch points. We will consider initiatives that are put forward. If the Deputy is aware of specific initiatives, we will examine them in order to fill identifiable gaps.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	234	There seems to be a problem with certain business studies teachers. As far as I know, a permanently employed business studies teacher can study a maths course that will bring him or her up to the required level. However, those not in permanent jobs face a difficulty. The retraining of business studies teachers offers a significant opportunity. The Minister could easily offer a number of solutions. One would be for the Minister to advise students of the subjects for which there is a surplus of teachers. I will not name them on the floor of the Dáil because I would rather the Minister provide official statistics. Perhaps the Minister could encourage people to study maths or provide them with more opportunities to upskill in other subjects in order to improve balance. At the moment, the system is skewed. Fundamentally, the Minister needs to in some way take control of the second level teacher education system because it is too open. The colleges have too much autonomy. The Minister is supposed to be setting national priorities for key subjects for the national education system and economy. The truth is that the Minister cannot stand over any particular targets on languages, maths, business or coding because he does not know what teachers will be available to teach those subjects.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	235	There is a difficulty because, as the Deputy said, people enter into subject areas without explicitly committing to a future in teaching. It is only when they do a masters that they enter the teaching channel. The working group examined whether it could introduce a model which could identify an objective intake for subjects such as chemistry, physics, maths or business studies that would feed into the system. So far, it has been unable to produce such a model. I am open to considering specific subject areas where we could have particular interventions.

The former Minister, Mary Hanafin, effectively sabotaged that effort by commissioning a curriculum that required the religious segregation of schoolchildren for a substantial part of the year. Some nine of the 11 community national schools are now refusing to implement that curriculum and are rebelling against it because they consider it to be completely unworkable, unfair and unacceptable, yet the Minister seems to be refusing to commission a new curriculum that would end the unacceptable practice of religious segregation of children in those schools.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	239	As he will see from my reply, the Deputy's depiction of the situation is a little inaccurate. The community national school model is a new model of multidenominational school which is not that well-known among the public. However, I believe it has a bright future ahead of it and a major role to play in providing choice to parents in the future. Community national schools are multidenominational and provide for belief nurturing during the school day. The aim of the model has been to cater for the diversity present within the community in a single school setting. The philosophy of the community national school as a multidenominational school is based on best practice in this area, and on each child better understanding and ultimately celebrating their and their friends’ belief and cultural identities. Belief identity is explicitly not left at the school gate, but used as a means of enriching the learning experience on the basis of mutual understanding and integration.  Goodness Me, Goodness You is the patron’s programme that underpins the characteristic spirit of these schools. It is a common programme suitable for pupils of all faiths and beliefs and none. In junior infants to second class, the children follow the programme together for the majority of the school year, exploring common themes. There is a belief-specific aspect of the programme. In the junior classes only, children have been grouped for a four-week period during the programme according to their faith or belief tradition, in line with the wishes of their parents. Lesson content was designed specifically for each grouping.  In third to sixth class, children remain in their class groups throughout the year and learn about different faiths and religions together. Belief-specific teaching is integrated for these classes. The manner in which schools deliver belief-specific teaching in junior infants to second class has evolved. The majority of community national schools no longer group children according to their beliefs for the four-week period. Instead, these schools have integrated belief-specific teaching so that all children learn about different religions and beliefs together and all groups remain together throughout.  As I indicated in a recent statement, I see merit in this approach. This model has the merit of responding to the needs of parents who wish their children to be able to prepare for specific events, for example, communion and confirmation in the case of Catholic families, but also respects the best principles of inclusion and mutual understanding that are central to multidenominational education.  The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is to commence a review of the Goodness Me, Goodness You programme for junior infants to second class, starting in September 2017. As part of that review, the belief-specific teaching aspect of the programme will be examined. The education and training boards, as patrons, are also examining how Goodness Me, Goodness You can be delivered in schools in the most inclusive fashion possible. I look forward to seeing the outcomes of these processes.

There has been a rebellion against the religious segregation required by the Goodness Me, Goodness You curriculum that was set. The Minister should confirm the programme was not set by the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, although the community national schools' brochure claims it was. In fact, it was commissioned to Dr. Clare Maloney of the Marino Institute of Education, probably under the influence of the Catholic bishops at the time. The Catholic Church was the only religious denomination to intervene in the process.At the time, it said the basic requirement would be that religious instruction and formation of Catholic children in the faith by a qualified teacher during the school day would be a minimum non-negotiable requirement for new multi-denominational primary schools. No other religious denomination wanted to interfere or felt it was even appropriate to bring this into the schools, but the Catholic Church demanded that. At the time, Mary Hanafin took it away from the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, and gave it to the Marino Institute which came up with a curriculum that required religious segregation. However, those schools are now rebelling, voting with their feet and saying it is not acceptable. Will the Minister rewrite the curriculum or get the NCCA to do it?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	241	The National Council for Curriculum and Assessment took over responsibility in 2012. As I said in my reply, it is currently undertaking a review of that particular patron programme. I also said it is evolving, as the Deputy rightly said too. Increasingly there is no period of the day during which children are withdrawn. However, parents are offered the opportunity, if they wish, to have their children taught in their own faith. That is an option. The class remains intact, but if they wish to withdraw their children for certain elements that can be arranged. The arrangement is evolving and the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment is now undertaking that work. It is moving to a model that will be more appropriate and more welcomed by parents. I value the idea that they invite and celebrate all religions. I was in Saggart recently and saw it on the ground. It is a really good model. There is an integrated approach to religion and there is great respect for diversity. It is a model that is worth giving impetus for the future.
#RichardBoydBarrett	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-party	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-dob	unknown-#RichardBoydBarrett-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	242	I have great respect for religious diversity and people's religious beliefs, to which they are entitled. What is totally unacceptable, however, is the religious segregation of young children, particularly in a country where one religious denomination dominates. What was supposed to be a curriculum for multi-denominational schools, which was all inclusive, was then given over to a Catholic college that drew up a curriculum which effectively required segregation. The reason it is "evolving", to use the Minister's nice word, is because nine of the 11 schools established have opted out and have refused to implement the segregation that the "goodness me, goodness you" curriculum tried to force on them. We need to acknowledge what has happened here and scrap that curriculum. We should get the NCCA to draw up what should have been drawn up 11 years ago, which is a genuinely all-inclusive, non-sectarian, non-discriminatory, non-segregative curriculum that does not involve segregating children on the basis of some requirement to have faith formation within the school. That should be kept outside the school gates.

It took over responsibility in 2012 and is commencing a review of that programme. I support the change in practice whereby children in most community national schools remain intact as a group and all religions are considered in a common programme. That is a good evolution of the programme which will fulfil more parents' wishes. I am keen to see more such schools evolve. It will be one element in our promotion of diversity. I am committed to seeing more diversity in schools and this is one such element. I welcome the work of the NCCA and the way in which it has evolved itself.

What steps have been, are being or will be taken to improve the administration and extend the scope of the Caranua fund in view of the most unacceptable comments the CEO of Caranua concerning the administration of the fund, as well as the hurtful and damaging experiences of many survivors with that board. This has been reported extensively in various print and broadcast media.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	245	First of all, I think that some of those comments were unfortunate and could be open to misunderstanding. However, as regards the substance of the Deputy's question, Caranua is an independent statutory body established under the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Act 2012 to oversee the use of cash contributions of up to €110 million, pledged by religious congregations, to support the needs of survivors of institutional child abuse. The legislation provides that supports may be available in the areas of health and personal social services, mental health services, education and housing. It is a matter for Caranua itself to determine the range of approved services it will support and the criteria by reference to which decisions may be made in respect of applications. Following its establishment, Caranua determined the approved services to be provided by it and determined the applications criteria.  I understand that in 2016 Caranua expanded the approved services it provides and amended its criteria to include a range of additional housing and health-related supports.  I have no role in regard to Caranua’s day-to-day activities or matters such as the determination of criteria. I am aware that there have been concerns raised regarding Caranua in the media and elsewhere. I have met with survivors and I appreciate their concerns. It is vital that in all our dealings with victims of abuse they are dealt with in a sensitive, fair and compassionate manner. I believe that Caranua has tried to put in place a process that is responsive to the needs of applicants. It has acknowledged the difficulties it has faced especially in the early period when it first began to accept applications. It is required to meet the obligations set out in the 2012 Act and to be accountable. In that regard it should be noted that Caranua will be appearing before the Dáil's Committee of Public Accounts next week. Caranua's aim is to provide a responsive, friendly and professional service and it has informed me that it takes all complaints seriously. It has a customer service charter, and feedback and complaints policy. There is an independent appeals mechanism and Caranua’s administrative actions are subject to review by the Ombudsman. It is my intention to carry out a review of eligibility for services provided by Caranua and in that regard draft terms of reference were recently published. A number of submissions were received and these are being considered.  It is hoped to finalise the terms of reference shortly and proceed to the review in the near future. Any change in the eligibility requirement would require legislation. I will be meeting the new board of Caranua when it is appointed and I will be impressing on it the need to ensure that it continues to be responsive to the needs of applicants.

She reportedly said: Some applicants will never be happy and grievances suit a narrative. It suits a narrative of the big bad State and the big bad religious congregations, and so on. We have to face the facts that the damage that has been done to these people [these are the words used by the CEO] is so deep that it does not matter what anybody does.I will not insult the survivors by finishing the quotation because it is simply appalling. I thank the Minister for clarifying that a review is under way on eligibility. Can he tell me when it started and when it will be completed? There has been a 110% increase in appeals since last year. That in itself speaks volumes about the unease that survivors have with the way they are being treated. 
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	247	We recently discussed Caranua in the House. Deputy Clare Daly put forward a Bill that was supported on Second Stage with a time delay, which gives us an opportunity to conduct this review. It is therefore being done according to a tight timeframe. Obviously, I want to ensure that we hear submissions into the review's terms of reference. As I have acknowledged, I think the comments as reported were unfortunate and could certainly be open to misinterpretation. I also recognise that Caranua has had a difficult job to do. In its initial phase it had a number of logistical difficulties which gave rise to genuine frustration for many people. Some of its administrative requirements can be irksome for applicants. To be fair to Caranua, however, it made improvements in the processes last year. Clearly, the review needs to look afresh at whether we can do more to improve those processes and make them user friendly, while at the same time ensuring that Caranua can fulfil its obligations to the House and show that the moneys it has spent were incurred as per the criteria set out in the legislation.  This is an important piece of work and I regard it as something that should be completed quickly. I know from other speakers in the House that it is regarded as a priority.

It is a misuse of the Irish language because the experience of all these survivors is not that they have met a friend.They have met with delay, obfuscation and the phone not being answered. There is absolutely no consistency in what survivors get. Sometimes they get a washing machine and sometimes they do not. Sometimes they get a bed which is suited to their needs, and a little bigger than a normal bed, but they do not get the blankets to cover it. This is the level of miserliness with which the scheme has been administered. It gives me no pleasure to repeat this here. I am very familiar with the redress board from a previous life and the survivors, having gone through the board, now having to go through the miserliness of this system, with its total inconsistency and the scale of appeals, speaks volumes. At the very least the CEO on that enormous salary should be asked to apologise.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	249	I have met survivors myself and they have expressed these very concerns. These are the ones who will be subject to the review. Of course there is a customer service charter, a feedback and complaints policy, an appeal mechanism and recourse to the Ombudsman. There are mechanisms in place to try to deal with these inconsistencies. These are standard good practices in any organisation. Part of the review will be to look at why these elements of support are not working in this particular circumstance. This is why it is timely to have a review and ensure we deliver the best we possibly can. I am conscious, having reread some of the Ryan report reviews recently on the way in which the State let down these individuals so badly in the past, that we have an obligation to make sure we support them now in a fair and equitable way. At the same time, I realise Caranua will come before the Committee of Public Accounts and must be able to account for the way it spends its money. There is a balance that must be struck, but I take the Deputy's points and they will be factored into the review.

This is a running issue. I acknowledge some progress has been made on it, and I was pleased to be able to utilise the pressure of the Fianna Fáil Party in this regard. We have a commitment on this. It is an issue that is affecting morale in many schools, despite the progress, because people will not be happy, and rightly so, until full equality of payscales is achieved.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	251	Equality and fairness are, of course, at the heart of everything this Government is trying to do, particularly in the education area where I am particularly focused on creating better opportunities for people from disadvantaged communities in our schools system and in higher education. The recent budget included measures seeking to do this. The public service agreements have allowed a programme of pay restoration to start. I have used this to negotiate substantial improvements in pay for new teachers. The agreement reached with the TUI and the INTO in September will see pay rises of between 15% and 22%, that is between €4,600 and €6,700, for new entrant teachers. The agreements also provide for earlier permanency for younger teachers, new promotion opportunities and new flexibilities in working hours. The pay increases for new teachers were, of course, also available to ASTI members but unfortunately in a recent ballot they were not carried. The agreements have restored an estimated 75% of the difference in pay for more recently recruited teachers and deliver full equality at later points in the scale. This is substantial progress and strikes an equitable balance with other claims for funding on my Department, particularly for example enhanced services for children with special educational needs, disadvantaged schools, growing schools, higher education and apprenticeships. I could list many more. Further negotiation on new entrant pay cannot focus on just one sector. A broader assessment of pay and new entrant pay across the public service will be informed by the analysis of the Public Service Pay Commission, and it will look at individual sectors such as teaching. I accept the teachers' unions have outstanding pay demands and that the new entrant deal does not travel the full distance they set out to achieve. However, it does represent significant progress and the door is not closed to the trade union movement seeking to advance the issue further in the context of future public service pay talks. Negotiations on a successor agreement to the Lansdowne Road agreement will shortly get under way.

While this is an issue across the public sector the number of public servants affected by this is disproportionately large in the Minister's Department and among teachers. This is why the Minister for Education and Skills needs to be at the vanguard of this, making the case at the Cabinet table and making the case publicly for our newly qualified teachers. This in itself will be a signal of seriousness of intent and hope for newly qualified teachers that they can get to a situation where their payscales are equal. It would also send out a strong message to the ASTI. There would be no excuse for rejection of what is on the table if the Minister was to make these types of statements. He has not done this and it has not helped the situation. He could do it in the way Fianna Fáil has done it, and perhaps offer a pathway to full equality and state this is when it can happen, that it will take time and that we have the public sector pay commission. Giving this indication as to how it will happen would mean a lot in terms of teacher morale.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	253	As the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, has pointed out, full restoration of all of the cuts would cost close to €2 billion and we have to make a phased arrangement. Under existing arrangements we are making a commitment of not far off €1 billion in restoration over the period of this agreement. We have the public pay commission and I know the INTO and TUI will pursue the cases the Deputy has made. From my point of view, I have to deal with public pay policy and I also have to try to deliver equity to those who have need and a call on the Department. With regard to what we can achieve in any given year, we have to balance the rightful ambition for teachers and young teachers to see restoration of pay with the other demands on the Department. These issues are encapsulated in the Lansdowne Road agreement. This is the arena within which we seek to resolve these balances and it is continuing with the Public Service Pay Commission and the successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement. This is the arena where we have to address the issues raised by the Deputy.
#ThomasByrne	unknown-#ThomasByrne-party	unknown-#ThomasByrne-dob	unknown-#ThomasByrne-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	254	We have made some progress. This time last year at their conferences, young teachers got together and demanded progress and the political system reacted. Fianna Fáil certainly used its position to make this progress happen with the INTO and the TUI and I congratulate their negotiators for the work they have done and which they continue to do in terms of putting pressure on the political system and forcing us to make sure their demands are heard. This was progress. There is nothing to say the Minister cannot say that as a political system and Government we need to acknowledge that pay equality is what we need to achieve. Nobody is expecting the Minister to write a cheque this year because we know there has already been an uplift in January and there will be another one next January. Nobody is expecting the Minister to write a cheque immediately, but he should give a signal that he is serious about this and that it can happen. The Minister gave this signal last summer when those negotiations started. We are at an early stage, but it is very important that in Dáil Éireann we continue to advocate on behalf of those newly qualified teachers and to state what has been going on with regard to their salaries is wrong, and that the Minister joins in this call, particularly at the Cabinet table.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	255	I negotiated a deal with the three unions. In the event, one of them was not able to carry the agreement. It has restored 75% of pay and delivered full equality at later points in the payscale. I know the trade unions representing teachers will go to the Public Service Pay Commission, which is an objective, fair and independent body, to assess the very issues on the table. There will be various issues put forward by the trade unions in various parts of the sector. We must rely on the trade unions, the commission and the subsequent successor to the Lansdowne Road agreement to deal with these issues fairly and deal with the various elements of the demands for various parts of the public service unions. This is the arena we have created and it allows us not only to meet the rightful ambitions of workers in the public service but also to deliver the improved services for which the Deputy's party also asks. We are trying to strike this balance. We are doing the best we can with the available resources and we have a good process that gives people an avenue to pursue their concerns.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	258	My Department's circular has set out details of the new model for allocating special education teachers to schools. The new special education teaching allocation provides a single unified allocation for schools, based on each school’s educational profile. No school, including the school to which the Deputy has referred, will lose supports as a result of the implementation of the new model. An additional 900 teaching posts have been provided to support the introduction of the new model. There has been a progressive improvement in resource teaching over the years since 2011. The school referred to by the Deputy in his question had a general allocation of 50 hours - that is the general allocation model, GAM, element for 2016 to 2017. This, combined with 30.18 resource teaching hours allocated to the school by the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, for children with complex needs, gave a total allocation of 80.18 additional teaching hours for 2016 to 2017. As the profiled allocation for this school did not indicate an increased allocation requirement for the school in 2017 to 2018, the school maintained its existing level of allocation. The special education teaching allocation for this school is 80.18 hours for the coming year. There has therefore been no reduction to the special education teaching allocation for this school as a result of the introduction of the model. The NCSE has announced the commencement of an independent appeal process through which schools may appeal the allocation made to their school if they believe the data upon which the allocation is based is incorrect or has been incorrectly used.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	259	I thank the Minister for the reply. I am looking at the figures he quoted. To be specific, he mentioned that the figure for last year was 80 hours and that it will be the same next year. He makes the point that this is not a reduction. The problem is that in this particular school in 2016 and 2017, the information is that there were 30 hours. However, if one looks back to 2015 and 2016, the same school had 60 hours in that allocation and had been at 50 hours over the five-year period. Effectively, the 30 hours that the Minister refers to in his answer to me today was the smallest recorded in any of the last five years. That is the basis for next year's allocation and is the issue that the school is complaining about. It is saying that it is not reflective of what had happened last year or over the previous five years. It is not out of kilter by a small bit, but is substantially out of kilter. That is the crux of the problem when averaging over a one-year period only and only taking last year's figure into account.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	260	The model will provide for some additional provision in exceptional circumstances, where the school's new intake, in the case that the Deputy describes, is substantially different from the intake it had in the past. The school will have to demonstrate to the NCSE that this has been the case. The NCSE will work with the school to seek to resolve those issues. Additional hours may be made available to the school where it can be demonstrated. The merit of this is that the school has resources now. It does not have to wait for the assessment. This diagnostic test has been taken away. There are many advantages in the new model. If, as the Deputy says, there is exceptional change in the profile of the school, that is something that the NCSE will look at.
#JohnCurranFF	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-party	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-dob	unknown-#JohnCurranFF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	261	I welcome that there is an appeals mechanism. The exceptional profile in this case was that the resource teaching hours for the single year in question dipped to 30. It had been 60 hours in the previous year and the average over five years had been 50 hours. The exceptional circumstance was the dip. That is the concern with this general allocation model. One particular year is being taken on its own, which may not be representative, and is clearly not representative of what has happened in this case. I acknowledge that there is an 80 hour allocation, but that is under what would have been the norm for the previous years. I welcome that the appeal mechanism is in place.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	262	The complex needs aspect takes into account the four cohorts. There are four years from junior infants right up to second class. It looks at the complex needs profile of those schools. That complex needs profile is delivered to the school. For that to be dramatically wrong, the cohort leaving the school must have dramatically lower special education needs than the cohort joining the school. If the school can demonstrate that the situation is that the new intake is dramatically different from the children who have moved on into third class and into another school, then that is the material that the NCSE would look at, and it would work with the school to resolve the situation. We need to see the actual enrolment. That would have to be evaluated exactly, based on the children concerned.

#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	264	The Cassells report considers a number of potential funding options, including for deferred payment of student fees. It is currently being examined by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills with a view to making recommendations on a long-term sustainable funding model for higher education. This process includes receiving input from relevant stakeholders. It will be important to obtain political and societal consensus on achieving a sustainable funding model for the higher education sector in the future and my Department and I continue to work with the committee as it undertakes its deliberations. In a follow-up to the expert group report, appropriate technical work will be undertaken by an interdepartmental group chaired by my Department on income contingent student loans in order to inform future funding policy options, including in light of recommendations from the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills. In advance of these recommendations, however, I have taken immediate steps to increase funding for higher education, the first such increase in nine years. Increased Exchequer funding of €36.5 million was secured in this budget for the higher education sector. This includes an increase in funding available to students from disadvantaged backgrounds and other under-represented groups to assist them in overcoming financial barriers to accessing and completing higher education. Provision is also being made in the Department's expenditure ceiling in 2018 and 2019 for demographic increases which cumulatively represent an additional €160 million investment in the sector in the period 2017 to 2019. In addition, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are currently undertaking a public consultation process on a proposed Exchequer-employer investment mechanism for higher education and further education and training. It is estimated that the mechanism, which proposes an increase in the national training fund levy from 0.7% to 1% between 2018 and 2020, could yield close to an additional €200 million revenue in 2020. Comments on the proposal may be submitted to the Department by 5 p.m. on Thursday, 13 April. Full details of the consultation process are available on the websites of both Departments. The intention is that, taken together, these approaches will contribute to and inform the development of a long-term sustainable funding model for the higher education and further education and training sectors.

It seems from his response that the Department is going ahead and doing much work on how student income contingency loans would work in practice alongside the work the Oireachtas committee is doing. The Department has not actually contributed to the work the committee is doing at the moment. It has not given evidence there. Why is the Minister developing the system parallel to the work the committee is doing if the committee might recommend that there should not be income contingency loans? Is it a case that it is actually a fait accompli and the decision has been already taken within the Department?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	266	No decision has been taken. We should prepare if it is intended to make a move. Part of the Cassells report is that, over the last number of years, the higher education sector grew by something like 25% with no increased State funding. The report is anticipating another 25% growth and recognises that doing nothing about this is not satisfactory. It outlines three sources of potential funding. One is the Exchequer, which we are pursuing. The second is employers, which we are pursuing. The third is the possibility of this student contribution mechanism. It would be imprudent of us not to look at the technical side of that, should it be decided by the Oireachtas that this is the direction we want to go. It is prudent to do that preparation. This is something the Oireachtas has to look at as a group, just like we are looking at health funding and pension funding in the long term. The Cassells report has set out issues that should be looked at, such as the extra earnings that someone who graduates gets, and whether it is fair to ask such a person to make a contribution back. We also have to look at access for students who do not come from backgrounds or families who can afford it. Would they be put off or could their needs be dealt with by other mechanisms? Might collection problems arise? All these are issues that we need to assess. That is why the Oireachtas is taking its time. We are available at any time to answer questions on any issues the committee wishes to raise.

I take it from his response that the Department is pursuing the loans. That is regrettable and should not be done because it places a huge burden on students and does not contribute anything to accessibility or affordability for students. There is ample evidence from across the world that most student debt is made of interest charges that accrue at a later stage through the income contingency loans. The Union of Students in Ireland is implacably opposed to it. Many of the Members of the House are opposed to it. I am seriously worried that the Minister is pursuing option three in parallel with options one and two and is going to try to develop some sort of hybrid of all three as a way of lessening the burden. That is not acceptable.

That has come as news to me, as a member of the Joint Committee on Education and Skills. We had decided to do a technical study because Peter Cassells recommended it. This is a new departure from the Minister. The best thing to do is that the Department fund an expert who joint committee would then hire through public tender who would then carry out a technical study. That would be the best and most independent way of doing it. We need resources to do that. I agree that it should be done fairly. It is shocking that the Minister would announce that this is going ahead given that all previous replies were that every issue relating to the Cassells report was being referred to the Oireachtas committee.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	269	We are working on every issue that has been raised. We are looking at the employer mechanism, which obviously can be assessed by the committee, and the Exchequer mechanism. I am not sitting on my hands and waiting for the assessment work to be carried out. I am moving immediately because there is a crisis, and I am acting to deliver cash straight away, to put an employer's mechanism in place which hopefully will be agreed in the budget, and I am making contingency preparations with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform should it be decided that this is the route to go. I can assure the House that the budget is not exhaustive. We are looking at issues such as cashflow impact, which is the sort of thing that clearly is an issue if this is to be a workable operation. That is wise planning, but we are not making any assumptions about what the Oireachtas committee might recommend to us.

They need it and they are anxious to acquire it. What is the budget in this regard? How many centres are there? Can the Minister tell us a bit more about it? The Teaching Council also has a role in this regard.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	271	The network of education centres consists of 21 full-time and nine part-time centres.  Their principal activity is to facilitate the local delivery of national programmes of teacher professional development on behalf of my Department. They also organise a varied local programme of activities for teachers, school management and parents in response to demand. My Department is the main source of funding for centres through direct grants for core and local course funding. Centres also receive funds for administration costs and room hire from Department-funded support services. The following table provides details of funding issued by my Department for each of the past five years. A total of €17.9 million issued to centres in 2016. It is up, although not dramatically, over the past number of years. It is up from just over €17 million. Centres also have other sources of income including, hire of rooms, local partnerships and partnerships with other State bodies. I have committed under the Action Plan for Education to a programme of actions for the further development of our CPD programmes and their organisation. Under this commitment, I will consider options for the legal model and potential functions of a centre of excellence to have oversight of the supports for school improvement and professional development of teachers, including research and identifying international best practice. The action plan commits to considering the potential of education and training boards, ETBs, to support the delivery of national programmes of continuing professional development. The core remit of education centres as providers of local and innovative training opportunities for teachers will be considered. I am committed to progressing this action item in the second quarter of 2017. The Teaching Council functions in relation to continuing professional development provide that the council will advise me in relation to teachers’ CPD, promote engagement in CPD, conduct research and raise awareness of the benefits of teachers’ learning, among the public and teaching profession alike.FUNDINGFull Time Education Centres20162015201420132012Core Funding€3,024,899€5,099,374€4,744,723€4,735,081€4,738,815Support Service - Allocation €14,846,935€12,778,670€12,850,471€12,329,908€12,640,164Overall Allocation€17,871,834€17,878,044€17,595,194€17,064,989€17,378,979 *The 2016 core funding allocation was adjusted as education centres were required to use accumulated funds held by the centre at the end of the 2015 financial year to meet their expenditure in 2016. **The 2016 figure includes a minor works grant - 10% of core funding - which was introduced in 2016 to assist in the upkeep of the centres buildings.

These people have spent four or five years in college, depending on whether they are primary or secondary teachers. They then go out, very enthusiastically, to teach in the classroom at primary level or secondary level, and unless there is a really good programme of continuing professional development, once they have gone into the classroom, they can be left very isolated. The Minister addressed an excellent conference last week on the forthcoming changes in the primary curriculum which take into account the fact that 95% of children who have gone to primary school have already been at pre-school. There is a disconnect - a shock, in fact, for many kids - when they move from the play and activity-orientated pre-school into a much more regimented primary system. Some excellent ideas were put forward by people like Fergus Finlay as to how it might become more child friendly. What is going to be the role of continuing professional education to make some of the proposed changes work?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	273	Deputy Burton has raised a few issues. There is no doubt that this is a very important area. We need to look more deeply at its impact and at the quantity and quality, and that is why this review is being carried out. At the moment we have 206,000 CPD deliveries, which is up by 23% in the last four or five years. It includes substantial elements for new teachers, including induction under Droichead. It has special education, curricular support and the junior cycle. It also has school leadership as a significant element, with a new centre for school leadership. I share the Deputy's view that transitions are absolutely crucial, and we should look more closely at those transitions between pre-school and primary and between primary and secondary. Those are points where children can get lost in the system. The purpose of the review of the curriculum the NCCA is talking about is to see if we can better aligned those, both at the start and end of primary education, to ensure that children make those transitions more successfully. I agree with the upskilling of our teaching workforce in a time of very rapid change in education. The advent of technology and the power that can have to change the learning environment is an area we need to focus on and get good value from.

He also spoke about a potentially very significant new role for education and training boards, ETBs, particularly at primary level. ETBs only have a small number of primary schools in the country. Is the Minister suggesting that the ETBs might in some way become the vehicle for the education centres? Will the Minister ensure that the different levels of the teaching profession are consulted in full about any changes? The Minister spoke about remedial education and special education. Many people who go into careers in education and develop an interest in those areas would be unable to reach the level of skill and training they have without CPD.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	275	The review is open-ended. It needs to look at best practice in the delivery of upskilling for teachers.At the moment it is divided into a number of education centres and it does not have a central directorate which would identify the direction we should take in the longer term. We need to ask if we need more central policy direction in this area. The education and training boards are a new creation and they are now developing a diversity of services and supporting clustering in different areas. It is worth examining whether they should have a new role in this area. Over time they will evolve additional support services for schools in their neighbourhoods and I am keen to consider that so that we have a local response to local needs on an even greater scale. This is open ended and there will be opportunities for all interest groups to contribute. It is of intimate interest to teachers and all stakeholders in education. We can deliver better in this area, over time, and I will continue to assess the situation accordingly.

Some 21% of the population of Wexford have completed third level education, the joint second lowest rate in the country, lower than the average for the south east of 23% and far lower than the State average of 29%.

My Department is also supportive of the proposed acquisition of a site in Wexford for development of the IT Carlow campus.  Funding has been allocated to enable IT Carlow to acquire this site in that context, with a view to developing a new purpose-built campus there.  The Higher Education Authority has approved this site acquisition on that basis. There are also plans in place for the development of a technological university for the whole south east region consisting of a consortium involving IT Carlow and Waterford Institute of Technology. The Kelly report on the development of a technological university for the south east presented a compelling rationale for a new type of higher education institution to support a step change in the economic and social development of the entire south east region.  This is clearly the overwhelming wish of stakeholders in the region. By creating institutions of greater scale and strength, high-quality multi-campus technological universities will be able to bring greater social and economic benefits to their respective regions through the delivery of a broad range of high-quality education and training in each of their campuses. The core elements of a new technological university in the south east have been already set out. With regard to the legislation to underpin the development of technological universities, the legislative programme was published on 17 January 2017 and the Technological Universities Bill is listed on the Dáil Order Paper and awaiting Committee Stage. Following the finalisation of the ongoing consultation process I will then advance the legislation, having determined a position in relation to any matters raised.

According to the Department's projection, there will be an increase of some 57,000 students seeking full-time education soon, which does not take into account part-time demand or attracting more international students. This is equivalent to four DCUs. Waterford and Carlow have been fighting over which of them should become a university but there is a good argument for starting anew in Wexford. It is an incredibly deprived county with 18.5% on the live register, which is shocking when compared to the national figure. Education is a way out of this and putting a new third level institution in Wexford would make a lot of sense in this context.  Nothing comes cheap but the costs of construction are not the biggest costs. The biggest costs are running it on a day-to-day basis so there is a good argument for putting it in Wexford. I know the national strategy does not think along those lines but that does not mean the Minister should not take a broader view.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	279	We have to look at what is the most effective way to develop regional strength. I regard human resource and talent development as core to the development of any region, including the south east. Any fair assessment would advise against creating myriad new institutions that do not have a solid foundation and cannot make a solid offering. This is from where the technological universities approach came. It is about merging a number of institutions under one body that can give the strength, width and depth that modern regional development needs. We need to move more into applied research and need more level 9 and 10 qualifications, as well as a deeper engagement with the enterprise and public service sectors to develop genuine regional competitive advantage. This approach does not involve "one for everyone in the audience" but tries to create a model that can bring a region to a higher level. This is important from the point of view of regional development because we cannot plan to have a university in every one of our 26 counties. We have to build on resources that will be strong and resilient and will deliver the quality service we need in the regions. Technological universities require mergers and multi-campus locations.
#MickWallace	unknown-#MickWallace-party	unknown-#MickWallace-dob	unknown-#MickWallace-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	280	I am aware of the thinking of the day. The national strategy for higher education report of 2011 stated that any such move would reduce the diversity in the overall system and have a negative impact on its ability to respond to the country's innovation needs and development opportunities. I wonder if this thinking is driven by university league tables. The thinking the Minister is offering delivers an outcome in which the rich stay rich and the poor stay poor. Wexford needs to play catch-up but it is falling further behind all the time. As long as the philosophy of the Minister is applied we will fall further behind. We will be in a worse situation in ten years' time unless there is a change of thinking. There is a really good, rational argument for thinking outside the box and looking at areas that need more help. The primary obligation of a State should be to take best care of those who most need its help, whether they be deprived communities or regions. Wexford is among the three most deprived counties in Ireland, with the county of the Leas-Cheann Comhairle, Donegal, also in the top three. Unless there is joined-up thinking on the part of the Government we will continue to lag behind and will not close the gap. The inequality gap will actually widen.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	281	We are offering joined-up thinking, while the Deputy is offering traditional pork barrel politics by asking for a university in every county. If we have small institutions that cannot deliver the service their regional base needs it will produce a second-class offering to the people, including in Wexford. I am trying to create a quality regional institution, a technological university, that can have the necessary research, progression and innovation capability to be a genuine support to regional diversity and development.

#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	283	The programme for Government contains a commitment to eliminating the use of prefabs in our schools. What actions has the Department taken on this to date? How are we going to move towards the elimination of prefabs? Can we have a timeframe and a date for it?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	284	As the Deputy is aware, it is my intention to replace all purchased temporary accommodation with permanent accommodation, where the need is established, over the lifetime of my Department's capital programme, 2016 to 2021. To enable this development, my Department will carry out an assessment of the number of prefabs being used in schools to deliver the curriculum. This will also determine whether individual prefabs need to be replaced in the context of the long-term accommodation needs of each individual school. When completed, this assessment will quantify the number of prefabs to be replaced. It is intended that this assessment when finalised will enable the replacement of such prefabs to commence in 2019. A funding provision of €180 million is being made available from 2019 for this initiative in the programme. As the Deputy will be also aware, it can be necessary to make use of temporary rented accommodation in order to meet the accommodation needs of schools, when an immediate or short-term need arises. For example, a school may require a temporary building in circumstances where a major school construction project is planned. Such temporary accommodation is removed when the major project concerned is completed.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	285	I thank the Minister for his response, but I am disappointed at the lack of urgency. Based on responses I received to parliamentary questions, I am aware that an assessment was due to be carried out. I understand this assessment process has not commenced. I ask the Minister to confirm if that is the case. I ask him to give an indicative timeframe for the assessment process because we cannot eliminate them until this process is complete. It is a serious issue. As the Minister is aware, money is needed in all sectors of our education system. However, €128 million has been wasted on prefabs over the past five years. That figure came from data recently reported in the media following a freedom of information request. The issue needs to be tackled. Approximately 950 prefab units are being rented in primary and post-primary schools. I have been informed that the process of replacing the prefabs will not commence until 2018. Along with many parents and teachers, I feel this is not good enough. Will the Minister commit to giving the matter urgent consideration and put in place a clear timeframe for the issue to be addressed? I also ask for clarity on the assessment issue.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	286	On the positive side, compared with a decade ago we have half the number of rented prefabs. However, we recognise this is an area we need to address. Obviously, there is pressure on the education capital budget to ensure there is provision for every child. We are going through a period where 20,000 additional places need to be delivered every year, which has absorbed the majority of the budget. Notwithstanding that, we are making provision for this and it will commence. The target is that this will start in 2019. The review will be undertaken in a timely manner to deal with that. The figure I have for the cost of renting the 950 prefabs is €25 million. As I said in the original reply, in any system there will be a requirement for temporary accommodation because populations wax and wane. We are clearly committed to bringing it down to a lower figure than the current level over time.
#CarolNolan	unknown-#CarolNolan-party	unknown-#CarolNolan-dob	unknown-#CarolNolan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	287	I again thank the Minister for his response. I welcome the reduction. The €128 million figure relates to the past five years and came from the media, based on freedom of information data. I remain unconvinced that the issue is being given the priority it deserves. We are wasting millions of euro that could be channelled into special education, for example, as we mentioned earlier and many other different areas. Building schools will save money in the long term because we will not be wasting millions on prefabs that provide substandard conditions. I have spoken to principals who have informed me that they could have had their extension built three times over for the same amount they have poured down the drain for their prefabs. Further money is being wasted on maintenance of these prefabs. As the Minister knows, many of the prefabs deteriorate over time. I have seen many of them in a dilapidated state - I am sure the Minister also has - and they are simply not fit to accommodate children and teachers. It is also a huge waste of money. The Minister continually refers to money and budgets, and this needs to be considered over the long term.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	288	We also need to look at it the other way round. That €25 million being spent on 950 prefabs would probably build one secondary school and one primary school. Switching that sort of a budget to building would not replace 950 prefabs. We are trying to strike a balance. We want to minimise the number, but in the short term a big population bulge requires flexible responses. In an ideal world we would keep these down to just transitional arrangements. My predecessors and I inherited a situation where 2,000 temporary prefabs were in use. It is now down to half of that and we have a programme to reduce it to much lower levels over time. However, a balance needs to be struck in allocating the capital budget.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	289	About an hour ago I chaired a briefing by the Union of Students in Ireland concerning its position paper on the funding of higher education. The student representatives have grave concern that the Minister is strongly considering the third option in the Cassells report of income-contingent loans as a system of funding higher education. They outlined to us forcefully how such a system would badly impact on the lives of students well into the future.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	290	I thank Deputy Broughan. Deputy Pringle earlier raised a rather similar question and I do not want to repeat myself. Peter Cassells chaired that expert group and looked at the pressure on higher education over the recent period where funding was effectively frozen and numbers increased. That has put the system under considerable strain. We are now considering how to establish a sustainable funding model for the future. Peter Cassells indicated a number of options, as the Deputy knows. I have not been sitting on my hands. I immediately worked on an Exchequer option with €36.5 million this year, a three-year programme with demographics built in increasing to €160 million over the three years. With the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, I have set up an Exchequer-employer mechanism which will generate an additional €200 million by 2020, if approved in the budget. The option of income-contingent loans involving the contribution of students is being considered by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills. Clearly we need to have political and social consensus on how we proceed. Peter Cassells has set out the merits of it in that people get a very substantially increased livelihood. If they get a third-level qualification, it dramatically improves their lifetime earnings and he is asking if people should contribute back. People have raised other concerns, such as the cashflow impact and whether it would create a barrier for people from disadvantaged areas or whether there are other ways to ensure people from disadvantaged areas get access. Those issues are being thrashed out by the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills. We are doing a technical evaluation of how it would work if it were selected. As Peter Cassells said, doing nothing is not an option. Therefore I have not done nothing. I am moving immediately on the areas where I have potential to act and have, I think, the support of the House. The view on the remaining element remains to be seen.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	291	The student representatives outlined to us the impact on students. It is a huge struggle to get through college in the first place with the rents and other living costs, given the existing registration fee the previous Fine Gael-Labour Government dramatically increased. All of that adds to making it very difficult, particularly for people from disadvantaged areas. The Minister and I both represent a number of areas where the uptake of third level education is still below 15% or 20%, which needs to be the Minister's first task even as an ordinary Deputy. We have had analysis on the economic front and the Minister mentioned his liaison with the Minister, Deputy Donohoe. A recent report by Dr. Charles Larkin shows that income-contingent loans could cost the Exchequer up to €10 billion, thereby adding significantly to our national debt. Given that so many young Irish people traditionally emigrate, there could be a very negative impact on our national debt over which there are grave concerns, particularly in 2019 and 2020.Overall it is clear that it would be disastrous, particularly for children, second chance education, maturer students, students with disabilities and so on. I urge the Minister not to go down that route.
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	292	I do not think there was a question in the Deputy's contribution. I appreciate people will have different views and suppose Peter Cassells put this out so that it would be seriously considered. It is important people consider the case as it is made. I have an open mind on it, as do others. Deputy Broughan criticised the increase in fees but part of Peter Cassells's vision is that there would be no fees at the point of entry and that there would be substantial income support for those from low income families to get into college. No one has a monopoly and advocates are not hard-headed capitalists who view education as being for the privileged. Peter Cassells has envisaged zero fees and is examining this. We need to have an honest debate. This is like the issues of health and pensions. We need to examine how we will fund these areas, which will place increasing demands on all our families. Will it be through the public purse or otherwise? We need to examine viable and sustainable funding models and I am trying to take the actions within my area that I can.
#TommyBroughan	unknown-#TommyBroughan-party	unknown-#TommyBroughan-dob	unknown-#TommyBroughan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	293	The Minister mentioned employer contributions of €200 million. The increase in Exchequer funding is dismal compared to the level of funding before austerity began. What are the Minister's plans for the 2018 budget? Is the Minister considering any specific additional thing? The Minister's party seems to be the one party that does not have a clear view on the issue. One has not been articulated. Before the general election, it was shy about stating where it stood. Will the Minister promote a full-scale Dáil debate on this subject before the end of this term or the next one?
#RichardBruton	Fine Gael	23397	unknown-#RichardBruton-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	294	We need to do a bit of an evaluation, as do all parties. One should not decide that one's mind is made up before evaluating the issue, which is the danger with the Deputy's line of questioning. We need to consider any proposal on its merits. As the Deputy is aware, I have specific proposals for 2018. I have indicated already that I have received a commitment for a demographic increase. In other words, additional money will follow the additional students in the coming year. This has not happened for the past nine years. Therefore, there is an additional commitment. On top of this, we will have an employer contribution. It is out to consultation but it is hoped that it will start next year and rise over time to 2020, when it will be €200 million. Those are two substantial commitments - €160 million from the Exchequer and €200 million from employers. What else the Oireachtas wants to do remains in issue. We are a minority Government. We have to work with others to see what is the consensus approach to the issue. Much like the health area, we must do it on the basis of how we will fund needs in a decade's time and not just say that we do not like the cut of a particular proposal.

The greatest numbers are being seen in Italy and Romania. In light of Brexit, it is important to point out that viruses are not in any way aware of borders. It is important we have good vaccination policy in this country. There is a responsibility on us as elected members to dispel some of the myths that are out there. We are what has been described as a post-knowledge economy. There is much information available to us but we are seeing the work of someone on Wikipedia having the same status as information and science from a reputable agency. There is a rise in populism and emerging mistrust of scientific facts. We have excellent research in Ireland and across Europe. It is worth noting that a significant amount of taxpayers' money is spent in this country and in Europe on scientific research. There seems to be an issue with disseminating the information from the scientific and research field to the public. It is our duty as elected representatives as well as that of those in the Department of Health to try to get the message out. It is funny to hear of ridiculous studies in some publications that outline the positive effects of red wine, chocolate or sex on one's longevity when real scientific facts and strong scientific data that have been peer reviewed and assessed as being fact seem to be lost. Vaccinations prevent many diseases. Notably, these days the issues surround the MMR vaccine, which I am referring to specifically today, as well as other vaccines such as the human papillomavirus, HPV, vaccine. On measles, we need approximately 95% coverage to get what is called herd immunity. If we start to drop below that level, we will get measles outbreaks. We spend much time in this Chamber discussing issues such as waiting lists and hospital bed waits but, if we have a measles outbreak in Ireland, we will have something far more serious than capacity in our health service on our hands. Anyone who was around when measles were around knows that it can cause deafness, blindness and death. It is a very serious illness. Over the passage of time, sometimes people forget how serious are these issues. Back in the day, in 1796, which was 220 years ago, Edward Jenner took from cattle the cowpox vaccine and started to give it to humans. This was deemed heresy and there were cartoons published at the time depicting people with animal heads. In my view, we are kind of heading back to that situation, so it is important that we as elected representatives and the Department do not lionise ignorance or applaud conspiracy theories that would do anything to harm public health.
#HelenMcEntee	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-party	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-dob	unknown-#HelenMcEntee-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	298	I thank Deputy O’Connell for raising this extremely important issue and giving me the opportunity to update the House on the matter. I am taking this on behalf of the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris. The announcement by the World Health Organization concerning the increase in measles outbreaks in Europe has brought this issue to the attention of the media and the wider public. However, we were already aware of the issue and had been taking appropriate response measures. The European Centres for Disease Prevention and Control, ECDC, issued a rapid risk assessment concerning the risk of spread of measles and sustained transmission in EU countries related to an ongoing outbreak in Romania on 3 March 2017. It noted measles outbreaks in a number of EU countries in 2016 and the continued increase in the number of cases this year. It also noted that outbreaks in three other EU countries have been linked to the current one in Romania. Actions have been taken at both EU and national level. The EU Health Security Committee met on 10 March to discuss the outbreaks and to ensure a co-ordinated response across member states. The ECDC continues to monitor the situation and can provide technical assistance to the member states if needed. The health system in Ireland is aware of the outbreak and has put in place measures to identify any threat and treat any cases.The HSE health protection surveillance centre circulated an update on 28 March to departments of public health as well as general practitioners, consultants in infectious diseases, emergency medicine and microbiology and other health professionals. This notification provided an update on the risk of measles in Europe and the risk of importation into Ireland, and reminded health professionals of what to do if they encounter suspected cases of measles. The European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control's rapid risk assessment noted that immunisation is the only effective preventative measure against acquiring measles. Immunisation against measles was introduced in Ireland in 1985 and from 1988 onwards, the MMR vaccine was used to replace the single measles vaccine. The vaccine is included in the primary childhood immunisation programme, with the first dose given at 12 months and the second dose given at between four and five years of age. It can also be given at any age to those who need it for travel for work or to protect vulnerable children or adults. Immunisation rates in Ireland remain high. Vaccination rates for MMR at 24 months were 93% in 2015 and have been above 90% since 2008. I note the Deputy's point in this regard. The MMR vaccination rate is slightly lower than 95%, standing at 92% in the third quarter of 2015. Vaccination rates fell when links between MMR and autism were first reported in the 1990s. At that time, people falsely linked the development of autism with MMR but, as the Deputy noted, these claims have been fully discredited. More than 500 million doses of MMR have been used in more than 90 countries around the world since the early 1970s. The World Health Organization recognises MMR as a highly effective vaccine with an outstanding safety record. Although uptake rates are high, we must not be complacent. A number of imported cases of measles were recorded in Ireland last year. The only protection against the condition is vaccination and I encourage all children, teenagers and young adults who have not been immunised with MMR to protect themselves by getting this important vaccine. I concur with Deputy O'Connell that all public representatives must play their part in ensuring people get this message.
#KateOConnell	unknown-#KateOConnell-party	unknown-#KateOConnell-dob	unknown-#KateOConnell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	299	The Minister of State's reply was reassuring, although I am concerned that the vaccination rate stands at 92%. We will be in serious trouble if it falls much further. Andrew Wakefield, a discredited doctor, is taking part in a roadshow that will soon visit this country. It is important that a message is sent to parents that the study carried out by this individual was completely discredited and he was struck off the register of medical practitioners in the United Kingdom. Mr. Wakefield is due to visit Ireland on tour with his anti-vaccine story. These anti-vaccine campaigners prey on vulnerable people and public concerns. Clearly, no one wants to give a child anything that is perceived as doing harm. It is important that public representatives and the Department of Health get the message across to parents that the individual in question, who bizarrely continues to use his title, has been discredited. I thought witch doctors and magic spells had gone out with the Dark Ages. We must work hard to increase the MMR vaccination rate to 95% because if it falls much further from the current rate of 92%, the concept of herd immunity will be lost and we and the rest of Europe will have a problem with the spread of infectious diseases. As the Minister stated, the way to deal with the problem is to vaccinate children.

Last year's outbreak, when almost 50 cases of measles were recorded in May and June, demonstrates the need to continue to send out a message on this issue and try to increase the MMR vaccination rate to 95% or higher. In that regard, the Health Service Executive continues to try to increase all vaccination rates, including MMR. Ongoing training is provided for health professions and meetings take place with key stakeholders, including the Department of Education and Skills and school management bodies. Articles have been placed in magazines directed at parents and various health professions. Specifically on MMR, letters have been sent to all language and summer schools as well as the Central Applications Office highlighting measles outbreaks in Europe and the importance of the MMR vaccination. Activities are also planned for European immunisation week, which runs from 24 until 30 April, to highlight measles outbreaks in Europe and the importance of the vaccination. Significant work remains to be done in this matter on which we must not become complacent. I thank Deputy O'Connell again for raising this matter.

In early January, I joined a delegation led by the Ceann Comhairle which visited Ibrahim Halawa in prison in Egypt. At that time, Mr. Halawa had been going on and off hunger strike. All members of the delegation strongly advised him not to do so but his actions in this regard were born of despair. I thank and commend our ambassador to Egypt, Damien Cole, and his team in Cairo on the work they are doing. I also commend the Minister and his staff on their efforts. This is a humanitarian rather than political issue on which all of us must work together to achieve a resolution.  I am concerned for Ibrahim Halawa, a young man who has spent more than three years in prison and whose trials has been delayed or adjourned 20 times. Mr. Halawa's trial is due to recommence on 6 April. I have learned from contact with his family that his physical and mental health are deteriorating. I hope the Minister is in a position to provide an update on his health without breaching confidence. I understand an independent medical assessment of his condition was carried out by an Irish doctor with the assistance of the Department. While we were in Cairo, a doctor visited Mr. Halawa and carried out some rudimentary tests and we requested that an electrocardiogram be performed. I ask the Minister to provide an update on what action is being taken in this case. I also urge the Government to insist to the Egyptian authorities that Mr. Halawa is released on humanitarian grounds without further delay. 
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	302	I am very frustrated about the case of Ibrahim Halawa. The Taoiseach, in reply to a question from Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett yesterday, indicated he had written to President el-Sisi of Egypt. President el-Sisi's statement that he cannot release people before their trial is a lie. Some 200 young students were released by the el-Sisi government shortly before Christmas. At that time, we pleaded with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to appeal for Ibrahim Halawi's release under the same programme. It is not true, therefore, that President el-Sisi cannot release Mr. Halawi. I will focus on an entirely different aspect of the case. The European neighbourhood instrument is an EU programme under which Egypt has received €320 million to date from Europe. Ireland makes a financial contribution to this programme, the purpose of which is to promote human rights and fundamental freedoms such as the freedom of association and assembly. What the hell are we giving money to Egypt under this programme for when the country has interned an extremely ill young Irishman without trial? Mr. Halawi's trial is due to start again for the 21st time today.  In addition to giving it money, we are promoting a beef trade with Egypt. Live cattle exports to the country resumed for the first time in 17 years after the Minister's visit to Egypt. The trade is worth approximately €40 million and is expected to rise in value to €200 million. Is the export of beef more important than this young man's life? Why are we using the European neighbourhood instrument, under which the EU provides money to Egypt for human rights, under false pretences? Why are we exporting beef to Egypt in the hope of making substantial profits for big ranchers and sacrificing Ibrahim Halawa on the altar of profit? I ask the Minister to address those questions.
#CharlesFlanagan	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-party	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-dob	unknown-#CharlesFlanagan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	303	This long-running and complex consular case continues to be a top priority for the Government and substantial resources and time are being devoted to it not only by myself, but by the Taoiseach, Ministers, officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs, by our ambassador and his team in Cairo, and the entire Irish diplomatic network. Last Monday, the Taoiseach renewed his appeal to the Egyptian President to release its Irish citizen and return him to Ireland without delay. This is the Government’s objective, and we are working day in and day out to seek to secure that outcome. lbrahim Halawa was back in court today for the latest hearing in the case in which he is a defendant along with more than 400 other accused persons. Our embassy officials were at the court to observe proceedings, as they have been at every hearing in the case to date and before coming to the Chamber, I received a report on the case. Some progress was made today as 11 more witnesses gave evidence. At the end of the hearing, Ibrahim's lawyers requested his release on medical grounds and the judge undertook to examine the matter. I very much welcome that development. The next hearing in the case will take place on 26 April. My Government colleagues and I have been disappointed and frustrated by the slow progress in the court case. Recent hearings, however, have generally been more substantive, with witnesses called and cross-examined, giving rise to cautious optimism that the trial may now, at last, be moving towards a conclusion. This is crucially important because, as Deputies will be aware, particularly those who visited Cairo earlier in the year, the Egyptian authorities have consistently said that they cannot intervene in a matter that is before the courts, and that this issue can only be resolved after the trial concludes. This complex and sensitive consular case has been a priority matter for me since my appointment as Minister. No stone has been left unturned by the Government and our diplomatic service in our efforts to secure Ibrahim's release and his return to Ireland to his family and, indeed, to resume his studies. Our embassy in Cairo has dedicated exceptional work to this case with an unprecedented number of prison visits to ensure his health and welfare is monitored and that any concerns are immediately followed up in an appropriate and proper manner. Reports about lbrahim Halawa's health are a matter of the utmost concern for me and my Government colleagues. In light of these concerns the Government took the unprecedented step last week of making arrangements for an Irish medical doctor, nominated by the Chief Medical Officer in the Department of Health, to visit Ibrahim in prison and to undertake an assessment of his health. The doctor also had an opportunity to speak with Ibrahim at length. The Egyptian authorities have a clear responsibility to ensure the health and welfare of Ibrahim Halawa. The Government and the Department have consistently underlined this in all contacts with Egyptian interlocutors. Ireland's embassy in Cairo is maintaining ongoing contact with the Egyptian authorities on issues relating to Ibrahim’s welfare and health. I have raised these issues repeatedly with Egyptian counterparts, including in a further recent face-to-face meeting with Egyptian Foreign Minister Shoukry. I am concerned at persistent reports that lbrahim Halawa is on hunger strike. I urge him in the strongest terms not to pursue such a course of action, and to protect his health in every way. I also urge all parties who are in contact with him or who have influence with him to dissuade him from any actions that would be detrimental to his health. In this regard, I welcome Deputy O'Brien's comments. The Department maintains open lines of communication with the Halawa family and has been keeping family members fully informed of all developments and updates received from the Egyptian authorities. The most recent face-to-face meeting between family representatives and officers from the Department was on Monday, 3 April. I assure the House that we will continue to keep pressure on Egypt until we see the release and return home of Ibrahim Halawa.

When I met Ibrahim, and in correspondence since, I assured him, as others did, that we will not forget about him and we will not give up until we get him home. How we approach this is important. While I do not doubt anyone's bona fides and that everyone cares about his situation, some of the comments that have been made from time to time have done more damage than good to him. People should be aware of that and should temper their remarks in that regard. They are very aware in Egypt-----

#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	315	We have a history of hunger strikes in this country going back to the fight for independence. Nobody goes on hunger strike unless he or she is utterly driven to it by frustration and is left with no other choice. That is why this young man has gone on hunger strike. For almost four years, we have been polite and nice, praising the ambassador and President el-Sisi's Government and telling them how wonderful they are without any result. I have every right to raise the question of the influence of economics on political decisions. It is a political decision to be nice to the Egyptian Government instead of telling them like the Australian Government did, "You do not do this to our citizen; we will not tolerate it". That is the attitude the Government needs to take. Ibrahim also suffers from a dangerous illness called Leishmaniasis, which kills 2 million people a year globally. It is spread through overpopulation in places like prisons and places which are poorly sanitised. He needs to be released and, although the doctor sent by the Minister to examine him has made a recommendation that he be released on humanitarian grounds, we are told the judge is considering it. We need more than consideration; we need this young man released, looked after medically and returned home.

I assure Members that the Government continues to do everything it can to ensure the authorities in Egypt are in absolutely no doubt about our determination to see this young man returned to his home and family. There is no question of the Government or, indeed, this House forgetting about or neglecting the welfare and health of our citizen. It is my solemn duty as Minister to be responsible for the health and welfare of our citizens abroad. No consular case is receiving the type of engagement Ibrahim Halawa's case is. However, the Egyptian authorities continue to detain our citizen, and only they can make a decision to facilitate his return home. I assure the Deputies that we will continue at every level to do everything possible and appropriate to apply pressure on Cairo on behalf of our citizen and also through our contacts with international colleagues and the EU. Only last Monday, I addressed this issue with EU High Representative Mogherini and the Secretary General of the League of Arab States, Mr. Aboul-Gheit. Our embassy will continue to follow up thoroughly on all the issues to ensure Ibrahim's health and welfare are looked after. I reiterate my appeal to him to take food and nourishment. I assure the House we are active on the matter of the independent medical report which was undertaken, received and is now being acted upon at the highest level. In response to Deputy O'Brien, I expect over the next few days to have a further conversation with my Egyptian counterpart, Foreign Minister Shoukry. In the meantime, the Government continues to provide extensive consular support in the case. I wish to again underline the fact that the Department remains in close contact with both the Halawa family and the citizen's legal representatives.

In February, Deputy Donnchadh Ó Laoghaire, Deputy Mick Barry, Deputy Micheál Martin, Deputy Billy Kelleher, I and others attended a presentation by the Cork Early Years Alliance. It was a very powerful presentation. On a visit to Cork, the Minister had an opportunity to meet with some members of the alliance. It was a stark and frightening presentation. The alliance informed us of the services being provided by 13 different member organisations in terms of early years care for children up to the age of three. There are 348 children in Cork receiving a service from 13 different organisations. These areas have significant disadvantage and in many cases the children involved have complex needs. We are told by the alliance that 233 of these children will lose a service by September. The critical immediate issue is the emergency funding promised by the Minister's Department in respect of the change in the regulations around the qualifications required by the child care workers who are in these services. That is the key immediate issue. I will come back on the long-term issues in a moment.
#DonnchadhOLaoghaire	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-party	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-dob	unknown-#DonnchadhOLaoghaire-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	318	It was a very stark presentation. I have raised this issue with the Minister previously. I thank her for her presence. There are 13 services looking at potentially closing in September 2018 and seven of those are concerned they will have to close this September. They offer a vitally important service to children aged from naught to three years. It is at that age that early intervention is most crucial and makes the most difference. I anticipate the Minister will say she announced €1 million in sustainability funding, which is welcome. There are longer term issues. On the €1 million funding, the latest position is that services received contracts on 24 March and were asked to return them. They were asked the same thing and received the same forms well over a month ago. This funding was announced back in January and February at the latest. The services have not been in a position to draw down any of that funding. The services have had to borrow, use their own savings and come up with all sorts of arrangements just to keep the thing on the road. They need to be able to access, in the first instance, the funding that has been committed to but which they cannot get their hands on. That is the most crucial issue to ensure these are sustainable even into the summer.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	319	We are talking about 13 not-for-profit community crèches here. There are 87 jobs at stake and 349 children involved: 44% of those children come from one-parent families; 73% come from families that can only continue on the basis of State income support; and 33% have specific disadvantage. The demands of the campaigners are straightforward. Apart from the emergency funding already mentioned there are three demands. First, the universal payment per child per hour should increase from €4.60 to €9.20, that is, it should be doubled. Second, there should be additional staff grants. Third, their work should be recognised not just in terms of value for labour activation but in terms of what it is, that is crucial early years intervention. I would like the Minister to comment on those demands from these campaigners who provide such a vital service within these communities.
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	320	I thank the Corkmen. Child care in Ireland is changing, and changing forever. Sustainable community services have a place in our ambitious plans. There should be no doubt about that. Services in Cork city have been proactive in producing research that makes clear the unique benefits of high quality care and education for children living in areas of urban disadvantage and elsewhere. This research is an important part of the long overdue national debate on child care, which is now under way. When I visited Togher in Cork six weeks ago, I met representatives of the community sector. As someone who has campaigned and worked in this area for over three decades, I could immediately identify with the challenges they face. It was a productive discussion with a sharing of information and views. The providers are also in regular contact with my Department. The challenges which have been identified are not unique. They are issues that were raised by community providers in my constituency in Dublin South-West and by community and other providers last weekend when I attended and addressed the Early Childhood Ireland conference. I assure Deputies we are aware of the concerns and are taking action. Commitment and passion for child care is admirable but it is not enough if we are serious about child safety, as I am. Training, education and qualifications are needed so parents can be confident their child is being looked after in safety. Some community services, including in Cork, were impacted by recent changes in regulations. The rules were changed to prevent an over-reliance on community employment scheme participants who did not hold qualifications in child care. I accept this has caused short-term difficulties and my Department has now concluded arrangements for up to €1 million of additional funding to be made to these services. The first payments under this programme will be received by services this week, including in five Cork services. My Department is in the process of securing the assistance of expert financial analysts to undertake work with services to assist them with assessing their sustainability. This work will link with the programme for Government commitment to conduct and publish an independent review of the cost of providing quality child care in Ireland. This commitment aligns closely with the work on the development of the affordable childcare scheme, including options for further development of the scheme over time. Initial scoping work on the independent review is being progressed in that context. The independent review is a priority action for my Department in 2017. The affordable childcare scheme will deliver significantly increased rates of subvention to the most disadvantaged families. This scheme will lift the barrier that prevents parents from taking up offers of work, training and education because they cannot afford child care. Deputies will be aware that this is an ambitious task. We also have to get the IT systems right which will require more work. My officials are examining how parents and community child care services will benefit from the additional investment I obtained in budget 2017 for September. I hope to update Deputies in that regard in the very near future.  In budget 2017, I was pleased to secure €14.5 million to help ease the burden of administration on child care providers by paying for non-contact time on top of existing payments. Providers will receive payments this summer. Community child care services that provide the various funding schemes operated by my Department will receive payments. The average ECCE service with 25 children will receive approximately an additional €2,200. My Department and its agents, Pobal and the 30 city and county childcare committees work closely with services that are experiencing financial difficulty offering a range of supports and expertise. I will continue to keep in contact with community services regarding the challenges they face. My officials are also working with Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and other support services, to ensure we have the proper funding and supports in place for children and families to ensure that community child care providers can provide their unique role in our communities.

I think she appreciates how vital these services are. The reality is that without them many of those children will be completely left behind by our society. They are in areas of disadvantage and many of the children have complex needs, including special needs and issues in terms of the home environment and so on. That is the reality. I think the Minister appreciates that. I welcome that the first payments are being issued this week. Can the Minister give a commitment that all relevant payments will be issued immediately on receipt of contracts? As Deputy Ó Laoghaire said, the contracts have been submitted by the Cork providers. More fundamentally, when will the overall independent review be completed by? The emergency funding is a stopgap. It will probably get them to September. We are being told by these providers that seven of them are in grave danger. They are at imminent risk of closure in the autumn. It is not a position we can stand over.Please, work with the providers on these issues in a genuine spirit of co-operation and ensure that their funding is on a sustainable footing so that these crucial services are maintained into the future.

I recognise that she has a long and well-known background in early years services dating back to An Cosán. There are two major parts - the short and long terms - to this issue. In the short term, we were trying to address the urgent matter of access to funding. A commitment was made in that regard. I welcome that some of that funding will come on stream this week and I hope the remainder of the services, not only in Cork but nationally, will see it entering their accounts in the coming week. However, the longer term issue remains. I hope the Minister takes account of the research conducted in Cork by various organisations and ensures that this matter is resolved on an ongoing basis. Some services will not benefit from the funding, including one in Cork that deals primarily with Travellers and has no entitlement to sustainability funding because it was not reliant on community employment, CE, schemes to that extent. A number of such community services will need additional subventions on an ongoing basis. I hope the Minister will commit to keeping an eye on this matter.
#MickBarry	unknown-#MickBarry-party	unknown-#MickBarry-dob	unknown-#MickBarry-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	323	I have three points. The first payments under this programme will be received by services this week, including five in Cork. Better late than never, I suppose, and it is welcome news, but what of the others? Will they receive their money by Easter or by the end of April? I am referring to centres that have submitted all of the paperwork and are just waiting for what they were promised and what has been announced in no fewer than three separate press statements to the Evening Echo. I asked the Minister three questions about the demands of the campaigners, but she did not reply. Could she reply to this supplementary question? The Minister referred to qualifications, which are important. Qualified staff should be well paid, but the average pay for child care professionals is €10.26 per hour. I support the Big Start campaign's call for €15 per hour. Will the Minister comment on the issues of low pay among these professionals and increase the rate to €15?
#KatherineZappone	unknown-#KatherineZappone-party	unknown-#KatherineZappone-dob	unknown-#KatherineZappone-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	324	I might begin with Deputy Barry's questions on the campaigners' call for the universal payment to be doubled. I would love to see that, but it will require significant additional investment. I have indicated that I am committed to doing that in the next budget. I achieved a significant increase in investment for this year and am looking for something similar in 2018. We are far behind where we want to be in terms of Government investment in child care. That happened as a result of how recent Governments responded to this issue. I anticipate that Deputies will support the request for additional investment in September as I work on budget 2018. That is how we will increase the universal payment. As to an additional staff grant, we are examining that issue in the context of assigning financial analysts to work one-on-one with services with a view to assessing their business models and their requests for money or more staff supports to provide child care in light of levels of need in their respective areas. I acknowledge the commitment to the early years sector to which Deputy Ó Laoghaire referred. I understand that the grants are taking a while. That is disappointing, but they are coming. As I indicated, money is being made available and financial analysts to work directly with those services that need them will be appointed. We will provide non-contact time grants again, probably this June. Those are additional moneys. We hope to progress our independent review in 2017.

I have met him and his officials regarding it a couple of times. I thank them for giving of their time over the past year or more. It was one of the first issues I raised when I first joined the Dáil. I did so because of the importance of such schemes to individuals and communities, not just in my constituency of Kildare North, but elsewhere. This is a problem nationally, as I am sure the Minister is aware. It has also been raised by my colleagues, Deputies O'Dea and Ó Cuív. We must examine the current Tús schemes and I want to determine with the Minister how their timeframes can be extended in certain circumstances. This matter is included in the programme for Government, which is welcome. The intention of these schemes is to reintroduce people to full and gainful employment. Unfortunately, that is not the outcome, and may never be, for all participants. We must focus on delivering improvements in that regard. The system is not working well. Participants on Tús schemes are carrying out valuable work for their communities. The difficulty is that, although they must leave the schemes after a year, no one is coming through to replace them and allow their work to continue and their communities and hosts - football clubs, soccer clubs, athletics clubs, etc. - to gain. This problem is having a negative effect on participants, communities and groups. Participants are engaging in JobPath schemes and the like because they are not able to continue with Tús. Will the Minister extend the Tús schemes for people in particular age brackets who know that, realistically, they will not be able to return to full-time employment but who nevertheless provide a much-valued social contribution to their schemes and communities? That contribution needs to be extended. I am unsure as to whether the problem in this regard is that unemployment is decreasing and people are not coming through or whether there is an issue with getting on lists, but the lists are not coming through. I engage with the hosts and scheme administrators on the ground. They are not getting the lists or a continuity of people, which has a detrimental effect on everyone involved. Given the age profile in question - over 55, 57 or 60 years, for example - we need to consider extending the schemes for these individuals. The schemes have brought benefits and advantages, but they need to be reviewed in certain areas in order to help their participants. The current system is not working because of a major issue. If it is not addressed, I would be concerned for all involved. Some schemes have no participants. The main sufferers of that are the communities, groups and those participants who had to leave their schemes.

Community employment and Tús are part of my Department's range of programmes and schemes, catering for long-term unemployed jobseekers and those most distant from the labour market. They are designed to break the cycle of unemployment and maintain work readiness, thereby improving a person's opportunities of returning to the labour market or getting a job for the first time. Employment programmes also support the delivery of vital services in local communities. The programmes deliver on two levels. First, they provide a person who is unemployed with the opportunity of work experience and a chance to develop new skills to prepare him or her for employment in the open labour market. Second, they play a very important role in augmenting service delivery to local communities in key areas such as child care, health and social care, drug rehabilitation and local amenities. All areas of the country have benefitted from these programmes. I have seen this first-hand over the past few months when I visited various schemes throughout the country and I know it from my experience in my constituency down through the years. As the economic recovery takes hold and the overall level of unemployment continues to fall - it is almost one third of what it was a few years ago - the need to adapt employment programmes to the changing circumstances and the needs of jobseekers has become more apparent and urgent. With this in mind, my Department undertook an analysis of the CE programme. While the primary focus was on CE, the review also looked at other employment programmes such as Tús and Gateway. The report made a number of recommendations in regard to the operation of these schemes. As the Deputy may be aware, I recently brought a memorandum on the programmes to Government and I obtained approval to publish the review report and to progress its various recommendations. I intend to publish the report in the next few days. As part of the implementation of new measures, my Department will be consulting with key stakeholders, such as supervisors and providers, in the coming weeks and implementation of the new measures will commence thereafter. The nature and format of the consultation process is being finalised by my Department officials. I assure the Deputy that the work being done through programmes like CE and Tús is highly valued and recognised by Government. It is work that has to be done and we need to ensure there are people available to do it. I believe the changes to be made over the coming months will strengthen the schemes, widen the range and pool of people who can take part and help to ensure they continue to support people who are long-term unemployed to gain valuable skills and experience while continuing to support the delivery of community services.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	327	I thank the Minister for his reply. The Minister is correct that the motivation of these schemes is to help people back into full time employment and in that regard they are succeeding. However, currently there are many schemes with no participants. I would like to know the reason there are no participants on some schemes and what can be done to encourage greater participation in schemes. Is this because more people are being employed or because of a lack of throughput of lists? I am not here to criticise the system in overall terms but if the schemes are to work as effectively as we would all like then it is important that when one participant finishes he or she is replaced within a few days to ensure continuity in the system for participants and communities but that is not happening. I can bring the Minister to a host of schemes in Naas, Kilcock, Maynooth, Celbridge, Leixlip and Clane that are suffering because of a lack of participants. There are massive gaps between one participant finishing on a scheme and another starting, if at all. There is another problem in regard to JobPath. Many people take up places in Tús while awaiting a place on JobPath. These people are required to meet once a week with a case officer who helps them to get back into full time employment. Many of these people, because of their age profile, may not get back into full time employment. If such people were allowed to remain on a Tús scheme and continue to meet with their case supervisor on a regular basis in relation to obtaining full time employment this would ensure that the Tús scheme and community could still avail of and benefit from their input. In regard to the CE scheme, I know people who were earmarked for CE schemes but had to take up positions on JobPath because of a delay in the commencement of the CE scheme. If two or three weeks after these people took up positions on JobPath the vacancies arose for which they were earmarked and all involved wanted them to do, including their case officers, supervisors etc., they could not take them up because they were required to complete their time on the JobPath scheme. They are now locked into the JobPath scheme for a year. There are very restrictive practices around these schemes that need to be reviewed.

We do not allow people who have been referred to JobPath to chop and change from one scheme or programme to another. We have never allowed that and we do not propose to do so. A participant in a programme or scheme should complete it. For all sorts of reasons we do not want people changing mid-stream from one scheme or programme to another. A person who is referred to JobPath, who has a start date for commencement on Tús or CE within four weeks, is not required to take up the place on JobPath. If the timeframe in regard to participation in the Tús or CE is more than four weeks he or she is required to take up the JobPath position. What has happened is pretty straightforward. We had approximately 25,000 places on CE schemes. This was increased to 30,000 plus places. Tús was then introduced, followed by Gateway, JobBridge and JobPath. Unemployment has since decreased by two thirds. It is not surprising that there is a mismatch between the number of schemes and programmes available and the number of people available to participate in them. The numbers are slowly being pared back following the withdrawal of JobBridge and the phasing out of Gateway. Because CE and Tús provide vital work on the ground that needs to be done and because of their important social inclusion role, we do not want them to be unable to fill their places, as is currently the case. There are a number of things that I propose to do. I intend to widen the pool of people who are available by reducing the age limit to bring in more younger workers. I will have to think long and hard about what to do for older workers. I also propose to allow people to remain on a scheme for more than a year if they are doing a qualification. We need to do better. When people have completed a year on JobPath they should be referred almost immediately to CE or Tús. A person who has spent a year working with JobPath and has not found a job - most people do not find a job having spent a year on JobPath - is a perfect candidate for Tús and CE, in my view. I do not know why the lists are not being referred on. I acknowledge there is a problem in that regard. I also intend to review the top-up paid to people who participate in CE or Tús. If one includes lone parents, people with disabilities and so on, there are more than 100,000 people who are eligible for Tús and CE. The top-up is only €22.50 and that is not enough. When account is taken of the cost of lunch, transport and so on a person might be worse off for participating in one of these schemes. I propose to look at that issue in the context of the budget. In the next few days, I propose to announce a relaxing of the rules in terms of who can participate. I am not closed to going further if that does not work.

The Green Party has proposed this motion because it believes the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for the mothers of babies who are born prematurely is a vital first step in tackling the particular challenges faced by the parents and families of prematurely delivered babies, as well as the babies themselves. I acknowledge the many parents who have written to me in recent weeks in support of this motion. I welcome the mothers, fathers and children who are in the Gallery for this afternoon's debate.  I thank them for their attendance. It is possible that any positive changes we make to maternity leave will be too late for some of them. They are not here for themselves, but for future mothers and fathers and future generations. I admire their strength, courage and generosity of spirit. Many of them know at first hand what is at stake today. They passionately want to see a more caring Ireland for mothers who are unexpectedly catapulted into a different world where they must face a challenge of a magnitude they have never have faced before.  A mother who wrote to me yesterday suggested that if people lived through these circumstances, they would not think twice about making this change. I welcome members of the Irish Premature Babies organisation to the Gallery. I thank them for supporting this motion. I acknowledge the selfless and dedicated work that is done tirelessly by this group and all charities to support and advocate for the families of premature infants and the premature infants themselves. One in every 16 women in Ireland will give birth to a premature baby. More than 4,500 babies are delivered before 37 weeks in this country each year. Some babies are born 17 weeks before their due date. The impact of premature birth on parents and members of the extended family can be significantly challenging and sometimes daunting. Ireland is a small country. Everyone knows parents who have been affected by the worry, shock, terror and uncertainty of the premature delivery of a baby, followed by long hospital vigils hour after hour, day after day, week after week and, in some cases, month after month. In such circumstances, parents rapidly become acutely aware of the scale of the varied worries and challenges they must face. They learn about infections, diseases and many other health challenges which premature babies are at much greater risk of contracting than full-term babies. While new parenthood is always a challenge, the mother of a premature baby has to deal with many additional challenges, the first of which is the sudden and unexpected timing of the birth itself. Many mothers do not have time to pack a bag for their stay in hospital, let alone be afforded the time to inform their employers in advance about events. When their stay in hospital ends and they are formally discharged, it is only the end of the beginning. In many respects, they are not discharged at all. Their thoughts are 100% focused like tunnel vision on the ongoing care and well-being of their babies. Due to the extent of their committed caring time, which is purely spent in the hospital environs, other people in the hospital who are unconnected to their plight sometimes mistakenly take them for being permanent members of the hospital’s caring professions. In one sense, they are - sometimes, unfortunately, to such an extent that they can selflessly neglect their own wellness and well-being. What does this State do at present? It fails to treat them differently from the other mothers who are fortunate enough to give birth to full-term babies. Today, the Dáil has an opportunity to say that there should be no more of this, to give these mothers a voice and to hear that voice. In acknowledging that voice and recognising the current inequality, the Dáil can resolve to address this issue in a meaningful way. The mothers of Ireland are watching us attentively today. I do not doubt that some of them are filled with nerves. I ask the Members of this House, who often have differences and disagreements in this Chamber, to stand together not for themselves or their respective parties, or even for new politics, but for mothers who find themselves propelled into a frenetic world in which the immediate and most pervading concern that permeates every second of their day is the fear that their babies might not survive. This fear can become speechless and suffocating for parents as they zealously watch their tiny and fragile children fighting for their lives in hospital. We know that emotionally draining and physically exhausting days, weeks and months lie ahead for such parents. As legislators, we cannot remove fear and worry from the parents of premature babies, but by extending maternity leave and benefit we can remove some of the incredible stress and strain from their already troubled lives. We can offer and deliver real help and make real change. An opportunity like the one we have today should not pass without acknowledging and paying tribute to the hard-working women and men who work in hospitals and health care facilities across the country. They work tirelessly, often in incredibly pressured work environments, to ensure the best professional expert care is given any baby who is born pre-term. Like the mothers I have mentioned, courageous doctors and nurses are unheralded champions. Under the Maternity Protection Acts 1994 and 2004, mothers are entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave and benefit and 16 weeks of unpaid leave. This generally comes into action on the birth of the baby. Babies who survive from the earliest gestations, such as 23 weeks, can spend months in hospital neonatal units because, as a result of being born prematurely, their major organs have not had enough time to develop in utero. Premature babies are at more risk of disease and infection than full-term infants. Babies who are discharged from neonatal units with definite long-term diagnoses or on supportive medical equipment need full-time care in the home.  Under current legislation, a mother will use up the majority of her maternity leave and benefit before her baby comes home from hospital. While it is possible for a mother to defer her maternity leave while her baby is in hospital, it is out of the question for many parents to go back to work while their baby is encased in a glass box and hooked up to tubes, especially when there is a great deal of evidence that babies benefit greatly from the touch and closeness of a parent on a daily basis. All of my three children were born at full term. In recent years, I have watched and listened to the heart-wrenching stories of friends and colleagues at work who have had premature babies.I cannot begin to imagine and comprehend the worry, stress and upheaval that parents go through when their babies are born prematurely. The current length of maternity leave and benefit does not recognise the difficulties faced by the mothers of premature babies who are forced to commence their maternity leave long before their babies come home. Research has shown that mothers of premature babies record significantly higher rates of post traumatic stress disorder than mothers of full-term infants and that these traumatic reactions can remain active in the long term and require extensive follow-up. I am bringing the motion before the Dáil to shed light on how unfair and unacceptable the current legislative regime is for parents of premature babies and to seek change. Politics can help and has the potential to make a real difference today. The motion calls on the Government to extend the period of available maternity leave and benefit by a variable degree for all mothers of babies who are born prematurely, extending it from the day the baby is born to the day the baby would have been born if born at full-term. In cases where premature babies are kept in hospital past what would have been their full-term, the extended maternity leave and benefit would continue until the baby is discharged. It is essential that the entitlement is made available, in addition to all current maternity leave and benefit entitlements.  The net effect of this change would be that when a baby is born prematurely, his or her mother would not start her six-month entitlement to maternity leave and benefit until the equivalent full-term of the baby has been reached or the baby has been discharged from hospital. While her infant is in hospital, the mother need not worry about eating into her six months of maternity leave. Only once the baby is discharged and is safe and healthy at home should the current six-month period commence. The motion also calls on the Government to consider extending paternity leave under these circumstances, and to provide additional financial support where necessary for families of premature babies for travel and accommodation costs so the family can stay together. Parents should receive greater support from their employers and, therefore, I call on the Government to arrange that appropriate advice be published for all employers on how to do this and to require employers to have a policy in place for supporting the parents of premature babies. While most employers treat employees who find themselves in these unexpected circumstances with compassion, it is essential that they know how best to support them. New mothers need to feel confident of their rights in the workplace. These are all practical and reasonable steps, and will make a significant difference to parents of premature babies.  It is important to note that not all premature infants have health issues, and not all babies who are born at or past full-term are born healthy. There are many sick babies who are born at full-term whose parents still live in worry and fear for their babies' health, and today my heart goes out to them. I also aware of the fact that sometimes the parents of premature babies may bring home their baby within days of birth, healthy and into a new and happy household. However, for those who are born prematurely the challenges are unbelievably daunting. In advance of this debate, I received numerous communications and I would like to share one letter I received from a mother of a premature baby. I will read some excerpts to the House. She states:Dear Catherine,I am writing to you to share my experiences as a mother of an extremely premature baby who was born four months early in 2014 at the National Maternity Hospital, Holles Street. Patrick arrived unexpectedly at 23 weeks plus one day's gestation weighing approximately one pound four ounces. To get an idea of Patrick's actual size at birth, his body was the size of a mobile phone. His legs were the length of an adult's baby finger.During labour, I was informed by the consultant neonatologist that Patrick had less than a 10% chance of survival and that they would know within three minutes of his birth whether they would take him immediately to the neonatal intensive care unit (ICU) or hand him back to me to hold in his final minutes of life. I will remember that moment and those words for the rest of my life. There was no joyful cry at birth, only the sound of clinicians working frantically to save our baby boy who faced life's biggest nemesis - death.My maternity leave of 26 weeks commenced the day after Patrick was born. There were no congratulatory cards, no shiny balloons, no photos of my husband or I holding our little boy. Only silent tears, trying to hold it together for each other, living hour-to-hour, day-to-day for the first two months. Our little boy, the apple of our eyes, the beam of our smiles, and the love of our lives, spent the next 18 weeks in ICU. He was on life support for 70 days, had 11 transfusions, an open heart valve, biochemical difficulties, chronic lung disease, hernias, severe reflux and retinopathy... Our world came crashing down when at seven weeks post birth, Patrick had kidney failure and crashed requiring resuscitation. Though our hearts were utterly broken, Patrick never gave up - one of his many traits. We learned that day to never underestimate a premature baby or any child. They can surpass all that is expected of them and much more. They are stronger than any adult.  After 18 weeks and following Patrick's discharge as an inpatient in Holles Street, I had 8 weeks remaining of paid maternity leave.  Ten months post birth... I realised I was functioning on autopilot and during a visit to my GP was diagnosed with... post traumatic stress disorder. Discussing one's mental health is difficult and a mother to admit that she feels fearful, anxious, or down, well this is in contrast to what society expects of a new mother and especially of one whose baby has survived [against] the odds. But I don't mind sharing this experience with you and others because I was living every day with a heightened sense of fear that Patrick might die suddenly; that his survival was just too good to be true. However, with the support of my wonderful husband, our families, and a counsellor, I learned how to integrate this traumatic experience into my life in a positive way. I end this letter on a positive, Patrick recently celebrated his 3rd birthday and is a beautiful, healthy and independent little boy.Patrick’s mum, Tara, is here today. Her story is just one story, and there are many more similar stories from mothers, fathers and families throughout the length and breadth of this country. Where are the supports for Tara and the thousands of other mothers every year who face this exhausting challenge of a lifetime? Many people who have written to me are shocked that we as a country have chosen to ignore rather than support and that what I am proposing is not already in place.

Is nasc nádúrtha é sin atá riachtanach do fhorbairt an naín leochailigh úd a shaolaítear ró-luath roimh am breithe.  This House has an opportunity to begin to put things right today. Members of all political parties and none have an opportunity to unite behind these mothers, to protect families and children and give them the help that they need and deserve. I implore and urge Members of the House to support this motion, and in doing so to allow mothers to have time to recover from a traumatic few weeks or months, time at home with their baby, time to hold their baby, time to care for their baby and time to watch their baby progress at home. I ask Members to support this motion and give mothers and babies that precious time together.

I congratulate Deputies Catherine Martin and Eamon Ryan for bringing this important motion before the House. I have been a Member of the House for 20 years and I do not think that this matter has come up before in this format. Perhaps Deputy Penrose, who has been here for around the same time or longer, might agree with that. I also thank Deputy Catherine Martin for the research she has done on this issue and the way in which she has presented the motion to the House. She will be pleased to know that the Government is not opposing the motion. The motion proposes the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies, and suggests consequential provisions in relation to paternity leave and other related matters. I have a personal interest in this matter because I also was a premature baby and was not supposed to live.

In the late 1950s my parents went through a time wondering whether or not I would survive, so I can empathise with that. I heard the stories that were told and I know it affects many people on all sides. The Government is acutely aware of the different pressures that families with pre-term babies face and believes that the State can and should support families at a time when the pressures of nurturing a new life can be daunting and stressful. The Government also believes in investing in a child’s critical early years. We all know how important and life-defining these are, and this is why investment in early years is a recurring theme in the current A Programme for a Partnership Government. It is also a theme echoed by colleagues on all sides of the House. Studies have shown that the first years of life, particularly the first three years, are crucial to a child’s lifelong growth and development, and further research shows that children benefit most from parental care in the first year. We owe it to our children to give them the best start in life, and enabling them to be cherished and nurtured by their parents for as long as possible will provide a vital foundation for their future lives. It is for these compelling reasons that the Government expanded paid leave in the first year of a child’s life in 2016 through the introduction of two weeks of statutory paternity leave and benefit for new fathers. The Paternity Leave and Benefit Bill 2016, which the Tánaiste and I progressed and which these Houses collectively enacted in July brought the number of weeks of paid support to parents upon the birth of their child to 28. This comprises 26 weeks of maternity leave, two weeks of which must be taken before the birth, and two weeks of paternity leave. The Government is very much aware that even when things go according to plan with the arrival of a full-term and healthy baby, families need the 28 weeks of combined paid maternity and paternity leave that are currently available and would welcome an increase to cover the first year of the child’s life. We have a commitment in this regard in our programme for Government, to which I shall return. When babies are born prematurely however, bringing all of the attendant concerns that have been outlined by the proposing Deputies, there is a particularly strong case to be made for expanding maternity leave on public policy grounds. In replies to several recent parliamentary questions the Tánaiste has signalled that this is an issue she is very open to considering in the context of the family leave Bill that the Department of Justice and Equality is currently working on. A draft Bill has been produced, which needs to be updated to reflect the redress reforms made in the Workplace Relations Act 2015 and the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016.  The Tánaiste has also signalled that the family leave Bill will be the vehicle by which other necessary updates and amendments to existing family leave legislation will be made. In this regard, I would also mention that there are two other substantive issues on which work is nearing completion in the Department of Justice and Equality. The first issue is the provision for adoptive leave and benefit in the case of same-sex male couples. This is currently not provided for and the anomaly could not be addressed in the time available for the Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 due to the complexity of the interaction with the Adoptive Leave Acts. The Department of Justice and Equality has completed consultations with the Department of Social Protection and the Tánaiste intends to bring a separate memorandum to Government on this essentially technical issue shortly. The second issue is the provision for the programme for Government commitment to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child’s life. Discussions have recently taken place between the relevant officials in the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Social Protection. Further discussions with other relevant Departments will take place shortly. The Tánaiste intends to develop these policy proposals with Government colleagues in the coming weeks, including the technical details of how the male same-sex adoption issue can be addressed in the Family Leave Bill, and have it published later this year. Returning to the motion before the House, clearly the question of costs will be a key consideration in the context of any forthcoming legislative proposals. We will therefore have to plan and budget for this properly. As I have said, the Government is not opposing the motion before the House. We believe the State should support families at a time when the pressures of nurturing a new life can be daunting and stressful, as Deputy Catherine Martin outlined earlier. However, we need to examine closely the costs of any legislative proposals, as well as planning and budgeting for them properly, in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform. In relation to the substantive point - extra maternity leave for mothers of premature babies - the Department of Social Protection has provided some preliminary and tentative costings on what this might involve. Obviously, the weekly cost to provide for all premature babies at week 37 would be much more than the initial weekly cost for the smaller number of babies that are born very prematurely, at weeks 24, 25, 26 and so on. However, we have an obligation to conduct detailed costing work to establish what such reforms would cost for the Exchequer and employers. We also need to define in law precisely what is to be regarded as a premature birth and what extra provision is to be made. In so far as there is such a thing as a normal birth, it is generally taken to be 39 weeks, with a pre-term birth in the medical world being taken as any birth in week 37 or earlier. Births in week 37, however, are not so unusual as to be abnormal and most babies born at that time are healthy and without significant additional support needs. Clearly, births at week 24 are in a radically different category. One of the issues it would be important to tease out at a policy level is how one defines in law that category of births that are so early that significant additional support needs arise for the child and the parents. This was outlined so well by Deputy Catherine Martin earlier. There is more work to be done before the Government is in a position to suggest legislation on this point and my Department will consult closely with the Department of Health, the Department of Social Protection and other Departments in formulating precise proposals. I expect that colleagues on Oireachtas committees will also be involved in those discussions at a later date.  As I mentioned at the start, the Government is not opposing this motion. I thank both Deputies for bringing it forward. It is an important and interesting debate to have at this time. I recently received representations from some people on the issue, so it is obviously quite current and people are focused on it. While not opposing the motion, we would instead like to place on the record of the House our intention to address the substantive issue raised in the Family Leave Bill. That is the vehicle by which we can make this happen. I look forward to the support of the House when these proposals come to be debated. I will be interested to hear what other colleagues have to say on this motion. I do not expect that the House will divide on the matter. I expect that the detail will be teased out as the issues are debated. It is not beyond us to do that.

I start by saying, as one premature baby to another, that there are many of us around. When one thinks about how many premature babies are born every year, it should not be unusual that a number of current Deputies would have been born prematurely themselves. There is no doubt that the greatest miracle in life is a baby. A baby comes with lots of emotions and challenges. It is a daunting time both for mums and dads. The greatest heartbreak comes when a baby is sick and parents are at a complete loss as to how to help and support their small offspring. Some 4,500 babies are born prematurely every year.This equates to one in 16 Irish women delivering a preterm baby. This is 4,500 Patricks and 4,500 Taras. Deputy Catherine Martin eloquently put the story of Tara and Patrick, and it is something that resonates throughout the country in every constituency. When we look at the situation globally, the latest World Health Organization report, Born Too Soon: The Global Action Report on Preterm Birth, gives a very good indication of where we stand in the world. A total of 15 million babies are born prematurely every year. This report was the first ever national, regional and global evaluation of preterm birth. It highlighted how preterm birth rates are increasing in many countries, and preterm birth is now the second leading cause of death worldwide for children under the age of five. This is very scary. World health leaders report that preterm birth has been an overlooked and neglected problem worldwide. As the UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon said, all newborns are vulnerable but preterm babies are acutely so. As we know, premature babies have a higher risk of respiratory problems, neonatal infections and heart problems. For example, babies born at 23 weeks can spend months in special care units in hospitals, and often babies who are discharged from a unit with a long-term diagnosis are on supportive medical equipment and still need full-time care in the home. Under current legislation a mother will have used up the majority of her maternity leave before her baby even makes the journey home. At present, in Ireland maternity leave comes into effect on the date of the birth of the child, but babies surviving from the earliest gestation, such as 23 weeks as I have outlined, can spend months in a neonatal unit in hospital. When they come home, apart from the extra care they require, they will need to attend regular clinics and therapy appointments. The situation we have at present with legislation and policy does not take into account the huge unforeseen pressure and turmoil families face when caring for a premature baby. I commend Deputy Martin for her motion, which calls on the Government to recognise the hardship faced by these parents and increase maternity leave and benefits by the number of weeks a child is born prematurely. I acknowledge the Minister of State has said the Government will not oppose the motion, and I support and welcome this statement. We must acknowledge that the system as it is puts enormous pressure on families of premature babies. When we look at the financial hardship faced by parents of premature babies, the expenses include the daily commute to hospital, parking costs, child care costs for other children at home and accommodation costs. Post-discharge costs include loss of wages, medical costs, GP costs and private assessments and therapies, and this does not even touch on the emotional trauma for a family. I certainly support the Bill and all of the addendums the Deputy has made. Extending paid maternity leave will promote and extend parental care in the first year of a child's life, which is absolutely crucial for the child's development. The journey for parents of a premature baby is often a very difficult one. Supports on an emotional level in terms of giving extra time, and easing the financial burden by extending maternity leave and benefit to reflect this, could make the journey slightly less arduous. It is incumbent upon us in the House to do exactly this.

I am delighted to be an elected representative when we do not have a divided House and we are all working together for one common goal. We are discussing the 4,500 premature babies born each year. Last Christmas, I was honoured to be invited by members of the Irish Premature Babies group to Lusk, where they launched their calendar. The reason they launched the calendar was to fundraise for breast pumps for premature babies because they do not have enough money. This is a conversation we could have with the Minister for Social Protection because with 4,500 premature babies born on an annual basis there is a shortage of approximately 100 breast pumps, which works out at approximately €25,000. Aside from all of this, my connection with the subject is through my sister, who is a neonatal nurse. She trained to be specially involved in it and she speaks about babies who are born with half a heart and preterm babies, and the role and responsibilities of the medical profession. She speaks about the anguish, upset and devastation in parents' eyes because they are so helpless. The last thing they think of at that moment is the financial implication. The baby has been born and they are just delighted to have their little one, whom they are willing on. When we get down to what it is about, it is maternity leave. In some cases if a child is born at 27 weeks, by the time he or she goes home there might be only three weeks of leave left before going into unpaid leave. This is what the conversation is about and Fianna Fáil is delighted to support the motion before the House. We strongly believe in this and it is a conversation we need to have. More facts and figures need to be found out. We all agree that babies born at 37 weeks have proper lung function and are in a good position, as opposed to babies born at 23 weeks or 24 weeks. This is what the conversation needs to be about and we have to get behind these parents. The real issue is with regard to the time after the baby is discharged. The presentation earlier in the Audio Visual room was very powerful. The consultant from Holles Street said a baby born four weeks early spends an extra four weeks in neonatal care and a baby born eight weeks early spends and extra eight weeks there. This is apart from any complications with regard to sight or hearing, and then we are into physiotherapy and continuous appointments. This is what feeds into a parent's time. Parents do not want to return to work without having done all of this caring themselves. There is not a mother in the country who will hand over the job with two weeks left on maternity leave. This does not happen. They will give up their jobs and walk away regardless, because their first and foremost call is to their child. We as legislators need to acknowledge the role of parents with regard to preterm babies. The challenges facing them are unbelievable. As Deputy O'Loughlin stated, there are financial implications, but there is also the emotional drain on the family, such as the coping mechanisms of siblings. Some neonatal babies from Galway have to be brought to Holles Street to be looked after and families relocate. Mothers relocate and the fathers are left at home looking after the other members of the family. People do not disagree or argue with this, they are just happy their wee one is alive, but it is strain. There is an emotional strain and a financial strain. If we could remove one of these strains through maternity benefit it would be a huge step in the right direction.

I am delighted to support the motion, which is to extend maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of babies born prematurely. We were informed this morning in a wonderful presentation by Dr. Claudine Vavasseur, and the parents of premature babies who spoke about their experience, that these children can have significant health challenges. Existing leave entitlements make no allowance for the additional time that is needed for parents when a pregnancy does not go to full term. Every year in Ireland approximately 4,500 babies are born prematurely, which means one in 16 women delivers a preterm baby. At the time of the baby's arrival, the parents' concerns, worries and anxieties are quite naturally focused on the baby’s safety, well-being and progress. Maternity leave comes into effect on the date the baby is born, but babies surviving from the earliest gestations, such as 23 weeks, can spend months in a neonatal unit in hospital, including in intensive care units, and most babies who are discharged from a unit on supportive medical equipment require full-time care in the home and will need to attend regular clinics, as my colleagues have pointed out.Premature babies are more at risk of disease and infection than full-term babies and current legislation and policy does not take into account the huge unforeseen pressures and turmoil families face when caring for a premature baby. Allowances are available in legislation for a mother to defer her maternity leave while a baby is hospitalised. However, these allowances do not adequately provide for the needs of premature babies. This inadequacy is particularly apparent in incidents where mothers are ill, or have undergone a caesarean section. Fianna Fáil proposed the extension of paid parental leave from 26 to 30 weeks, so that parents, if they choose, can spend longer with their newborn without worrying about its effect on their career prospects or their ability to earn a living. There is a significant gap between the termination of paid maternity leave and the commencement of free pre-school when a child is, at the earliest, three years and two months old. The progression of this policy would have a complementary effect on areas such as parental choice, work-life balance and child well-being. The extension of maternity leave would minimise the need and cost of child care in the child’s first year and allow young children to spend the crucial first year benefiting from parental leave. I thank Deputy Catherine Martin and the parents who spoke this morning. It was very informative and moving.

A premature child is more likely to have complications after coming home and the family will be going back and forwards for appointments. That, with the time, resources and difficulty involved, would be when they are on reduced leave. It makes real sense to extend the maternity leave and give the same opportunity to both full-term and premature babies and their parents. The Minister of State outlined how he intended to use the family leave Bill as the vehicle to bring this into effect and that he had a number of other issues that he wanted to bring on board. I also bring to the Minister of State's attention the situation with maternity leave for carers, who may have kept a foot in with employment, income and careers. Their carer's allowance is halved when they go on maternity leave. It is a very difficult time for carers, especially if they are continuing in their carer role while on maternity leave. It is another aspect that I recommend the Minister of State takes on board, although the focus today is on the premature baby and extending leave. Molaim an rún.

I thank Deputy Catherine Martin and the Green Party for bringing forward this motion, as well as the families who are here today. Sometimes a matter comes before the House that is so obvious and so simple that one has to ask why it was not done before. Premature births are the biggest killer of babies in Ireland. Many who survive suffer serious illness. Parents should not have to worry about financial considerations at this time. My sister was born prematurely. Thankfully, Judy survived, but with spina bifida and hydrocephalus. I remember the stresses and strains on my parents at that time, having to travel up and down to Crumlin hospital and seeing their child in an incubator for such a long time. As a mental health spokesperson, I am acutely aware of mental health risks to parents during such times of stress, and the increased risk of mental illness to premature babies as well. Along with my party colleagues, I am glad to support this compassionate and practical motion to extend the maternity leave and benefit of mothers whose babies are born prematurely. Currently, under the Maternity Protection Act 1994 and Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, a mother is entitled to 26 weeks of maternity leave and 16 weeks of unpaid leave. I acknowledge that Fianna Fáil previously proposed the extension of paid parental leave from 26 to 30 weeks, with the best interests of both parents and babies in mind. Aside from the obvious nurturing benefits this change would have, there are also the practical benefits of minimising the need and cost for child care for parents at this stressful time. This motion recommends that maternity leave and benefit is extended by the length of time between the delivery date of the baby and either the date the baby would have been delivered full-term, or the date of the baby leaving hospital, whichever is later. Depending on complications, some preterm babies need to stay in neonatal units for weeks or even months. This inevitably means that when a preterm baby is discharged from a neonatal unit, the mother may have very little, if any, maternity leave left to spend with her baby at home. This, coupled with the fact that premature babies are at increased risk of infection and other illnesses compared to full-term babies, makes for an excruciatingly worrying time for parents. This motion is entirely supported by the Irish Premature Babies association, which is asking us to be the voice of the tiniest babies in Ireland by supporting this motion. We are doing just that. I hope the support and goodwill of this House for this motion will be reflected in the Government legislation to bring about the necessary changes to implement the sentiment of this motion, address the unfairness of the current arrangement and end the arbitrary nature by which maternity leave is given.
#FrankORourke	unknown-#FrankORourke-party	unknown-#FrankORourke-dob	unknown-#FrankORourke-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	342	I thank my colleague, Deputy Anne Rabbitte, for sharing her time with me this evening. I thank Deputy Catherine Martin for bringing forward this motion. It is a well-timed and very important motion for many families. I compliment the Deputy and her party on bringing it forward. I acknowledge all the families and people who spoke today in AV room. They gave very powerful speeches and presentations, all of which I can relate to very closely. It is important to acknowledge, in this whole conversation and debate, the support given by consultants, doctors, general practitioners and the aftercare and nursing staff. Without their input and help, all the premature babies that we speak about may not and would not survive. I am the father of a premature baby. She was born ten weeks early, 19 years ago. I spent much quality time in Holles Street and Temple Street hospitals. The story was not so good for some parents who came through the hospital during our time. We had a good story and our daughter is now 19. She has done her leaving certificate, is in college, and is leading a full life. That comes at a time when, before she left hospital, all of my wife's maternity leave was gone. That is something which we cannot be distracted from focusing on. We must allow that additional time for them. A good day in Holles Street hospital was when one went in to the neonatal unit and found no doctor or nursing staff around one's child's incubator. That was when one breathed a sigh of relief and celebrated because of knowing that the child was not in the danger zone at that time. It is hugely emotional for parents, and cannot be distracted from by what is going on outside. When a child comes home from hospital, three very important things must happen. The child is premature and needs stimulation to survive and develop. He or she must get the human touch and interaction that has not been received and he or she suffers for being premature. The child must also get the aftercare that is needed. Children can have complications that need physiotherapy, occupational therapy or speech therapy, which are not afforded through the public health service. This is why it is so important that parental leave is extended. I hope this continues and is enacted and brought into law.
#KathleenFunchion	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-party	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-dob	unknown-#KathleenFunchion-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	343	I am sharing time with colleagues. I welcome the opportunity to speak on this very important motion, which proposes the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers and babies who are born prematurely. I would like to acknowledge Deputy Catherine Martin for bringing it forward and for the presentation in the AV room today. I also acknowledge the Minister of State for saying that he will not oppose the motion. Currently, not only do mothers of premature babies have to battle with the emotional trauma of living through the precarious situation of their newborn child, but also face the financial stress of having to take extra unpaid leave in order to spend the appropriate time with their baby. This may not always be possible in certain employments. We also know the parents of premature children often have huge difficulty in finding ways and means to stay with their babies in hospital after a birth due to a shortage of space or the high costs of accommodation required in order to remain near to them. That is very much the case in rural situations where people are primarily transferred to Dublin. We in Sinn Féin fully support the calls for an extension of maternity leave for the time a premature baby has had to spend in a neonatal unit receiving intensive medical attention. The time available for mother and child to spend at home afterwards is obviously shortened as a result. It goes without saying that the trauma and pain that parents go through watching their newborn fight for survival is enormous. It is an incredibly difficult process, monitoring hour-by-hour if ones baby is going to pull through, and we cannot overstate the emotional impact of that on parents and other family members. In that context it would be wrong not to point out the other factors that play a huge part in compounding this stress. As mentioned, many parents must cover the costs of accommodation in order to remain near their baby while in treatment, with the addition of parking costs and expenses associated with that. Accommodation should be provided so that parents can stay with their baby while they are in hospital supporting their well-being. A very premature baby can spend weeks or months in intensive care before they are able to go home or be transferred back to their local hospital. Parents face the problem of no accommodation, and fathers are often separated at this critical point when their baby really needs the presence, touch and nourishment of their mother and father. Last November the Minister for Health, along with the Irish neonatal health alliance, launched an online guide which outlines ten family centred care-giving activities that families can participate in when they have an infant in a neonatal intensive care unit, such as comfort holding, assisting with tube feeding and expressing breast milk in order to feed the baby. While that piece of work is welcome, what parents really need is practical and financial assistance. Currently, there are absolutely no allowances for parents of premature babies at State level. Organisations, such as Irish Premature Babies, do outstanding work on a voluntary basis for parents, fund-raising to assist with the costs that parents often have to incur. However, voluntary organisations cannot be expected to be the only support. Many people here are aware of the work of Irish Premature Babies. It has seen an increase in demand of 300% for its services last year, which is completely unsustainable. We know from the most recent statistics from the CSO that there are over 4,500 babies born prematurely ever year. That is one in every 14 births. I fully support this motion. We are delighted to support it. I would like to remember my own baby nieces, Alana and Lynn, who unfortunately passed away at 23 weeks as a result of being premature. We really need to provide support and assistance to parents. We cannot overstate how difficult it is for people on an emotional level. We may be able to help out on a financial level and provide some assistance for them.
#JohnBrady	unknown-#JohnBrady-party	unknown-#JohnBrady-dob	unknown-#JohnBrady-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	344	I welcome the motion and I commend the Green Party and the Social Democrats for bringing it forward, particularly Deputy Catherine Martin, who spoke very passionately and emotionally when speaking on the motion this evening. Since the motion was first published I, like many Deputies in the Chamber, received many e-mails from right across the State from parents who have faced the potential devastation of losing a loved one. One e-mail described a situation where a mother had to spend her entire maternity leave in hospital with her premature baby and is then forced to take unpaid leave or leave her job due to work places refusing additional leave. Financial burdens should never be placed on mothers or fathers, especially in cases where a baby is born prematurely. When it comes to the level of pay mandated by law, Ireland ranks at the very bottom of the European league, along with Slovakia. The amount paid to mothers over a relatively long period of leave falls well below 66% of normal earnings. Year on year, in our alternative budget, we include provision for an increase in maternity benefit and an extension of maternity leave. In our alternative budget for 2017, we provided for an increase of €40 in maternity benefit and an extension of two weeks to maternity leave. This should be looked at in every Government budget. This motion provides the Government with an opportunity to take a positive step and a much more compassionate approach to improve maternity practices in Ireland. I welcome the fact the Government is not going to oppose this motion. Hopefully, it can be moved forward to the next step.
#DeniseMitchell	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-party	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-dob	unknown-#DeniseMitchell-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	345	I welcome the opportunity to speak on this motion this evening on the very positive action to help parents at their most vulnerable. As other speakers have mentioned, 4,500 babies are born prematurely each year, and this affects thousands of parents and family members. It can happen to any family. This motion is simply recognising the reality of childbirth and maternity leave. There are complex health issues when a child is born prematurely. There is emotional pressure, and there is often a financial burden on parents. With all these issues, parents often find out that their maternity leave is up and that they have to return to work. The rigid, inflexible current welfare system does not identify this reality that many parents face. It does not recognise parents at one of the most difficult times. Greater flexibility is required in this area of welfare to help these parents. It is in the Minister's power to ensure we change this legislation and ensure parents are given the time they need so that the thousands of parents affected every year can be helped through a very emotional and difficult time. This motion will allow us to lead and set an example. Considering what all parents go through with premature babies, I plead that we act now.

I commend the Green Party and the Social Democrats for bringing forward this important and timely motion. There is an urgent need to extend the maternity benefit and maternity leave for mothers of premature babies in Ireland. As we know, 4,500 babies are born before 37 weeks across this State every year. This is a large group of parents who have a right to fairness when considering their rights to maternity benefit and leave. We believe that maternity leave and benefit should be extended, recognising that these mothers will need extra time to spend with their children at home to care for and bond with them. The needs of mothers and their premature babies must be the primary consideration in tonight's debate, and Sinn Féin is happy to support this motion. We also believe there needs to be investment in maternity services across this State, as it is estimated that we need 600 midwives to achieve basic safety levels. We also have the lowest level of obstetricians per 100,000 across all OECD countries. While this is not part of the debate this evening, nevertheless it is an important connected matter and I urge the Government to take action on those particular issues.

We congratulate it on bringing this forward and Deputy Catherine Martin on a compelling contribution. I am glad that the Government will embrace the objective and thrust of this motion and ensure that it is enacted into law as quickly as possible. I also join in the welcome extended to the people in the Gallery, who are here to ensure we get the message. There is no doubt mothers across Ireland are watching us carefully to ensure that we reflect their views. I welcome this motion because it matches many of the commitments of the Labour Party to improve maternal care in Ireland. A mark of a country is how it treats pregnant women and cares for families at times when pressures can be extremely stressful and daunting for all concerned.In the wake of a number of terrible preventable tragedies, Ireland has made some progress in advancing the rights and protections for pregnant women with the enactment of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Act 2013. Much work remains to be done and we need to implement the recommendations of the national maternity strategy. My colleague, Deputy Sean Sherlock, raised in the House two weeks ago the fact that many mothers in our country still cannot get access to 20 week foetal scans. Deputy Sherlock's amendment to the Health (Amendment) Bill 2017 would have seen every pregnant woman in the State guaranteed foetal anomaly scans regardless of their geography. Currently only a third of women in Ireland are getting access to these critically important scans. We also need to ensure higher compliance with internationally recognised ratios of staff to patients and that means hiring more obstetricians, gynaecologists and midwives. We have to build new maternity hospitals, replacing Limerick, Holles St., the Rotunda and the Coombe, and we need massive capital expenditure in those areas. We need to introduce a new health and well-being approach to prenatal and post-natal care with the establishment of specific mother and baby clinics within primary care centres. In government we provided for two weeks of paid paternity leave and it is time to consider extending this to incorporate the circumstances of premature babies. The next policy change we want to see is the provision of three months' paid parental leave on top of existing entitlements. These months could be shared between both parents to ensure that every child can be properly cared for in the family home over the first nine months of life. The Minister provided an extra €5 weekly increase in the budget, which was welcome. We also believe it is time to commission a review of the level of payment given for maternity, paternity and parental leave to ensure they remain sufficient for the needs of modern families. The Minister might consider that proposal, alongside this motion. Many of us have received letters and e-mails over the past week from mothers and fathers who are parents of pre-term babies. I thank everyone who communicated with us on this important issue, which reflects the benefits that this significant change will have when enacted. These people are simply asking for help during what is a difficult time and want to ensure they get to spend the maximum time possible with their babies. I also congratulate the charity, Irish Premature Babies, for their advocacy work on this. They have a very simple goal, to support families when they are going through one of the most difficult journeys in their life, with their tiny baby in a neonatal intensive care unit. They are asking to extend the period of statutory maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies by the length of time between the delivery date of the baby and either the date the baby would have been delivered, if full term, or the date of the baby leaving hospital, whichever is the later. It also calls for this extension to be in addition to the current entitlement to 26 weeks' maternity leave and maternity benefit and the additional 16 weeks' unpaid maternity leave under the Maternity Acts 1994 and 2004. We are talking about extending maternity benefit and leave by the number of weeks by which a baby is born early so that the mother gets to spend that time, when often a baby is at its most vulnerable, with her baby. Every year nearly 4,500 babies are born prematurely, that is before 37 weeks' gestation. It is important to say that in the context of nearly 70,000 births per year we are talking about just 6% of births in Ireland. In total it is not a lot of people but for those parents it is the beginning of what can be a difficult, demanding and worrying, long journey. It is tough enough being a new parent without the worry, stress, fears and concerns that come with a premature baby, and the stress that puts on a family. Significant costs are also incurred, including for accommodation. As the Minister will know, maternity benefit begins immediately when a baby is born prematurely. Very often, expecting mothers go on leave two weeks before their due date but the mother of a premature baby does not have that time. The law currently gives 26 weeks' paid leave and a further 16 weeks' unpaid leave but the law does nothing to take into account babies who are born early. Some premature babies can spend months in hospital, leaving a very short time for a mother and her new baby to bond when they get home. It is not unusual to spend up to four months in hospital, leaving just two months at home for the mother and baby, due to the rigidity and inflexibility of our legislative framework. There is a provision in law already, namely section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004, that allows the postponement of maternity leave in strict circumstances, that is, if a baby is hospitalised. As has been pointed out, however, there are difficulties with this for various reasons. An employer has the right to refuse a postponement. In addition, the postponement does not take into account a mother's health status, and the possibility that she may be unable to return to work after surgery or illness. Moreover, many pre-term babies are transferred from their local unit to one of the four tertiary neonatal units with specialised neonatal care for the tiniest and sickest pre-term babies and most parents will leave their home in these cases and follow their baby to the transferred neonatal unit. It is not plausible for a mother to return to work if she is miles away from her home. The case is clear for changing the law. There is much more I can say but the Green Party, in particular Deputy Catherine Martin, has outlined the relevant points of the motion. The Minister for Social Protection is due to bring a social welfare and pensions Bill to the house soon and I encourage him to consider bringing in this important change at that stage. This change will be administered by the Department of Social Protection so there is no need to put it on the long finger. We are not talking about a lot of money here as the full-year cost would be approximately €5.4 million. The Social Insurance Fund is on target and unemployment is falling rapidly, with Department of Social Protection spending for the first three months of the year €26 million below target. A simple amendment to the PRSI benefit scheme would accommodate this very important and desirable change. I am sure the Minister could find a few bob down the back of a sofa in Áras Mhic Dhiarmada to fund this without any undue difficulty. This is a measure that would be of immense help to mothers across Ireland and would be widely welcomed. If he is not prepared to do it now, I urge the Minister at the very least to ensure this is included in next year’s budget this autumn.

The position of women who give birth to premature babies is not satisfactory and it highlights the lack of provision in general for pregnant women in this country. As the motion points out, a woman can defer her maternity leave but that is completely impractical given the fact that premature babies will often be in neonatal units and are more likely to have health complications. The women themselves are also more likely to require medical attention. There is also a strong class and poverty dimension to premature births and the Institute of Public Health has stated that socioeconomic deprivation is independently associated with both premature delivery and babies being born underdeveloped. Children born to mothers in the lowest income group are 42% more likely to be born light than those in the highest income group so the need for a provision for such mothers is clear. In Britain the Trades Union Congress, TUC, carried out a survey of maternity leave in EU member states. It defined decently paid maternity as two thirds of income, or €1,000 per month. Ireland is one of only three member states which does not have decently paid maternity leave. The rate of maternity benefit is just €235 per week for six months and there are 16 weeks unpaid leave. While the Labour Party is supporting this, when Deputy Joan Burton was Minister for Social Protection in 2014 she cut maternity benefit. We are calling for a number of measures that would immediately improve the position of mothers and fathers. The emphasis on unpaid leave is extremely unhelpful and puts low-paid working women at a distinct disadvantage. It also puts single women at a distinct disadvantage, which is why Solidarity is critical of the newly announced policy of the Social Democrats with its emphasis on unpaid leave for six months. We believe maternity leave has to be paid leave. Maternity benefit is also far too low and Ireland does not link maternity benefit to a person's income. The payment should be raised to at least €300 immediately. While researching for this debate I was informed by one woman that she had to fight hard to get her employer to pay her a top-up which she was owed. She was initially refused and the employer told her it would lead to a rash of pregnancies in the company. It should be mandatory for employers to top up maternity leave but currently only 38% of bosses do so. These are generally larger workplaces where there is a union whereas low pay, precarious, non-unionised workplaces are less likely to have these arrangements. We also call for more leave for fathers because currently paternity leave is just two weeks. That is not adequate and the practice in other countries includes shared leave.However, shared leave should not be done in a way that takes away from a woman's leave which must be a guaranteed amount. There is a major gender inequality in sick leave and pregnancy rules. Workers who have to take leave due to pregnancy - no woman who has been pregnant has not had some complication - must take their sick leave from their general sick leave entitlement. Unfortunately, the EU despite what we hear backed up a case taken by a woman a couple of years ago. There is clear discrimination against women and it puts them at a distinct advantage to men. There should be a separate sick leave allowance for pregnancy-related illness. In Ireland a woman is also entitled to maternity leave if she has had a miscarriage after 24 weeks' gestation but nothing if it is before this time. Those are some of the issues.
#BridSmith	unknown-#BridSmith-party	unknown-#BridSmith-dob	unknown-#BridSmith-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	350	I welcome the motion and congratulate Deputy Catherine Martin on tabling it. I attended today's briefing and some very moving and emotive circumstances apply to these people, some of whom have come into the Gallery. Obviously, we support the motion and regard such extension of maternity leave as a very practical aid for families and particularly mothers dealing with a traumatic time in their lives. I echo everything that was said; of course we should extend the period of statutory maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies, by the length of time between the delivery date of the baby and the date the baby would have been delivered if full term was achieved. I reiterate the point made by others that in general we should do more for mothers and families. It has always been a deep irony that many in this Government and previous Governments who profess to be pro-family and pro-life often fall short of seeing a regime that actually does its best to support mothers and families. Deputy Burton cutting maternity benefit in the previous Government is one of the worst recent examples of that. We come in at second from bottom of all European countries in the number of weeks of maternity leave and the amount of maternity benefit we grant. A British academic study found that an employee generally receives about 66% of her normal earnings or more but that is not what happens here and certainly not in the private sector. Private sector employers have no obligation to pay women any top-up while on maternity leave. That also must change. Instead of making employers do as they do in other European countries the State steps in to pay €235 a week in maternity benefit for 26 weeks. While, of course, this is correct, pressure should be applied to private enterprise to pay up for maternity leave. In fact, sometimes it is the opposite. I know many women whose contracts were not renewed because they fell pregnant. It is very difficult to prove, but it often happens to women in this country in this day and age. We do not really legally enforce maternity pay. I believe private capitalists are being let off the hook and they should be made to pay their share. We support a woman's right to choose and that is on the record of this House. That means the choice to have a child or to terminate a pregnancy. Making the choice to have a child means society has to put proper economic, social and health care provision in place for the mother, the child and the family in general. Unfortunately, based on the country's record of homelessness and the number of families in hotels every night, this is not the case. That is the sort of thing we need to aspire to. Deputy Catherine Martin's motion plays some role in moving towards that. I am not surprised that this is coming from someone on the pro-choice side. I congratulate Deputy Catherine Martin on tabling the motion.

#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	352	I thank Deputy Catherine Martin for tabling this very important motion. It is a very important aspect of child rearing from the point of view of women, their families and their extended families in dealing with premature births. The motion proposes the a change in the current status of maternity leave for mothers of premature babies; maternity leave will begin when the baby is delivered, but an extension of maternity leave will be added for the time spent in the neonatal unit. That is a very important point of the motion. It calls on Government to extend the period of statutory maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies, by the length of time between the delivery date of the baby and either the date the baby would have been delivered if full-term or the date of the baby leaving hospital, whichever is later, and that this extension be in addition to the current entitlement to 26 weeks maternity leave and maternity benefit and the additional 16 weeks unpaid maternity leave under the Maternity Acts 1994 and 2004. It also calls for an extension to the paternity leave in those circumstances. Depending on the complications, some pre-term babies need to stay in the neonatal unit for weeks or months. This inevitably means that when a pre-term baby is discharged from the neonatal unit, the mother may have very little maternity leave left to spend with her baby at home. If a baby is born at 23 weeks, 12 to 14 weeks of the mother's maternity leave will be taken up, which would only leave ten to 12 weeks of her official maternity leave. Mothers of pre-term babies do not get to spend their full maternity leave at home with a premature baby. The figure is approximately 4,500 per year which is a very small number. This is a long-standing problem that needs to be rectified for families affected by pre-term birth. Extensive global research has shown that maternity leave has a significant positive effect on the health and mental well-being of mothers, babies, fathers, partners, families and communities. These benefits are physical, psychological, social and economic. Section 7 of the Maternity Protection (Amendment) Act 2004 provides for the postponement of maternity leave in strict circumstances - if the baby is hospitalised. However, there are difficulties associated with a postponement. An employer has the right to refuse a postponement. This postponement does not take into account the mother's health status. She may not be able to return to work after surgery or illness. Mothers are actively encouraged to express breast milk for the pre-term babies and this needs to be done every two to three hours. Those circumstances must be taken into account and given specific status regarding pre-term babies. Many pre-term babies are transferred from their local unit to one of the four tertiary neonatal units with specialised neonatal care for the tiniest and sickest pre-term babies. Most parents will leave their home following the transfer to a neonatal unit. In this situation, it is not plausible for a mother to return to work if she is miles away from her home. The last four points of the motion are particularly important. They call on the Government to provide additional financial support, where necessary, for the families of premature babies, in relation to travel and accommodation costs, so the family unit can stay together; ensure that forms and information on maternity leave and related benefits are available in all neonatal units; publish advice for all employers about how to best support parents of premature babies; and require employers to have a policy in place for supporting parents of premature babies. It is good that the Government is accepting the motion, but the devil is in the detail. We are not talking about a hell of a lot of money in this. I hate to see the word "cost" being put in there; it is not really necessary.

Déanaim comhghairdeas leis an gComhaontas Glas. I have no hesitation in supporting the motion. I congratulate the Green Party and the Social Democrats on tabling this very comprehensive motion. While I hope it will not become a pattern, for the second time in a number of weeks, I find myself praising the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, who unfortunately is not in the Chamber. It is my second time praising him for accepting a concept that he is going to work on. However, I am somewhat concerned at the warning about costs. Perhaps the Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, who is in the House, might come back to that. We are talking about a very finite number of people - 4,500 premature babies, which is one in 16 births. It is a very small number and a very small cost. As I said previously, in this new politics we need to ask what the cost of not doing it would be.I have said it about mental health and domestic violence. The actual cost of not doing something is worth billions of euro to the economy. With premature babies the actual cost includes that of the stress involved. I accept that every family is affected differently and every child born prematurely could have between no problems and a whole range of problems. Dr. John Murphy, Clinical Lead for Neonatology at the National Maternity Hospital, captured it when he stated:Family centred and developmentally supportive care is becoming more recognised as an essential attribute of high-quality neonatal and family care. Infants and families who must traverse the [NICU] deserve the quality of care that this care giving philosophy demands by providing an environment for the family that is comfortable, safe and supportive of their individual needs.Perhaps the Minister of State will keep that in mind when looking at costs from a tunnel vision point of view rather than what would be saved were legislation to be introduced following this motion. I would say that Dr. Murphy's words have a broader application but tonight's debate relates to premature babies alone. There would be a huge cost saving if we broadened out the concept of cost rather than having a tunnel vision approach.

The Rural Independent Group is also fully in favour of the motion. I thank Deputy Catherine Martin for tabling it. Care of family and children is enshrined in our Constitution and the birth of a baby is the most significant event in a family's life journey. The proper care and nurturing of a baby by bonding between mother and baby is critical to the development of the emotional and caring relationship between them for life. Premature babies may have physical life-threatening problems, as outlined in the motion, which require intensive care both in hospital and at home. It is important that mothers are as closely involved as possible in the care of their children and are given the time to do so. As part of our society's values, which include compassion and understanding, we must create the time and space for mothers of premature babies to recover physically and emotionally while being given the time to care for their babies or baby. I wish to make a point on substantial prematurity. Some babies are now surviving although they were born as early as at 23 weeks gestation. At the moment, babies who are in utero at 23 weeks have protection under the Constitution but they may lose that protection should the eighth amendment be repealed. In England, a 23 week old foetus has no rights as a person. It acquires full legal status and protection only if born alive. The motion concerns all the supports that the State can provide to look after a baby born at 23 weeks. Should the 23 week old unborn foetus not have the same human rights and be protected from termination of pregnancy when that baby has the potential for a full and healthy life? Should we not pull out all the stops to protect a 23 week old unborn foetus just as we now propose to do to protect the life of a baby born at 23 weeks? We have to protect our babies, whether they are born or unborn, at 23 weeks. We must also protect their mothers and give them time to look after them when they are born.

She has put a lot of work into it. It is a great evening to be an elected Member of this Dáil given the unanimity on the motion. The birth of a baby, whether born prematurely or at the correct time, is a joy and a wonder. It is a treasure for the parents to see a young baby come into the world. Today is a positive day given that we are speaking about protecting and saving a 23 week old baby rather than having motions and attempts to provide for abortion and getting rid of a little baby at that very same age. Parents who have a premature baby experience an emotional pressure as they hope and pray for the baby to live. There is also a financial pressure. We must look at the law as it is and ensure that parents are supported and mothers are given the time to recover at home and bond with their baby, which is very important. It was very moving to see the slide in the AV room today of Baby Patrick who was born perhaps only 1 lb in weight. That baby lived and is now three years old. I fully support the motion and again thank Deputy Catherine Martin for tabling it.

I compliment Deputy Catherine Martin and the Green Party for introducing the motion. Tá fíor-fháilte roimh na daoine sa Gallery - daoine óga agus na parents. I am delighted to welcome them. I met them earlier in the AV room and elsewhere. It is wonderful to see little babies and to hear the sounds of the little babies. There is wondrous sound here this evening from the Gallery. I have raised this issue a number of times over the past few years since I first became aware of the full reality of premature birth when my first granddaughter was born in 2014. My granddaughter, Amy, was born 10 weeks prematurely and spent three months in hospital, two months of which were spent in a neonatal intensive care unit in a hospital that was more than one hour from her home. During this time my daughter and son-in-law had to live in a home away from home in Cork. They were accommodated in the wonderful facility that is Brú Columbanus which allowed them to be near their daughter in hospital. In this regard, their life was to a certain extent put on hold. Had they not had access to Brú Columbanus, which many families in other cities do not have, they would have had hefty accommodation or travel bills to comprehend, adding additional stress to an already stressful situation. When Amy was finally discharged after three months in hospital, she was just two weeks corrected but she continued to have a number of extra care needs to those of a newborn baby as she was tube fed and still on a lot of medication. At this stage, my daughter had just three months left on maternity leave, much of which was spent attending hospital and doctors’ appointments. On discharge, they were advised not to put Amy into child care until she was at least three years old due to her compromised health, yet my daughter was expected to return to work in just three short months or take unpaid leave to care for her daughter. Not alone does this highlight the need to extend maternity leave for parents of premature babies, it also highlights a wider societal issue where there is little or no supports for families that care for their children in their home. Many parents of premature or sick children do not have an option but to care for their children at home. The only child care supports available to them are to put their children into child care but this simply is not an option. While I am fully supportive of this motion, my only concern is that it does not go far enough and focuses solely on premature babies by extending maternity leave for the length of time that the child spends in the neonatal unit. Many full-term babies can spend weeks and months in a neonatal unit or children’s hospital if they are born with heart disease or other complications. These parents are no different to parents of premature babies as they have to endure the same hardships and the same stresses associated with having a sick baby. I believe that the payment should be extended by the length of time that any child spends in a neonatal unit regardless of whether they were born prematurely. It would be remiss of me not to mention the fact that this once again brings us back to the failings associated with the National Children’s Hospital. The lack of, or delay in having, a co-located maternity hospital beside our children’s hospital will continue to have an appalling impact on the lives of our premature children as many of them will continue to have to be transferred from our maternity hospitals to children’s hospitals for treatment, thereby separating mothers and their babies, both of whom could be critically ill, and putting these children at unnecessary risk. The shortage of the Ronald McDonald beds at the new hospital will also put additional financial strain on families.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	360	It is no small thing to deliver a baby. While that statement may seem obvious, the enormity of childbirth creates a degree of trauma, which is sometimes lost on people. It is fine when everything goes well but an unexpected development, for example, a premature birth with considerable medical intervention, adds significantly to this trauma. I should correct two statements made by previous speakers. The Social Democrats have been lauded for helping with this motion. While my party is supportive of the motion and is in the same group as the Green Party, it was drawn up exclusively by the Green Party. I do not wish to take credit for work done by someone else. On another matter, Deputy Coppinger stated she disagreed with the Social Democrats on legislation on parental leave we introduced earlier this week. While we would have liked to have gone further, unfortunately, opposition parties are precluded under the Constitution from introducing money Bills or legislation that imposes a charge on the Exchequer. It is important to point out, therefore, that we could not introduce a Bill that would give rise to a charge.  Maternity leave was developed to allow new mothers not only to bond with their children, but also to take time to parent effectively, develop routines, gain confidence and so forth. Developing routines is a vital part of feeling sufficiently confident to leave the most precious thing one has to return to work. Women participate in the workforce to a much greater degree than previously and we must cater for and manage this change. Returning to work is one of the most difficult decisions young mothers can make. One frequently hears mothers speak of the trauma of returning to work. They often use holidays to extend their maternity leave, sometimes at great financial cost, because they do not feel ready to return to work. Many other European Union countries, specifically the Nordic countries, have much more sophisticated maternity leave systems in place. They provide much longer periods of paid leave, in some cases up to three years after the birth of a child. In the changed, modern environment, fathers have thankfully become an increasing part of the bonding process and routine setting period that must be factored into leave. While our Bill on paternity leave is modest, it would extend the period of parental leave available to mothers and fathers.  Most mothers find themselves in a position in which they must return to work for economic reasons and they often do so much sooner than they would like. However, when a woman delivers prematurely, she and her baby require additional time. In the first instance, both the mother and baby need medical care. Moreover, when a woman worries about losing time at work and managing economically, these concerns add to an already stressful situation.  An important part of the motion is the extension of maternity leave to the original delivery date or the date on which the baby leaves hospital. This is a sensible provision. A premature birth requires significant additional care for the mother and baby and in many cases the pre-term period can involve extensive and intensive medical care, during which the mother does not get sufficient rest and recovery and the bonding and parenting period for which maternity leave is intended is largely absent. Premature delivery is not unusual, with one in 16 women in Ireland delivering prematurely. Women who have premature babies should not be terrified of losing valuable time with their new baby, either because nature or medicine has intervened and disrupted the timing that many of take for granted. The emotional and physical trauma of premature birth should not be compounded by parents worrying that the weeks of maternity leave they expected to have for bonding, fun and learning are to be lost.  Deputies who have given birth will remember the day on which they took their first child home. This experience is terrifying enough in the case of a child who is of average size and whose health is not compromised. It is much more terrifying when the baby is very small and may have compromised health. The civilised approach is to cater for such circumstances in the maternity and paternity regime.  The old cliché that we know the cost of everything and the value of nothing applies. We should know the value of this eminently sensible and necessary proposal which I hope the Government will accept.  I hope the House will agree to allow Deputy Eugene Murphy to use the rest of the time available to me.

I chaired the first part of this debate, which has been fantastic. I commend Deputy Catherine Martin on introducing the motion. Her address was delivered with great passion and emotion and was special. Every Deputy spoke with passion and there is a real desire among us to help parents of premature babies by changing the current position regarding maternity leave. It is long past time that we acknowledged the plight of parents of premature children. I recall a mother telling me of her experience. Her baby arrived prematurely at 22 weeks weighing only 2 Ibs and 3 oz. She was so tiny she could fit in the palms of her parents' hands. She spent virtually the entire first seven months of life in hospital with either a parent or close family member. After four months, the mother's only option was to return to work and to this day she regrets having to leave her little girl behind. At the time, however, she did not have a choice. This is one ordinary, everyday example that explains the reason we must try to change the current position. While I had more to say on this issue, this example gets the message across that we would like to help the people affected. I am pleased the House has been able to accommodate the motion and that all sides, including the Government, are on board and will try to make the changes required to help them.

I acknowledge the presence of parents and their children who have joined us in the Gallery to hear the debate. I reiterate the point made by my colleague, the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, that the Government is acutely aware of the different pressures that families with pre-term babies face and believe the State can and should support families at a time when the pressures of nurturing a new life can be daunting and stressful. The Government also believes in investing in a child's critical early years. We all know how important and life-defining these years are. For this reason, investment in early years is a recurring theme in the programme for partnership Government. The Government will not oppose the motion and welcomes the initiative of the Deputies in question in providing us with this opportunity to highlight the issue and debate how best to respond. The Government expanded paid leave in the first year of a child's life in 2016 through the introduction of two weeks of statutory paternity leave and benefit for new fathers. The Paternity Leave and Benefit Act 2016 brought the number of weeks of paid support to parents upon the birth of a child to 28, comprising 26 weeks of maternity leave, two weeks of which must be taken before the birth, and two weeks of paternity leave. When babies are born prematurely, bringing all the attendant concerns that have been outlined by Deputies, there is a particularly strong case to be made for expanding maternity leave on public policy grounds. The Tánaiste and Minister for Justice and Equality has signalled in replies to several recent parliamentary questions that this is an issue she is open to considering in the context of the family leave Bill on which the Department is working.A draft Bill has been produced, which needs to update various issues as my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton said. The most important is the programme for Government commitment to increase paid parental leave during the first year of a child's life. Discussions have recently taken place between the relevant officials in the Departments of Justice and Equality and Social Protection and further discussion with other relevant Departments will take place shortly. The Minister intends to develop these policy proposals with Government colleagues in the coming weeks, include such proposals in the family leave Bill and have it published later this year. The question of cost will be a key consideration in the context of forthcoming legislative proposals. I reiterate we believe the State should support families at a time the pressure of nurturing new life can be daunting and stressful. However, we need to closely examine the cost of any legislative proposals, including this one. This will be done in conjunction with the Departments of Social Protection and Public Expenditure and Reform. There is more work to be done before the Government is in position to suggest legislation on this point. The Department of Justice and Equality will closely consult the Departments of Health and Social Protection and other Departments in formulating precise proposals. I understand Deputies Penrose, Nolan, Rabbitte and others suggested improvements to maternity leave and other family leave, including carer's leave and paternal leave. I am not in a position to respond to these issues but I assure the House that they can all be considered in the family leave Bill, which is intended to be published before the end of the year. As the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton, mentioned earlier, the Government does not oppose the motion. Instead, we intend to address the substantive issue raised in the family leave Bill and I look forward to the support of the House when these proposals come to be debated.

I also thank the Irish Premature Babies charity for the willingness of its members to share their stories and fight on behalf of other mothers, which it has been doing on a consistent basis. I am glad we were able to assist them in bringing their case to the House. I was stuck at a meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and I was unable to make it to their presentation in the audiovisual room earlier but everyone I talked to said it was a powerful and moving occasion. I thank them for attending the House and sharing those stories with us. I thank the Minister of State, Deputy Stanton. He is an advertisement for premature babies, 60 years on. I also thank the Minister for Justice and Equality for her presence and for her willingness to accept the motion. I would like to make a few points to nail down exactly what we are agreeing. This Chamber, by its nature, is adversarial. Motions are often agreed but there is a sense that one has scored a point but nothing will get done. This is a different motion, which has to have real effect. I am slightly concerned by the comments of both Ministers of State. I detected the Civil Service speak in their contributions with notes of caution and references to cost implications, further consideration, Attorney General's advice and so on. The proposal in the motion should be easily achieved before the year is out. We tabled it in a motion because, when in opposition, we are not able to introduce a money Bill but we are also concerned that if we tried to do this through legislation, it could get stuck in a slow and difficult legislative process. We thought one option might to be to include it in the finance or social welfare Bills connected to the 2018 budget because this has to be enacted in that timeframe to make that happen for next year. The Minister of State, Deputy Corcoran Kennedy, said the proposal could be included in the family leave Bill, which is intended to help couples with adoptive leave and same-sex couples looking for benefits, and which I welcome. If it is possible to include it in that Bill and have it implemented in the timeframe we outlined, we would welcome and support that. The Department of Justice and Equality is under particular legislative pressure with an endless number of Bills in the queue and it is often difficult to secure Government time in the House. If an alternative approach can be taken through the budgetary process, as we have suggested, will the Minister consider it to make sure the proposal gets over the line and turns into a reality? The second note of caution I detected related to cost implications and a differentiation in the contributions of both Ministers of State between a premature baby born at 23 or 24 weeks and a baby born at between 34 or even 37 weeks. The simplicity and clarity of the mechanism presented by Deputy Catherine Martin makes most sense. She said that this is about giving mothers time. The science is clear that every day before the arrival of a baby is vital for the baby, the parents and the rest of the family. If we start parcelling out and costing each week in respect of a premature baby, that would not reflect well on the State and how we value mothers and babies and, in particular, premature babies. The Government should stick with the approach that has been set out in the motion. The clarity of the taxation and benefit measures in our law should help in order that mothers are not trying to calculate which category of premature child they are in. It is medically recognised that a baby born at 37 weeks or less is premature. Let us treat them all the same. Our estimate, when the social welfare benefits and other supports are included, is that the proposal would cost €5 million. The Secretaries General of the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform appeared at the meeting of the Committee on Budgetary Oversight and they batted off a €120 million charge that has not been covered for additional Garda pay and water charges and so on by saying the money would be found easily enough. If €120 million can be found easily enough, then let us find €5 million and extend the maternity leave system in a way that everyone would recognise as just. The number of Members who contributed to the debate and who had personal stories about premature babies was remarkable. The one in 16 ratio emerged in every contribution with Members referring to a sister or someone at a sibling's workplace, or a mother they knew. We all relate to this experience. This proposal should be implemented quickly, whether that is through the family leave Bill in gestation, the finance Bill or another legislative proposal, as part of valuing motherhood, parenting and our young babies.
#CatherineMartin	unknown-#CatherineMartin-party	unknown-#CatherineMartin-dob	unknown-#CatherineMartin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	365	I thank the Members who contributed and I am delighted there is cross-party support for the motion. I am especially delighted for the mothers and fathers who are present in the Gallery to watch the debate as they seek a fairer system for mothers of premature babies. Present legislation and policy abjectly ignores, and is cruel in its disregard for, the huge unforeseen pressure and turmoil families face when caring for a premature baby. In some cases, parents from the country are compelled to travel for up to four hours on a daily commute to a neonatal intensive care unit. They incur significant expenses in medical care, accommodation, parking, transport and food and this puts severe stress on parents and their other children. At the time of a baby's arrival, parents' concerns, worries and anxieties are naturally focused on the baby's safe well-being and progress.At that time, maternity leave and maternity benefit may be one of the last things on a mother's mind but it will not take long until the mother faces the reality of being treated by the State in a markedly different and unfair way compared to mothers fortunate enough to give birth to full-term babies. Under current legislation, a mother, despite being shattered and exhausted after this unexpected and prolonged rollercoaster experience, will have used up the majority of her maternity leave before her baby even makes the first long-awaited journey home. Extending maternity leave and maternity benefits for the mothers of premature babies, as we seek in this motion, will give the support needed at a time of such upheaval and stress. This in turn will lead to better post-natal health, a better outcome for the baby, and eventually a better and more positive return to work. It is truly awful that mothers are not getting this support already because when premature babies finally get discharged from hospital, they need their mothers more than ever and their mothers need to be with them too.

Tá ríméad orm go bhfuil an chuma air go bhfuilimid ar tí an deis sin a thapú agus, mar sin, a léiriú gur féidir leis an bpolaitíocht nua an beart a dhéanamh. Is féidir linn fíordhifríocht a dhéanamh anocht do na glúnta atá le teacht. The words of support spoken tonight offer hope and reassurance to thousands of mothers in Ireland. I welcome the words of support but words alone will not be enough. It is way past time for real, concrete action. Although I welcome the Government's support of this motion and its intention to address this issue in the family leave Bill, I ask it to treat the issue with a greater sense of urgency. I urge the Government to commit to providing for the extension of maternity leave and maternity benefit for mothers of premature babies in the budget this autumn. As mentioned earlier in the debate this evening, providing for this in the upcoming budget should come in at a cost of approximately €5.4 million. That is a relatively small cost that could make such an incredible difference for mothers of premature babies.  I conclude by saying if we are to truly cherish all of our nation's children, then we also need to cherish all mothers equally by supporting them in their devoted care for their children.

However, we have to respect the wishes of the UK electorate and its Government and our focus now has to be on establishing a close and beneficial relationship for the future. There can be no bilateral negotiations between individual member states and the UK on its withdrawal or on matters that fall within the sole competence of the European Union. Ireland has a voice and a great ability to influence matters. That is what we have to do. There is already widespread recognition among our partners and the EU institutions that Ireland will be more affected by the departure of the UK than any other member state. Prime Minister May has now invoked the provisions of Article 50 of the Treaty of the European Union. Turning to her letter of 29 March 2017, I will draw attention to two issues that are of particular interest to me as Minister for Justice and Equality. First, she makes clear the UK wants to agree a deep and special partnership with the European Union that takes in both economic and security co-operation. Security co-operation therefore will be a key issue. Second, she referred to the UK’s unique relationship with Ireland, the importance of the peace process in Northern Ireland and the common travel area. These are issues I wish to explore further in my contribution to this debate and I will start with the issue of security co-operation.  The question of border controls, police co-operation and judicial co-operation in criminal matters only entered into the mainstream of the European Union legal framework with the Lisbon treaty in 2009. Despite this, the legal framework for police and judicial criminal co-operation in criminal matters is now almost entirely based on EU instruments. Key instruments include the European arrest warrant for extradition; mutual legal assistance; Europol and the Europol information system; and the police aspects of the Schengen information system - Prüm for checking fingerprints, DNA and car registration and ECRIS for criminal records. There is a very wide variety of instruments. Entering into force in May 2018, before the withdrawal of the United Kingdom, we have the passenger name record, the PNR, for the prevention, detection, investigation and prosecution of terrorist offences and serious crime. The ones I have mentioned just give a taste of the network of instruments joining all member states in their fight against crime. For us, the UK is a vital partner in security co-operation, not only in addressing dissidents in the context of Northern Ireland but also, because of its size and geographical proximity, we have more interaction with the UK criminal justice system than any other jurisdiction. Of particular importance for us is the European arrest warrant. I cannot overstate its importance in improving the arrangements for the extradition of wanted persons within the European Union. It addressed all the failings associated with the 1957 Council of Europe Convention on Extradition and means extradition is a relatively straightforward procedure that now takes months rather than years and avoids political issues. I would be very concerned if the UK did not continue its participation in the European arrest warrant system as it would have very significant and serious implications for security co-operation. I am heartened by the consistent statements of the UK Government reinforced by the emphasis in Prime Minister May’s letter that security co-operation is one of her top priorities. However, I am still concerned about the lack of detail on how the UK intends to reconcile maintaining such high levels of security co-operation with their plans to withdraw from the European Union. Negotiating new instruments for police and judicial co-operation can be a lengthy and complex process. The Prime Minister referred in her letter to the need to avoid cliff edges and refers to implementation periods to adjust in a smooth and orderly way to new arrangements. Maintaining this level of co-operation is in everyone’s interest and keeps everyone safer. We have a special interest in ensuring that the closest possible co-operation takes place. In the context of the EU-UK negotiations, we will be pressing that the UK exit should not result in any let-up in our work to tackle serious crime and terrorist threats. I will turn now to the close links between Ireland and the United Kingdom and to Border issues and Northern Ireland. We all know the background to the common travel area arrangements which are bilateral, between the two States, and they predate our accession to the European Union. We know about the reciprocity of rights so I will not go into detail on those. We are all very clear about the rights of residents such as the right to vote in parliamentary elections, the access to various services and that they do not require work permits. We are also aware of the arrangements that exist here for UK citizens. Part of these arrangements was the decision that there should be no border control obligations on people travelling within the common travel area. To facilitate this, there are various arrangements in place to protect the interests of both the UK and Ireland while allowing the free movement of persons across our mutual borders. This is recognised in protocols 19 and 20. Ireland and the UK were specifically excluded from the obligation to participate in the Schengen arrangements. It is our intention to remain outside the Schengen area and to continue to avail of protocols 19 and 20 to maintain the common travel area arrangements with the UK. The UK has also said it wishes to maintain the common travel area arrangements and this is repeated. It is particularly important as we all know in the context of the peace process in Northern Ireland. I have touched on specific issues raised in the Article 50 letter issued by Prime Minister May. However, her letter is not exhaustive in terms of all the issues. My Department has gone through every EU instrument falling within our remit, which amounted to more than 700 instruments.As part of our preparations for this day, each was examined and the implications of a UK withdrawal assessed. We have identified the key priorities for the forthcoming negotiations and considered what alternative measures may be relevant. However, we can only progress our preparations so far in the absence of an indication of what position the UK will take. I will briefly touch on issues not yet raised by the UK. Those living on the Border are probably more conscious of the practical day-to-day advantages brought about by the EU than most. Within the remit of my Department, there are many EU instruments dealing with the cross-Border aspects of, for example, the recognition and enforcement of judgments, family law and recovery of maintenance payments. These issues have not been highlighted by the UK and there are no indications to date as to what its plans are in that regard. This also applies to asylum policy. We have a co-ordinated approach currently, but there is no indication of what the UK is thinking for the future. Any change could have significant effects on us because of the common travel area and our proximity to the UK. Another issue of which we need to be conscious is that of the new data protection regime that will apply within the EU and to law enforcement. This is not just a justice issue. Rather, it has implications over a wide range of services, including banking, insurance and payrolls. The exchange of data with UK-based bodies will be severely curtailed if the UK does not maintain a data protection regime that is equivalent to that in the EU. The new EU regime will apply before the UK leaves and one presumes that the UK will maintain the regime on departure, but that is something that will have to be watched closely. The Government will shortly publish a consolidated paper providing more detail on the four main priority areas of minimising impact on trade and the economy, protecting the Northern Ireland peace process, maintaining the common travel area and influencing the future of the EU. We have prepared comprehensively for the invocation of Article 50 by the UK and it is positive that the UK has emphasised its desire for close co-operation with the EU on security matters. However, the detail of what the UK is going to be looking for in the justice and home affairs area has yet to be set out. The sooner the UK's proposals are made known, the sooner we can make progress on many of these vital matters, some of which I have outlined and will have serious implications for our citizens.

The date 23 June of last year was a sad one for the EU, Ireland and, in particular, Britain, especially in light of the disgraceful and treacherous campaign run by the Brexiteers, the lies that were told and the unrealisable promises that were made. Now we see the reality of the Article 50 letter that Prime Minister May has submitted to the EU. We hoped that cool and calm heads would prevail as we transitioned through this phase, but the hard Brexiteers in the British Cabinet in London have won the day on what stance Britain will take. That Britain would look to remove itself completely from the Single Market and effectively from the customs union means in real terms that this will probably be the hardest of hard Brexits. We must make it clear - my colleagues and I certainly do - that, as part of the negotiations, we are on the EU's side of the table. We have a centuries-old relationship with Britain, most of it not good, and we have a shared history, but Britain's history has tended to be imposed on us to the detriment of the Irish people. Only in recent times following Independence, the Good Friday Agreement and the peace that we enjoy in the North has that situation turned around. However, here we are with another example of Britain taking a wrong turn down the road, one that will drastically affect us and has the potential to damage our country, including people's livelihoods and quality of life. Our job as an Oireachtas and that of the Government is in the first instance to protect the interests of the Irish people in the Republic and the North. I will turn to the issue of the North shortly. Consider the sectors that can be affected. We know the trade figures. There is €60 billion in trade between Ireland and Britain per year. Among others, our agrifood sector is dependent in that regard. However, we are a large and important market for Britain as well. We actually run a trade deficit with Britain. I have spent time in London speaking with people who bemoan their current situation and regret what has happened. Underneath the trade figures are people's jobs, incomes and their ability to feed their families, send them through education, pay mortgages and live the lives to which they aspire. It was a reckless and treacherous act on the part of elements within the Tory Party. Now we have to live with it, but we must make as good a fist of it as possible. I understand the position taken in today's statements from the EU, particularly the Commission, to the effect that we should agree the terms of what has been termed the "divorce settlement" in advance of talks on the future relationship, but I hope that there will be overlap in real terms - there must be some - when we are deciding what the new arrangements will be when someone decides to leave. I will turn to discuss a number of issues for my constituency, where aviation is important owing to the presence of Dublin Airport. The figures are stark. A total of 39% of all airline passenger traffic into Ireland is from the UK. The second busiest air route in the world, and the busiest European route, is Dublin-London. Dublin Airport accounts for 15,700 jobs directly and between 28 million and 29 million passengers. Consider the work that has been done by successive Governments, as well as by management and, importantly, staff at Dublin Airport and the airlines that fly out of it. It contributes 4% to GDP. This must be kept in mind. I could pick any sector, for example, financial services or agrifood, which has seen a drop of nearly €600 million in the value of exports to Britain, because there are threats to jobs, livelihoods and homes in all sectors thanks to Brexit. My colleague, Deputy Donnelly, just reminded me that Mr. Michael O'Leary stated at the weekend that there was every possibility that, should these negotiations go off a cliff without agreement, UK flights would not be able to land within the EU or fly across its airspace for a number of weeks or months post the two-year negotiations. That might sound fanciful and ridiculous, but Britain has decided to pull out of the Open Skies agreement. The EU must ensure that the mechanisms and long-standing agreements between EU member states and associate states are adhered to. Who will be the regulator and so on? The uncertainty over the free movement of goods and people poses a threat to aviation, including passenger flights and freight. The UK is moving away from the EU's liberalised market. I have spoken about Dublin Airport, but these major threats also affect Cork and Belfast airports. The British Government has not taken these matters into account. The Irish Government must respond as opposed to just holding regular debates. Now that the British have outlined their plan, or lack thereof, seeing as how they do not know what they want, we must prioritise what is important to us and consider the risks to our sectors.We have been led by some economists to believe there will be an upside to Brexit in terms of the stream of financial services and insurance companies looking to relocate to Dublin and the jobs that will ensue from that. As the Minister knows, that has not happened. While we were in the running in a number of areas some of the major companies have decided to locate elsewhere. I am not suggesting we can win them all. I am not convinced that in terms of our response, reaction and readiness we have been up to scratch. In regard to the agrifood sector, 37% of all Irish foods and 50% of all dairy and beef exports are to the UK. It is estimated that in 2016 almost €600 million in the value of trade was wiped out because of the depreciation in sterling. These are real issues that arose pre-submission of the Article 50 letter. I earnestly hope the EU, with Ireland at the table as one of the EU 27, can move towards a reasonable agreement. Nobody wants to punish the UK but it cannot be outside the EU and at the same time have all that is good without any of the responsibilities. I cannot see how we can marry free access to the Single Market with restriction on the movement of European Union citizens. That is something that I personally could not agree with. In regard to Northern Ireland, I remind the Minister that this Dáil voted on a Sinn Féin motion, amended and added to by Fianna Fáil, to give the North of Ireland special status in the negotiations. That motion was agreed. We should have insisted on that at the outset of our negotiations. The largest proportion of EU citizens that will be outside the European Union post-Brexit will be in the North of Ireland. We have a duty of care to Northern Ireland. We are a co-guarantor of the Good Friday Agreement. A citizen born in Belfast is as entitled to his or her Irish citizenship as any citizen born in Dublin or in any of the 26 counties. I believe the Government gave up on that even before the negotiations started. I ask that the Government look to what Spain has been able to achieve, even by way of mention of Gibraltar and the over-the-top reaction of some of the Tories in the UK. Obviously, the Spanish had lobbied for mention of Gibraltar. I know that we have a much stronger case to make because a sizeable proportion of the people in the North of Ireland have a close and earnest affiliation of citizenship in Ireland. This is multifaceted. As negotiations move forward we will need to find a mechanism in the Oireachtas to allow our Ministers and the Government to report back on the various sectors and to work actively to protect jobs in the areas I mentioned, including aviation, horticulture and agrifood.
#SeanCroweSF	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-party	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-dob	unknown-#SeanCroweSF-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	369	As we know, last week the British Government triggered Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union and began the process of formally withdrawing from the EU. The British Government's plan to date on Brexit shows it is ignoring the views of the people of lreland, North and South. Its intention to leave the Single Market and the Customs Union will have a detrimental impact on Ireland by placing a hard Border on this island. The British Government has no mandate to do this. The people of the North clearly voted in the referendum to remain in the EU but their democratic voice is being discarded as unimportant by the British Government. That a British Conservative Government would treat the citizens of the North as second class citizens is no surprise to me and other Irish republicans but it is infuriating communities across many different divides. Sinn Féin has a mandate and a duty to defend the democratic wish of this cross-community majority who have not consented to leave or be dragged out of the EU by the British Government. We will not allow the British Government use Brexit to unravel the progress of the past 20 years. This is a very serious threat, one we are not taking lightly. Brexit will affect so many aspects of Irish life but particularly the movement of people, products, services and capital in Ireland to and from Britain. It will massively affect the indigenous export sector, particularly the agrifood sector. Brexit undermines the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process, particularly the provisions on consent. It moves the EU border onto the island of Ireland, leaving, potentially, 1 million Irish citizens and, therefore, EU citizens isolated on the other side. For this reason Sinn Féin is calling for special designated status for the North within the EU. This is supported by the majority of parties in the Oireachtas and by the majority of MLAs who were elected in the recent Assembly elections. It is a realistic and achievable solution. This will happen only if the Irish Government negotiates for our national interests and pushes for it. The Government has been asleep at the wheel thus far. It has failed to outline publically or privately to the Opposition its plans for the negotiations. We are being asked to row blindly in behind the Government while not being briefed by it on developments. The Sinn Féin motion passed by the Dáil in February called on the Government to keep the Oireachtas updated on the Brexit process on a regular basis but that has not happened. There has been no meeting of party leaders or spokespersons. A briefing by the Department of Foreign Affairs scheduled to take place in the AV Room in February was cancelled for some reason and never rearranged. We are being asked to wear the green jersey while not knowing the tactics of the team. With the publication of the draft European Council Brexit guidelines we learned that the Spanish Government has been afforded a veto over any future exit agreement concerning Gibraltar. While reference is made to Ireland and the Good Friday Agreement and the unique circumstances on our island there is nothing close to a veto. Has the Irish Government requested such a veto? If it has, on what basis is Ireland being treated differently to Spain? If not, why not? Today the European Parliament adopted a resolution regarding the Brexit negotiations. The resolution is far from perfect but it is far superior to the draft guidelines issued by the European Council last week. The resolution states that the Good Friday Agreement should be protected in all its parts, that there should be no hardening of the Border in Ireland and that the unique situation of the North should be recognised. It is because of this unique situation and in the context of the Good Friday Agreement that we are calling for the North to be granted special status. In my opinion, there is an onus on the Taoiseach and the European Council to take heed of this and to stand up for the Good Friday Agreement in all its parts, and to act in the best interests of Irish citizens. We are also calling on the Irish Government to ensure workers who lose their jobs because of Brexit will be compensated and to invest heavily in our infrastructure to ensure we can continue to export and import goods. We also call for a relaxation of the fiscal rules which hamper significant Government expenditure and tax measures. We need to be doing things differently. The Government has failed its first big Brexit test. It now needs to step up to the plate and to put up a fight and defend our national interests at the European Council and to do so immediately. We all need to be on board when it comes to that fight and we need to be updated regularly on the negotiations. There is no reason leaders of the Opposition parties or spokespersons should not be updated on the discussions. Day in and day out we are meeting people who are arguing in relation to Ireland's situation but we do not know the Government strategy.

I spent five years in the European Parliament. I was always astonished at the fact that British Tories could obsess so passionately over obnoxious foreign notions like a 40-hour working week. It is no secret that my party and I have been long-term critics of much of the architecture and the direction of the European project. We believe it has lost its way, which accounts for some of the backlash that was manifest in the Brexit debate.I suggest the little Englander mentality which sadly prevailed was far stronger than that. As an outside observer, I believe it serves no great purpose for the great English people. It is an agenda which is not worthy of them. That is my view as an outsider. If the desire of the English people, as voted for and democratically mandated, is for England to leave the EU, that is their business and off they go. The primary concern of the Oireachtas must be the consequences of Brexit for this island as a whole, and in particular for the North. It has been said, but it bears repeating that the people of the North of Ireland voted to stay in the EU. They did not join in the Brexiteer jolly as it unfolded across the water. I am conscious that there has been endless discussion and lamenting of Brexit and no doubt that will continue. I cannot help feeling the Government is essentially sleepwalking into a potentially damaging and dangerous situation. I want to put it straight on the table that if Brexit and the hard departure of Britain from the EU are left unchecked and unchallenged, it is an absolute racing certainty that the Good Friday Agreement will be undermined and sabotaged. The logic of the Agreement, the political architecture of the Agreement and the human rights provisions that underpin the ethos and the outworkings of the Agreement were all premised on joint membership of the EU. A hard Brexit, as envisaged by Mrs. May and her colleagues, means the essence of the Agreement, which has been so painstakingly constructed by so many people over such a long period of time, is in immediate peril. I have to say one certainly would not get that impression from reading the draft guidelines from the Council. One of the Taoiseach's Government colleagues - I think it might have been the Minister, Deputy Flanagan - described them as a "triumph" for Ireland. The triumph concerned is anaemic in its wording, non-committal and mealy-mouthed. It is certainly not as strong as the protections or assertions achieved by the Spanish Government in respect of the Rock of Gibraltar. Heaven help us if the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, regard this as a triumph. If this is a moment of triumph, we are in even bigger trouble than I suspected. As we have heard, a majority of Members of the Oireachtas voted to support a special designated status for the North of Ireland within the EU. That is the agenda the Government must pursue. For reasons I find bizarre and outlandish, it seems unwilling to pursue that logic. Unless we achieve what this House has voted for, we will cause economic difficulties for our agrifood business and for communities that live on the Border. It will be more difficult for everyone, including those who do not live in Border areas, to access health services and academic institutions in the North. In these circumstances, the biggest damage and the real collateral damage will be to the peace process and to the architecture, the letter and the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement. We are not prepared to let that happen. I do not believe any Irish Government worthy of the name should be prepared to let it happen. That means that Article 11 needs to be amended. We have until 29 April. The Taoiseach should relish the opportunity to go back to secure what would be a real achievement and potentially a triumph for this country.
#AlanKelly	unknown-#AlanKelly-party	unknown-#AlanKelly-dob	unknown-#AlanKelly-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	373	I agree with many of the previous speaker's comments. I accept her passion on this issue. It would have been great if her party had campaigned on Brexit in Northern Ireland. It would have been welcome, given the passion with which she has spoken about the issue this evening. Her party did not even register as a political entity to campaign in the referendum. If it had done so, the Deputy and her colleagues would have been able to express their views and fight for even more "Remain" votes. We are heading into years of uncertainty. It is clear from how long it took to reach a trade deal with Canada that this process will take many years. I genuinely congratulate the Government on its diplomatic efforts. I would not necessarily say it has won, but it has secured elements of acknowledgement of Ireland's unique situation. We should acknowledge those small wins. The real win will be secured when we reach an agreement we can all live with. I would like to take a different angle on this debate. I believe we need to discuss what our options as a country will be when the final outcome is known. In particular, I suggest we should have a conversation about whether the agreement that is eventually reached will need to be put to the Irish people for ratification. I do not think anyone here can predict where we will be at that point, what the outcome will be or whether a vote will be needed. I am not saying anyone has the answers, but we certainly need to discuss the possibility of a referendum. Article 50 has been triggered. We know the EU's initial negotiating principles. There is a spectrum of outcomes on where we could end up as regards Brexit. There could be a hard Border. Obviously, a fully negotiated agreement is what we want. The spectrum of outcomes I have mentioned will lead us to make a decision in order that we can ensure this is ratified. We can be sure of three things. First, the agreement on leaving will have to be ratified by the European Council using qualified majority voting. Second, any such agreement will have to be passed by the European Parliament. As a former Member of the European Parliament, I expect that to happen, although it is not a foregone conclusion. Third, any deal will have to be agreed by each existing member state. We all know we have been here before. Many EU referendums have been held in this country since 1987. Every country has its own way of ratifying the accession of a new member state, for example. In this case, a member state is leaving the Union. The Labour Party has published a Brexit document that discusses the need to look at how all the EU treaties will affect this change. Substantial changes to EU treaties may be ratified by the Irish Government by means of an Act of both Houses of the Oireachtas. As we have seen before, there will need to be a referendum if a material change is proposed. It is extremely unlikely that Brexit will result in a change to the EU treaties that will affect Ireland in such a way that we will not need to have a referendum. The UK is referred to approximately 120 times in EU treaties and protocols. Having listened to what the Tánaiste has said about a range of protocols, I am more convinced than ever that there is a strong possibility that any agreement will create new bodies or organisations to oversee the relationship between both parties - the UK and the EU - thereby again necessitating a referendum. I do not think anybody in the Oireachtas can say definitively that a referendum will be necessary. I am saying straight out that we need to discuss the possibility. We need to have it on our radar. We need to be prepared for it. I expect that myriad legal arguments will be presented as part of the legal debate about whether a referendum will be necessary. I would like to help the Government by mentioning another component of this matter. We do not know where the legal debate will end up. We certainly should be putting it to our EU partners that there is a very strong likelihood of a referendum. Frankly, it is one of the biggest levers we have. The possibility that an agreement between the remaining EU member states and Britain would have to be put to a referendum of the Irish people should focus Mr. Barnier's mind during the negotiations. Tactically, this is something we have to consider very strongly. We will need to have a referendum anyway. The Government should state this is a strong likelihood as a strategic, tactical and factual move. No one can tell me that somebody will not walk into the Supreme Court once an agreement has been reached and argue that, for various different reasons, it needs to be put to the people. There needs to be a discussion about whether we should be upfront about this. I want to focus on some of the issues the Labour Party has highlighted in our perspective on Brexit. We were the only party to publish a paper on Brexit. The special status of Northern Ireland is a critical priority. We need to examine a range of other areas. My party believes that a new protocol on EU treaties will be necessary and we need to consider how that will happen in order to protect the common travel area with Britain and enshrine the Good Friday Agreement. Work on that needs to commence. The fiscal rules and Stability and Growth Pact are key issues that we need to lever in the negotiations in order to generate change and give us greater flexibility. We need that flexibility, given the unclear situation in which we find ourselves. We need to ensure the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, is protected. The €115 billion received by Irish farmers annually must, as far as possible, be guaranteed in any post-Brexit adjustments to the EU budget. The UK currently contributes 12% of the EU budget, with a net contribution of €10.5 billion which will be lost post-Brexit. A 12% cut to CAP will be devastating for Irish farmers, as EU direct payments account for 65% of family farm incomes in Ireland. There needs to be a direct and real focus on that. We need to consider transitional arrangements with Britain over the coming years before Brexit in order to prepare for it. Furthermore, an early warning system needs to be created to deal with the issues that will arise across industries as regards Brexit. This will help to prepare industries for Brexit. There are unknowns. This is virgin territory. Let us put an early warning system in place in order to find out what the issues are and deal with them as quickly as possible. We all know what happened to the mushroom industry. Not alone will we have to deal with negative consequences, there could potentially be positive consequences. We were told how well the IFSC would do out of Brexit and now we can see the consequences. There are opportunities in other areas, including IT and standards, pharmaceuticals and education, particular third level education. There is capacity to promote this country as the only English language speaking country in the EU, which would provide an opportunity to foster significant investment in research. We need an early warning system or other system in place to foster ideas and opportunities and bring about capacity for warnings about the known or unknown impacts on industry.
#JoanCollins	unknown-#JoanCollins-party	unknown-#JoanCollins-dob	unknown-#JoanCollins-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	374	Some two or three weeks ago, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, gave a short interview on television at a meeting of EU Finance Ministers. He was remarkably sanguine about the prospects of Brexit. He stated that, in his view, there would be a transitional period. He implied that most of the existing arrangements between the UK and the EU and the UK and Ireland would remain in place during this transitional period. In other words, he said there was nothing much to get excited about. If this reflects in any way the attitude of the Government, it is heading for a rude awakening. We only have to consider the remarks of Michael Howard, who raised the spectre of war with Spain over Gibraltar, to see the reality of the situation. Michael Howard cannot be dismissed as a voice from the lunatic fringe, even though some people might think he is. He is a former leader of the Tory Party who has influence and authority over the Tory extreme right, those who are driving the agenda on Brexit. These people live in a fantasy land of their own creation. They have convinced themselves that once they have thrown off the shackles of the EU, all of the glories of the empire will magically reappear. It is a case of hard Brexit or no deal. It is highly likely that these people, along with their supporters in the UK right-wing media, have an effective veto over the hapless Theresa May. As to who else might have a veto on the Brexit negotiations on a new relationship and trade deal between the UK and the 27 member states it is, to be honest, anybody's guess. Spain may have a veto on Gibraltar. If it does, it will use it. Anyone who thinks this is not a problem for the exit negotiations is not living in the real world. The 27 individual member states do not have a veto on the Brexit negotiations but if the negotiations involve elements of a post-Brexit relationship, individual states will possibly have a veto. The European Parliament has a monitoring role in the negotiations. If it decided that sufficient progress was not being made on the early issues in the negotiations, such as the rights of EU citizens in the UK up to 2019 or agreement on the amount the UK pays to leave, it can prevent negotiations moving to the next level. Is this a veto? This points to a situation in which a soft Brexit is the least likely scenario. The special situation of Ireland in Clause 11 of the EU negotiation guidelines will have about as much weight as Angela Merkel's statement that Ireland was a special case in the context of the bailout of the EU banking system, and look where that got us. The situation is not good - some people think it is verging on very bad. We should be prepared for the worst, something to which other Deputies have referred. We need to think about what will happen if Europe does or does not remain in place. For working people throughout Europe, neither remaining in a European Union dominated by neoliberalism or living outside it in a right-wing nationalist pipedream can solve the problems they face, health, jobs, education, social welfare, housing and all of the other issues faced by ordinary people in the past eight years of austerity. There is a need for an alternative, and the alternative will become clearer over time. Unless Europe puts money into the areas that directly affect people's lives such as living standards, jobs and other things, we face a potential rise of the right and the continuation of neoliberalism, which is the cause of the rise of the right. There is a need to build a new left to fight for a new Europe, which is genuinely based on solidarity and co-operation between the peoples of Europe and which puts the interests of the citizens before those of big business. If we do not do that, the outcome for Europe or America will not be good. People will struggle and fight back against what they see as inequality.

As Minister for Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs, Brexit will have an impact on a number of sectors and areas within my remit. Its impact on rural areas is of course of particular concern, but the UK’s decision to leave the EU will also have an impact on the arts and cultural sectors. My Department, like all other key Departments, has been engaging with sectoral interests under our remit to ensure the Government is well prepared to anticipate key issues. I hosted a sectoral dialogue on Brexit in Cavan on 6 February, which was attended by more than 100 stakeholders from across the arts, culture, film, heritage, Irish language, regional and rural affairs sectors. The actions set out in Realising our Rural Potential, the Government’s Action Plan for Rural Development launched in January, will assist in supporting rural communities, including those in Border areas, to meet the challenges posed by Brexit and to position themselves to avail of the opportunities which may also arise. The plan sets out a number of actions which will address the effects of Brexit in particular. For example, a specific piece of research will be commissioned on the impact of Brexit on rural areas, particularly rural areas in the Border region. InterTradeIreland will also fund the development of a programme of initiatives to increase the awareness and capacity of SMEs to deal with the practical consequences of Brexit for cross-Border trade. I am confident that my Department’s preparations for Brexit are comprehensive and will assist in ensuring rural communities and businesses are equipped as best as they can be to deal with the issues which will arise. The Irish Government has been preparing for Brexit for a long time - months before the UK actually took that fateful decision last May to leave the European Union. Our concerns and priorities have been well flagged and they are well understood. As we move into the next phase, the finalisation of the EU negotiating guidelines, we will continue to pursue our priorities and ensure they are clear to all EU member states. Entering this phase marks the beginning of a long and complicated process. We will no doubt encounter roadblocks along the way, but it is important we remain calm and patient as the Government continues to seek the best deal for Irish citizens. It is also important we communicate the benefits of our own EU membership. Ireland has benefited exponentially since we joined the EEC in 1972. It is worth specifically mentioning that Irish women have benefited significantly from our EU membership. Let us not forget that it was EU legislation that led to the abolition of the marriage bar for women in public service jobs in 1973. We have also benefited from enhanced workplace legislation, such as measures on equal pay, which I suspect might not have been given priority in the Ireland of the 1970s and 1980s were it not for the EU’s influence. Irish people are broadly supportive of our EU membership, but we should not take that for granted. Misinformation and scaremongering played a large part in the campaign strategy of pro-Brexit parties in the UK; therefore, it is important that we, as elected representatives, impart factual information to the Irish public on the benefits of EU membership. I was pleased, therefore, to see my colleague, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, launch a website today which will publicise the positive impact of European structural and investment funds in Ireland. Over the 2014 to 2020 programming period, EU structural and investment funds will be used, together with Irish Government and local authority funding, to invest €6.2 billion in Ireland. As a Minister from a Border constituency, I have considerable concerns about the impact of Brexit on those communities living close to the Border. Those of us who have lived on or near the Border all our lives know that Border communities have faced more than their fair share of challenges. Brexit presents one of the great challenges to date, but that does not mean it will not also bring opportunities. The Government’s position is clear. We want the closest possible trading relationship with the UK and, in particular, for trade between the North and the South. A key priority is to ensure the continued free flow of trade on the island and the need to avoid a hard border. The British and Irish Governments agree that they do not want to see the imposition of a hard border on the island of Ireland. It is my view that the cross-Border bodies are more important than ever and could provide a framework for post-Brexit relations, North and South. Investment in projects which will benefit both sides of the Border should be given priority by the Irish Government and the Northern Ireland Executive. Through my Department, I am supporting the restoration of the Ulster Canal which criss-crosses the Border from Belturbet in County Cavan, through Northern Ireland and on to Clones. I also believe there is a significant opportunity to develop a specific tourism offering in the Border areas. We need to be innovative and ambitious as we plan for a post-Brexit era in the Border region.
#AndrewDoyle	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-party	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-dob	unknown-#AndrewDoyle-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	376	There has been much speculation on possible scenarios, including ifs, buts, ands and maybes. It is clear that while we have heard a lot of expert opinions, none of us here is an expert. Everyone involved in the negotiation process here, in Britain and across Europe never envisaged having to have a debate along these lines. It was never envisaged all those years ago that Article 50 would ever be invoked. Nonetheless it is the reality we now have to face. In the time allowed, I would like to focus on the sectors for which I am responsible as Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. These include forestry, horticulture, organic products and food, in particular. The agrifood sector faces one of the more acute challenges from Brexit. It is in the eye of the storm, and certain sectors within it are exposed to the potential implications of a negative outcome from the Brexit negotiations. To put our dependence on the UK market in context, in 2016 we exported €4.8 billion worth of agricultural products to the UK, representing about 39% of our total agrifood exports. Our imports came to €3.7 billion, which represented 47% of our total agrifood imports. It is not just about the figures but also about the intricate, ongoing and long-established relationship between both islands, which has made each of us an important trading partner for the other. It is important to note that the British Prime Minister, Theresa May, saw fit to insert in her letter triggering Article 50 a specific paragraph dealing with some of the North-South issues, as well as the UK's relationship with Ireland which dates back many centuries, long before the EU was formed. The areas of forestry and horticulture, for which I have specific responsibility, would be very exposed to a negative result from the Brexit negotiations. They have a particular dependence on the UK market within an EU context. Our priorities ore clear. We wish to have continued unfettered access to the UK market, without tariff, and with minimal additional customs and administrative procedures. In addition, we are asking that the UK market be kept viable for Irish producers by minimising the risk from UK trade agreements with third countries. In the short term, our immediate concerns have centred on the significant drop in the value of sterling against the euro. We have attempted to address these challenges primarily through the measures announced in budget 2017. These include further additional funding for Bord Bia of €3.6 million, a new €150 million low-cost loan scheme, additional agri-taxation measures, and increased funding under the rural development programme and the seafood development programme. The more medium to long-term impacts of Brexit include new trading arrangements and possible tariffs, changes to regulations and standards, Border controls and certification and the related areas of veterinary and health certification. Some of these overlap a number of Departments.To ensure the process works well we have put in place a number of practical steps. These include: establishing a Brexit response committee and a dedicated Brexit unit in the Department; the creation of a stakeholder consultative committee complemented by frequent contact with representative organisations and companies on an ongoing basis; close consultation with State entities, Bord Bia, Bord Iascaigh Mhara and Enterprise Ireland in particular; and the addition of Brexit as a standing item on the agenda of the Food Wise 2025 high level implementation committee. To address some of the comments and observations that have been made, the Minister, Deputy Michael Creed, and I have engaged in meetings with our counterparts in Northern Ireland, the UK and other member states. Since St. Patrick's weekend we have met the German, Dutch, Belgian, Danish, Estonian, Polish, Luxembourg and Austrian Ministers, and today the Minister met the French Minister, to try to build up alliances in the fishing and other sectors so that in the negotiations Ireland's special relationship with the UK as a market is acknowledged.

There is probably a good deal of consensus between Fianna Fáil and the Government on these priorities, but where there will not be consensus is we believe the Government needs to do much more in all three areas. This is our view, it is the view of the public as, according to polling, two thirds of the public believe the Government is clueless on Brexit, and it is the view of many people involved in preparing their companies, their clients or their members for Brexit.

Ireland is a trading nation and we export a lot of goods and services globally. By far the biggest export group is our small and medium-sized companies, and €2 in every €5 of our SME exports go to the UK. For some SME sectors, the figure is much higher. The Department of Finance estimates that a hard Brexit could lead to 40,000 fewer jobs in this country and a drop in trade with the UK of nearly one third. Irish exporters could be looking at the imposition of tariffs. They could be looking at border controls and a divergence in product standards with the UK no longer subject to EU regulations. They could be looking at lower business regulations for UK companies, such as on environmental protections and working conditions. They could be looking at changes to contract enforcement, the rights of their employees to work, changes in data protection, higher costs of funds, bigger currency fluctuations and more. Our fishing industry faces an existential threat, should the UK decide to take back its territorial waters. The agrifood sector faces an existential threat. Beef farmers could be looking at tariffs of more than 50% and having to compete with product from Brazil or Argentina or producers who do not have to deal with EU food safety standards. The list goes on. What has the Government done in response to these threats to farmers, the fishing industry, manufacturing, tourism, retail and 40,000 Irish jobs? The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has a dedicated Brexit unit, which is one principal officer and three additional staff. In the Brexit budget last year, IDA Ireland received total funding for Brexit of less than €1 million and is allowed to hire nine staff. To put this into context, The Guardian has a Brexit unit of nine staff. Bord Bia, tasked with helping the agrifood sector deal with an existential threat, is allowed to hire four staff this year for Brexit. To put this into context, the newly established UK Department for Exiting the European Union employs 335 officials.

They could consider currency hedging to protect against further falls in sterling. They could review supply chains to protect against potential tariffs and other trade barriers They could look at their international pricing to offset falls in sterling since Brexit. They could explore new customer markets and new products, and conduct financial reviews to ensure cashflow is protected from some of the known risks associated with Brexit. Some Irish firms know how to do this and are doing so, but many do not. They need direct assistance, and this means the Government needs to free up resources for Enterprise Ireland and other sectoral agencies in order that they can engage directly with companies. Running regional events and constituency events is not enough. Companies need to be engaged with directly. On Northern Ireland, the Government's activity to date is decidedly mixed, it has to be said. To the Government’s credit, the issues of Northern Ireland have been well flagged diplomatically in Brussels. Government spokespeople were out in force on Friday to proclaim a diplomatic victory when we saw the European Commission's draft negotiating guidelines for Brexit. The guidelines recognise the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland and include the stated aim of avoiding a hard border. They also speak to how the EU should recognise existing bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland. The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, described the result as as good as could have been hoped for. Maybe or maybe not, as to me this suggests a pretty low level of ambition. The existing bilateral agreements between the UK and Ireland should be recognised, but it is important to state the EU guidelines put a caveat on this, which is if they are compatible with EU law. There is broad support for retention of the common travel area, but what about the full reciprocity of rights between the UK and Ireland? What happens when Irish citizens want to work in Northern Ireland and it is no longer possible for French, Spanish or Italian citizens to do so but it is covered by the common travel area? Will it fall foul of EU law? It may or it may not and then there is Gibraltar. Prime Minister Rajoy has obtained a veto on what happens in Gibraltar in terms of its future relationship with the EU. Ireland got warm words. We have had warm words previously. In July 2012, the EU inserted words into a statement on sharing the burden of the bank bailout. The Taoiseach described it as a seismic shift for Ireland and the then Tánaiste told us it was a game changer. However, as we all suspected, those warm words turned out to be empty, meaningless, vacuous words. The population of Gibraltar is 30,000 people. The population of Northern Ireland is 1.8 million. There are 60 times more people living in Northern Ireland than in Gibraltar but where the Irish Government got, admittedly, warm words on Northern Ireland, Spain got a veto. Brexit could be a disaster for Northern Ireland. More than half of its exports are to the EU, and 87% of farm income in the North comes from the Common Agricultural Policy. It will no longer be in the Common Agricultural Policy. A total of 30,000 people cross the Border on a daily basis to work. EU peace funding has delivered €3.5 billion over the past 25 years to the Border regions, North and South. Special status must be afforded to Northern Ireland, as called for and voted through by the House. We should seek ways to include ongoing access for Northern Ireland to the Single Market, EU sectoral programmes and EU peace funding. None of these is being actively pursued as far as we can see. If there is to be a border, we should seek to have it moved off the island of Ireland. This could be done with border controls in Belfast, Derry and Larne. The common travel area must be secured but not just in terms of free movement. The UK and Ireland enjoy full reciprocity of citizens' rights. We can vote in the UK and they can vote here. It is a unique relationship and it must be protected in totality. Simply protecting a common travel area will not be enough. The Government should seek to remove as much uncertainty as possible from these negotiations. This is something it has failed to do. The EU position is the divorce talks must happen first and if Monsieur Barnier's team is satisfied the UK is behaving itself, it will go back to the European Council and seek a second mandate to begin informal trade talks. Then those high-level guidelines will have to be turned into detailed directives and then they can begin talks. That could take a year.Every month that the trade talks are delayed is an additional month of risk and uncertainty for Ireland, Irish companies and Irish jobs. The EU's position is what it is, and we are unambiguously on the side of the EU and will support that position. Before it was locked in, the Government, the Taoiseach and relevant Ministers should have been calling for those negotiations to happen at the same time. They should have been doing so publicly and, to the best of my knowledge, not one of them ever did. I stand to be corrected if that is not true, but personally, I have listened to many statements and I have never heard them say that. Similarly, we must call for an early transition period agreement. To the Taoiseach's credit, he mentioned that in his opening statement yesterday. It is fair to say tensions are high on both sides and they have been escalating. It is simply the case that the UK took a pretty open mandate for Brexit, picked up the Brexit ball and ran towards a hard Brexit. That has not gone down well in Ireland, nor should it. It has not gone down well with our EU member state colleagues. That can be seen reflected in the tone of the EU guidelines. They take a very hard line. It is in everybody's interests, in Ireland's interests, in Europe's interests and in the UK's interests that people step back from the cliff that they are beginning to walk towards. Ireland is a small country in Europe, but we have unique exposure to Brexit. We have a unique relationship with the UK. While we are unambiguously on the side of the EU 27, we can play a role in facilitating as little change as possible and in helping the parties, I hope, to step back from what is currently like a very hard Brexit.
#FinianMcGrath	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-party	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-dob	unknown-#FinianMcGrath-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	388	I am grateful for the opportunity to speak in this urgent and important debate on Brexit. I urge all Deputies to work together in the national interest and to do our best for the people on our island. I stress the words "the island". I have always said a divided Ireland is a weakened Ireland. Everyone needs to accept and listen to common sense arguments in this debate. My recent visit to Antrim, Newry, Derry and Strabane reminded me closely of this, of the relationship on the island and the importance of it, particularly in the area of economic development. That is the strong message that I got from people in the North and the Border counties in recent weeks. While I was there, I visited many disability centres in both Antrim and other places in the North. There was also a message for me there to work very closely with everybody on the island. We are trying to rebuild the economy. It is returning. We can now see the economic situation here. We are beginning to return to good health. Unemployment is down to 6.4% from 15.2%. That is three points below the EU average. It is not all bad news. My recent visit to Scotland also supported that. There was warmth, energy and support for Ireland all over Scotland, particularly in Edinburgh and Glasgow, where I visited many expatriates living there. We need to focus on issues and need to have priorities for this Brexit debate. The first issue for me is protecting the Northern Ireland peace process. We need to protect all the provisions of the Good Friday Agreement. We need to maintain EU support for the peace process. We need to avoid a hard Border on the island and support continued North-South co-operation. We need to minimise the impact on trade and the economy. We need to maintain close trade between Ireland and the UK and the EU and Ireland. We need to minimise the regulatory burden for goods transiting the UK. We need to improve the business environment, make us more competitive, diversify markets and have better infrastructure. We also need to pursue trade and investment opportunities from Brexit. There are opportunities. Of course, we have major concerns. I totally respect the views of my colleagues from all parties who share my concerns. It is important that we clearly outline what we have to do. We have to maintain the common travel area, CTA. We have to commit jointly with the UK to maintain the CTA. We have to confirm rights and benefits under the CTA, secure support of our EU partners and uphold free movement of EU citizens within the European Union. We also have to be optimistic and look to the future. We have to influence the future of the European Union. We need to strengthen existing allies in the European Union and build new ones. We also need to influence future direction of the European Union and many of us have concerns about the direction of the European Union in recent years. That is something that we should challenge. I emphasise that all Deputies should challenge it. I would like to see a European Union built on equality and social justice and less militarisation throughout the European Union. That is our view and that should be our policy for building and developing Ireland's independent, neutral foreign policy, which can have major benefits and effects on conflicts throughout the world. We need to promote better awareness of the EU role, values and achievements and we need to maintain strong Ireland-UK and EU-UK relations. These are all very important issues to deal with in this Brexit debate. Many people are being critical about the role of the Government. I totally reject that. Brexit has been on our radar since before the vote last June and we have been planning accordingly. We need to analyse and prioritise. Deep analysis has been conducted across all areas by the Brexit teams across Departments. Risk and mitigation measures were identified. Opportunities were identified and pursued. Everybody should be a Brexit ambassador. Every Minister and politician in Dáil Éireann should take that role. We undertook the all-Ireland dialogue for consultation. There were 16 events in four months. Over 1,200 delegates representing industries and organisations from across the country attended. We also had, separately in the dialogue process, nearly 200 separate meetings with industry and civic society to deepen and expand our analysis and research. This was the message that I got from a cross-community group that I met in Antrim town during my recent visit to Antrim. Those people were very fearful of Brexit, including both small businesses and farmers throughout the North. That is a message that they asked me to bring back to Dáil Éireann. They were from right across the political spectrum and different religious and political divides. The message was that they are very concerned, particularly since they voted to stay in the European Union. The Government held over 390 meetings with the remaining European countries and institutions as part of the programme for engagement. It has been a huge diplomatic effort with officials flying out to key capitals and hosting delegations here in Ireland for sectoral discussions to ensure that our unique concerns are well-understood. In addition, the 80 Irish embassies all around the world, especially our permanent representation in Brussels, are also making the case for Ireland's specific issues with Brexit. The work is ongoing. I challenge those who say the opposite. There have been good opportunities to discuss it. We had a good opportunity to discuss Brexit with London and with Edinburgh and as I said I was in Edinburgh spreading that message. I was in Glasgow, spreading that message. I was in the Scottish Parliament meeting Ministers and spreading that message. My colleagues were in Cardiff and Belfast, using long-established connections from the Good Friday Agreement, while clearly respecting the "no negotiation without notification" principle. Structures and resources are in place. All Departments and agencies have been charged with making Brexit a priority. There is strong co-ordination at key levels right across government. Every Minister is on the same message. What are our priorities? We have to have priorities. First, we have to minimise the impact on trade and the economy. Protecting the Northern peace process is a very important issue. Support from the European Union is very important. Support from ourselves is equally important and we have to build on this and build on diversification. We also have to maintain the common travel area. Influencing the future of the European Union is another of the priorities of the Government. It is important that we stand up and speak up for our own country and that we accept, say and celebrate Ireland's contribution to the wider world and the positive impact that the wider world has had and continues to have on Ireland.When one looks at the details and the facts, Ireland has experienced continued solid economic growth, with 3.5% real GDP growth forecast in 2017. Economic activity is broadly based and we now have more that 2 million people at work, the highest level since 2008. Ireland is a committed member of the European Union and the eurozone. It has prepared to meet the challenge of Brexit, which I emphasise is our duty. In a world facing complexity and uncertainty Ireland remains a stable, competitive and secure place with a well educated and productive workforce and a reputation for excelling in research and creative discovery.  As regards the peace process and the situation in the North, the principles of partnership, equality and mutual respect and the goal of reconciliation are shared objectives. These are at the core of the Good Friday Agreement and must be upheld by all parties involved in the political process in the North. The Government will continue to engage fully with the British Government and all political parties in the North in order that devolved institutions will be fully established at the earliest opportunity following the election.  A number of my colleagues referred to Ireland as a small country. In 2020 it will be seeking election to the United Nations Security Council. Our candidature reflects Ireland's continuing engagement on issues of international importance. The United Nations is central to our foreign policy and commitment to promoting our values of freedom, democracy, tolerance, community and solidarity and respect for others,

I am glad to be able to speak to the report carried out by the EU committee. With a Chairman like the one it has, we would expect to receive a good report. Among the ideas discussed in it is a requirement that Ireland seek to maintain strong connections through its permanent representatives with the various EU committees and structures. There is also a sense that we must face certain facts, namely, that while Brexit is a hugely significant event for us and the United Kingdom, the work of the European Union will continue as normal and we expect it to continue with reference to Ireland. I am not sure if this is just common sense or something about which we need to be worried. To my mind, the nature of the European Union and how it is organised and what it is about have been thrown into question following the decision by the United Kingdom to leave. That is a discussion that cannot be left to one side. Of course, there is still the day-to-day running of events, but I wonder if the seismic nature of Brexit has really sunk in and if the EU elite really thinks it can adopt a business as usual approach. The issues discussed at the round table meeting included how Brexit was going to impact on farming and enterprise and industry in this state. Banking was also discussed, but the European Union never listened to us on any issue about which we were worried in banking. It promised us during the bailout that it would not be found wanting but, my God, it was. It was absent in paddling its own canoe.  I have spoken previously about all of these topics and the European dimension. Given that I have limited time, I will confine my remarks to highlighting just how important the UK market is in sectors of strategic importance for Irish farmers and why we need to get this right in achieving solid outcomes in the negotiations.  At 65% self-sufficiency, the United Kingdom is a net importer of beef. Ireland is its main supplier, accounting for almost 70% of UK beef imports. I know that the Aire Stáit will understand this, being a farming man. I am not saying the Ministers, Deputies Michael Noonan and Heather Humphreys, do not understand it, but the United Kingdom is the market for 50% of Irish beef exports, with a further 45% going to other EU markets. Overall, a reduction in the level of access to the UK market would have a very negative impact on the Irish beef sector and potentially the overall EU beef market. The capacity of the EU beef market to absorb increased imports is low. Irish beef exports of 270,000 tonnes to the United Kingdom represent almost 10% of the intra-EU beef trade figures. The displacement of these exports will, therefore, have a destabilising effect on the overall EU market.  In 2016, 34% of Ireland’s dairy exports went to the United Kingdom, representing 53% of cheese exports, 29% of butter exports and 12% of skimmed milk powder exports. The volume of exports of cheddar cheese was 78,000 tonnes, representing 82% of the cheddar imported by the United Kingdom in 2016. Retention of tariff-free access to the UK market is critically important, particularly for Irish cheddar cheese exports. Overall, the loss of or restricted access to the UK market could have a destabilising impact on the overall value of the Irish dairy sector. We cannot emphasise this point enough.  Ireland exported 13,000 tonnes of sheepmeat to the United Kingdom in 2016. Almost 90% of UK lamb imports come from outside the European Union, from New Zealand and Australia, while the United Kingdom predominantly exports to four EU member states, with France accounting for 50%. The key issues for the sheep sector will be the decisions taken on the division of the large EU tariff rate quotas for New Zealand lamb. Any displacement of New Zealand Iamb imports to the UK market could have a negative impact on the overall value of the EU lamb market.  There is significant bilateral trade between Ireland and the United Kingdom in pigmeat and poultry products. The Minister, Deputy Heather Humphreys, above all should be aware of this, especially given the impact in Border counties. It has been built over many years. The disruption to existing trade flows caused by tariff barriers or other increases in costs would reduce the overall value of these markets. In addition, the continuation of cross-Border trade in pigs for processing is critical, reflecting the overall processing capacity of the sector on the island of Ireland.  In the tillage sector, as the Aire Stáit knows, Ireland is a net importer of grains. The geographical closeness to Northern Ireland results in some grain farmers exporting their product there rather than selling to more distant parts of Ireland. Why would they not? The imposition of tariffs on UK imports would potentially result in a re-sourcing of imports from elsewhere in the European Union, resulting in increased transport costs. On import costs, the exit of the United Kingdom from the European Union presents a significant threat of increased costs and reduced availability of plant protection products to ensure animal health.  We all know what has happened in the mushroom sector and I am more acutely aware of it than anybody else. The UK accounts for 90% of the value of Irish mushroom exports or over €80 million. Barriers to trade through tariffs or other additional costs would significantly undermine the sector which is struggling already because of the fall in value of sterling.  The forestry sector has a high reliance on the UK market and experienced major growth in exports to the United Kingdom in recent years, doubling its UK market share for sawn softwood timber since 2007, while 65% of panel products produced in Ireland are exported to the United Kingdom. I am acutely aware of this because of the location of Medite in Clonmel and the other plant in Waterford which depend totally on those exports. This may have dire consequences if we are not proactive. It is time to listen to the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who has been on trips to Belfast and parts of Wales and elsewhere. I do not know, however, if he is really in touch with what is going on. The excitement of being in the Cabinet as a super junior Minister has not yet left him and, as far as I can see, he is in a trance. He thinks all is well because he can come into the Dáil Chamber and use some empty rhetoric. I was used to him sitting on this side of the House when the shoe was on the other foot.  The year 2012 was very telling for us. The Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, came back and proclaimed that our EU gods were going to support us in the bailout and that they were our friends.We are still waiting for them to support us. They use us as patsies to bail out the European banks. The Minister was not Minister for Finance at the time but he supported the bailout as did I, to my everlasting sorrow. We were sold a pup and told naked untruths. The European banks shovelled money in here when the banks ran out of it, having trailed recklessly. Not only were the bondholders bailed out by the vote, they had insurance policies that were drawn down. We were the laughing stock of Europe and the world. The EU does not mind securing Gibraltar for Spain but what have we got? For all the visits of the Taoiseach, the Minister for Finance and all other Ministers, what have we got in tangible benefits for our little country? Nothing. We have only received pious platitudes, and dúirt bean liom go ndúirt bean léi. We would be a long time waiting for the bag and we could shake it forever without getting three farthings. They do not care. The British people are entitled to their own destiny but Northern Ireland must be protected. The Border cannot be in Monaghan, Armagh or Aughnacloy and must be pushed back to the ocean. Ireland is an island off the west coast of Europe and we all learned at school that we were surrounded by water. It is now more important than ever that the water is our boundary and if the British want tariffs they should have them there, along with the checkpoints and the trade and customs posts. They should not divide the Six Counties from Ulster's other three counties as we have too many memories of what went on there. We have too many memories of smuggling and other issues which are still happening as a legacy of the past. It is imperative we do not have our Border in Aughnacloy, south Armagh or Monaghan, areas of which I have an intimate knowledge. We must have control of our own destiny and if the European gods will not help us out other countries might also exit. They have been found out for being selfish, unforgiving and unhelpful to smaller countries such as ours.

#CatherineMurphy	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-party	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-dob	unknown-#CatherineMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	393	I welcome the opportunity to speak in this debate following the triggering of Article 50. In recent weeks there has been far too much emphasis on who should attend the negotiations on our behalf. It suggests a reliance on personal relationships to achieve the desired results, but what exactly are the desired results, or set of results? It is not at all clear. The same personal relationships were much in evidence before the general election of 2011, when the same "close relationships" arguments were advanced. However, the crisis was largely handled, or mishandled, by the intergovernmental approach of France and Germany. Nation states acted in their own interests and not as a collective. The peripheral countries paid a very heavy price and we have to learn a lesson from that. We have to know what we want and cannot rely on that approach. We have a unique set of circumstances because of the Good Friday Agreement, which was possible because of our joint membership of the EU and was underwritten by the EU. We need to develop a shared ownership of what we want out of the negotiations, and not allow something to be done behind the scenes by a cross-departmental group and imposed on us. I am not saying that it is unimportant that cross-departmental groups work hard on Brexit but it is simply not enough for this to be where the focus is. How we approach Brexit in the context of Ireland and Northern Ireland is critical and it has been identified in the draft guidelines. No one wants a return to a hard border but there is a sizeable circle to be squared in the context of how that is achieved if the UK leaves the customs union and wants to control its own borders. The 10% of Northern Ireland exports that flow to the Republic account for €3.5 billion but just as important is the normalisation of the trading relationship that connects the two parts of our island in more than the economic sphere. The post-conflict opportunities should be paying dividends but Brexit will set them back, possibly for years. Point 22 in the guidelines states that no agreement between the EU and the United Kingdom may apply to the territory of Gibraltar without the agreement between the Kingdom of Spain and the United Kingdom. This is much more definitive than what is stated in point 11 as it gives a veto, whereas point 11, while welcome, appears to rely on goodwill. Language is really important because, without absolutes, one tends to have something one cannot rely on. The guideline also states:The Union has consistently supported the goal of peace and reconciliation enshrined in the Good Friday Agreement, and continuing to support and protect the achievements, benefits and commitments of the Peace Process will remain of paramount importance. In view of the unique circumstances on the island of Ireland, flexible and imaginative solutions will be required [that states nothing concrete], including with the aim of avoiding a hard border, while respecting the integrity of the Union legal order. In this context, the Union should also recognise existing bilateral agreements and arrangements between the United Kingdom and Ireland which are compatible with EU law.What if they are not compatible with EU law? There are many ifs, buts and maybes embedded in that and while it is welcome that the reference is included, it is not a hard commitment in the same way as for Gibraltar, where nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. On trade, when triggering Article 50 the British Government sought to put in place a parallel trade deal. Article 18 of the draft guidelines states: The British government has indicated that it will not seek to remain in the single market, but would like to pursue an ambitious free trade agreement with the European Union. Based on the Union's interests, the European Council stands ready to initiate work towards such an agreement, to be finalised and concluded once the United Kingdom is no longer a Member State.For the next 18 months or two years, all attention will be paid to the divorce and it is only after that is finalised that the trade deal will be considered. It seems that there is the potential to identify a crisis for countries like Ireland that rely heavily on the UK for trade unless transition arrangements at least are put in place. In Ireland’s case, 20% of our trade is done with Britain. The agrifood sector accounts for 41% of trade with the UK and the SME sectors would be particularly badly affected, with 192,000 jobs and a very good regional spread at risk, or partly at risk. We need to address a transition arrangement now, not in 18 months’ time, in addition to the work being done to identify alternative markets. Did we agree to postponing a trade deal until after the negotiations conclude? If we did not have an input into that, was it done for us and was it done with our agreement? The European Union will position itself for negotiations but we could fall badly foul of that. Trade deals take time to negotiate, sometimes years, and we will not be free to negotiate a trade deal with the UK other than as one of 27 member states. We need to know what our desired outcome is and how any interim arrangements will be handled and, just as importantly, supported.The UK is not without clout and we could see a return to the individual nation states ensuring their interests are protected. These are nation states that have much bigger interests than ours. For example, the UK accounts for approximately 16% of the European Union's GDP. The German car industry relies quite heavily on the UK. We need to be very hard line on our desired outcomes. The third point I want to emphasise is the need to reimagine a different kind of Europe. We hear constant references to the European project. It is not at all clear what the project was or is post the economic crash. While we are utterly focused on Brexit because it disproportionately impacts on us, Europe will change and change is not always good. Jürgen Habermas, a respected German philosopher, wrote a long essay, the English name of which is On Europe's Constitution. In it he describes how the essence of our democracy has changed under the pressure of the crisis and the frenzy of the markets. Habermas maintains that power has slipped from the hands of the people and shifted to bodies of questionable democratic legitimacy. He suggests that technocrats have long since staged a quiet coup d'état. Newton's third law states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. We are seeing that reaction post crash now. We cannot ignore the need to consider the type of Union to which we want to belong. Understanding why people supported Brexit or those who are supporting Marine Le Pen and others like her cannot be ignored. To quote Habermas:Like all symptoms, this feeling of the loss of control has a real core - the hollowing out of national democracies that, until now, had given citizens the right to co-determine important conditions of their social existence. The UK referendum provides vivid evidence about the keyword "post-democracy". Obviously, the infrastructure without which there can be no sound public sphere and party competition has crumbled.Europe needs to rebuild socially, economically and politically if it is to have democratic legitimacy. The alienation of European citizens means that politics is catching up. Europe has been rebuilt previously, with the London debt agreement a great example. We need to be ambitious and seek things that will help to rebuild. For example, we need to talk about the need for resources to free up the possibility of investing in capital projects such as housing and transport, and making us more efficient. We need a national effort and not quiet diplomacy. We need to use all of our resources across the spectrum of business and politics. Citizens need to find ways of coming together on this. We need a national approach rather than just being kept up to date with changes and negotiations as they go along.
#MichaelNoonan	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-party	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-dob	unknown-#MichaelNoonan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	394	Every Member of this House will agree that Brexit presents major challenges for Ireland given the potential implications for the economy and trade, the Northern Ireland peace process, the maintenance of the common travel area and the future of the European Union. These are the Government's priorities and we have been preparing solidly to defend them over a long time. Our preparation to date includes extensive analytical work carried out before the UK referendum, and intensified analysis and scenario planning carried out across all key sectors since the referendum. This is coupled with extensive stakeholder consultation and engagement to ensure Ireland's concerns are well understood. In this context, we are pleased that the draft Brexit Article 50 negotiating guidelines circulated by President Tusk last week include a very strong acknowledgement of Ireland's unique circumstances, the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements with the UK such as the common travel area. We will, of course, study the draft guidelines carefully in terms of the overall approach to the negotiations and the many other issues that arise beyond those that are unique to Ireland. We are ready for the negotiations. We will negotiate firmly and fairly as one of 27. The Government is under no illusion about the nature and scale of the Brexit challenge. We know that because of our close economic ties, any negative impact on the UK economy in the medium term could have potential implications for the Irish economy. However, economically and administratively Ireland will be ready for optimal engagement in this process. Ireland will be seeking a positive, constructive and orderly outcome. The Government will continue to engage in the best interests of the country and all citizens. Before turning to examine the economic issues on the Brexit negotiation, let me reiterate Ireland's commitment to the European Union. As a member since 1973, we have benefited enormously from our membership and the Government believes our future prosperity and well-being lies with continued membership of the EU. Let us not forget what the economy was like prior to 1973. Our EU membership has been central to the success of our open, trading and competitive economy. Access to the Single Market has allowed a small open economy like Ireland to prosper. It has been central to our twin strategies of attracting inward investment and helping Irish-owned companies to diversify their markets. Moreover, European Union membership has given us full access to EU trade agreements with other major markets and a capacity to engage in global free trade that we could not possibly have on our own. There is no doubt, however, that Brexit represents a serious and direct threat to our economic prosperity. Overall, the Irish economy remains highly reliant on the UK. As a trade partner, the UK accounts for approximately 16% of exports. Given the close economic links between Ireland and the UK, any negative development in the UK economy in the short to medium term is likely to have a spillover effect on the Irish economy. The potential impacts are profound right across the economy. That is why a key priority in the forthcoming Brexit negotiations is to minimise the impact on trade and the economy. We have a two-pronged approach in place to respond to the profound challenge of the UK's departure: to negotiate hard for the best possible outcome in the negotiations, and to continue intensive work to make the economy resilient and future proofed. We will work, as one of 27, to secure the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the European Union and United Kingdom, and to prepare the economy to cope with the turbulence of coming years and the structural shift of new realities. Important steps have already been taken to prepare the economy, including the introduction in budget 2017 of tax measures to support Irish enterprises that will be affected, especially agribusiness. The Action Plan for Jobs 2017 has 20 specific actions to respond to Brexit, including diversifying export markets and improving competitiveness. The Government will remain proactive in developing and adapting our policies to ensure Ireland's economy continues to remain competitive in the face of future economic headwinds. A key element will be to continue to manage our economy and the public finances prudently to enable us to meet future challenges. In budget 2017, the Government announced the decision to establish a rainy day fund, starting in 2019 once we have achieved a balanced budget in 2018. This will both be a counter-cyclical measure to avoid overheating and also enable us to deal with the initial effects of any shock that may occur. The Government has also decided to set a new domestic target of a debt-GDP ratio of 45% to be reached by the mid-2020s, or thereafter, depending on economic growth. This target takes account of the particular risks that Ireland, as a small and very open economy, faces. In recent years, Ireland has laid the foundations for a solid and sustained economic recovery. Indicators such as consumer spending and labour market developments are consistent with an economy that is maintaining momentum. We are confident that the economy is resilient and that appropriate fiscal policies are in place to help us to adjust to the economic effects of the UK's negotiated withdrawal from the European Union. While Brexit will pose undoubted challenges to the Irish economy, there will be some opportunities and the Government will work to maximise those where possible. Following Brexit, we will be the only country in the EU that is an English speaking common law jurisdiction. We have a young and well educated population and the Government will work to continue a business friendly environment here for large and small businesses. We have ensured additional resourcing of Enterprise Ireland and IDA Ireland to help retain, attract and develop businesses within Ireland and to help Irish businesses export to new markets. In terms of sectoral opportunities, the continued successful development of the international financial services sector in Ireland is a priority for the Government. The appointment of Deputy Eoghan Murphy as Minister of State with special responsibility for financial services highlights the importance the Government continues to place on the continued development of the sector, especially in the new context of Brexit. Brexit will provide an opportunity as companies will of necessity need to seek new access points to the European Union. We are ready to facilitate those needs and are actively seeking to maximise those opportunities. A key component of a successful and attractive jurisdiction for the location of financial services activities is a strong and independent regulator with international credibility. The Central Bank of Ireland is committed to delivering high quality and effective financial regulation and supervision to achieve its mandate of safeguarding financial stability and protecting consumers. The Central Bank has a strong commitment to transparency and clarity in respect of its authorisation process, ensuring all applicants have a clear idea of what is expected. The Central Bank is already engaging with a significant number of firms across all sectors and has the resources, including dedicated professional teams, in place to cater for the demand. Turning to the Article 50 negotiations, as outlined previously the Government will defend our national interests and priorities fully within the established negotiation framework in order to ensure the best possible economic outcome. For Ireland, that continues to mean the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the UK and the European Union. As the Taoiseach has stated, that close relationship is in the interests not only of Ireland but of our fellow EU member states. Given the complexity of the issues involved, it is likely that the negotiations on the future relationship agreement will take longer than two years. We therefore believe a transitional arrangement between the exit agreement and the future relationship agreement is vitally important to ensure an orderly exit and to provide certainty for citizens and businesses. Ireland will be on the EU 27 side of the table when the negotiations begin and we will continue to work with other Member States to ensure that they fully understand and address the nature and scale of the particular challenges facing Ireland. Domestically, we will continue to monitor the economic impacts closely and to frame budgetary policy in the context of the challenges of Brexit. I reiterate that the Irish economy remains resilient. Government actions in recent years have laid the foundations for a solid and sustained economic recovery. The Government has put structures and resources in place to ensure that deep analysis is conducted across all sectors, with all Departments and agencies charged with making Brexit a priority. The challenges that we face as a result of Brexit is main-streamed across my Department and we have co-ordination happening at key levels across government. Ireland will negotiate from a position of strength, as one of the 27 member states committed to the European Union. We will pursue our national interests and priorities forcefully within the established legal and political framework for the negotiations. We are entering these negotiations, as a member of the EU 27, with the strong view that an agreement can be reached that caters to the needs of all to the greatest possible extent.
#DeclanBreathnach	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-party	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-dob	unknown-#DeclanBreathnach-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	395	I pondered speaking on this historical mistake and thought for a title on my Brexit statement. I decided to call it "Breathnach ag caint faoi Bhreatimeacht". It is rather appropriate that history would record it as such. Wednesday, 29 March 2017, when Article 50 was invoked, will in my view be remembered as May Day for obvious reasons. I believe the time for talk is over. Appropriate action needs to happen immediately, especially on the myriad sectoral issues that have been identified through the Ceann Comhairle's dialogue in the Mansion House, the two civic forums and their break-out groups as well as the need to soften the mitigating circumstances that these sectors have identified as problems. The Government needs to have a national response to Brexit which has not been seen thus far. This is a national event and we are not seeing a national response. I have called the response that is needed the "Fixit Focus". Britain leaving the EU will present unprecedented political, economic and diplomatic challenges to Ireland. Fianna Fáil has been seeking to have a Minister for Brexit appointed. This should be done now and that Minister should remain in place through any future Cabinet reshuffle. I am satisfied that the response from the European Union recognises the Irish-British relationship. The draft EU document contains important reassurances on protecting peace and avoiding elements of a hard border. Today Michel Barnier in his European Commission speech stated:For the borders, particularly in Ireland: as Gabriella Zimmer said, we will work towards arrangements that do not call into question the existing peace process and dialogue, particularly the Good Friday Agreement, whilst being compatible with Union law.The House of Commons Exiting the European Union Committee published its report on the UK Government’s Brexit negotiating objectives this morning. That report also asserts that the UK and Irish economies are deeply integrated with more than £43 billion of annual trade between the UK and the Republic of Ireland. In the event of no UK-EU deal, the UK would revert to trading on WTO terms with the Republic of Ireland. The high tariffs that could be imposed on dairy and agricultural produce as a result would have an extremely serious impact on the agrifood industry on both sides of the Border. I am sure every Deputy in the House knows that 80% of the goods produced by individual firms in the agrifood sector are exported to the UK. We know already that Brexit poses one of the biggest risks to our farming community, exports and agrifood jobs since the foundation of the State. At the end of the separation period in approximately two years’ time, the UK could, for example, impose tariffs which tend to be high for certain foods like dairy and beef. Meat is the food with the highest possible tariff at almost 50%. The UK could equally decouple itself from EU food standards, adding many new regulatory checks, delays and costs. It could remove tariffs from low cost regions such as South America, making it extremely difficult for Irish farmers and producers to compete. It could impose Border controls around Northern Ireland, making it harder, slower and more costly to move products and people from North and South. Others have referred to Bord Bia's estimate that €570 million in trade has already been lost in 2016, with exports to the UK falling by 8%. The Irish Farmers Association has stated that beef farmers' income was down €150 million in 2016. Deputy Mattie McGrath referred to the mushroom industry. It was badly affected, with €7 million in exports and 130 jobs lost. IBEC has estimated that every 1% fall in sterling reduces Irish agrifood exports to the UK by 0.7%. It has also stated the euro climbing to 90p translates to a €700 million drop in Irish exports and potential job losses of 7,500. If parity of the euro and sterling occurs, IBEC has already told us that this could realise a loss of more than 75,000 jobs on this island. The seriousness of any currency fluctuations at this time cannot be understated. The House of Commons report also stated that there is a particular concern in the Republic of Ireland about any return to customs checks at the Border with Northern Ireland because this would provide an opportunity and a focal point for those who wish to disrupt the peace process, not to mention the slowing of logistics and movement. I am happy that this report places a real emphasis on maintaining and building on the considerable progress made as a result of the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement.They are hoping a mutually acceptable solution can be found. Objective 4 in the report is entitled Protecting our strong historic ties with Ireland and maintaining the common travel area. It is evident that the United Kingdom does not want a hard border and wishes to maintain its strong links to Ireland. However, this will be a matter for the other member states of the European Union to decide. Nevertheless, we need a proper, co-ordinated national response. Thus far, Government agencies have hired few new staff to deal with the fall-out. Bord Bia and IDA Ireland have hired a handful of staff to deal with Brexit, which is entirely inadequate. Much more needs to be done. The Government needs to have a strong voice at the negotiating table. We must secure an early agreement on the transition period and engagement in existing and new bilateral discussions. Northern Ireland is the most exposed part of these islands in respect of Brexit, with no leadership to protect its interests. Northern Ireland needs to get its act together and return its power-sharing Government in order that it is in the best position to protect its interests in light of Brexit. As co-guarantors of the Good Friday Agreement, the Irish and British Governments must add greater impetus to reaching a solution to reactivate the Assembly before the deadline of 17 April set by the Secretary of State, Mr. James Brokenshire. EU citizenship is a right protected by international treaties and one we must respect. As my party leader noted last night in his statement on Brexit, 1.8 million people in Northern Ireland will be entitled to claim EU citizenship. This is just one of many urgent issues the British Government appears unwilling to tackle. We need a proper response to the unique position of Northern Ireland and Border regions. This requires creative approaches to cross-Border health care arrangements, tourism, marketing, energy supply and education, to mention only a few areas. Creative joined-up thinking is required on how to solve Border related problems. We know a hard Border would be repulsive to everyone on both sides of the Brexit campaign. The Border leaks at multiple points, as it did even in times of old. There are 38 Border crossings in my home county of Louth. It is important to note there are more crossings between North and South in this country than there are crossing points in parts of eastern Europe along the length of the European Union's boundary. We need to be careful about the potential for goods and illegal immigrants crossing the Border. As I have asked on numerous occasions, if the UK is no longer subject to EU food standards, what would stop cheap US hormone saturated beef imported into the UK, which contravenes EU health standards, being smuggled into the South? Such a scenario would not be in anyone's interest. It would damage the integrity of our excellent food standards and reputation and question our integrity regarding our green food supply to our valued markets. It is evident that the challenge to peace and prosperity will have to be addressed and the period of negotiation ahead will define the future, North and South, for generations to come. While it will not be easy to come up with solutions, Prime Minister Theresa May’s priorities appear to be elsewhere and everywhere. She has not shown any real willingness to deal with the economic and social problems which confront us. She has been trying to sit on two stools. Ní féidir do thóin a bheidh i ngach áit. In fact, she is using Ireland's negotiating skills with Europe while continuing to play high poker stakes with both islands' economies in an effort to create chinks in the united European Union arrangement. There are, however, good omens for a hybrid solution according to an article in the Belfast Telegraph today. I hope solutions can be found in a collaborative fashion, with a recognition that we all must survive in an all-Ireland, east-west and North-South economy.
#MauriceQuinlivan	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-party	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-dob	unknown-#MauriceQuinlivan-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	396	I agree with Deputy Breathnach's point that we are taking part in what is unfortunately an historic debate. The context is the triggering one week ago of Article 50, setting off two years of negotiations for Brexit. In this short period, the Government managed to get off to the worst possible start, being left red-faced by Spain securing a veto over the future of Gibraltar. Sinn Féin has been advocating since the Brexit referendum in June 2016 that the Government call for a special status designation for the North. This would not only substantially benefit North and South but would also address the serious concerns people have about the return of a hard border. Today, we again call on the Government to get its act together and put the interests of citizens, North and South first. Sitting on the sidelines in anticipation that Europe will secure a good deal for Ireland and protect our interests is not good enough. We must be more upfront in our demands and requirements. In February, we saw the Taoiseach advocating for the future needs of a united Ireland in Europe, which was a very welcome change. However, the immediate need is for special status for the North and this should be at the forefront of negotiations. Ireland is a special case in the European Union; it is unique. Our position is different from that of every other member state. In 2014, InterTradeIreland estimated that North-South trade amounted to more than €3 billion. IBEC estimates that 35,000 people cross the Border every day, the vast majority of whom commute to work. Thousands of students travel across the Border in each direction to study, and small and medium enterprises in Border communities depend on customers from both sides of the Border to keep them in business. While it is welcome that none of the parties to the negotiations wants a return to a hard border, unfortunately this objective is not realistic. No one is fooled by the mantra of using technology and flexible means to maintain the free flow of people and goods, North and South. It is ridiculous to believe we can maintain this position if one jurisdiction has totally different immigration and tariff rules from the other. This line fools no one, except perhaps the Government. In February, the Dáil passed a motion on special status for the North. The motion demanded that the Government seek the designation of special status for the North in the European Union in the Brexit negotiations. It received welcome support from the Fianna Fáil Party which must be backed up. Given that this minority Government depends on Fianna Fáil support, it has the power to enforce the position set out in the motion passed by the House. In March, the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation published a report entitled, The Likely Economic Impact of Brexit with Particular Emphasis on Jobs and Enterprise, which included the recommendation that as "part of the Brexit negotiations, it is essential to argue the case for designated special status for the North within the European Union". This, the report states, includes protection of the peace process and protection and full implementation of the Good Friday Agreement and subsequent agreements; access to the EU Single Market; retention of access to all EU funding streams; continued participation in the common travel area; maintenance of access to EU institutions, including the European Court of Justice, the European Court of Human Rights and EU sectoral agreements; protection of access to EU rights pertaining to employment, social security and health care; and protection of the right of Northern Irish citizens as Irish and, therefore, EU citizens and all rights pertaining thereto. Only today, the European Parliament voted to "recognise the unique and special circumstances confronting the island of Ireland ... ensure continuity and stability of the Northern Ireland peace process and avoid the re-establishment of a hard border". There is no reason the Government should not campaign for special status for the North. It is the closest equivalent to the current status quo and would leave the door open for the North to be reunified more easily with the South in future. The Taoiseach must tell us why he is opposed to a special status designation for the North. Will he explain the reason Ireland does not have rights similar to those secured by Spain last week? Did we ask for these rights and, if so, was our request refused or were we afraid to speak up and outline our demands? What is the Taoiseach's plan? It is not fair to citizens to be left waiting to hear what future awaits the country. This is not only a call on the Government to do more. Fianna Fáil, the so-called republican party, is propping up this minority Government. It could, if it wished, insist the Government take a harder approach to negotiations around Brexit and set out its position on a special status designation for the North. The way of life on this island has been hard fought for and demands absolute defence in these negotiations. Both Fine Gael and Fianna Fáil need to get their priorities in order. They must stand up for the rights of citizens, North and South, and ensure our support for any Brexit deal will be conditional on a special status designation for the North. The Dáil has clearly spoken on this issue and it is time for this minority Government to act on what this House has said.

All Members will agree that Brexit presents the biggest threat to the Good Friday Agreement and to the social and economic future of the people of this island. In the education sector, for instance, we are facing significant issues in respect of funding for research projects under EU programmes, the prospect of students being charged international fees to study in their own country and restricted access for pupils travelling to schools in Border counties. Educational institutions have been plunged into uncertainty and long established traditions and cross-Border co-operation are jeopardised as we are threatened with a hard border running through this small island, yet the Government is asleep at the wheel. The British Government has ignored the democratic wishes of the people of the North. It is quite happy to drag them out of the EU, despite the devastating consequences it will have for all the citizens of this island. Special designated status for the North within the EU has the majority political support of parties in the Oireachtas, yet the Taoiseach refuses to accept this position or take any action to promote it. This should be contrasted with the veto the Spanish Government has been granted in respect of the future of Gibraltar. It has been afforded a veto in the draft Council guidelines over any future exit agreement concerning Gibraltar. Logically, such an option must also be available to us and the question on everyone's mind is has the Government even sought such a veto. If not, why not? If it has, what are the grounds for us being treated differently from Spain, given we are an EU member state? I fear, as we have witnessed during countless other episodes, that our Government has failed once again to defend the best interests of the country on the international stage. The Fine Gael Party is more concerned with the petty political squabble over its leadership than with the future of our country. Citizens do not care whether Simon or Leo claims the dubious honour of leading the party; they care about the future of their children on this island. The Government has failed its first big Brexit test. Even the European Parliament has been more successful in fighting for Ireland’s interests than our Government, which says it all. The bitter truth is that previous Governments who sat in this Chamber abandoned the people of the North throughout the decades and allowed the British Government to wreak havoc on part of our island. That is inexcusable and unforgivable. However, now is the time to put an end to the prospect of the British Government wreaking even more havoc on our island. All 32 counties need to move forward and we must uphold the democratic wishes of the people of the Six Counties. The resolution adopted by the European Parliament acknowledges that a majority of people in the North voted to remain in the EU and that must be respected. It states the position and interests of Ireland need to be represented in negotiations, recognising that Brexit will have significant ramifications for our country. The resolution expresses special concern about the impact of Brexit on the North and demands that the Good Friday Agreement be protected in all its aspects. The Government seems to have forgotten that it is a co-guarantor of the Agreement. Now is the time to remember that and stand up for the interests of all the people of this island.

Those words were written by an adviser to a former President of the European Commission prior to Brexit and elections in other parts of the world that have been cause for such reflection in Ireland and elsewhere. They reflect that the order in which our country is located is now slowly changing and shifting. The nature and form of the EU is shifting and the nature and form of political debates in other parts of the world is beginning to change as well. This fundamentally matters to Ireland because we are an open trading economy. We import and export twice the value of our national income each year. These kind of changes for economic and political reasons have such a profound effect on Ireland. Deputy Breathnach accurately outlined the different challenges this will pose for different parts of our island and different sectors of the economy. This is a crucial area in which the Government will now have to continue its engagement in light of what we have achieved in the European mandate. The Sinn Féin Deputies raised a question about the status of Gibraltar and I ask it two questions in return. Can they explain to me how that would be consistent with the Good Friday Agreement? How would the reaction this issue has prompted in the UK and Spain be helpful if it was replicated on this island? For a party that pretends to be such custodians of the Good Friday Agreement, I would like an explanation at some point in the future as to how the deployment of such a mechanism would be in the spirit of the Agreement. Given the consequences it is having in the political debate in England and Spain, how do Sinn Féin Deputies think that would be helpful for the security of this island? For Deputy Nolan to stand here and claim successive Governments have abandoned the North and have not tried to help-----

#PaschalDonohoe	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-party	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-dob	unknown-#PaschalDonohoe-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	400	The track record of successive Governments from many parties, excluding the Deputy's party, has been to play a leadership role successfully in dealing with the challenges in the North and to try to create an environment in which the peace process can prosper. It is such a pity that the spirit and tone we hear from Sinn Féin in the North regarding the role the Government is playing in trying to secure the interests of Northern Ireland could not even be mirrored minutely here as we are subject to the divisive tone of Sinn Féin Members in this Chamber continuously regarding the challenges facing this island. The challenges are great but there will be opportunities. However, our country has shown itself capable of responding to similar challenges in the past such as when we decided to move away from a protectionist approach to running the economy to one that embraced the outside world. We faced the same challenges when the country decided to enter the Single Market and to enter the euro when the British Government decided not to do the same. The approach that was used then and the broad change that happened in our economy and in our society to ready the country for the challenge will be needed again. What the Government is doing and the actions it has taken can be broken into two categories. The first is what we need to do externally. Many speakers pointed to the statements made by Prime Minister May, the draft mandate that has been laid out by the European Council and the debate in the European Parliament. Does the House think these are happening by chance? They are happening because the Government and our ambassadors are out there putting the Irish case forward. The Council in its draft mandate made reference to Ireland and its needs because of the efforts of the Government and some other Members of the House. This happened because we have a Taoiseach and a Government that have engaged with an entity that Sinn Féin has been against for 40 years to try to ensure the country and this island are recognised in the new environment into which we are moving. The second category is the need to develop different and new allies. The British Government on many occasions has been most closely aligned to Ireland on issues it has raised. We will have to develop further alliances depending on the policy area in which we are looking to advance our interests. The issue regarding the North, over which no party has a monopoly, is at the heart of our national interest.As Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, I have been directly responsible for the status of European funding programmes on both sides of the Border. In the immediate aftermath of the Brexit result, the Government secured a framework within the European Union to ensure current commitments are met and that they are funded to offer clarity on them up to 2020. What we are now going to do is begin the work within the European Union of looking to succeed and deliver replacement programmes based on work that happens elsewhere and outside of the European Union. Here at home, as the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, has outlined, the challenges and needs are great. For all of the deep challenges we face now, it is irrefutable that we would be in an even more challenging place to deal with them if we could still not borrow to fund public services and unemployment was increasing. That neither is happening at least offers a platform upon which we can build. The need for diversification, as outlined by Deputy Breathnach, is great. We will have to make choices and decisions regarding how we support industries and sectors and parts of the country that will need further supports in the future. The scale of those challenges will be far bigger than anything we face in the current debate on water. We need to put those kinds of challenges into context because they are approaching the country and the economy and we will need to respond. This is a challenge and a change that Irish companies have already responded to in the past. We should look at the success of a company such as Glanbia and how it has gone ahead with a diversification programme. We should look at companies such as Cement Roadstone and some of our retailers and the way they have diversified abroad. It is a model and a challenge that our country has responded to in the past. We will need to do that again. We cannot be under any doubt, which few speakers are, regarding the scale of that challenge and the scale of the turbulence and volatility that is abroad. The order we have taken for granted in the past may not be there in the future. It is by no means certain that the generations that follow us will have the kinds of political freedoms that we have been privileged enough to experience. The political institutions that we have assumed to be stable may now be experiencing a challenge, the scale of which is only apparent to us now. All of us in the House, who care about and want to see a form of centrist politics work, need to be aware and acknowledge the scale of the challenge, which most Members of the House do. I will end where I began with the writer I referred to a moment ago. He concluded in his book, "When a storm becomes too fierce and the wind blows your boat towards the open sea, it is sometimes better to have a good compass than an anchor." From an Irish perspective, we have had a compass. We have had the compass of being members of the European Union, of being firm and successful members of the Single Market, and using the euro as a platform on which Irish companies and Irish farmers can ensure the valuable goods and services they have created can be easily bought and sold by other parts of Europe. It has been clear where we stand in that debate. It has been clear about the fact we have a European future. I want to see one that will encompass all parts of our island. Being clear about that horizon when so much change and volatility is happening elsewhere is the best compass we have for navigating waters that at the moment are volatile but that it is increasingly likely will be stormy in the coming period. The Government and many Members of the House know where we stand in that debate. That kind of steadiness will be essential in the debate and choices to come.
#FionaOLoughlin	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-party	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-dob	unknown-#FionaOLoughlin-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	401	There is no doubt this is a very historic turning point for the country and Europe and the European Union. I am glad to hear the Minister mention Northern Ireland because it seemed to me from previous dialogue that the special circumstances of Northern Ireland had not been appropriately or properly acknowledged. There is no doubt that there needs to be a special status for Northern Ireland and for the Border region that my colleagues represent. We need absolute urgent engagement to address the many serious issues we have with regard to Brexit. These are primarily those that impact on citizens, the economy, Northern Ireland, the common travel area and the future of the European Union. My party is very concerned about the inadequate response of the Government to the many challenges the State faces from Brexit. In the time I have I will refer to two particular areas. As Chairman of the Committee on Education and Skills, I will comment first on the challenges and opportunities that Brexit poses to the education system. The challenges are complex and manifold. On an annual basis, the number of Irish students studying in Britain is between 12,000 and 15,000. They come mainly from four categories. If that number of students choose not to go to the UK because there fees will absolutely go up, it will have a very significant knock-on effect on CAO points, the CAO system and university places here. It will put a lot of strain on universities that are already struggling with capacity. We know from the Cassells report that our third level institutions are underfunded and are already in crisis. They face a huge demographic challenge as it is without including those 12,000 to 15,000 students. The SUSI grant scheme will also be affected. Within the terms of the current scheme, the almost 2,000 students who go from Ireland to the UK or Northern Ireland will not be eligible to carry their grant support with them. When we look at the UK students in Ireland, if a hard Brexit emerges, Irish students could be treated as international students in the UK. The British students coming to Ireland will be classed as non-EU students and will probably be charged non-EU fees. UK students currently represent almost 45% of the EU students in Ireland. This increase in fees could certainly act as a major barrier to those students. There will also be a big impact on Erasmus students coming from Europe, who have traditionally been going to England. That challenges our capacity. The final category it will affect is traineeships. Traineeships are fundamental to many degrees such as aerospace technology, car manufacturing and construction. There could be a reduction in the number of graduates qualified in some of these professions as traineeships decrease. There are certainly some opportunities available as Brexit could provide a useful opportunity to reverse the brain drain we have had. The UK stands to lose most or all of the €1 billion a year it receives in EU research grants. We have to fight hard to get a share of that. There are things we must do. We must improve language skills among workers and students and we need to continue areas of all-Ireland research and innovation excellence. It is really important Brexit does not contaminate the perception of Ireland abroad as welcoming to international researchers and students. I will also mention the effect Brexit will have on the equine industry in Kildare. Kildare is the thoroughbred county and counts for much of this industry; we are, therefore, very worried about the implications of Brexit. The horse racing and breeding industry contributes €2 billion annually to the economy and 28,000 people work directly in the industry and 58,000 indirectly. Many jobs are possibly at risk. Britain is the main market for both flat and national hunt horses. That would be at risk. The two countries have effectively operated as one industry for a number of years and they operate a single stud book. Any barrier to trade flows or the exchange rates could make Irish horses more expensive or result in lower returns in the industry. In particular, the freedom of movement of horses needs to be protected. The existing tripartite agreement between the Republic, the UK and France, allowing racehorses to move freely between the three, may be called into question due to Brexit. It is the same with labour. Breeders on both sides of the Border will have the same issues. The industry needs to be protected from the negative impacts of Brexit and mechanisms need to be put in place to protect this sector.
#PatCasey	unknown-#PatCasey-party	unknown-#PatCasey-dob	unknown-#PatCasey-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	402	Today, the European Parliament heard from the head of the EU negotiation team, Mr. Michel Barnier. It is appropriate that Brexit is being discussed in the directly-elected European Parliament, as well as our Parliament, as the major challenge to our democratic institutions for the coming years. Brexit must mean that we examine the reasons on our side for a narrow decision of the British people to leave the EU. Valid criticisms of the EU have not yet been addressed by the remaining member states. I say this as someone who believes strongly in the EU but notes that its democratic institutions are increasingly seen as distant and irrelevant to the lives of our ordinary citizens. As a businessman, I tend to take a pragmatic approach to decision-making. When a business makes a decision that proves down the road to be mistaken, the only sensible, mature and responsible action is to cut the losses and reverse that decision. I say this because I firmly believe that Ireland and the EU need to construct a negotiating framework that allows the people of the UK to reflect on the massive implications of a simplistic referendum result. Of those who voted, 48% did not want to leave. There are profound and long-lasting negative consequences for the people of the UK that were never sufficiently discussed during the charged and highly-emotive campaign. In fact, the unity of the UK has been put at risk by Brexit. Ireland and the UK have often shared the same criticisms of the EU. The immense amount of European red tape that frustrates businesses, farmers, rural communities, fishermen and all other citizens is but one example of the distance that needs to be bridged between EU institutions and programmes and the ordinary EU citizens. The challenge is to deepen the EU. We must deepen the relationship between each EU citizen and the EU. That is a long-overdue conversation. If the EU addresses some much-needed reforms that bring the Union closer to citizens and the negotiations are conducted by the EU in a forthright and fair manner, I am convinced that there will be a serious and cross-party movement within the UK to rejoin the EU. I say this because of my background in the tourism industry in Wicklow, where I have worked all my life and where visitors from the UK comprise the largest and most important market. I have been serving UK visitors for decades and know that they are pragmatic, common-sense customers. I know from the tourism industry in Wicklow that UK visitor numbers have fallen since the final quarter of 2016 and that the UK as an alternative tourist destination is increasingly becoming more competitive and attractive to our international visitor market, which is another threat to our tourism sector that is hardly ever mentioned in this debate. Tourism is a major industry for Ireland and a key pillar of Wicklow's economic model. Brexit is the greatest threat to Irish tourism since the start of the Northern Troubles in the 1960s. We must face the challenge to tourism with appropriate gravity and evaluate and exploit whatever opportunities may exist. There are thousands of jobs at stake in Wicklow and east Carlow between farming, agribusiness and tourism. Brexit is potentially an economic disaster for those sectors. The Irish Government needs to put together a package of measures with EU buy-in that protects and enhances the economic model in counties such as Wicklow and Carlow. I will conclude by mentioning an industry that rarely gets attention in the debate on Brexit, that is, fishing. Wicklow's fishing industry has not been well served by the EU, to say the least. Brexit probably represents the last opportunity to reset the relationship between the remaining Irish fishing communities and the EU. The decline of the Irish fishing industry is a hidden scandal that has been ignored for too long. We need to use Brexit to reopen the rules pertaining to the fishing fleet, the quota system and access to our own and UK waters. This is a critical moment for Ireland, the EU and the UK. I implore the Government and the EU to reform our own failings, to treat the UK with respect and generosity of spirit and to lay the groundwork for the day when we can celebrate the return of a valued partner.

A whole-of-government approach to Brexit issues is in place. My Department and its agencies are to the forefront of that effort. The UK's decision to leave the EU will impact on all policy fields of my Department and agencies. I have tasked my departmental officials with making Brexit their No. 1 priority. In advance of the referendum, my Department conducted a contingency risk assessment of the potential impacts of Brexit across the relevant policy areas. We have since been refining our analysis and working with agencies to put in place actions to mitigate risks and maximise opportunities. We have also been working with colleagues across the Government to analyse potential sectoral impacts and consider the implications of various scenarios that may emerge as a result of the UK leaving the EU. As the Minister with responsibility for supporting business across all sectors, and in order for me to support those impacted by Brexit in a targeted way, I must fully understand the concerns and needs of business. I have taken every opportunity to hear the opinions of sectors and companies. I have met a wide range of representative organisations, including IBEC, ICTU, ISME, the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, the Small Firms Association, the Irish Exporters Association, American Chamber of Commerce Ireland, the Dublin Chamber of Commerce, the Irish Farmers Association and many more. I hosted a Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation Brexit stakeholder engagement event in Carrick-on-Shannon on 30 January that was attended by more than 200 stakeholders. I have also presented at other Brexit meetings at which there was a total attendance of more than 400 people. I met a number of my EU counterparts in Brussels, London and, most recently, the Netherlands and Denmark to convey the unique impact of Brexit on Ireland. These meetings are part of a series of bilateral visits to key member states that my Department is undertaking. We want to enhance the understanding of Ireland's unique position and deepen and strengthen Ireland's relationships with other EU member states in preparation for the upcoming negotiations. Our diplomatic efforts are paying off. I am pleased that the draft guidelines circulated by European President Tusk include strong acknowledgements of Ireland's unique circumstances - the need to protect the peace process and the Good Friday Agreement, and our intention to maintain bilateral arrangements - such as that relating to the common travel area - with the UK. The guidelines also express our shared desire to establish a close partnership between the EU and the UK after its departure. This will be important for our future trade relationship. Brexit presents a range of challenges, but also opportunities, for our companies. With its small, open economy, Ireland relies on external demand and international markets for sustainable and continued growth. The UK is and will continue to be an important export market for us. Given our geography and trading relationship with the UK, certain sectors will face particular challenges as the UK leaves the EU. While we want to secure the closest possible economic and trading relationship between the EU and UK, access by the UK to the Single Market must be on the basis of full acceptance of all four freedoms, namely, goods, services, capital and people, which is the stated position of the EU 27.My Department and the enterprise agencies are fully committed to supporting business and all of our stakeholders in the period ahead. Enterprise Ireland and the local enterprise offices, LEOs, are steadily working with companies to ensure they will be better prepared to respond to the challenges Brexit will bring. Last week Enterprise Ireland launched a Brexit SME scorecard to help companies to self-assess their readiness for Brexit. Companies engaged in cross-Border trade are particularly exposed to the impacts of Brexit. We will do our utmost to protect the interests of these companies. InterTradeIreland, with which I met last Friday, plays a critical role in helping them to prepare for Brexit. Supporting its work will remain a priority for me in the time ahead. In our collective efforts to address these challenges we should not overlook opportunities that may emerge for Ireland. One such opportunity is the possibility of attracting increased foreign direct investment. I have directed IDA Ireland to explore the potential for winning more on account of Brexit. The agency and its staff are working hard with this goal in mind. It is constantly engaged with clients across its entire portfolio in actively pursuing any opportunity for mobile investment. In our efforts to win more foreign direct investment we can continue to rely on the selling points that make investing in Ireland so attractive in the first place. Ireland is remaining in the European Union and open to business and trade. If investors are looking for a sound and certain location, Ireland is that location.  There are also opportunities for Ireland in the area of research and innovation. My Department is working closely with Science Foundation Ireland to maximise these opportunities. The UK vote has led to uncertainty in our trading relationship with the United Kingdom, one of our most important trading partners. Extensive research carried out by Behaviours & Attitudes on behalf of my Department points to the challenges, including the need for business to diversify to be less reliant on the UK market, to drive down costs, to innovate in the way they do business and to revisit their product range. My Department is working closely with the Department of Finance, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in looking at supports already available to business and what other supports may be required down the line. Brexit will have a profound impact on all policy areas of my Department. We will continue to assess its possible implications and impacts on enterprise. My Department and its agencies are working hard to ensure the most advantageous outcome for Ireland and the European Union and the benefit of Irish enterprises, employees and consumers.

#EugeneMurphy	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-party	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-dob	unknown-#EugeneMurphy-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	406	I am somewhat alarmed by the Government's lack of imagination and half-hearted approach to Brexit, one of the biggest challenges this State has ever faced. Numerous reports have indicated that a hard Brexit will have profound negative implications for Ireland and that the knock-on effects will be most keenly felt in rural Ireland, in particular. Farmers, agri-businesses and suppliers throughout my constituency of Roscommon-Galway are worried about the potentially devastating consequences of a hard Brexit. Agriculture is one of the main priorities in rural counties such as Roscommon and Galway. Reduced access to the UK market, owing to tariff barriers, a diminution in the value of the UK market through increased imports from lower cost countries and a potential reduction in the CAP budget post-Brexit present significant threats to the future growth and development of the Irish farming and food sectors. In a scenario where there is a 10% reduction in the CAP budget and a reduction in UK food prices resulting from reduced tariffs on imports, Teagasc has estimated that farm incomes could fall by a whopping 26%. When applied to the national farm income figure of €2.5 billion in 2016, this would mean a reduction in farm incomes of almost €700 million. I am sure the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will agree that this would have a crippling effect on rural Ireland where farm families are already struggling to survive. Beef farmers are particularly worried as cuts of 37% to cattle farm incomes would gravely undermine the viability of suckler beef production in Ireland and substantially reduce the size of the 1 million suckler cow herd. This would jeopardise the livelihoods of the 100,000 farmers involved in livestock and beef production, resulting in thousands of job losses and the loss of export earnings. An analysis undertaken by the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, of the impact of a hard Brexit on trade flows - with World Trade Organization trading rules applying following the UK exit - showed a potential reduction in EU trade to the United Kingdom of over 60% in dairy products and a whopping 85% in meat products. In an Irish context, the value of meat exports to the United Kingdom would fall by €1.5 billion, while the value of dairy exports could fall by over €600 million. A strong CAP budget post-2020 is critical for farm incomes, farm output and wider economic activity. A reduction in spending power in Irish agriculture, arising from a cut in direct payments to farmers, would have a significant and negative knock-on impact on the demand for goods and services in the rural economy.  While the Article 50 trigger letter and draft guidelines issued by the European Council make reference to Ireland, which is welcome, this is only the beginning of a complex process. The Government must step up to the mark and do more to protect Ireland's interests. It must ensure Ireland's distinct concerns will not fall off the negotiations agenda in the months and years ahead. Furthermore, it must provide support for Irish businesses and industries so as to insulate them from the instability caused by Brexit, to help them to diversify into new markets and to ready themselves for a new trading environment. It is clear that it is not business as usual. As stated by my colleagues, there is need to have a Brexit Minister to co-ordinate the required cross-departmental and cross-sectoral response. We call on the Government to advocate for a trade agreement that would be as close as possible to what we currently have. Some 14% of Ireland's total exports go to the United Kingdom. A trade regime based on WTO tariffs would be a disastrous outcome for Ireland. An ESRI report published in November 2016 indicated that a WTO scenario would result in the level of GDP being 3.8% below what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario. We need the Government to seek what it otherwise would have been in a no-Brexit scenario. We need it to seek clarity on the future trading relationship as soon as is feasibly possible in order to provide certainty and stability, which are essential for Irish business, jobs and the economy.
#NiamhSmyth	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-party	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-dob	unknown-#NiamhSmyth-constituency	speech	unkown-language	2017-04-05 00:00:00	Leaders' Questions	407	I am delighted that the Minister for Enterprise, Trade and Innovation, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor, and the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, are in the House because I have had many conversations with the Minister about Brexit and how it might affect Border counties. It is one of the biggest challenges the State has ever faced and numerous reports have indicated that a hard Brexit would have profound negative implications for Ireland. For the Border constituency of Cavan-Monaghan, this raises serious concerns for those living at the coalface about a possible return to customs checkpoints. The United Kingdom has traditionally been our largest trading partner and the two countries trade approximately €1.2 billion worth of goods and services on a weekly basis. While all countries stand to be affected by Brexit, Ireland stands to be proportionately more affected than any other EU member state. The possibility of a hard border between the North and South of this island would be catastrophic and might lead to end of the common travel area. A hard Brexit would be disastrous in the light of the extent of the cross-Border agrifood trade, with different stages of production taking place on either side of the Border. One of the largest milk processing plants in the country is in the Cavan-Monaghan constituency. Lakeland Dairies processes up to 1 billion litres of farm-produced milk into a wide range of dairy food service products and ingredients for export to over 70 countries across the world. It has annual revenues of over €500 million and employs 700 dedicated people across its operations. It has plants in Bailieborough and Killeshandra in County Cavan and Lough Egish in County Monaghan. It depends on milk sources from across the Border. Lakeland Dairies is a major dairy processing co-operative. It operates within a 15-county catchment area across the north of this island. What does the future hold for agrifood businesses like Lakeland Dairies, which are so vital to our economy? Sadly, the first wave of Brexit job losses has already started. Producers in the horticulture sector have ceased production and laid off workers as a direct consequence of the fall in the value of sterling. Irish businesses across the entire economy need predictability and stability. Ireland must seek immediate assurances from our European colleagues that CAP payments are secure for the current window up to 2020 and beyond. It is vital as a policy action and as a transitional aid measure that we secure increases to current EU state aid thresholds to protect agrifood enterprises and exporters hit by a hard Brexit. We believe the Brexit vote demands an immediate review of the Food Wise 2025 strategy. The targets in the strategy as it stands were set on the assumption that the UK would remain within the EU. The UK's proposed exit from the EU is a clear and present danger to the Irish agrifood sector. It represents one of the biggest risks to farmers, exporters and jobs since the foundation of the State. The agrifood sector supports 270,000 jobs in rural communities. It is the most exposed sector of our economy, given that 37% of all Irish food exports go to the UK. These exports accounted for €4.1 billion in value in 2016. As the Irish farming and food sector has a higher dependence on the UK market than other sectors in Ireland, it is most exposed to any negative economic impact of the UK Brexit decision. The mushroom industry in counties Cavan and Monaghan has been thrown into turmoil and virtually wiped out since the UK referendum, with some €7 million worth of mushroom exports and 130 jobs lost. We need increased diplomatic engagement with EU member states, particularly in eastern Europe, to ensure there is a full understanding of the distinct position of the island of Ireland with regard to Brexit. We need increased resources for State agencies, including IDA Ireland, Bord Bia and Enterprise Ireland. We need an exporters fund to help companies to diversify into new markets and to maintain their UK market share. Export credit needs to be made available in order that finance can be offered to companies for international export operations and activities. Online trading supports are needed to help companies to grow their online business and e-commerce sales. The online trading voucher should be expanded to a greater number of Irish retail SMEs to help them to develop and expand their online business. We need regulations to allow credit unions to lend to businesses across the South. As the Minister is aware, IDA Ireland's track record in the Border region is abysmal. It needs to step up to the mark by supporting the regions and providing targeted measures to ensure Brexit does not contribute to greater regional imbalance.

The fight for our independence and the subsequent Civil War was a time of huge upheaval. Many of these challenges have persisted until the present day. The State prospered and continues to prosper. We need to channel that energy and experience. We have always faced these challenges with determination and resilience. I believe we will face Brexit in the same spirit. During this debate Opposition Deputies have accused us of not looking after this country and not putting it first. I suggest we need only look at what has happened at the water committee in the past two days to see that we are the only party putting this country first.

That is why Ireland's overall priorities - protecting the Northern Ireland peace process, which has been so hard fought; minimising the impact of Brexit on trade and the economy; maintaining the common travel area; and influencing the future of the EU - remain unchanged. It is important that we remain at the heart of the EU. All of the preparations that have been made ahead of the departure of the UK from the EU have focused on protecting and advancing the interests of Irish citizens in the context of this country’s continuing membership of the Union. As Minister of State at the Department of Health, it is important for me to set out some of the principal potential impacts of Brexit for the health sector. I note that the UK has not yet left the EU and remains a member with all of its existing rights and responsibilities. This means there have been no immediate changes in the area of health care, nor are such changes expected during the negotiation period. Work is under way to examine and address any implications for the health sector in the longer term. We have two key priorities in that context: first, to ensure there is continuity in the provision of health services; and, second, to avoid changes in the current situation that would have a negative impact on the health of the citizens of this country. The principal impacts of Brexit for the health sector cover a number of areas, including rights to health services and regulatory issues. One of our key concerns in the period ahead will be to ensure there is minimum disruption to health services and essential services are maintained on a cross-Border, all-island and Ireland-UK basis. Our Border communities, in particular, have benefited from significant cross-Border health provisions and co-operation on health promotion. These interactions have been of practical benefit to many communities on the physical margins of the State and have helped to build the momentum of peace on this island. We will work to protect such arrangements between Ireland and the UK, including east-west arrangements, during the Brexit talks. The common travel area has been in existence since Irish independence. It allows freedom of travel between the two jurisdictions for Irish and UK citizens and provides for largely reciprocal benefits of citizenship in terms of entitlements to reside, work and access services. This is of relevance for the health sector. The Irish and British Governments have consistently set out their desire to maintain these arrangements. On regulatory issues, it is clear that having a single set of rules across Europe is enormously helpful to protect human health, to ensure consumer protection and to provide a level playing field for industry. If the UK moves away from a harmonised regulatory system in relation to food safety standards, pharmaceuticals, medical devices and cosmetics, it could disrupt trade between Ireland and the UK. As well as preparing for the challenges posed by Brexit, Ireland is pursuing opportunities. For example, we are preparing to bid for the European Medicines Agency to relocate to Dublin. A move to Dublin would ensure minimum disruption to the work of the agency which is critically important for the health of all Europeans. Dublin is an English-speaking environment which offers excellent air connectivity with EU capitals and internationally. In addition, Ireland’s national medicines agency, the Health Products Regulatory Authority, already provides significant support to the agency. This can be rapidly scaled up in the event of relocation. The strength of the relationships between Ireland and Northern Ireland and the UK will be of benefit as we work to find solutions to any problems that arise in this context. I am absolutely committed to ensuring this co-operation continues in the interests of patient safety and population health. I would like to conclude by speaking about agriculture. In 2014, the IFA calculated that the value of agricultural exports arising from agricultural output in County Meath was €493.8 million, or almost half of €1 billion. I have no doubt that this figure has since increased in line with the improvement in the economy. Farming is the lifeblood of rural Ireland. Farm family incomes help to keep shops, pubs and cafés open in places like Nobber and Skryne. In 2014, some 2,535 people in County Meath were employed in food and drinks processing jobs which stem from the agricultural products of the county. With new businesses like the Slane Castle distillery having opened since, I do not doubt that there are many more people employed in the food and drinks sector. This must be protected and expanded upon in the forthcoming talks and trade missions. This will be difficult. It will test the abilities of Ministers, Teagasc personnel and members of the IFA and other representative bodies to the limit. I have every faith in them.

It is the backbone of the county. I welcome the Government's document on its priorities with regard to Brexit and the work that has been done in this context in recent months. I am a member of the Joint Committee on Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has been working very closely with the Minister, Deputy Mary Mitchell O'Connor.All stakeholders came before the committee. We interviewed them and put together a document that contains cross-party recommendations. It was launched a number of weeks ago and I encourage all Deputies to read it because a lot of work went into it. Deputy Quinlivan is also a member of the committee. Agriculture is a major industry in my constituency in County Limerick. We have to consider Brexit in a national context. There are 130,000 farms in the country, including 18,000 dairy farms. The value of agrifood and drink exports exceeded €11 billion in 2016. Ireland exported 65,000 live cattle to the North and Great Britain in 2015 and imported over €3 billion worth of food and drink from the UK in 2014. Retail is also a factor, particularly as high-street stores import goods from the UK. Trade goes both ways. It is in the best interests of the UK and Ireland to try to get a deal that will work for Ireland in particular. Some 9% of total milk processing in the Republic comes from Northern Ireland, representing 26% of Northern Ireland milk supplies. A total of 1,000 cattle and 10,000 pigs are exported from the Republic to the North each week. The potential effect of Brexit on the transport sector, such as border checks, could hamper exports given that there are 32,000 lorry trips per year in the milk sector. Brexit will have knock-on effects on farms that may have cross-Border land. There are implications for farms that have land on both sides of the Border, BPS greening, research and development schemes, nitrates, cattle movements, farm import costs, the possibility of having different requirements and the potential impacts on CAP. It is linked with our domestic policies, which farmers in County Limerick have raised with me. Against the backdrop of Brexit, they have referred to the areas of natural constraint scheme and the ongoing review. There is a commitment in the programme for Government to increase subsidies by €25 million in 2018, and I have asked that we consider exploring the possibility of a further increase, given the improving economic situation, and to try to retain it at 2008 levels before the crash hit. We also need to build a coalition within Europe when we are negotiating. We will negotiate as 27 member states, but there will be a greater impact on a number of countries - Ireland, the Netherlands, France, Germany, Spain and Italy - as a result of the fact that they engage in a considerable amount of trade with the United Kingdom. The Netherlands and France conduct €6.07 billion and €4.85 billion worth of trade, respectively, with the UK. Other countries in Europe will be affected. We also need to consider growing markets. Our exports to the UK were worth €7.2 billion, an increase of 12%, in 2015. The figure for Northern Europe was €4.17 billion, an increase of 8%. The figure for the Asia-Pacific market was €1.59 billion, an increase of 11%, and the figure for the USA was €2.9 billion, an increase of 27%. We need to push the Asia-Pacific market, which is enormous. There are 4.5 billion people living in Asia, which is 60% of the world's population. They are not buying Irish products so we need to market such products to them. There is a growing middle class in the region and there has been an increase in wealth. It is a growth market. Unfortunately, many people in Asia probably think Ireland is part of the UK. Some people may think that New Zealand and Australia are the same. I know this from working in the Asian markets when I spent time in the region.
